ROAD GAUNTLET BEGINS FOR LAKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So the young, fresh-legged Lakers are best equipped to
contend with the compacted, lockout-shortened schedule, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Now the theory gets put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today at 3 p.m., the Lakers get their first taste of
the NBA's throwback schedule _ the back-to-back-to-back is back.
And by the time the Lakers walk off the GM Place floor in Vancouver
on Tuesday night, they will have played three games in 55 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Three games, three cities, three days. Also, two time zones and
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a 15-year veteran's knees ache just thinking
about it. But for a 20-year-old, it's just another new experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bounce back quickly,'' Kobe Bryant said, with an optimistic
grin. ``I'm curious to see if I can push myself past that wall. I'm
curious to see how it's gonna be.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing the Pacific Division-leading Sonics this
afternoon, the Lakers depart for Denver and a Monday night game
with the Nuggets. They conclude the whirlwind odyssey against the
Grizzlies in Canada on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be tough,'' Bryant said of Night 3. ``We'll
probably get in at like one in the morning. It'll probably be 4
o'clock in the morning (when the team gets to the hotel) because
you've gotta check your bags and all that stuff. But I don't care,
man. It's gonna be fun. We'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris said the rigorous schedule won't change his
substitution patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just gotta try to win each game,'' he said. ``You can't
really be saying, `I'm gonna play so-and-so 25 minutes tonight
because we have to play tomorrow night.' Each game has its own
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotating Dereks: Harris wouldn't say so, but it appears Derek
Harper will replace Derek Fisher in the starting lineup today. It's
unclear if the change will be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, the 16-year veteran, has been playing more consistently
and getting more minutes than third-year pro Fisher, who has been
indecisive at times this season. Just as significantly, the
opposing point guard this afternoon is Gary Payton, and the Lakers
signed Harper in part because at 6-foot-4, he can match up with
taller guards.
</P>
<P>
   Harper practiced with the first team Saturday, but Harris played
coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what you saw,'' he said. ``If I were (starting
Harper), I wouldn't say. I wouldn't want (Seattle) to know until
(game time).''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Travis Knight (sprained left ankle) participated
fully in Saturday's practice and said he was ``a little sore,'' but
is probable for today's game and should get the start against Vin
Baker. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry (irregular heartbeat), who is not traveling with
the team, will be reevaluated Tuesday. Horry will wear a heart
monitor for 24 hours beginning Monday, then go through a number of
exercises Tuesday to see how his heart responds.

A RIVIERA RECORD FOR TRYBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ted Tryba was terrific. So, too, are his closest
pursuers going into today's final round of the $2.8 million Nissan
Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   It should make for one of the most intriguing finales in the
history of the 73-year-old event, which has produced star power and
drama almost every year since Harry ``Lighthorse'' Cooper won the
inaugural tournament in 1927 with an eagle on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba got his eagle earlier Saturday _ on No. 11 _ and also had
eight birdies in a stunning 10-under-par 61 that broke the course
record and brought him from from six strokes off the pace to a
two-stroke lead at 13-under-par 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave many shots out there,'' he said. ``That's about
as good as I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tryba will try to hold off a pursuit that has four of the
world's five top-ranked players within three shots of his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Tiger Woods is two strokes off the pace after a
third-round 65 left him tied with Davis Love III (68) and Ernie Els
(68), who share the No. 4 world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2-ranked David Duval (67) is another stroke back at 207,
tied with persevering Jerry Kelly (also 67), who had never
previously made the Nissan cut but already has a hole-in-one as
well as a guaranteed paycheck this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for Tryba?
</P>
<P>
   Not more than he's come to expect on weekends on tour,
increasingly in recent years and notably this season. Woods shot 62
last week to win the Buick Invitational from nine strokes off the
lead at the midway point.
</P>
<P>
   Duval shot 59 last month to win from seven strokes back in the
final round on the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you play on Sunday, there's pressure to perform,''
Tryba said. ``The precedent has been set that you have to shoot low
numbers out here. You can't make bogeys, because the other guys are
coming and you can't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba's top-end pursuit today includes two-time PGA champion
Nick Price, defending Nissan champ Billy Mayfair, midway leader Bob
Estes and Rocco Mediate, this year's Phoenix Open champion. All are
part of a six-way tie at 205 after each contributed to the field's
total of 31 third-round scores in the 60s _ the result of fast
fairways, receptive, good-rolling greens and excellent weather.
</P>
<P>
   It all sets up a finish that promises to be frantic, if not as
fabulous as what Tryba accomplished on Saturday, when he put
together a back-nine stretch of eagle-birdie-birdie-birdie-birdie
and went to his last hole needing a birdie for a 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about it on the 18th tee box,'' said Tryba, who
was then 11 under par for the 6,953, par-71 Riviera course.
</P>
<P>
   He settled for a bogey and a 61 after hitting past the green on
the 451-yard, uphill 18th with an 8-iron, then coming up short on a
downhill chip out of the rough and missing a 12-foot par attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But Tryba wasn't about to be disappointed about any part of a
record on revered Riviera, which has hosted two PGA Championships,
a U.S. Open and a Senior U.S. Open and includes Ben Hogan, Jack
Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson among its past
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's really special . . . it's a real honor considering
all the people who have played here,'' said Tryba, who has won once
in nine years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   His record round left Tryba's pursuers as amazed as the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the classic courses in the world,'' Els said
after Tryba surpassed former Riviera co-record holders Larry Mize
(1985), Fred Couples (1990) and Kenny Perry (1995), all tied at 62.
``I don't think you'll ever see another 61 around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But there was some speculation earlier in the day that
Els might chase Tryba to the record.
</P>
<P>
   The big South African, playing behind Tryba, was a stroke ahead
of leader's pace coming to the 564-yard, par-5 11th hole, where
Tryba has set up his 30-foot eagle putt with a 254-yard 2-iron
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Els, however, landed his lay-up approach shot to No. 11 in a
divot and bogeyed, then yanked a tee shot out of bounds two holes
later while suffering a double-bogey on No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my run on the front nine (a 5-under 30),'' said Els. ``I
was going great. . . . I just kind of lost my momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods never lost momentum in a bogeyless round that included six
birdies. But he felt he missed some chances while recording his
third consecutive score in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of four that I left out there,'' he said. ``I'm
playing just as hard on the weekend as I do the other two days, but
sometimes you don't get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment, after shooting the second-best round of the day
and third-best of the tournament, suggests Woods could be a handful
for the field if he gets it going today.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get a chance to check out the leader at close range,
teeing off with Tryba and Love in the final group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see,'' Woods said of Tryba's record round.
``It's good to see him shoot some low numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Woods will try to shoot as low as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday is different from the rest of the days,'' he said. ``If
you're near the hunt and have a chance to win, you can play
aggressively.''

FERTILITY TREATMENTS SOMETIMES LEAVE PARENTS WITH SELECTIVE
HEARTBREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ultrasound screen showed one tiny life in Cathy Cimoch's
uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Then two, three and four.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband became silent as the reality sank in: Soon, they
would become parents of quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   But the real shock hit them a few moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll want to make an appointment to reduce the number,''
their doctor said. He handed them the business card of a physician
who could perform a procedure called ``selective reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted, then horrified,'' said Cathy, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she and her husband faced an agonizing choice they
never knew they'd have to make: End some of the lives they had
sought so hard to conceive, or have Cathy undergo a harrowing,
potentially dangerous pregnancy that could result in premature
children with lifelong disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   They had struggled to conceive even one child. It had never
occurred to them _ and their fertility doctor had not clearly
explained _ that they might have to end some of the new lives
inside Cathy's womb.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of women of childbearing age in the nation
undergo some form of fertility treatment. Thousands end up with
more babies than they bargained for. As procedures and drugs
improve, the number of multiple births has soared. In Arizona alone
they are up 56 percent from 1986 to 1996, the latest year for which
figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   For those who choose to continue the pregnancy with quads or
more, their former lives come to a halt as their whole focus turns
to doing whatever it takes to stay pregnant as long as possible,
usually meaning months of bed rest and discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those women who don't choose to reduce go to hell and back
before their babies are born,'' says nurse Elizabeth Brewer, who
has been assigned to many of the 39 women who have had quads at
Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of all involved to steer through a
difficult ethical and moral landscape, the new medical capabilities
put people into great moral binds.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Charlotte (not her real name), a petite, 112-pound
Valley homemaker. Because of her size, her doctor told her, there
would be ``zero chance'' that the six babies she was carrying would
live unless she underwent selective reduction.
</P>
<P>
   She was unprepared for the decision to end some lives to
preserve others.
</P>
<P>
   In nine years of fertility counseling, with several different
doctors, she had never heard of the procedure. The very religious
32-year-old Valley woman would have to make an accommodation
between the reality of her situation and her beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have four or more fetuses face the same dilemma. The
conventional wisdom among doctors around the country is that
selective reduction is the way to go if a woman is carrying quads
or more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The first question most couples ask is: If some are to be
``selectively reduced,'' which ones?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is surprisingly simple _ and the procedure is
relatively uncomplicated. Using ultrasound guidance, the doctor
passes a needle through the mother's abdomen and injects a fatal
chemical into the selected fetus. Fetuses are usually chosen solely
on how easily the doctor can reach them with the needle. Doctors
and patients agree that it is a form of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the goal is to leave behind twins. The dead fetuses
are reabsorbed into the mother's body. The procedure is usually
done between nine and 12 weeks, when the fetuses are approximately
an inch long.
</P>
<P>
   While it is normal for a pregnant woman and her partner to look
at the ultrasound monitor during other procedures, only the doctor
and the nurse watch during this procedure. Even they find it
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman decides to carry four, she usually has to sacrifice
her own health to have healthy babies. In the last few weeks of
pregnancy, many moms are put on intensive drug therapies to stop
contractions, to delay delivery to 34 weeks, when they have a good
chance of having healthier babies.
</P>
<P>
   Some mothers temporarily become partially blind because of the
drugs and can't read or watch television to help them pass the long
final days. The drugs make many moms nauseated and irritable.
Often, their speech will be slurred, as if they were drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers sometimes cry and beg the doctors to deliver their
babies, but then agree to try to go another 12 hours _ and then
another.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Afterwards, like Vietnam veterans, some have symptoms like
post-traumatic stress disorder because of the aggressive measures
used to keep them pregnant longer,'' said Brewer, the Good
Samaritan nurse. ``Yes, they end up with healthy babies, but
sometimes I wonder what the aftereffects of pushing the moms so
hard will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cimoches threw away the card of the selective reduction
doctor. Though they never considered themselves particularly
religious until this point, once they saw those four heartbeats,
they couldn't reduce.
</P>
<P>
   They started looking for a doctor who could help them
successfully deliver quads. The five doctors they interviewed near
their home in Los Angeles had delivered only a couple of sets of
quads each. They heard about a doctor in Phoenix who specializes in
multiple births, Dr. John Elliott, who works with a team of 10
doctors at Phoenix Perinatal Associates. His success has drawn
patients from around the country, including the Cimoches.
</P>
<P>
   The Cimoches then began a long and difficult journey, one that
risked Cathy's life and the babies'.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Phoenix, the doctors who had had great success delivering
multiples also counsel patients about the pros and cons of
reducing. It is the couple's decision, doctors here say, giving an
even-handed description of the risks of both choices.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Cimoch has been at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center
since Nov. 29. She is counting the days, hoping to stay pregnant to
Week 34 _ March 9 _ when a Caesarean section will be performed. In
the meantime, she is exhausted. She has worried most of her
pregnancy that if she delivers too soon, her babies may have
problems such as cerebral palsy, learning disabilities and vision
or hearing losses.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to try to deliver all the babies may not have been
possible if the number of fetuses had been higher, as in
Charlotte's case. When that happens, the life of the mother and the
life of some of the fetuses have to be considered. And there is
also the ethical question of whether it is fair to bring children
into the world when there is a high chance they could be disabled,
because all quad babies are born prematurely. There isn't room in
the womb for a mother to carry them to full term.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte and her husband took a long weekend to ponder whether
she could make an accommodation between the reality of her
situation and her religious beliefs. Her doctor suggested she
reduce to two, but she asked for the maximum number she could
carry. He said four. At 30 weeks _ eight to 10 weeks before a
normal single-baby delivery _ she delivered four infants, who are
now healthy 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From her living room filled with toddlers and their toys, she
still thinks back in amazement to those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overnight, I went from a woman who thought she would never
have children to the mother of so many,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charlotte underwent fertility treatments for nine years. She
went through menopause in her 20s, so there was no way she could
bear children without high-tech help. She took fertility drugs for
years, then had high-tech procedures. The first produced nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the second procedure, six embryos were implanted, but none
survived, even though four were graded as having a good potential.
</P>
<P>
   In the third procedure, eight were implanted, seven of which
were graded as ``poor.'' Surprisingly, six survived. The doctor
apologized profusely.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many selective reductions are
done, though one estimate is that there have been 4,000 performed
worldwide. They are usually done discreetly. Some couples decline
to confide even in family members that their twins started out as
quadruplets or sextuplets. Charlotte preferred not to have her real
name used because many of her neighbors and church friends don't
know she went through this ordeal, and that's the way she would
like to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Valley doctors estimate that in Arizona, only about two
procedures at the most are done each month. But that is far more
than the one or two a year performed a decade ago. Phoenix
Perinatal had one patient who reduced from eight to two.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a medical reason, in Phoenix a woman can't have
a selective reduction performed unless she is carrying quads or
more. Doctors advise against selective reduction &UR; under other
circumstances. Wanting to carry fewer children than three isn't
enough of a reason. Nor is carrying a baby that may have Down
syndrome. If a mother in Arizona wants to reduce triplets, she will
be given a card of a doctor in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure costs about $3,000 and is usually not covered by
insurance unless the woman's life is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte cried as she left the procedure. When she decided to
carry the greatest number she could, her doctor at Phoenix
Perinatal didn't try to talk her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was her decision to do that, he said. But she says she nearly
had a stroke in the final hours of her 30-week pregnancy. And she
lost so much blood during delivery that she needed transfusions.
After that, she was anemic for months. &UR; Still, she doesn't regret
her decision to carry four.
</P>
<P>
   She looks at her four healthy 2-year-olds and says she did the
right thing. Even so, she sometimes wonders what the other two
would have been like. If she had it to do again, she says, maybe
she would have had fewer embryos implanted, and perhaps have
delivered twins. Then she would not have to wonder such things.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an experienced medical staff that has delivered
hundreds of multiples, carrying four or more is still a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   About two mothers of quadruplets die each year during or shortly
after the pregnancy, according to Maureen Doolan Boyle of Mothers
of Supertwins, an international organization that helps couples
with triplets or more. The mothers have died of a variety of
causes, including blood clots that resulted in strokes or bleeding
that doctors couldn't control after the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses brought in a cake in late January to help Cathy Cimoch
celebrate Week 28, when the risk of disabilities from too early a
birth start to diminish. But another quad mother two floors away
was having an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Four 24-week fetuses were losing oxygen and the mother carrying
them was having respiratory failure. An emergency Caesarian was
done. They all made it, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closest Phoenix Perinatal has come to a maternal
disaster, doctors there say. The babies were born at 24 weeks, the
very point at which it is possible for them to live on their own.
They will be in the children's intensive care unit for weeks, if
not months, and likely will have some disabilities. The intensive
care tab will be about $2,500 a day per baby _ more than the
parents bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham, Ala.,-based Society for Assisted Reproductive
Technology, whose professional members perform fertility
procedures, has expressed concern about the rise in multiple births
nationwide. As of a year ago, the group recommends that doctors
implant only three embryos in women under 35 years old, and three
to five in those 35 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona in 1996, the latest year for which statistics are
available, five of the seven Arizona clinics implanted, on average,
more embryos per patient under 35 than the now-recommended three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fertility clinics need to really sit people down and tell
them what they're getting into,'' Cathy Cimoch said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doctors at the clinics counter that they give women the facts
but that many patients have been trying for years to get pregnant
and are frustrated. They do selective listening about the dangers
and probabilities, the doctors say. The term ``selective
reduction,'' may seem like just another routine procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The number of patients who choose selective reduction remains
elusive. Since 1995, it has been mandatory for fertility clinics to
report their statistics to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers contain a gap between the number of multiple
pregnancies and the number of multiple births. Much of the gap is
due to miscarriages in the first trimester. But no one doubts that
some of the lost fetuses are the result of selective reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have suggested that regulations need to be in
place, as they are in England, that limit the number of embryos
implanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jay Nemiro, a leading fertility doctor in the Valley,
doesn't agree. In his 17 years of practice, he says, has learned
that you have to consider each client's individual circumstance.
The older the woman, the fewer the chances of her becoming
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   If you put limitations on doctors, then many women will never
get pregnant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most consent forms in fertility clinics indicate that assisted
reproduction may result in multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant number do not mention that multiple births
entail considerable risks. And few consent forms mention the
possibility that selective reduction may be suggested in the event
of multiples.
</P>
<P>
   Some clinics are more careful. Dr. John Mattox of Samaritan
Institute of Reproductive Medicine makes his patients sign a form
saying that they have been counseled about selective reduction
before they start therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say that is not something they could deal with _
either carrying quads or reducing them _ then I would never put
them in that position. It might be more costly to them in the long
run, but they won't have to make any heartbreaking decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He recommends that couples choosing a doctor ask, ``How many
twins, triplets or quadruplets came out of your practice last
year?''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that desperation and technology are leading the
game, and medical caution and thoughtfully informed consent are
trailing behind, says Dr. David Beyda, medical ethicist and Phoenix
Children's Hospital physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that so many women have to struggle with the decision
of selective reduction means we are going about the fertility
process backwards, and are not considering the ramifications,'' he
said. ``We are placing that incredible burden on the mother. It
shouldn't get that far for a woman to have to struggle with that
kind of question.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott gets three or four calls a week from women across the
country who have been told they have to reduce. They are upset
because they are told there is only one course of action.
</P>
<P>
   If more women elsewhere in the country could get good care while
carrying quads, more of them wouldn't have to consider selective
reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he believe that all out-of-state doctors give women
data that show the risks to their pregnancy. Women who reduce have
a 15 percent chance of losing their entire pregnancy, compared with
only 3 percent who do not undergo selective reduction.
</P>
<P>
   On her 90th day of bed rest, earlier this month, Cathy Cimoch
described these as the most challenging days of her life. At her
greatest time of need she is far away from family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband flies over to visit as much as he can, but it's
never enough.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, mothers of other quads come to call, including
Charlotte, who stopped by to visit Cimoch on Saturday.

   The nurses on the floor have become friends, and Cimoch calls
upon her faith to help keep her grounded.
</P>
<P>
   She worries about having disabled children, though as each day
passes she worries less.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe once you make that decision to have four, you
embrace them no matter how they turn out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cimoch, the most painful part of the battle began almost two
weeks ago. She was put on an intensive drug therapy to stop
contractions and delay delivery. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have such a newfound respect for women who have gone through
this,'' she said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she has a few long, uncomfortable days ahead.

<P>
   But every day Cimoch celebrates getting through another.
</P>
<P>
   She is in her 31st week. Only three to go. &QL; Maureen West can be

TRYBA GOT LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE RECORD ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 -LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ted Tryba spent a restless night and didn't know
what to expect before Saturday's third round of the Nissan Open at
Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing wrong with him or his game when the day was
over.
</P>
<P>
   All he did was shoot a course-record 10-under-par 61 to take a
two-stroke lead at 13-under 200.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, a journeyman pro with one victory, the 1995 Anheuser
Busch Golf Classic, and about $1.9 million in earnings to his
credit, torched one of golf's most storied courses despite getting
little sleep after drinking a couple of Cokes before going to bed
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   His 61, which included nine birdies, an eagle and one bogey,
broke the Riviera record held by Kenny Perry (1995), Fred Couples
(1990) and Larry Mize (1985). It also tied the tournament record
set by George Archer in 1983 at Rancho Park Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on the 11th fairway, I said, `Man, let's just keep
going. Keep going,''' he said. ``I thought I was playing in a J.C.
Goosie event down in Florida. Down there, courses are so easy, you
have to shoot 7- or 8-under to win. If there's a hole in front of
you, you have to birdie it because somebody's going to birdie it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a good attitude to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old eagled the 11th hole when he hit a two iron from
254 yards to 30 feet and made the putt. He was six-under-par on one
five-hole stretch of the back nine and 11-under on the day when he
stood on the tee of the par-4, 451-yard 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of greatness started dancing in his head, he admitted _
specifically, the recent 59 shot by David Duval in the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was shooting a low number out here,'' he said. ``I
had no idea what the course record was. I just wanted to shoot as
low as I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``But definitely shooting 59 and making history at Riviera... I
may not get another chance to do that again. I was just pleased to
have the opportunity to shoot 59.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba hit a good drive, but his 8-iron approach went through the
green. He chipped to 12 feet, but then missed the putt to save par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame he bogeyed the last hole,'' said Tiger Woods,
whose 65 left him two shots out of the lead. ``It would have been
neat to have another 59.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ted Tryba is going to have an uneasy night tonight,''
Ernie Els said.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba opened last week's Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines with
a pair of 65s before recurring back problems resulted in
consecutive 74s and a tie for 21st place. But warm weather at this
week's Nissan Open have resulted in some of Tryba's best golf.
</P>
<P>
   His timing couldn't be any better, considering the quality of
play on this year's tour. Tryba, who turned professional in 1989
and played on the Nike Tour from 1990-92, said this season's scores
will continue to be impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out here eight years, and I've never seen those
numbers before,'' he said. ``Even on the toughest courses, guys are
unconscious. When Tiger shot that number (62 in the third round of
the Buick Invitational), I didn't see 10-under out there. The guy's
just incredible. It just goes to show how good guys are, and how
good guys are going to have to become to keep playing well out
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Ray Brown shot 6-under on Sunday (at last week's Buick),
and didn't win the tournament. Guys are just getting
better.''!end! &QL;

MULTIPLE-BIRTH MOMS FLOCKING TO ARIZONA DUE TO HIS SUCCESS RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some conservative doctors back East think of him as a
risk-taking cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   They say he pushes mothers of quads too hard, without hard facts
to back up the drugs he gives them to keep them pregnant longer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But most of the studies that have been published by respected
medical journals on high-order multiples have been written by him.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hard to argue with Dr. John Elliott's success rates
with delivering multiples.
</P>
<P>
   With his nine partners at Phoenix Perinatal Associates, Elliott
has delivered 39 sets of quadruplets and about 200 sets of triplets
_ world records. Two years ago, he also delivered a set of
quintuplets, with the mother, Bridget Erklin Collins of Chicago,
carrying them to 34 weeks, a national record.
</P>
<P>
   Word has spread, and multiple-birth moms from fertility clinics
from all over the United States are coming to Phoenix to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in other cities show them old statistics that they will
likely give birth at about 29 weeks, he says. That means they are
given the choice between killing fetuses _ selective reduction _
and having disabled babies, he says. But quad moms under Elliott's
care often deliver at 34 weeks. That is a huge advantage for the
health of the children, though it may come at great hardship for
the mother, many of whom are deeply depressed, physically ravaged
and medically sedated in the final, &UR; long weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has figured out ways, some of them tortuous, to remove
some of the risks of having disabled babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do anything to keep them pregnant to 34 weeks,''
Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   He has created his own arsenal of techniques, including high
doses of drugs to slow contractions and physical devices to hold
the babies in place longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes his relationship with his quad mothers is adversarial.
Other times it is paternal. The bulletin board behind his desk at
Good Samaritan has photos of all the multiples he has delivered.
Years later, he gets letters from his mothers with new pictures of
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sixteen of the 39 quad mothers Elliott has delivered have come
from as far away as Florida and Massachusetts; women from Michigan
and California are in the hospital now under Elliott's care. They
will bring his total of quad sets to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, doctors around the country routinely
encouraged women pregnant with three to ``reduce'' to twins.
</P>
<P>
   But more doctors are better at delivering triplets. Four is now
the ``fence'' where the outcome of a pregnancy could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to have brain surgery, you look for the most
experienced brain surgeon in America. If you want to carry quads,
an Internet search or word-of-mouth from multiple-birth parenting
groups will usually turn up Elliott's name.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Doolan Boyle, executive director of MOST (Mothers of
Supertwins), an international organization for parents of triplets
or more, based in Brentwood, N.Y., regularly refers women from
around the world to Elliott to discuss their decision to reduce or
continue a multiple pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only five or six doctors have his level of experience
delivering multiples, and no one has as much experience with
quads,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought in the perinatal community, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors will encourage reduction and others will put all
their efforts into sustaining a pregnancy,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is the latter, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't buy the idea that reduction is necessary for a
healthy delivery,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite delivering high-risk babies, Elliott's success rate has
been remarkable. Nationally in 1995, multiples made up 3 percent of
births but 16 percent of neonatal deaths. Since 1986, when he
delivered his first quads, Elliott has had only six neonatal deaths
out of 39 sets. While there have been babies with mild handicaps,
he is only aware of delivering two with cerebral palsy. Nor has he
had a maternal death. Nationally about two mothers carrying quads
die each year.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a mother stays pregnant, the lower the costs: Every
extra day a baby is born early _ and all quads are _ the more time
they have to spend in intensive care. At Phoenix Children's
Hospital, where the babies are cared for, that adds up to about
$2,500 a day per baby.
</P>
<P>
   The preemie costs are on top of the $40,000 to $70,000 bill for
the mother, assuming minimal complications. &UR; It's not unusual for
the mother's bill to be $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that that one day couples won't have to make any
horrendous decision involving selective reduction,'' Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   She longs for the day when the science of fertility is to the
point where a woman will become pregnant with only as many babies
as she can safely deliver.
</P>
<P>
   That day may not be too far away, says Dan Strouse, a law and
ethics professor at Arizona State University's Law School. New
research indicates that will be able to successfully implant one or
two embryos and get one or two babies.
</P>
<P>
   That would please Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He didn't set out to become the quad doctor, but the Valley's
fertility clinics have sent him so many quadruplets and triplets
over the years that he had little choice but to get good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his reputation has been made by the practices of
fertility clinics, he believes patients must be better informed
before treatment so they are not placed in a position to have to
make horrible choices.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in 570,000 sets of quads occurs naturally. The rest are
artificially induced, creating social issues and costs that are not
being considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to see a community fertility meeting where
fertility clinic directors, doctors, public health officials,
religious leaders and interested couples could develop reasonable
guidelines for implantation and informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he says, he will try to deliver as many healthy
babies as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only pick up the pieces,'' he said. &QL;

TRYBA MUST SHAKE OFF SUNDAY SWEATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You've got to feel sorry for Ted Tryba, leading
the Nissan Open the way he is, which is temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like such a decent fellow. Hard-working and talented too.
Popular with his fellow golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad they're about to eat him for brunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that he's Ted Tryba. The victim could be anybody
who's nobody on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that he's at the top of a Rivera Country Club
leaderboard that includes Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Davis Love III
_ three major winners _ and David Duval _ the world's hottest
golfer. A lot of guys would love to be in their positions going
into the final round of a $2.8 million tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that this is Sunday. And the overnight leader's
collapse in a puddle of cold sweat is as much a Sunday institution
as church, lawn mowers and ``Gilligan's Island'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when the overnight leader is a one-time tour winner
who might feel a little unsure of his place on that leaderboard
given the fact most fans haven't a clue how to pronounce his name
(!ital!tree!off!-buh!off!).
</P>
<P>
   As Els said drolly on Saturday after he joined Woods and Love at
11 under par, two strokes behind Tryba with 18 holes to play: ``I
think Ted Tryba's going to have an uneasy night tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   But oh, how bravely Tryba spoke after his course-record 61 in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go to the (driving) range, take a couple of good swings,
loosen up and hope you brought your `A' game,'' Tryba said of his
approach to leading the final group on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Justin Leonard, who has been one of the best Sunday players
on the tour and says it's an acquired talent. Leonard was 25 when
he went into the last 18 holes of the 1997 Kemper Open trailing by
five strokes and rallied to win. It was a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the British Open at Troon a month later and I was in
the same situation,'' said Leonard, who trailed Jesper Parnevik
after three rounds. ``Knowing I'd done it before made me realize it
was possible (to win).''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard shot a 65 to win his first major tournament by three.
</P>
<P>
   As for Parnevik, who had the pressure of waking up Sunday with
the lead, he shot a 73 to finish in a tie for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude is certainly different when you're trying to
come from behind,'' Leonard said. ``You know you have to be
aggressive, so there isn't a whole lot of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with the lead, you kind of try to play steady and pick
your spots. The best advice is to keep doing what you've been
doing. You've obviously been playing well if you're leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy advice to follow if you've been there and done that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday is !ital!it!off!. You can go out and be aggressive,''
Woods said enthusiastically. ``I can't wait to get out there and
feel the butterflies.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods insists he tries no harder on Sundays. He just plays
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just seem to make a few more birdies on the weekend than I
do during the week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has such a knack for rising to the occasion that he
believes he's merely taking advantage of pin placements made easier
on weekends because the tour wants to dazzle TV viewers with low
scores. In fact, a tour spokesman said, the weekend pin placements
aren't meant to be easier at all.
</P>
<P>
   When your name is Tiger, Ernie or Davis III, all the Sunday
putts seem to be uphill.
</P>
<P>
   When your name is Ted, well. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Torrey Pines, Scott Simpson made up eight strokes
in the final round to tie the record for a PGA Tour rally. It was a
charge in the Arnold Palmer tradition. But such heroics are
memorable because they're rare. A great Sunday rarely makes up for
a rotten week. Only nine times in the 45 tour events last year did
the winner shoot his best round on Sunday. That's exactly as often
as the winner shot his best round on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The player _ or players in the case of ties _ who teed off with
the lead on Sunday morning went on to win the tournament in about
half of the tour events last year. The player _ or players _ in
second place won about one-fifth of the time and others surged to
victory about one-third of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sound easy, Ted?
</P>
<P>
   The only question is how it will end.
</P>
<P>
   With a snap-hook into the tennis courts alongside the first
fairway? With a skulled chip shot into the mid-green bunker on the
sixth? With a sweaty-palmed, 10-foot, downhill, par putt that rolls
only eight feet on the 13th?
</P>
<P>
   Or with the slow torture of a dozen birdie opportunities missed
because the vise grip of Sunday pressure cuts off the blood supply
to your muscles and your imagination?
</P>
<P>
   With the mispronounceable Mr. Tryba clutching one of the huge
cardboard checks the PGA Tour gives to tournament winners?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   And, not bloody likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ernie and Tiger are going to be uncomfortable
(today),'' Love said pointedly. ``Experience is good and being
successful makes the experience worth a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's all relative. Even a two-time U.S. Open winner
like Els can feel intimidated by this leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm in a better situation, not being in that (final)
group,'' Els said. ``I won't have to look at Tiger.'' &QL;

HARVARD STUNS PRINCETON IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard's 87-79 overtime win over Princeton Saturday
night in front of a sellout crowd of 2,195 at Harvard's Lavietes
Pavilion was the Crimson's biggest of the season. It was bigger
than the season-opener at Boston College and bigger than the
decision over host Santa Clara at its tourney.
</P>
<P>
   It was bigger than any other win over four years for the Crimson
seniors, as Harvard ended a 17-game losing string to the Tigers
that began in February 1990. Harvard connected on all three field
goals it attempted in overtime and shot 50.9 percent (28 of 55).
Princeton shot just 39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson, who outscored the Tigers, 19-11, in the extra
period, got 27 points from senior Tim Hill (8-of-16 shooting, 10 of
12 on free throws). He also became the college's all-time assist
leader with 571 (one better than Tarik Campbell) with four helpers
and just one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Clemente had 16 points for Harvard. The Crimson (11-12, 5-7
Ivy) had five players in double figures against Princeton (18-6,
9-2, second in the Ivy with three games left).
</P>
<P>
   Princeton got 20 points from senior Gabe Lewullis while freshman
center Chris Young scored 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt this was the best win of my career,'' said
Harvard playmaker Hill. ``It was awesome the way we matched up
against their zone, which gave us the driving lane. This is the top
game on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead throughout the first half, Harvard held a 35-29 lead at
intermission. In the closing minutes of regulation, Mike Beam tied
it at 62 on an 8-foot baseline jumper with 2:37 left. Lewullis, who
had 12 points in the second half, made a 3-pointer, getting it to
65-65 with 1:05 to go. Andrew Gellert then hit a 3-pointer from the
key for the Crimson, with 44 seconds left, and then Lewullis tied
it at 68 on a 3-pointer with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience got to them,'' said Harvard coach Frank
Sullivan of his team, which had lost with 1:28 left against Penn
Friday. ``We had a level of confidence that we could score points.
And that was also the first time we held Princeton under 40
percent, which was incredible for us. It wasn't like the bottom was
falling out like it might seem.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Beam tossed in a 3-pointer from the key, making it
73-71 with 3:22 to go. Then Gellert hit a baseline layup, pushing
it to 76-71. Then two foul shots by Hill, two more by Clemente, and
two more by Hill put Harvard ahead, 82-72, with 56.6 seconds left
in OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game they sort of controlled the pace,'' said
Princeton coach Bill Carmody. ``I almost didn't even like the way
we came back. I didn't feel good. The effort was there, but we
never got our hands on the pulse of the game the entire time.
Things their guys do well, they did well.''

DODGERS' ROJAS HAS MYSTERY TO SOLVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ New York, New York. If you can make it there
you can make it anywhere . . .
</P>
<P>
   If not, try Los Angeles. That's what Mel Rojas is doing.
</P>
<P>
   His displeasure in the Big Apple was accentuated by a tumultuous
second half of last season. First, Mets manager Bobby Valentine
lost confidence in the one-time Chicago Cubs closer, and then Rojas
lost confidence in himself. All of which made for a miserable time
for the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible,'' Rojas said Saturday in explaining his year-plus
tenure with the Mets. ``I really don't like the city. It's tough.
You need time to prepare yourself, and I didn't get that because
there are so many people around. I didn't like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much more relaxed here. I feel like it's a fresh
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, acquired by the Dodgers in a November trade for Bobby
Bonilla, needed a new home for his mental well-being. But truth is,
Rojas began pitching poorly long before he reached New York. It was
actually his inability to close games for the Cubs that led to his
being traded to the Mets. What the Dodgers need to figure out is
what's been wrong with Rojas since he left the Expos, and how he
can regain his old form.
</P>
<P>
   On what should be perhaps the dominant pitching staff in the
National League _ given a starting rotation that begins with Kevin
Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort and closes with Jeff Shaw _
the set-up role remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Rojas, 32, figures in. It's a role he knows and
could flourish in. Before the problems in New York and Chicago, and
before he saved 66 games in two seasons with the Expos, Rojas was
Montreal's set-up man for John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was (in Montreal) he was the best set-up man in the
game, and he did a great job,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said. ``I really believe in my heart of hearts his best role
is setting up. There's something about those last three outs. He's
a very sensitive, caring person, and almost sometimes you can't be
(to be a closer). You have to have a certain mentality, and I think
his mentality is more prone to setting up.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rojas' problems (begin ital)are(end ital) more
psychological than physical. At least that would make as much sense
as anything else as to why Rojas plummeted from the pedestal of
premier closer to forgotten middle reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, something changed for Rojas since he left the
comfort and anonymity of Montreal to sign a three-year, $13.5
million free-agent contract with the Cubs after the 1996 season.
And the change hasn't been for the better.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two seasons Rojas is 5-8 with 17 saves and a 5.21
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems when he was with Montreal it was tough to pick up the
ball off of him,'' Dodgers catcher and ex-Mets teammate Todd
Hundley said. ``Lately, he's been up in the strike zone. It's still
the same windup. It's just being up in the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who has watched Rojas' path closely since leaving
Montreal, said much of the pitcher's ills can be cured with the
proper stride in his delivery. Malone said Rojas has a tendency to
overstride. It causes his body and arm to drop, which flattens out
his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the destruction of his confidence, Rojas said last
season it got to the point where he didn't trust his forkball,
curveball or slider. And the location on his fastball was also
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years I've been having a lot of trouble,'' Rojas
said. ``When I came into Chicago as a free agent, that team lost
too many games and you came in for save situations and you tried to
make to much out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have no problem with my mechanics, no problem with my
pitches, no problem with my fastball. I just have to concentrate on
pitching and be positive and get my confidence. Right now I feel
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitching coach Charlie Hough said he'll reserve judgment
until he analyzes Rojas over a period of time, but he does know a
little of the pitcher's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was real good, then real bad, and I hope real good
again,'' Hough said. ``He looked very healthy out there. I was
really impressed with how he threw the ball. He had good arm speed,
balance. He looked like he was in good shape.''

AIR FORCE PUTS TCU ON THE ROPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ Coming into last night's game, Air
Force had won one Western Athletic Conference game in 11 attempts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Make it 2-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force defeated TCU, 81-78, stunning the Horned Frogs and
likely damaging their chances for an at-large NCAA Tournament
berth. The loss may have hurt their chances for the WAC tournament
berth, as well.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (17-8, 5-6 WAC) dropped to sixth place in the WAC's Mountain
Division with three games remaining. Only the top six teams in each
division make the tournament, the winner of which gets the WAC's
automatic NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the mood to talk about it,'' TCU coach Billy Tubbs
said of the Frogs' NCAA Tournament hopes. ``I don't know. We need
to win and we're not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs started slow and didn't recover until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   The shots started falling near the end of the game for the
Frogs, Prince Fowler's basket with 12.3 seconds remaining cut the
Falcons' lead to 81-78. But by then it was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had dug itself too big of a hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply a matter of percentages last night at Clune Arena.
Air Force shot 43 percent from the field. Buoyed by a fast and
furious final six minutes, TCU shot 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can wait until the last six minutes of the
game to play,'' Tubbs said. ``They outplayed us; they
out-everythinged us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Nailon was the Horned Frogs' leading scorer with 26 points,
but he was 9-for-23 from the field. Meanwhile, Tyron Wright led Air
Force with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (10-14, 2-10 WAC) had four players finish in double
figures. The most unexpected, and therefore most troublesome for
the Frogs, came from Lawrence Yazzie. He finished with 12 points
for Air Force, all coming on 3-pointers and all but three coming
during a critical second-half stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs trailed 51-43 with 14:54 remaining in the game. Enter
Yazzie. Sparked by three 3-pointers from Yazzie, the Falcons then
went on a 13-4 run over the next 3:14.
</P>
<P>
   That critical stretch was eerily similar to the beginning of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force began with the hot hand, shooting 9-of-17 in the first
10 minutes to jump to a 23-14 lead. The Frogs, on the other hand,
came out looking like they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
with a basketball. They were 5-of-23 in the same opening span,
including 1-of-9 from Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were especially lethal on 3-pointers, knocking down
four of their first eight attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs trailed by as many as 15 in the first half, and the
Falcons had a 43-32 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' lead could have been much more. The Frogs shot 29
percent in the first half compared to 43 percent shooting by the
Falcons. A smaller Air Force squad also outrebounded TCU, 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   The lead also could have been much less. The Frogs had the ball
with 40 seconds remaining and trailing by eight. But Thomas
McTyer's layup rimmed out, and Air Force forward Billy Humphrey
buried a 3-pointer at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the Frogs' shooting woes in the first half
was Fowler. He had 12 points at halftime, shooting 75 percent from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were helped to the good start, and subsequent
halftime lead, by the tandem of Wright (12) and Jarvis Croff (10).
</P>
<P>
   In the teams' first meeting in Fort Worth, TCU easily handled
Air Force, 114-87. Nailon had 26 points in that game with Ryan
Carroll contributing another 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   TCU travels to Nevada-Las Vegas for a Big Monday matchup on
ESPN. It's the Horned Frogs' last road game of the year, and look
for the Rebels to be hungry. They lost to SMU, 80-78, yesterday.

CROWD ROARS FOR TIGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN BEENE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Crowds gathered along fairways, tee boxes, between
holes _ anywhere to get a glimpse of the PGA Tour's most popular
player on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Along the 13th fairway, fans standing on porches high above
Riviera Country Club peered through binoculars for a peek at Tiger.
Some fans staked out spots for hours just to so they could say they
saw him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Robert Karlsson, who was playing in Woods' Nissan
Open pairing along with Phil Blackmar. Karlsson claims he doesn't
even watch Woods hit the ball, all in fear of ruining his own sweet
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to look at (Woods') swing because he has so
much speed. It can be destructive,'' said the Swede who is a
relative newcomer to the PGA Tour. ``I didn't look once today when
he drove because I wanted to stay in my game.''
</P>
<P>
   What Karlsson missed was an efficient day by Woods, who used
five birdies to record a 6-under par 65. That gives Woods a
three-day total of 202 and puts him in position to challenge leader
Ted Tryba (200) in today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was once again the course's crowd king, drawing galleries
10-15 deep that seemed to shout encouraging words every time he
took a practice swing.
</P>
<P>
   Now into his fourth year of dealing with Tigermania, Woods is
used to the fanfare. It didn't affect him Saturday, as he continued
his climb up the leaderboard. He's lowered his score each day at
the tournament, going from 69 to 68 and then to Saturday's 65
despite more and more people following his every shot.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said his score might dip again Sunday, if only he can
straighten out a few more putts and the weather stays good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's windy like this, then par might be a good score,'' he
said after his round, which finished with light breezes. ``But if
it's calm like it was this morning, then you might try to bust a
few birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   He recorded 13 pars in the third round in spite of his putter
and sometimes errant drives. On the 15th, Woods' drive went into
the crowd and rolled up on the seventh fairway. A shot over the
eucalyptus trees put him back on the green, and Woods had an
attempt at a birdie putt. He missed, but saved par by making a
5-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been a lot lower than I was,'' he said. ``I
missed a lot of putts for birdies. . . . but I did make a lot of my
share of putts for par.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as his day was, it didn't seem to matter to fans whether
Woods' shots found the green or wound up at their feet. As long as
he can drive like he can, he'll elicit oohs and ahhs and send fans
scrambling to see him mash it more than 275 yards. And that bothers
Woods because of the distraction he causes to the players in his
pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough if they're not used to it,'' he said. ``People are
moving around, yelling and screaming. . . . It's disconcerting,
disconcerting to myself.``It's a shame that has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson said the large number of fans didn't bother him too
much, although his score rose to 70 after having shot 66 on Friday.
Blackmar's scored also went up, climbing from a 67 to 69.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Maybe. Karlsson insists he doesn't mind playing
with the world's No. 1 player because it means you're playing well
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best challenge you can get,'' he said. ``Of course
it's intimidating, but you have to expect that when you are playing
Tiger.''

NORTH TEXAS MAKES EFFORT, BUT FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Rick Herrin 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ North Texas continues to learn with young
players. But not quite enough, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (2-22, 2-12), looking for their first winning streak
of the season, came close, pressing New Mexico State to the wire
before falling, 84-82, before 2,060 fans last night at the Super
Pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the worst team in this league,'' North Texas coach
Vic Trilli said. ``We're just not good enough to beat that team,
but we're getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   UNT, coming off a surprising victory Thursday against West
Division-leading UC-Santa Barbara, was almost good enough. The
Eagles had a season-best 30-for-33 effort at the free-throw line.
Freshman guard Dexter Tennell, who tied a career high with 26
points, went 13-for-13 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State (18-9, 10-4), the second-place team in the East
Division, stayed ahead of the Eagles in the second half, but not
too far. UNT cut the deficit to four with 46 seconds remaining, but
Bradley Bestor's 6-for-6 free-throw shooting in the final minutes
secured the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Count Aggies coach Lou Henson, who won the 699th game of his
career, among the impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vic Trilli has done an outstanding job with these guys,''
Henson said of UNT, which starts three freshmen and a sophomore.
``He is doing as well as any coach in the country. North Texas is
playing as well as anybody in our league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles success at the line couldn't overshadow their
weakness on the defensive boards. UNT was battered inside by Aggies
6-foot-9 senior forward Charles Gosa. He scored a team-high 26
points and had eight rebounds, including six on the offensive end.
Billy Keys added 25 points for New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was missing down the stretch was rebounding. It seemed
like they kept coming up with the big one and we didn't,'' Tennell
said. ``It's difficult to try our best and keeping coming up on the
short end of the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense kept the Eagles close. Freshman guard Kenneth Mangrum
had a career-high eight rebounds and five blocks.

JONES CELEBRATES 10 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To understand why Jerry Jones has operated the Dallas Cowboys in
his unique manner, consider his last career change, into the murky
world of the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Jones didn't know a geologist from an engineer when he ventured
away from sales and marketing. In his first investment meeting, an
expert driller advised the naive Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend $3 million to drill right there and you'll find oil and
gas,'' a geologist told Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Jones shot back, ``if you're so sure, why don't you
invest your money?'
</P>
<P>
   Jones says that was the day he realized experts offer only
opinions in most professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in that business,'' he said, ``I had to learn engineering.
I had to educate myself, be hands-on. And then came the business of
the Dallas Cowboys. Everybody had opinions, but nobody knew. There
was no handbook, no blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wrote our own.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Jerral Wayne Jones celebrates the 10-year
anniversary of his high-profile purchase of the Cowboys. He has
become the author of a decade-long story that has entertained,
energized and sometimes polarized a public fascinated by both the
club's soap-operatic adventures and its six NFC East titles, its
four NFC Championship Game apperances and its three Super Bowl
titles _ accomplishments that make Jones' Cowboys the NFL's Team of
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win more today than I did the first day,'' said
Jones.''But when we do have adversity, as much as I want it to look
like I'm mad, truly, I have very little right to be _ because we've
had so many great times, and because I've been so lucky here.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the on-field success, the once-floundering Cowboys _
Jones claims a pre-purchase study showed the franchise was destined
to lose $25 million a year _ are now worth an estimated $400
million, making the club one of the most valuable properties in
American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not buy the Dallas Cowboys to get my head amputated
financially, as a toy to lose money on,'' said Jones, ``I didn't
buy it to make money _ so I could someday sell at a profit _ but I
always wanted to be able to look in the mirror as both a
businessman and a sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years as owner, Jones has been bussinessman and
sportsman and geologist and engineer. When reflecting on his tenure
last week, Jones recalled what he said on Feb. 25, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be my life,'' he quoted himself as saying
then. Jones also gave every indication that he would be a much
different kind of Cowboys owner, aggressive, opinionated, involved
and in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everything has gone that way,'' Jones confirmed. ``It
hasn't deviated one iota in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, Jones has gone from learning the business of NFL
owner to making unprecedented business and marketing deals to one
of the most powerful owners in the league who, at the request of
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, sits on its competition committee and
executive management council. He admits he made some mistakes along
the way, but in effect he's given the NFL a new form of owner's
manual.
`FOOTBALL MAN'
</P>
<P>
   What continues to happen, largely because of the fuel provided
by this force of nature named Jerry Jones, is a wildly entertaining
circus. Accusations of ``meddling'' have come frequently from
Cowboys outsiders. Jones casually deflects this particular
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the owner of a grocery store and I'm in charge of
paying the bills, how can the fact that I'm also in charge of
arranging the shelves be `meddling'?'' Jones asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jones still attends film sessions with his coaches, still goes
on scouting trips with his personnel people, still subtly reminds
that he isn't just an owner, but also a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics still harp on whether I'm a `football man,'''
Jones said. ``I've been doing this for 10 years. How long does it
take to be a football man? Is it 12 years, or 13 years? How long
does it take to know your way around the NFL?''
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Tom Landry, Tex Schramm, Gil Brandt, Dick Nolan,
Dick Mansperger, Bob Ackles, John Wooten and Jimmy Johnson have
come and gone during the Jones era. It begs the question Jones
considers most unfair:
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Jerry Jones hire a general manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little source of irritation to me that as we evaluate
the 10 years, as we evaluate the good decisions we've made, the
success we've had, to hear people say `Jerry needs help,''' Jones
said. ``The thing that bothers me most is that some people don't
recognize all the good decisions we've made, and some people don't
understand where the ultimate decision maker was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is fond of admitting that he knew nothing about running an
NFL team a decade ago. He's more fond of terming that ignorance a
positive of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say ignorance is bliss? It was for us,'' Jones said.
``Maybe it was an advantage at times that we didn't know our
limitations, that we thought we didn't have limitations because we
didn't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know any better'' could be Jones' perspective on
much of his early years as Cowboys honcho. Upon buying the
franchise from H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, he claims he declined Bright's
offer to handle the firing of Landry and others. ``Bum, a fine
gentleman, asked if he should do the firing so I'd only be saddled
with the hiring,'' Jones said. ``I turned him down. But don't think
I did that alone. I had the advice of some of the finest PR minds
in the country, people who'd advised presidents. Of course,
presidents sometimes get in trouble, too, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   After that first season in 1989, Jones hired the
public-relations firm Fairchild-LeMaster to guide him. And since
then, the comments regarding how he'd be in charge of everything
from ``socks and jocks'' to how the cheerleaders were the ``pick of
the litter'' to how Troy Aikman ``looked good in the shower'' have
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``People twist \Rmy comments\S around a little bit,'' Jones
said. ``The way I was attacked when I first bought the team hurt.
It hurt a lot. I don't think anything the media did to me was
vindictive. But I do think the media took advantage of a part of my
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been called cheap and heartless and ruthless, and he
has more than his share of enemies. You don't invade Texas from
Arkansas to buy the Cowboys, hire outsider Jimmy Johnson and fire
Tom Landry, all essentially in one clumsy swipe of the machete, and
not make enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's style can be brash, to say the least,'' said Cleveland
Browns president Carmen Policy, Jones' archrival when Policy was in
charge of the San Francisco 49ers. ``Ours was always, necessarily,
an adversarial relationship. But what a wonderful adversary he
was.''
THREE REGRETS
</P>
<P>
   Regrets?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones has a few.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Cowboys owner to rank his top three mistakes of his
first 10 years on the job, and off he goes, launching into a
lengthy stream-of-consciousness oration that seems painfully frank
but cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly,'' Jones said, ``there was a time when the other
people in this league saw us and thought, `Boy are we gonna take
these guys to the cleaners.' And in some cases, I screwed up, big
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones ranks his top three errors:
</P>
<P>
   1. The importance of players' off-the-field behavior: ``I wish I
would have jumped out of bed on that first morning in 1989 and
realized how much the behavior issue mattered,'' Jones said. ``I
never even considered it. The issue snuck up on me. I just figured,
if we're winning, succeeding, firin' hard, doin' anything to win,
there wouldn't be criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong. I now get it.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Keeping Barry Switzer beyond the 1995 season: ``Hindsight
says it would have been best for Barry to leave after we won the
Super Bowl,'' conceded Jones. ``We won it with Barry, and for
Barry. And he's one of finest men, as an individual and a friend,
I've ever known. But when he was successful, I should have
encouraged him to be part of a change right there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the charge that Switzer's Cowboys were destined to win a
Super Bowl with or without him, Jones responded angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry never got the credit he deserved,'' Jones said. ``Let me
ask you about the Green Bay Packers. All that talent, a great
quarterback, a fine coach and general manager \RMike Holmgren and
Ron Wolf\S. Why isn't it automatic for them to always win a Super
Bowl? And now, Ron has Ray \RRhodes\S taking over for Holmgren.
Believe me, if Ron and Ray can get them a championship, it'll be a
great achievement _ the same kind of thing Barry achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   3. His three-headlines-in-one takeover of the franchise: ``Doing
those three major things in one swoop,'' Jones said, continues to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in ownership. The management and coaching change.
And the hiring of Jimmy Johnson. Each of those was a huge sports
story by itself. But we lumped them together, giving the wrong
appearance. ... It was a mistake. There was that one big press
conference, which I didn't handle very well. And what happened,
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is all about pushing the envelope. In February 1993,
when the new rules of the collective bargaining agreement featuring
free agency and the salary cap were fresh and full of loopholes,
Jones was not displeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to thrive around here when there is a little
`vagueness' or a little `give' in the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones thinks with his tongue and he makes commitments he cannot
possibly keep and he flies by the seat of his pants _ ``Blowin' and
goin','' he calls it _ in an oddly absent-minded way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mind is a busy mind,'' said sports agent Leigh Steinberg.
``From the start, while some in the NFL were still riding in
covered wagons, Jerry was steering a race car. It's a sort of
outside-the-box thinking that gave the Cowboys the opportunity to
get ahead, and gives them the opportunity to stay ahead.''
SECOND-AND-10
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Jones' career has come full circle. He started in
what he calls ``the world of marketing.'' And marketing is still
how he spends much of his time as he looks to the future of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Jones plans on re-furbishing Texas Stadium by
adding seats and possibly a roof for what he calls ``a
state-of-the-art stadium'' that could bring a Super Bowl to North
Texas. One of his greatest battles with the NFL establishment, the
duel with NFL Properties, is also another apparent victory for
Jones. He predicts that by 2003 the Cowboys will own all the
licensing rights and revenues of their marks and logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things I was doing early on that drew criticism,''
Jones said, ``are now the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the future of the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the audacity to think we can win another Super Bowl,
and another, in the next few years,'' said Jones. ``We'll win, and
we'll win the right way.'' /

   JERRY JONES _ A COWBOYS CHRONOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25, 1989: Jones reaches an agreement to purchase the
Cowboys and the lease on Texas Stadium from H.R. ``Bum'' Bright,
and announces that University of Miami coach Jimmy Johnson will
replace Tom Landry. April 18, 1989: The sale of the Cowboys to
Jones is approved by NFL owners, and 29-year team president Tex
Schramm leaves the club to oversee the newly formed World League of
American Football. April 20, 1989: No. 1 overall pick Troy Aikman
of, the UCLA quarterback, is signed to a six-year contract. Oct.
12, 1989: Herschel Walker is traded to Minnesota for five players
and seven draft picks. The blockbuster swap results in Dallas
eventually selecting All-Pros Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson and
others. Oct. 29, 1989: Former All-Pro linebacker Lee Roy Jordan is
inducted into the team's Ring of Honor by Jones. By some, the move
is considered the righting of a wrong; by others, it's the
beginning of Jones' awkward failure to show the proper respect for
the previous regime and the history of the club. Dec. 24, 1989:
With a 20-10 loss to Green Bay at Texas Stadium, the Cowboys
complete a 1-15 season, their fourth consecutive without a playoff
appearance. April 22, 1990: The Cowboys target Baylor linebacker
James Francis in the draft, but failing to get him settle on
Florida running back Emmitt Smith. July 18, 1990: Jones bucks
tradition by changing the usually quiet and private nature of
summer training camp. He moves camp to Austin's St. Edwards
University, creates a carnival atmosphere and draws 100,000 fans in
the Cowboys' first in-state training camp. Dec. 30, 1990: the
Cowboys' stunning turnaround sees them finish 7-9. Had they not
lost 26-7 at Atlanta in the finale they'd have made the playoffs.
Emmitt Smith wins Rookie of the Year and Jimmy Johnson wins Coach
of the Year. April 21-22, 1991: The Cowboys get both quality and
quantity in the draft, trading up with New England for the top
overall pick to acquire Miami defensive lineman Russell Maryland,
and making 17 total picks (a club record for 12 rounds). Jones
helps create the concept of ``assessing signability'' by offering
contracts to potential picks before the Cowboys select them. As a
result, the club executes the unprecedented, signing all three top
picks on draft day. Sept. 29, 1991: The Cowboys defeat the
defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants, 21-16, at Texas
Stadium. Dec. 22, 1991: The Cowboys defeat Atlanta to finish 11-5
and return to the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Emmitt
Smith and Michael Irvin become the first teammates to lead the NFL
in rushing and receiving yards in the same season. They join tight
end Jay Novacek and Troy Aikman in the Pro Bowl, where Irvin is
selected MVP. Jan. 5, 1992: The Cowboys defeat Chicago, 17-13, in
first-round playoff game, their first postseason victory since
1982. May 1, 1992: In a sign of respect and an acknowledgement of
his innovative thinking, Jones is named to the prestigious NFL
Competition Committee. Aug. 27, 1992: The Cowboys acquire defensive
end Charles Haley in a trade with San Francisco. Hayey piles up
26.5 sacks in five season. Dec. 27, 1992: _ The Cowboys finish 13-3
and win their first NFC East title since 1985. Emmitt Smith wins
his second straight rushing title and the Cowboys play before
sellouts in all 16 games. Jan. 31, 1993: The Dallas Cowboys make an
NFL record sixth Super Bowl apperance, and do it in style with Troy
Aikman being named MVP after a 52-17 victory over Buffalo in Super
Bowl XXVII. Dallas becomes the first franchise to win Super Bowls
under different ownership. Sept. 16, 1993: After an 0-2 start,
Jones signs Emmitt Smith to a $13.6 million contract. Smith, the
first player ever to win a rushing title and a Super Bowl in the
same season, would go on to win a third consecutive NFL rushing
title. Nov. 7, 1993: Despite an icy relationship, years of
negotiations result in Tom Landry accepting Jones' invitation to
induction into the team's Ring of Honor. Jan. 2, 1994: With a 16-13
overtime win at New York, the Cowboys finish 12-4, capturing their
second consecutive NFC East title. But there are cracks in the
foundation when Jones finds out about Johnson's flirtations with
other NFL teams with coaching openings. Jan. 30, 1994: Dallas wins
Super Bowl XXVIII, downing Buffalo 30-13. Smith is selected the
game's MVP. To some, Jones and Johnson appear to be competing for
control of the Vince Lombardi Trophy as they pose for
photographers. March 21, 1994: The Jones-Johnson relationship
crumbles. Hurt by what he calls Johnson's ``disloyalty,'' Jones
tells reporters in Orlando for the NFL owners meeting that ``500
coaches could coach this team to a Super Bowl.'' March 29, 1994: In
a private meeting, Johnson tells Jones of his willingness to coach
in Dallas for one more season. Jones counters by telling the coach
to stay long term, to ``quit or commit.'' Johnson chooses the
latter, and accepts a settlement to depart on friendly terms with
Jones. March 30, 1994: Jones and Johnson weren't really that close
at Arkansas; but Jones and Barry Switzer were. Switzer, an
assistant coach on those Razorbacks teams who had been in exile
after his brilliant term at Oklahoma was soiled by controversy,
becomes the Cowboys' third head coach. Aug. 15, 1994: Jones'
willingness to sell the image of the Cowboys and the NFL result in
his cooperation with the league in the American Bowl, which sends
the team to Mexico City for an exhibition with the Oilers. The
crowd of 112,376 is the largest audience for an NFL game. However,
as was the case when Johnson led the assault, Jones is criticized
by team members for putting marketing ahead of preparation. Jan.
15, 1995: The Cowboys qualify for an NFL record 13th NFC
Championship Game, but Switzer's club falls short of the Super
Bowl, losing 38-28 in San Francisco. Sept. 9, 1995: The Cowboys
sign Deion Sanders, the 1994 Defensive Player of the Year who
played the previous season with Super Bowl champion San Francisco.
Dec. 24, 1995: The Cowboys win their fourth consecutive NFC East
title, a feat no other division team had accomplished except the
1976-79 Cowboys. Jan. 28, 1996: The Cowboys become the first NFL
team to win three Super Bowls in four seasons with a 27-17 victory
over Pittsburgh. Oct. 13, 1996: Michael Irvin returns from a
five-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse
policy. Dec. 15, 1996: With a 12-6 victory against the New England
Patriots, the Cowboys become the first team in NFL history with
five consecutive division championships. Nov. 30, 1996: Defensive
tackle Leon Lett is supended for one year for violating the NFL's
substance abuse policy. Dec. 21, 1997: A 20-7 loss to the New York
Giants ends the Cowboys' season at 6-10, the first non-playoff
season since 1990. Jan. 9, 1998: Barry Switzer resigns after a
season that began with him being arrested for carrying a gun in his
bag into D/FW airport and ended with the Cowboys' first losing
season in eight seasons. Feb. 12, 1998: After searching through a
number of ``name'' candidates, Jones hires Chan Gailey to serve as
the Cowboys' fourth head coach. Gailey is immediately hit with
charges that he'll be nothing more than a Jones ``yes'' man. Dec.
20, 1998: The Cowboys clinch their sixth NFC East title in seven
years with a 13-9 defeat of the Philadelphia Eagles. Jan. 2, 1999:
The Cowboys return to the postseason is short. After a 20-7 loss to
the Arizona Cardinals, whom the Cowboys had defeated twice during
the season, Jones admit the Cowboys need to make some changes to
get back to the Super Bowl. Feb. 25, 1999: Jerry Jones will
celebrate his 10th anniversary of purchasing the Cowboys.

JERRY'S COACHES
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson (1989-93) Regular season record: 44-36, two NFC
East titles Postseason record: 7-1, two NFC Championship Game
appearances Super Bowl record: 2-0 Legacy: Shrewd personnel
evaluator who made public outbursts at the site of laggards. Temper
could be set off anytime. Once cut a backup running back a day
after the back lost two fumbles in a game. Generally thought of as
a master psychologist who got the most from his players, even if it
meant sending a message through the media to those said players.
Best move: After the 1990 season, he traded Steve Walsh, the player
who won him a national championship at the University of Miami.
This forever ended any quarterback controversy between Walsh and
Troy Aikman, and Aikman went on to win three Super Bowls in four
years. Worst move: Not toasting team owner Jerry Jones during a
party at the 1993 NFL owners' meetings. The snub was the final barb
between the two which led to Johnson resigning a few days later.
Barry Switzer (1994-97) Regular season record: 40-24, three NFC
East titles Postseason record: 5-2, two NFC Championship Game
appearances Super Bowl record: 1-0 Legacy: Laid back demeanor was
welcomed by most of team who'd endured taskmaster Johnson. Problem
is, one of the players who didn't take to Switzer's demeanor was
the quarterback, Troy Aikman, who preferred Johnson's strict way of
running practices and team meetings. When Switzer took sides
against Aikman in a racial incident involving a former Cowboys
assistant coach, the division between coach and quarterback became
too great to be repaired. The two went through the remaining years
of Switzer's tenure barely speaking. Best move: The move he didn't
make. He left the wishbone and option offense in Norman, Okla.,
allowing the Cowboys to keep the same offensive and defensive
philosophies. In doing so, Switzer won a Super Bowl in his second
season. Worst move: He ordered his team to go for it _ not once,
but twice _ on fourth-and-one from their own 29 late in a December
1995 game in Philadelphia. Emmitt Smith was stuffed both times and
the Cowboys lost.
Chan Gailey (1998-present) Regular season record: 10-6, one NFC
East title Postseason record: 0-1 Super Bowl record: 0-0 Legacy: He
is recognized as an extremely organized coach with a sharp
attention to detail. Every minute of every day for the team was
scheduled. Of the three previous head coaches in Cowboys history,
only Tom Landry was a more creative offensive coach, though Gailey
may have been too wild at times with the formations. Most
importantly, he appears to have the respect from every player on
the team. Best move: Letting veteran players sit in first class on
the team plane. This was one of several things that helped Gailey
show his players that the game is still about them. Worst move: Is
still head coach, so no move has been met with disastrous results.
Yet we're sure he'd like to have it to do over again in Chicago.
After the Cowboys scored a touchdown, Gailey ordered his club to go
for two. The attempt failed, and was eventually the difference in
the game as the Cowboys lost to the Bears, 13-12.
JERRY'S BIG THREE
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jones recalls his three favorite Cowboys victories:'' A
24-21 victory at Washington on Nov. 24, 1991, a win that triggered
a five-game victory streak that propelled Dallas into the playoffs.
``They were undefeated at the time, and I think that was the game
that first has us believing that we were on the right track to
someday being able to compete for a Super Bowl,'' Jones said. A
52-17 victory over Buffalo in Super Bowl XXVII at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena on Jan. 31, 1993. ``That first Super Bowl, in Pasadena,
was a big day. It was just a dream come true, something I'll never
forget,'' Jones said. A 27-17 victory over Pittsburgh in Super Bowl
XXX in Arizona on Jan. 28, 1996. ``The win we had with Barry
Switzer as the head coach, our third Super Bowl win, was a
tremendous day for this franchise, and for me personally. It was a
terrific accomplishment, one that Barry deserves a lot more credit
for,'' Jones said.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pernell Whitaker came to work early and left late
Saturday night, far later than Felix Trinidad ever thought he
would. But when the end came, Whitaker didn't leave a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 16-month layoff, the 35-year-old four-time world
champion showed flashes of the ring generalship and defensive
wizardry that for so long made him the game's pound-for-pound
champion, but as the battle for Trinidad's International Boxing
Federation welterweight title wore on, Whitaker simply wore out.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years difference in age and a lifetime of fighting slowly
seemed to unravel the former champion, who lost a unanimous
12-round decision before a roaring crowd of 13,822 at Madison
Square Garden that sets up a showdown between Trinidad and World
Boxing Commission champion Oscar De La Hoya that may not be made
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, judges Robert Exton and Melvin Lathan had it
118-109, while judge Samuel Conde Lopez scored the bout, 117-110.
The Globe card had Trinidad a 116-112 winner with the champion
taking four of the final five rounds. Although Whitaker disputed
those numbers, even his manager gave the nod to Trinidad before the
official announcement came.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the fight,'' Lou Duva said. ``More punching. Better
punching.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough punching and elbowing that after the fight a physician
examined Whitaker and feared he had broken his jaw. Despite that,
he still argued forcefully for his position before leaving for St.
Vincent's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything,'' Whitaker (40-3-1) said. ``Hell yeah,
I thought I won. I controlled the late rounds. I'll fight until
somebody beats me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious (I won),'' Trinidad (34-0) said. ``It was
obvious on the judges' scorecards, given such a big split, that I
won. I am the best welterweight in the world. I knew I was going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   If he did, he could have fooled Whitaker in the early rounds.
Off 16 months after twice testing positive for drugs, Whitaker
regularly reached the champion with his right jab and body shots.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker also drew first blood when he landed a string of
stinging right jabs late in the opening round, bloodying the
champion's nose. Whitaker continued to beat Trinidad to the punch
with the jab until only seconds were left in Round 2 when, out of
nowhere, the champion dropped a straight right on Whitaker that
sent him to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the first minute of Round 6, the champion twice rocked
Whitaker with rights that signaled trouble was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   As Trinidad moved closer and more often landed his own jab as
well as those stinging rights, Whitaker twice sat down voluntarily
without being hit as Trinidad searched for him. Although neither
was considered a knockdown, it was clear he hadn't gone down
completely at his own suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker's last hurrah came one round later when he twice rocked
the champion while once being shaken up himself. It was one last
blast of gunfire from an aging gunslinger and by the next round he
suddenly seemed older by half a decade as Trinidad did his first
real damage.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of those right-hand leads were landing and for
perhaps the first time in his career, Whitaker appeared to be in
real trouble with 1:23 left in Round 8.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, it was a different fight but a familiar one. The
young man landing often enough to take over the fight if not often
enough to do what he had come for _ become the first man to knock
out Pernell Whitaker.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With a little more than a month to go until the March 23 trade
deadline, the Stars find themselves in an interesting position.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared every team in the Western Conference
needed to make at least one trade, if not a bevy, solutions have
sprung up out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The Avalanche has shored up its problems on
defense by finally resigning Sandis Ozolinsh. If everyone stays
healthy, a blue line with Ozolinsh, Adam Foote, Sylvain Lefebvre,
Alexei Gusarov, Aaron Miller and Greg deVries isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the Red Wings went on a five-game winning roll
behind the strong goaltending of Chris Osgood and improved
defensive play of the forwards. This, despite injuries to
defensemen Uwe Krupp and Todd Gill, shows the Red Wings might be
deeper than thought.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Coyotes are struggling, but seem secure in their
position as fourth seed in the West. And, of course, the Stars are
8-1-1 in their past 10 games, letting everyone know that they have
a pretty solid second-line left winger already in Jamie
Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the top four and the rest of the West is
clear. But does that mean there will be more competition at trade
time or less? Does it mean teams are more confident than ever that
they can win or more scared that they need an extra advantage?
</P>
<P>
   The word out of Phoenix _ although this could be posturing _ is
that the Coyotes are expected to lose between $5 million and $10
million and that owner Richard Burke is a little shaky on trying to
rent one of the available free-agents-to-be like Theo Fleury. Stars
owner Tom Hicks last week said he, too, needs his payroll to
decrease in the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we will be moving in younger players
next season and in the years to come and we will be able to keep
our payroll in line that way,'' Hicks said of the cheap help.
``Those younger players are a very important part of the entire
system right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you think the Stars might hesitate before dealing
a propspect for a high-priced veteran like Adam Graves of the
Rangers or Mark Recchi of the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Avalanche has been on a tight budget for years,
and the Red Wings likely won't break the bank when their payroll
already is the largest in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the market for Fleury or Recchi or Mark Tinordi of the
Capitals won't be nearly as intense as people think. Maybe, teams
seeking defense will start focusing on players like the Hurricanes'
Curtis Leschyshyn ($1.7 million) and Adam Burt ($1.1 million)
instead of Tinordi or the Blackhawks' Chris Chelios. Maybe the
Stars will look for cheaper left-wing solutions like Geoff
Sanderson, who has worn out his welcome in Buffalo.

   Sergei Fedorov's pledge last week to give $2 million to
children's charities had some skeptics choking. After all, Ottawa
Senators center Alexei Yashin last year pledged $1 million to the
arts in Canada and then backed off on the donation after giving
only $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Fedorov appears to be sincere in making his pledge to
Detroit-area youth, which makes for an amazing story. For any
person to pledge that amount of money is mind-boggling, let alone
an athlete. Remember, Fedorov still has friends and family who are
probably getting plenty of donations from last season's $14 million
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   And Fedorov pledges to be an active giver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go and talk to them, to spend some time with them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him.

   Interesting how Calgary GM Al Coates dealt with the announcement
from Theo Fleury last week that Fleury was tired and could be
experiencing a relapse of the Crohn's Disease that has dogged him
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, who is trying to trade Fleury before the March 23 trade
deadline and is hoping to start a bidding war, was quick to rush
his trainers into a full examination of Fleury _ after which, the
gritty winger was pronounced completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sure wouldn't want to do business at Honest Al's Used Cars. ``No
mam, really, those tires are designed to run flat like that.''
STILL CRAZY. . .

   Oilers GM Glen Sather continues to be the league-leader in wacky
ideas. His latest is to expand the playoffs to 20 teams and give
the division winners first-round byes. His reasoning? That Canadian
teams are getting squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six out of 27 teams are Canadian and it'll soon be six out of
30,'' Sather said. ``The Canadian teams making the playoffs has big
ramifications for TV viewing and TV contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, 16 teams seems too many.

   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk is struggling, and that's one

</P>
<P>
   ``Once he gets the smile back in his heart _ his hockey heart _
and he stops pressing so much, it will all come together for him,''
Schoenfeld said.
SPOTLIGHT ON. . . RON TUGNUTT
JOURNEYMAN GOALIE ENJOYING ONE OF BEST YEARS IN HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings once a week for Ron Tugnutt, just to keep him
humble.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the line is his 9-year-old nephew Michael, a
novice league goalie who wants to tell his NHL goalie uncle that
his goals against average keeps dropping.
</P>
<P>
   It's down to 1.25, Michael says.
</P>
<P>
   Well, even Uncle Ron can't match that total _ his 1.59 GAA is
only good enough right now to be the lowest in the NHL since 1940,
shattering the modern-day era mark of 1.88 set in the last two
seasons by Ed Belfour and Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   What, you say you haven't heard of Ron Tugnutt? Well, you're not
alone. Even in the NHL, Tugnutt is seen as something of a
journeyman. The 31-year-old 155-pounder is on his fifth NHL team
and entered the season with a 3.56 career GAA. His best season was
last year when he went 15-14-8 with a 2.25 GAA.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Tugnutt was ready to quit his NHL career two seasons ago
when he spent the entire season with Portland of the American
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of in shock at the stats,'' Tugnutt said of his
16-6-5 record and 93.4 save percentage. ``I've said all along that
you're only as good as the team in front of you. And I'm fortunate
to playing behind a team that plays outstanding defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Tugnutt's experience and determination have him
winning a head-to-head battle with the younger Damian Rhodes, who
most in Ottawa feel is the player destined to be the No. 1 goalie.
After all, Rhodes played 10 playoff games last season while Tugnutt
had two appearances.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with the same defense as Tugnutt, Rhodes has a
15-10-3 record, a 2.57 GAA and a 90.2 save percentage. That's
nothing against Rhodes, it just shows how well Tugnutt is playing.
And there might not be a more deserving goalie. Tugnutt struggled
through years with the Quebec Nordiques when they were the worst
team in the NHL, and then had brief stints in Edmonton, Anaheim and
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man who has played all of 12 playoff games in 10
seasons, has the inside track on being the Senators' No. 1 goalie
in the postseason. Mix that with his first-ever All-Star game
appearance, and it's been a pretty good year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who's been traveling around trying to find work for
12 or 13 years, to me that's pretty gratifying,'' Tugnutt said.
AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Flames winger Theo Fleury scored three points to pass Al
MacInnis and become the Calgary Flames' all-time point-scoring
leader with 824 points. ... The Hurricanes are hoping for a healthy
return from Jeff O'Neill (strained neck) soon. O'Neill is one of
seven Hurricanes forwards with 10 or more goals. ... Former Stars
winger Todd Harvey is the heartbeat that has Rangers fans still
believing they can make the playoffs. ``I know I'll play hard until
the 82nd game, if I'm still alive by then,'' Harvey said. Harvey
has a black eye and a thumb splint. ... Wayne Gretzky now has 2,850
career points, 1,000 more than the NHL's second-best scorer, Gordie
Howe. ... The Flyers struggled in their recent 1-2-1 Western road
trip, allowing the Senators to close within one point in the fight
for the East's top seed. Flyers defenseman Luke Richardson has been
so bad he might end up in the press box in the playoffs. ... Blues
backup goalie Rich Parent is out indefinitely with a ruptured
testicle. ... Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek has missed two games with
a groin strain.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a little more than a month to go until the March 23 trade
deadline, the Stars find themselves in an interesting position.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared every team in the Western Conference
needed to make at least one trade, if not a bevy, solutions have
sprung up out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The Avalanche has shored up its problems on
defense by finally resigning Sandis Ozolinsh. If everyone stays
healthy, a blue line with Ozolinsh, Adam Foote, Sylvain Lefebvre,
Alexei Gusarov, Aaron Miller and Greg deVries isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the Red Wings went on a five-game winning roll
behind the strong goaltending of Chris Osgood and improved
defensive play of the forwards. This, despite injuries to
defensemen Uwe Krupp and Todd Gill, shows the Red Wings might be
deeper than thought.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Coyotes are struggling, but seem secure in their
position as fourth seed in the West. And, of course, the Stars are
8-1-1 in their past 10 games, letting everyone know that they have
a pretty solid second-line left winger already in Jamie
Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the top four and the rest of the West is
clear. But does that mean there will be more competition at trade
time or less? Does it mean teams are more confident than ever that
they can win or more scared that they need an extra advantage?
</P>
<P>
   The word out of Phoenix _ although this could be posturing _ is
that the Coyotes are expected to lose between $5 million and $10
million and that owner Richard Burke is a little shaky on trying to
rent one of the available free-agents-to-be like Theo Fleury. Stars
owner Tom Hicks last week said he, too, needs his payroll to
decrease in the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we will be moving in younger players
next season and in the years to come and we will be able to keep
our payroll in line that way,'' Hicks said of the cheap help.
``Those younger players are a very important part of the entire
system right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you think the Stars might hesitate before dealing
a propspect for a high-priced veteran like Adam Graves of the
Rangers or Mark Recchi of the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Avalanche has been on a tight budget for years,
and the Red Wings likely won't break the bank when their payroll
already is the largest in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the market for Fleury or Recchi or Mark Tinordi of the
Capitals won't be nearly as intense as people think. Maybe, teams
seeking defense will start focusing on players like the Hurricanes'
Curtis Leschyshyn ($1.7 million) and Adam Burt ($1.1 million)
instead of Tinordi or the Blackhawks' Chris Chelios. Maybe the
Stars will look for cheaper left-wing solutions like Geoff
Sanderson, who has worn out his welcome in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they won't make moves at all. . .that is, until another
team makes one.
</P>
<P>
   So the best bet for fans right now is to do exactly what the GMs
are doing _ put on your poker faces, boys, because it's going to be

HOME-GROWN TALENT KEY TO RANGERS' FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it's starting to come out. The Rangers considered all along
putting super prospect Ruben Mateo in a trade for pitcher Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   What kept the deal from getting done at the winter meetings in
December was the Blue Jays' desire to have Rick Helling included in
the same package. The Rangers, in danger of gambling away their
long-term future by trading Mateo, at least weren't willing to go
that far. The Rangers also backed away from a Tom Goodwin-Helling
package.
</P>
<P>
   What finally got trade talks going again last week was that the
Blue Jays lowered their price. Toronto general manager Gord Ash did
not want Clemens in his spring training camp after he had upset so
many of his former teammates with his demands to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   So Ash pushed for a deal and decided to settle for Esteban
Loaiza instead of Helling. That's what put the Rangers on the brink
of acquiring Clemens before the New York Yankees stepped in
Wednesday evening. In the back of his mind, Ash was hoping the
Yankees would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's little chance of stopping the Yankees from
winning the division, but he did improve the Blue Jays' wild-card
chances. That's more important than a super prospect because Ash
could lose his job if the Blue Jays fail to reach the playoffs for
the fifth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin should be disappointed.
After three months of hard work, all he succeeded in doing was
lowering the price for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers owner Tom Hicks is steaming as well, but it could be
worse. He could be sitting in Peter Angelos' position and may soon
be if the Rangers aren't careful.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles' owner had the highest payroll in baseball
last year, only to watch as his team come in four games under .500.
Now he's shelling out close to $90 million and his team still
doesn't have a prayer of beating the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is that likely to change anytime soon, because the Orioles'
farm system is depleted from reckless trades over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers had traded for Clemens, they would have been
legitimate World Series contenders, just like they were supposed to
be when they signed John Wetteland. But the Yankees also wouldn't
have sat back without doing something. Curt Schilling is out there,
as are Denny Neagle and Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   Bet the house Yankees owner George Steinbrenner would have
pulled out the whip and made his people do something. If so, the
Rangers could have been sitting there with a $90 million payroll
and still not have been good enough to get past the Yankees.
Meanwhile, the Rangers' best prospect since Juan Gonzalez would be
playing in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Including Mateo in the deal for Clemens was way too risky. The
continual bleeding of the farm system eventually has to stop. The
only way to catch up with the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians is
for the Rangers to develop their own talent, especially pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they'll be just like the Orioles: a team with
expensive stars but with little hope now and even less for the
future. Short hops Clemens has been known to do his daily running
outside the ballpark, but that might be a little tricky in the
South Bronx. Said Clemens, ``I haven't thought about that. I'll
find somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, when asked how long wanted to keep pitching: ``As thin
as pitching is in baseball, I can probably go out there as long as
I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumors going around, the Blue Jays have no interest in
trading Wells. That may change come July if they're not in
contention. But if Wells gets over his deep disappointment and
pitches well in Toronto, the Blue Jays are at least serious
wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd was no small loss for the Yankees. He had a 1.67]
earned-run average last year, and opponents hit .191 off him. He'll
be missed in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros showed commendable restraint in the Clemens affair.
The Blue Jays were demanding Scott Elarton in return, but Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker refused to budge on his terrific
young pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin believes No. 1 starters have a bigger impact in
postseason than they do in the regular season. But Clemens was 1-2
with a 3.88 ERA in nine postseason starts while with the Boston Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He had a lead going into the sixth inning in four of his last
five postseason starts, and the Red Sox lost every game. The one
exception was Game 4 of the 1990 American League Championship
Series against Oakland when he was ejected in the second inning for
arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Cy Young Award winners have been traded in their
careers. The Rangers have acquired four: Ferguson Jenkins, Gaylord
Perry, Mike Marshall and Sparky Lyle. But the Clemens deal was
probably the biggest involving a future Hall of Fame pitcher since
the Mets traded Tom Seaver to the Reds on June 15, 1977, for
pitcher Pat Zachary.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar trade that comes to mind happened after the 1971
season when the San Francisco Giants traded Gaylord Perry to the
Cleveland Indians for Sam McDowell. Both were big winners in the
prime of their careers. Perry won the Cy Young Award for Cleveland
in 1972, but McDowell was a huge bust in San Francisco, crippling
the Giants severely for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga will miss the entire season because of a tumor
in his lower back, but believe him when he says he'll be back.
Galarraga, 37, keeps himself in superb physical condition and has
remained extremely productive at a time when other players start to
decline. He's batting .305 over the past five seasons and has
averaged 44 home runs a year over the past three.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went into spring training thinking they might trade
left fielder Ryan Klesko. Now he'll likely move to first base and
Otis Nixon, Gerald Williams and Danny Bautista will play left. The
Braves also have some interest in Pirates outfielder Al Martin, who
lost his job in the off-season to Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Claude Brochu continues to be a problem in
Montreal. A group of investors is ready to step in with an infusion
of cash that will help the team stay in Montreal and get a new
ballpark. But the investors first want Brochu out. He owns 7.6
percent of the team and has been offered $10 million, but he's
apparently holding out for more.

   CALGARY, Alberta _ Midway through the third period Saturday
night, Calgary Flames defenseman Derek Morris lofted what appeared
to be a simple clearing pass out of his end of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 1-on-1 battle between Flames right wing Theoren Fleury,
a man who might be a King, and defenseman Mattias Norstrom, who is
one. As the puck entered the Kings' zone, the 5-foot-6, 180-pound
Fleury prevailed, with the 6-1, 205-pound Norstrom losing his
footing.
</P>
<P>
   Now on a breakaway, Fleury drove to the net and stuffed a
backhander under goalie Jamie Storr, the tying goal in what ended
as a 2-2 deadlock before a crowd of 16,758 at the Saddledome
watching the opener of the Kings' six-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Norstrom and Kings coach Larry Robinson, one more
emphatically than the other, both said they felt referee Stephen
Walkom should have penalized Fleury for holding Norstrom's stick on
the play. More emphatically, Fleury disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, right,'' smirked Fleury, the subject of intense trade
speculation involving the Kings. ``Matti Norstrom is 6-foot-5, 250
pounds. I'm 5-foot-6, 150 pounds. I won the battle. He lost the
battle. I scored the goal, plain as day.''
</P>
<P>
   And plain as day, the Kings (21-31-5) lost a point in the
standings in a game in which they'd held a two-goal lead. The point
the Kings did earn drew them to within five of Edmonton, which
holds the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth.
Calgary (20-28-10) is ninth, two points ahead of the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst-officiated game I've ever seen,'' said
Robinson, whose team got a boost with the return of Glen Murray,
back after missing 19 games with a knee injury. ``I'm disgusted.
I'm sorry. On the Fleury goal, he held Matti's stick all the way up
the ice.... Give me a break. You're not supposed to criticize
(officials)? Holy Macaroni. I'll get a young kid out of the stands
who can do just as good a job. It's awful. I've never seen anything
like it in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Markedly more low-key, Norstrom said, ``That's one of the few
times I expected to hear a whistle. I was the guy closest to the
situation. He got a good grab on my stick and tipped me over.... I
should be able to outmuscle him. But it's tough, no matter how
strong you are, if somebody holds your stick or trips you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game the Kings should have won, especially after a
first-period goal by Donald Audette and Olli Jokinen's
second-period power play goal gave them a 2-0 lead. Jokinen's goal
went in off the left skate of Flames defenseman Tommy Albelin, and
Storr picked up the first assist of his 55-game career on the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings should have had more, but Fred Brathwaite was
excellent in goal for the Flames, and lucky, too, with a shot from
the slot by Rob Blake ringing the left post in the final minute of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' inability to pad their lead would cost them. Late in
the second period, a shot by Phil Housley that deflected in off the
stick of Kings defenseman Doug Bodger brought the Flames within one
goal. Then came Fleury's goal in the third.
</P>
<P>
   By night's end, the game had sunk to the level of a rugby match,
with Walkom assessing six penalties in the final minute of overtime
after one scrum. Walkom gave Robinson one more reason to be angry
when he placed the subsequent faceoff to the right of the Kings'
net rather than outside the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't see anything,'' Robinson said. ``He usually is
pretty good. He just had a bad night.''

MAVERICKS BREAK SKID BEHIND TRENT'S HEROICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No way, the Mavericks said, were they going to
lose this game. Not here. Not to the winless Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a magnificent performance from reserve forward Gary
Trent, the Mavericks snapped their seven-game losing streak by
spanking the Clippers, 105-90, last night before 10,946 at the LA
Sports Arena. Dallas finishes this seven-game road trip with a game
in Phoenix tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (2-8) can thank Trent that the streak is history.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clippers still hanging close, Trent hoisted the
Mavericks on his back and successfully toted them across the finish
line. The burly 6-foot-8 forward scored 15 of his career-high tying
27 points in the fourth quarter, and also collected a career-high
16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Trent scored 10 unanswered Mavericks points during one stretch
that increased Dallas' lead from 89-81 to 99-83. He was truly the
star of this show, with Michael Finley added a supporting role with
his 31 points and 10 rebounds in 43 grinding minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this team needs is what Trent's bringing now,'' Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``He's taking advantage of a
great opportunity and is really making us play well.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is now 1-5 on this seven-game road trip, which concludes
tomorrow night in Phoenix. The Clippers are 0-7 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Trent has now increased his point production five straight
games. But he said he still has more to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not in the rhythm like I want to be,'' Trent said.
``I've been a little fatigue late in the game, but you just have to
fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent was 10-of-16 from the field and also added three assists,
two blocks and a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson showed just how desperate he was to get a win by
scratching rookie Dirk Nowitzki from the starting lineup in favor
of Cedric Ceballos. He also did not play Samaki Walker for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowitzki has been in a real struggle to make something happen,
and we had to do something to change it,'' Nelson said. ``We
basically went with veterans, because we wanted to get a win in the
worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for benching Walker, who is in the midst of trying to get a
contract extension with the Mavericks, Nelson said: ``It just can't
be helped. I wanted to play guys that were being productive, and
he's really struggled this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just statistics, it's the errors that are being made.
So we wanted to limit those. We thought to give ourselves a chance
to win tonight we had to limit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos responded with 14 points and 11 rebounds. He scored
seven of the Mavericks' first 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of movement, and that's what I live off of,''
Ceballos said. ``The start gave us a lot of enegry, and everybody
kind of fed off that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash had two beautiful assists to Trent, with the latter
one lifting the Mavericks ahead, 85-78, with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who collected 11 points and six assists, squeezed a jumper
through the nets for an 89-81 lead with 5:33 left. The Clippers
then committed an inbound violation, and Trent took over from there
as the Mavericks eventually built their first 20-point lead of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley poured in 17 of his points in the first half. Dallas led
at the half, 48-45, and Finley finished with a 11-of-21 shooting
chart after going 4-of-19 from the floor against Golden State on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some good looks and I didn't try to force anything,''
Finley said. ``I took what the defense gave me, and I knocked down
open shots when I had the opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just come in and contribute and do what Nellie asks,'' Trent
said. ``But I don't want to be tired at 30 minutes; I want to be
tired at 38 minutes.''

CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers broke the seal on their seventh game
Saturday, hoping all heck might break loose. On cue, there was a
plague of mediocre defense, scores of lost rebounds and a flood of
offense that didn't flow.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, amen, the Clippers were 0-7, 105-90 losers
to the sickly Dallas Mavericks in front of 10,946 at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in our favor,'' said Clippers forward Maurice
Taylor, who followed Tuesday's 21-point, 20-rebound effort vs.
Vancouver with 11 and 4, respectively, against Dallas. ``They
(Mavericks) were on the road, they played back-to-back games and we
had time to prepare. It's embarrassing. If this doesn't wake us up,
I don't know what will.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-8 Mavericks, who had a better alibi for sleepwalking
through this one, were playing their third game in as many days.
They also were the first team this season to play the Clippers the
night after playing someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to avoid being the first team the Clippers
tagged for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for these guys to realize they need to have more
respect for each other,'' coach Chris Ford said of his Clippers.
``They need to stay together; they need to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The inadequate work is reflected in numbers that weren't
horrendous _ in Biblical terms _ but were within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scorer and card-carrying small forward Lamond Murray
started at ``shooting'' guard but only managed eight shots. He made
two and finished with eight points, nine below his average. After
whipping Vancouver on the boards Tuesday, the Clippers were
outrebounded 54-41 by the road-weary Mavericks. Rookie center
Michael Olowokandi chased down a team-high 11 rebounds but missed 9
of 13 field-goal attempts against 7-foot-6 Shawn Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were scalded by guard Michael Finley, who poured in
a game-high 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. They were punished
by forward Gary Trent, who strutted in from the bench to score 27
points and pick off a game-high 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't seize a victory that circumstance left on their
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the maturity level has to grow here,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who frequently open a game as if it is a ticking
package, meandered out to a 10-19 deficit. They rallied to tie it
at 19 by the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who frequently treat such success as if it were a
traveling salesman, opened the second quarter by spotting Dallas
the first seven points. With Pooh Richardson _ filling in for the
injured Sherman Douglas as Darrick Martin's backup a point guard _
rallying the troops, the Clippers clawed back to within three, at
48-45, by intermission. Martin, by the way, turned in one of his
better performances, finishing with 13 points and a season-high 10
assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who frequently open third quarters as if posing
for a still portrait, decided to remain animated for a while.
Rodney Rogers scored eight Clippers points in a row and the home
team stayed within two until the Mavericks went on a 10-2 run.
Finley converted a deuce at the end of a drive, and Dallas led
67-57 with 4:10 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter reached its highest level of grief when Trent, who
finished with 27 points and a game-high 16 rebounds off the bench,
made a pair of three throws to put Dallas ahead 76-61 with 1:27
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who frequently flirt with the thrill of victory in
the fourth quarter, must have had a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you can earn respect in this league,'' Ford said, ``you
have to learn to respect each other.''

   SCHOOL-DISCIPLINE _ The controversial centerpiece of Gov. Roy
Barnes' student discipline bill _ giving teachers more power to
remove disruptive students _ addresses a problem that most critics
and even supporters agree only occurs where leadership or resources
are sadly lacking. Specifically, the bill could force the principal
to find another place for a disruptive student when a teacher wants
to kick the student out of class. It's a rare situation, most
educators acknowledge, but it can happen, they say. (Cuming,

`AND THE BEAT GOES ON':   TWO STARS ARE BORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the cult of the dead celebrity, everyone who dies comes back
as a vanilla wafer. That's what happens to Sonny Bono in ``And the
Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story,'' a foolishly reverential
drama about two people who, in their pop-star moment, wore furry
vests and orange bell-bottoms. Nothing about that joined-at-the-hip
team was nearly as fascinating as its afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   In their separate reinventions, she became a superstar; the line
that goes from Cher to Roseanne to Madonna revels in the
kaleidoscopic self. Stranger still, he became a congressman; the
line that goes from Ronald Reagan to Sonny Bono to Jesse (the Body)
Ventura breaks down the evanescent border between celebrity and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their solo lives are outside the scope of this bland film,
though, which focuses on their rise to stardom yet suggests none of
the savvy or cynicism that is a basic element of pop celebrity and
image making. It turns the Sonny and Cher story into a Mickey
Rooney-Judy Garland movie, but such on-screen innocence is a
tougher sell today.
</P>
<P>
   The film's pit stops include the years when Sonny worked for a
meatpacker and longed for a music career. ``I never stopped
hustling,'' he says in a voice-over. In this squeaky-clean version
of the recording industry, hard work and hustle are all it takes to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   One day Sonny and Cher are shaking their bangs and singing ``I
Got You Babe'' on the pseudo-hip television show ``Shindig.'' The
next they're starring in Las Vegas and in their own CBS
comedy-variety show, with a new shtick: Cher constantly insults
Sonny. Then, big surprise, they divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The film, on ABC Monday night, fails to take advantage of its
priceless opportunities for camp-classic status, despite glimmers
of unintended wit at the start. It begins with a re-enactment of
Sonny and Cher's late-'80s reunion on David Letterman's show.
</P>
<P>
   The actors playing the Letterman and Paul Shaffer roles are so
unconvincing they seem like refugees from a failed ``Saturday Night
Live'' sketch. The story then unfolds in flashback. Sonny meets
Little Richard, played here as a pudgy-faced guy in a pink dressing
gown flouncing down a spiral staircase.
</P>
<P>
   As Sonny, Jay Underwood tries to capture the nasal whine. (The
credit ``prosthetic makeup'' means Sonny's nose.) But he comes
across as a scrappy, no-talent guy. Some people have that
impression of his career, but surely it's a fluke here.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only one word of dialogue to see that Renee Faia has
captured Cher with drop-dead accuracy, though. ``Hi,'' she says
when she meets Sonny, her voice dripping with dismissive wit. This
shrewd imitation is wasted in what should have been called
``Sonny's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Together or apart, Sonny and Cher were never musical geniuses.
Still, the buoyant music (a mix of authentic Sonny and Cher
recordings and sound-alikes) adds what little energy the film has.
</P>
<P>
   In a coda, ``And the Beat Goes On'' ends with clips of the real
Sonny Bono, shown with Newt Gingrich and, from an earlier phase,
onstage in a sequined tuxedo. As some weird manifestation of the
American dream, it's hard to top that transformation. Sidestepping
the truly intriguing questions, this movie turns the star's life
into goo.

`MELTDOWN AT THREE-MILE ISLAND': TECHNICAL ERROR AND HUMAN FOLLY
LEAD TO FIVE FRIGHTENING DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa.) (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happily, if that is the word, the direst fears were not realized
in America's worst nuclear accident, at the Three Mile Island plant
in March 1979. But as Monday night's close-up account on ``The
American Experience'' sets forth in illuminating detail, the
Americans who lived near Harrisburg, Pa., experienced an
unnervingly anxious week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meltdown at Three Mile Island'' tells a story of technical
failure (a defective valve) and human folly (an error in cutting
off the plant's water supply) in what had been advertised as an
accident-proof power plant. The resultant confusion was compounded
by an inept public relations effort that added to the mistrust it
was intended to quell.
</P>
<P>
   In hour-by-hour reporting on Gov. Dick Thornburgh's decision as
to whether to order an all-out evacuation, Monday night's program
shows how a manageable accident became a national emergency. When
reporters picked up hints that something untoward was happening at
the plant, spokesmen for the utility rushed in with ill-founded
assurances that there was no danger of radiation, and a state
official announced in the face of the evidence that ``everything is
under control.'' Residents were soon protesting ``the way we were
lied to.''
</P>
<P>
   What with tangled communications, shaky diagnoses, angry
disagreements among experts and agencies and the natural
nervousness of parents, conditions were ripe for hysteria, and
140,000 people fled their homes. Walter Cronkite is credited or
blamed for first using the fearsome word ``meltdown'' to describe
what might be happening as weary scientists worked in the shadow of
an anticipated explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way you can learn something about the calculations
that go into ``explosion theory.'' With the experts disagreeing
about the physical threat, priests started offering absolution. The
heroes of the occasion turned out to be President Jimmy Carter and
his take-charge emissaries and the scientist who figured out that
the measurement his colleagues had been using to analyze a
seemingly dangerous hydrogen bubble was all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So despite a closer call than the public was informed of by
those they relied on (the plant's core was later found to have
suffered a 50 percent meltdown) there was never a threat of the big
bang or a serious release of radiation. That was, of course, a
relief after what is described as ``five days of fear and
anguish,'' but it left behind a fallout of anxiety that pretty much
ended the promise of nuclear power in the United States. This
program reminds viewers that not a single new nuclear plant has
been built since the panic at Three Mile Island.

reminded his nephew, Walter Sachs. Whether such a reminder was
necessary is questionable. Goldman and Sachs were the sons,
respectively, of Marcus Goldman, a German-Jewish immigrant who went
into the money business in lower Manhattan in 1869, and his
son-in-law Sam Sachs, who joined the business in the early 1880s,
thereby inscribing his name in American financial legend.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been any Goldmans or Sachs in the top positions at
Goldman Sachs for a long time now, but, as Lisa Endlich's new book
on the famous financial services company makes clear, Henry's
comment to Walter could have served as the company motto all along.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Endlich's theme in ``Goldman Sachs,'' an account of the
company from its 19th-century founding to its failed effort to sell
itself to the public last year, is what she calls corporate
``culture.'' Her emphasis is on the nature of a company that
remained a private partnership even as every other major investment
house became a publicly traded corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Endlich spends a good deal of time describing the various
abortive efforts by senior management to end the partnership
arrangement _ first in 1986, again in 1996, once more in 1998 _ and
this provides a kind of narrative frame for her account.
</P>
<P>
   But money, the acquisition of vast sums of it for the firm and
its partners (along with the occasional losses of large amounts as
well), is the underlying subject here, the true thread of a story
of American business.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy thing to write a lively and informed
institutional history, and Ms. Endlich's effort to do so with a
large investment bank is a qualified success. Certainly, the
transformation of an immigrant peddler's operation into a
multibillion-dollar-a-year financial institution is an American
classic, and Ms. Endlich describes its various stages with an
insider's expertise (she was herself a foreign currency trader at
Goldman Sachs before becoming a writer).
</P>
<P>
   The dramatis personae are pretty much all managerial
bureaucrats, men in suits, to whom Ms. Endlich tries valiantly to
impart a sense of individuality and color. There is Robert Rubin's
legendary coolness under fire, for example, or the story of why
everybody called the senior partner Gustave Lehmann Levy ``Gus'' _
``because in the time it took to say ` Levy' he was on to something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most gripping stories, something of a model of the
rags-to-riches variety, is that of Sidney Weinberg, ``the father of
the modern Goldman Sachs,'' Ms. Endlich writes, who went from
cleaning cuspidors and brushing the partners' suits to being named
managing partner after the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, this is an account of competitive business
practices, calculations of risk, technical innovations and the
search for profits in the world of high finance, and these can come
across as surprisingly colorless to outsiders. Ms. Endlich writes a
bit too much in the rhetorical style of the financial world,
lapsing often into a kind of bureaucratic vernacular that, to a
nonspecialist like myself at any rate, gives more the illusion of
explanation than the reality of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unsuccessful bill tender (in which the central bank sells
short-term bills) by the Bank of England in July sent shock waves
through the market,'' Ms. Endlich writes at one point, explaining
the background to a serious loss suffered by the company in the
currency futures market. For one who does not grasp why an
unsuccessful bill tender would cause such ``shock waves'' (in
itself an overused metaphor) this is not a satisfying sentence, and
there are many others like it in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Endlich holds the reader's interest, in part because
money is interesting and in part because risk-taking financing has
its moments of high drama. Ms. Endlich details the creation of new
businesses by Goldman Sachs and explains the company's successes
and failures. Some of the most fascinating passages come as she
describes the company's early rise, helped by its pioneering role
in taking such fledgling companies as Sears Roebuck and Continental
Can public. Later Goldman Sachs developed risk arbitrage (though
again Ms. Endlich's explanation of this tricky business is a bit
too cursory); this was the special area of Rubin, one of Goldman
Sach's brightest stars and now Secretary of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Ms. Endlich's history is devoted to the most
recent decade or so, since the firm's first internal debates about
ending its partnership arrangement and going public. Ms. Endlich
chronicles in close detail the emergence of Goldman Sachs as ``a
global brand name,'' with offices and money-making power all over
the world. In 1992, to give one example of its earning power, the
firm made $200 million in several weeks of betting against the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Endlich describes the company's mistakes and embarrassments
during this heady time. Her account of the firm's implication in
the insider-trading scandals of the 1980s brings up no new or
definitive material, but it covers the essential ground.
</P>
<P>
   A gripping moment is Goldman Sachs' ill-advised relationship
with the highly leveraged British media entrepreneur Robert
Maxwell, a relationship that eventually cost the company some $253
million in out-of-court settlement costs.
</P>
<P>
   As she writes of all this, Ms. Endlich engages more in business
journalism than economic history. Her book is a kind of extended
version of a profile one might read in, say, Fortune or Forbes
magazines. It is workmanlike and informative, but it is also
written so much from within the corporate, money-making ``culture''
that she describes that it seems limited, narrow in its scope and
in its breadth.

A WOULD-BE SEXY SOUL BOY   WITH THE HEART OF A ROCKER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm the honky you love to hate!'' declared Greg
Dulli during the Afghan Whigs' show at the Bowery Ballroom on Feb.
18. It was just one of many times this singer and guitarist waxed
defensive about his status as a post-punk rhythm-and-blues
revivalist.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to his ``black heart,'' noted that some critics call
him ``the white Barry White'' and admitted that ``whenever I hear a
drum machine, I think I'm Prince.'' But Dulli did not magically
change race. He remained a rocker with a familiar cultural
fixation, playing out desires that made this show as perplexing as
it was provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Always known for their interest in black pop, the Whigs have
lately made their debts extravagantly explicit. The group's latest
album, ``1965'' (Columbia), uses lavish horns, keyboards and backup
singers to invoke genre crossers like Stevie Wonder and the Rolling
Stones.
</P>
<P>
   The band littered their show, the first of three, with snippets
of songs by Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Prince and Lauryn Hill. Susan
Marshall and Steve Myers, the touring band's one black member,
added gospel-style backing vocals. Thankfully, Dulli did not rap,
instead sticking to his whisper-to-a-scream singing, more limber
than ever. The band stayed grounded in raw rock, driven by the
force of Rick McCollum's sinuous guitar leads and John Curley's
menacing bass lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most insistent of all was Dulli's contentiousness, ever the
spark of his art. On past albums he confronted sexual love's
frustrations in songs that walked the tightrope between
seductiveness and violation. Now he strictly favors conquest,
although the best cuts on ``1965'' still bear the burden (or gift)
of emotional complexity.
</P>
<P>
   In performance, he muffled his serious side, saying that he just
wanted to ``party.'' Dulli is smart enough to know that his
fantasies are just that; his best songs are wrestling matches with
his limitations, both artistic and personal. On Thursday, however,
he seemed to think such self-awareness prudish.
</P>
<P>
   Dulli genuinely loves black music, and he lavished praise on the
hand-picked opening act, the trumpeter and singer Olu Dara. But
Dulli is evading the questions raised by his mimicry of black
style. At least he made a joke or two about his mack-daddy act, and
his ardor seemed more honest than the cooler, more theatrical
approaches of similarly black-obsessed artists like Jon Spencer and
Beck. He obviously thinks himself closer to sexy soul boys like the
young Mick Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   But Dulli occupies a new historical moment. Miscegenation is
again a hot point in pop, but credible white rappers like Everlast
and mixed-race bands like Rage Against the Machine point to a
genuinely interracial esthetic. In this post-civil-rights context,
old issues of authenticity and appropriation arise. The problems
and the pleasures of crossing racial lines are common knowledge.
Dulli rarely has shied away from the thorny aspects of his
cravings; he needs to face them now. &QL;

(ATTN: N.C.) `OH, YOU KID!': FAST AND LOOSE IN THE AGE OF RAGTIME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not all that surprising that a prancing
quintet in Ku Klux Klan headgear pops up in the middle of the
exuberant romp to ragtime music that Paul Taylor has choreographed
and called ``Oh, You Kid!''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, as is his wont, looks through a dark glass lightly. Some
of his most hilarious pieces are also acerbic critiques of American
society. Bigotry and hypocrisy are his favorite targets; Taylor is
not concerned with the textbook view of his native land but with
the subtext he finds in its cross-stitched samplers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, You Kid,'' given its world premiere by the Paul Taylor
Dance Company at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
here on Thursday night, is the third work commissioned by the
Kennedy Center and the American Dance Festival through the Doris
Duke Millennium Awards for Modern Dance and Jazz Music.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface the piece is sheer and wonderful entertainment, a
genuine celebration of turn-of-century popular music, played live
on this occasion by Rick Benjamin's Paragon Ragtime Orchestra. But
for all its rollicking images and witty choreography, ``Oh, You
Kid!'' carries a warning. Taylor suggests that a tinted photograph
is just that: tinted. His suite of nine dances is sharply evocative
of the vaudeville houses and the boardwalks of the past, from the
1890s to World War I. But within that nostalgic glow, created in no
small part by Jennifer Tipton's lighting, Taylor reminds us that
the era of the Keystone Kops was also the heyday of the KKK.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Taylor's satirical ``From Sea to Shining Sea'' had
the Pilgrim Fathers land on a shaky rock and instantly trample an
Indian chief. ``Oh, You Kid!'' is mellower and on an immediate
level as enjoyable as the other pieces Taylor has created to more
recent popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one wants both to laugh and cry when Lisa Viola dances the
extraordinary solo he has created for her. Astounding in her
tragicomic intensity, she distills all the pathos of the sideshow
entertainer. Even the music, ``That Hindu Rag,'' composed by G.L.
Cobb in 1910, is part of this story of an exploited cooch dancer,
literally thrown on stage to perform fake dances from India.
Taylor's parodistic collage of contortionist moves and robotlike
accelerated head shaking is hilarious, but Ms. Viola, eyes aglow
like burning embers and her head sunk deep into the socket of her
neck, makes us feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other sections, the solo is treated as a number in a
variety show. The music hall conceit is furthered onstage by a
proscenium in the rear. Benjamin, in the pit, conducted with the
gusto one would have heard in a vaudeville house, which is not
surprising since he is an expert on the music played in theaters,
restaurants, hotels and concerts during the ragtime era.
</P>
<P>
   When the Taylor company opens a two-week run at City Center in
Manhattan on March 2, the music will be heard on tape. But this was
the first time a commissioned work in the Duke series for jazz and
modern dance had its premiere at the Kennedy Center. The earlier
premieres, for Pilobolus and the Parsons Dance Company, took place
last summer at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor seems to have been interested initially in the
turn-of-the-century social dances, which were researched for him by
one of his leading dancers, Patrick Corbin. Naturally, the
authentic material becomes stylized and Taylorized. ``Knockout
Drops'' (F.H. Klickman, 1910) is the first number, a fast polka for
dancers with flat or floppy feet who also tiptoe. Andrew Asnes and
Silvia Nevjinsky offer a twist on palm-court tea dances to the
waltz ``Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland'' (Leo Friedman, 1909).
</P>
<P>
   By the third number, ``General Mixup, U.S.A.'' (T.S. Allen,
1905), Taylor switches into satirical gear. The collage of
patriotic tunes has the cast, dressed always in Santo Loquasto's
black and white 1890s bathing outfits, plunging into a movement
collage of salutes, navy dances and fife and drum parades.
</P>
<P>
   Plot and subplot intersect with a comic master's touch in a ``An
Operatic Nightmare'' (Felix Arndt, 1914), where the musical
operatic parodies accompany a silent-film scene. Takehiro Ueyama,
the villain, places his trussed-up Pauline, Maureen Mansfield, on
an invisible railroad track while Ted Thomas, a preacher in Puritan
garb, marries Caryn Heilman to Tom Patrick as their oversize
infant, Andy LeBeau, gets a repeated kick from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The insertion of the Klan follies is jarring at this point, all
the more so because the tone is so lighthearted. Heather Berest
skips in as the Klanswomen rejected by a chorus line of four
mincing Klansmen, whose masculinity is called into question.
</P>
<P>
   The percussion here in ``Drumology'' (H.L. Alford, 1914) is
followed by Ms. Viola's solo and then some mock moping by Kristi
Egtvedt and three women to ``Some Jazz Blues'' ( M.L. Lake, 1917).
Taylor moves away from the bitter undertones into a dance hall
finale. There is a Taylor digest of social dances, accompanied by
``Gold Dust Twins Rag'' (N. Johnson, 1913) and the waltz rhythms of
Jerome Kern's ``Till the Clouds Roll By'' (1917).
</P>
<P>
   A striking end-of-the-day perfume wafts through the final image.
Ms. Tipton's stunning sepia tones catch the dancers in a cluster,
frozen in time.

AN EXPLOSION OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY ON MADISON AVENUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Ill., Conn., N.J.)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week may have been a four-day week for most on
Madison Avenue, thanks to Presidents' Day, but it ended with enough
account activity for a full week _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of blue-chip brands sold by three big advertisers _ the
Pillsbury Co. unit of Diageo P.L.C., the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
and the Citizen Watch Co. of America _ left incumbent agencies on
Friday. Combined billings were estimated at more than $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies were also selected on Friday to handle campaigns for
two new products: a bottled water from the Coca-Cola Co. and a
Godiva line of ice creams from Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream. Specific
information on spending awaits the product introductions; each will
have multimillion-dollar budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Pillsbury decision involved pantry and freezer staples like
Progresso ready-to-serve soups, Toaster Strudel and the Martha
White line of baking products. Pillsbury expanded its relationship
with MacManus Group in New York _ which handles media and
promotional assignments for the company through its Mediavest and
Clarion Marketing and Communications units _ by awarding D'Arcy
Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications advertising assignments with
billings estimated at $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   D.M.B.&AMP; B. picks up the Progresso soups, Totino's pizza and
pizza snacks and what are known as the Pillsbury breakfast brands:
Toaster Strudel, Toaster Scrambles and other frozen products to
come. The pizzas and breakfast brands had been at the San Francisco
office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, a unit of True North
Communications, which is now eliminated from the Pillsbury agency
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Progresso had been handled by Nelson-Henry in Minneapolis, which
will work for Pillsbury on special projects, said Terry Thompson, a
company spokesman in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Martha White brands _ including flour, grits, corn meal and
muffin mixes _ were reassigned from Nelson-Henry to the Leo Burnett
Co. in Chicago, the lead Pillsbury agency with billings estimated
at more than $100 million from brands like Pillsbury baking
products, Green Giant vegetables and Old El Paso Mexican foods.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the second time around for DMB&AMP;B on Progresso,
which is now being advertised with a campaign from Nelson-Henry
that takes humorous jabs at the brand's primary rival, the
Campbell's line of soups sold by the Campbell Soup Co.. The St.
Louis office of DMB&AMP;B handled Progresso from early 1995, when a
Diageo predecessor, Grand Metropolitan, bought the brand's previous
owner, Pet Inc., until December 1997, when the agency and Pillsbury
then mutually agreed to end their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of such agreements to disagree, Bristol-Myers Squibb
and Intuition Group in New York, a unit of WPP Group P.L.C.,
mutually agreed to end a contract under which Intuition had handled
several Clairol hair-care products with billings estimated at $35
million. The brands are: Loving Care, Natural Instincts,
Revitalique and Ultress.
</P>
<P>
   Agency plans for the brands are undetermined at this time, said
Colleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for Clairol in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   WPP opened Intuition in November 1997 as an agency specializing
in products aimed at women. The Clairol account was relinquished by
a WPP sibling, J. Walter Thompson New York, freeing Thompson to
handle a new Thermasilk line of hair-care products sold by
Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Clairol assignments leaves Intuition with only
project work for clients, whom Mary Churchill, a spokeswoman,
declined to identify. The loss was foreshadowed three weeks ago
when Clairol shifted a big brand, Nice 'n Easy hair color, with
billings estimated at more than $20 million, from Intuition to
another roster agency, Kaplan Thaler Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Citizen Watch involved the creative and media
portions of its North American account, which had been handled by
the New York office of DMB&AMP;B since December 1992. Those
assignments, with billings estimated at $15 million, are leaving
for Deutsch Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nicholson, vice president for advertising and marketing
services at Citizen Watch in Lyndhurst, N.J., said that the
decision came after a three-month review in which DMB&AMP;B declined to
take part. The review was narrowed to Deutsch and two other
finalists: DDB Needham New York, part of the DDB Needham Worldwide
unit of Omnicom Group, and Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York, part of
the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch was selected, Nicholson said, on the basis of ``its
ability to develop really smart creative work and strategic
thinking in the arena of fashion and retail'' for clients like Foot
Locker, Ikea and Mitsubishi. A campaign from Deutsch may begin
appearing during the 1999 U.S. Open tennis tournament, he added;
Citizen Watch is a tournament sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the new products, Coca-Cola assigned the bottled
water brand, to be called Dasani (duh-SAW-nee), to Berlin Cameron &AMP;
Partners in New York, a roster shop that handles soft drinks like
Diet Sprite, Fresca and Mello Yello.
</P>
<P>
   Dasani, to be available before the summer, will be sold in light
blue plastic bottles. It marks an entry into the thriving North
American bottled-water market for Coca-Cola, which already sells
another such brand, Bonaqua, in about 35 countries overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is expanding its product offerings beyond soft drinks
as consumers demonstrate demand for beverages like water, iced tea
and juices. The principal Coca-Cola rival, the Pepsi-Cola Co. unit
of Pepsico Inc., waded into water in 1997 with Aquafina, which has
become the leading bottled brand sold in convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending to introduce Aquafina totaled $3.9 million,
according to Competitive Media Reporting in New York, a unit of VNU
N.V., then was cut back; spending for 1998 totaled $447,000 through
November.
</P>
<P>
   And Dreyer's expanded its agency roster by assigning the new
Godiva ice cream line to Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners in New York,
majority owned by the MDC Communications Corporation.
Margeotes/Fertitta handles advertising for the Godiva confectionery
products sold by the Godiva Chocolatier unit of Campbell Soup;
Dreyer's will produce the ice cream under a licensing agreement
with Godiva.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Margeotes,'' said Kevin George, marketing director
at Dreyer's in Oakland, Calif., because the agency's executives
have ``done such a great job on the parent brand.'' The
introductory campaign will use national print and outdoor
advertising, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Godiva ice cream, due in supermarkets next month, will be an
``ultra-premium'' product, George said, selling for about $3.19 for
a 12.5-ounce package. The six flavors will include pecan caramel
truffle, Belgian dark chocolate and white chocolate raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   The Godiva brand is separate from a line of expensive ice creams
to be introduced later this year with a campaign by Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco, a unit of Omnicom. The
company's principal brands, sold under the Dreyer's and Edy's
names, are handled by Goldberg Moser O'Neill in San Francisco,
majority owned by Interpublic.

 (ATTN: Col., Mont., Calif., Ariz., Mo.)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Cohen had an idea for a sure-fire Internet money maker: He
would design a Web page around Lemon Boy, a cartoon environmental
hero he dreamed up, and use to it sell Lemon Boy-themed watches at
$19 a pop _ $10 more than the watches would cost him.
</P>
<P>
   But like any Web entrepreneur worth his bits, Cohen, ran the
idea past a New York consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's guru, Harry Lowenstein, convinced him that the chances
of enough people stumbling onto the page, then clicking on the
watch icon, and then wanting to pay $19 for a watch, were awfully
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry intrinsically understood the Web's limitations,'' said
Cohen, who at Lowenstein's urging is drastically overhauling plans
for his Lemon Boy Web site.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable is not that Cohen, 31, heeded the consultant _
but that his Web adviser, Lowenstein, is a 79-year-old former owner
of a furniture manufacturing company, who retired long before
anybody coined the term ``E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not news when retired people are pulled into the computer
age by a desire to e-mail their grandchildren or check their stock
portfolios on the Internet. But Lowenstein is one of 12,400 members
of Score, the Service Corps of Retired Executives, a group with 389
chapters around the nation that offer free guidance to
entrepreneurs. Score's members, recognizing that they cannot bill
themselves as small-business experts without fully understanding
what the Internet has added to the party, have immersed themselves
in the nuances of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some old folks sit around and talk about their ailments,''
said Abraham Kaplan, a retired investment banker who belongs to
Score's New York City chapter. ``Well, we now all talk about our
computer problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, Score has tried to steep its
counselors in computerese. Score chapters have brought in guest
speakers to talk about using the Internet for promotions, sales and
researching the competition. Many have installed networks of
computers with Internet access and hired consultants to teach
counselors to use them. Score's headquarters in Washington soon
will distribute a brochure about the ways the Internet affects new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Score's two-year-old Web page (www.Score.org) guides would-be
clients to the closest Score office and even offers hot links to a
few sites, including the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is letting clients, through the Web page, ask advice of
Score members via e-mail. So far, 544 counselors have listed their
key skills _ tax law, say, or the textiles trade _ in Score's
electronic data bank. When a client e-mails a question, the
computer searches the data base for an electronic match between the
query and a counselor's stated skills. Robert Souza, the retired
economist who administers the e-mail counseling system from
Honolulu, says Score handles about 3,000 e-mail queries a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing beats face-to-face counseling, and you can't learn to
write a complex business plan through e-mail,'' Souza said. ``But
it eliminates telephone tag, and it lets people ask and answer
questions from home, at any time of day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   It also lets them tap into a national network of experts. Ervin
Simon, chairman of Score's Colorado Springs chapter, tells of a
woman who runs a hot-dog stand in a small Montana city _ a long
drive from the nearest Score office _ who wants to base a business
on her sauerkraut relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped with her business plan, a Southeastern patent lawyer
helped with her trademark, and a California woman who had been in
food manufacturing counseled her on that,'' Simon said. ``E-mail
pulled our whole network together for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The same system kept Daniel Adamovich from making what might
have been a disastrous business move last year. Adamovich, a
52-year-old retired Air Force pilot then living in St. Louis,
e-mailed Simon for advice on how to start a 1950s-theme restaurant
in Colorado Springs, where he hoped to move. Simon asked a Score
colleague who had been a restaurateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``They persuaded me that restaurants were too tough a business
for someone without experience,'' Adamovich recalled. So, in June,
Adamovich, who always had enjoyed tinkering with computers, opened
a Computer Renaissance franchised store in Flagstaff, Ariz.
(Colorado Springs already had one), where he fixes old computers
and assembles and sells new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail setup has its limitations. There are no pull-down
menus for helping clients navigate the 600 key skills listed in the
data base. A lot of counselors refuse to use the e-mail system
because _ having come of age in a business world where presidents
presided and secretaries typed _ they have poor keyboard skills.
</P>
<P>
   But Score's headquarters executives are betting that training
and time will raise the counselors' comfort level. ``Our goal is to
develop a truly comprehensive computerized list of every
counselor's skills, one that all counselors can tap into whenever a
client asks a question they cannot answer themselves,'' said W.
Kenneth Yancey Jr., Score's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But there is sometimes a gulf between the requisite will and the
necessary skill _ as Lisa Sykes discovered six months ago, when she
volunteered to show Score's 38 counselors in New York City how to
operate their chapter's new computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to show them what the system can do, and a third of
them are saying, `What do you call this little thing, a mouse?' or
`Where did you say the on button is?''' recalled Ms. Sykes, who is
28. ``Half of them hadn't even seen Score's Web site!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Sykes, a principal of the consulting firm of Miller Sykes
New Media Services, originally had volunteered a couple of hours a
week, assuming she herself could pick up some business tips in the
process. But demand for her services was such that, about two
months ago, Score began paying her to come in about eight hours a
week to conduct one-on-one tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sykes notes that her pupils are not always cheerful
gleaners. Most of the Score counselors were bosses for much of
their careers, and are used to being the source of guidance and
knowledge, not the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But she says the breakthroughs have been heartening. ``One man
found a CD-ROM with sample business plans on it, and his reaction
was, `What am I supposed to do with this thing?''' Ms. Sykes
recalled. ``Now he knows how a CD reader works, he's asking the
publisher's permission to print out sample plans for clients, and
he's looking for Web sites that offer similar things.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys survived mainframe computers, fax machines,
calculators, lots of revolutionary technologies that became vital
tools of business,'' she said. ``It'll be like that with the
Internet, too. Once they grasp it in their head, the knowledge will
filter to their guts.'' &QL;

DISPUTED RADIO PLAN LIFTS HOPES IN NAVAJO LAND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.M., La., Nev., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
   On the high desert mesas of the Navajo reservation, known for its
pedestals of sculpted rock, the amenities of modern life are few.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half of the reservation's declining population, which now
numbers 172,000, live in wood-heated houses without indoor
plumbing. Roads are unpaved. There are telephones in fewer than a
quarter of the homes, which are scattered over an area that takes
in portions of four Western states and is roughly the size of West
Virginia. Only the tribal government's health service, in Window
Rock, Ariz., is online.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped for resources and limited in its ability to provide
services to its rural population, the newly elected Navajo
government is turning to a Tin Lizzie medium. The tribal leaders
are among the scores of individuals clamoring for access to the
airwaves on a low-power FM radio signal under a plan the Federal
Communications Commission opened for public comment last month.
</P>
<P>
   Low-power radio could reach an entire population without the
cost or technology headaches of a full-power signal, M. Teresa
Hopkins, information technology coordinator for the Navajo nation's
legislative branch, said at an FCC hearing last month in
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change would relax the regulations to allow new
broadcasters to transmit in areas from 2 miles to 18 miles. There
is need all over the country for micro-radio, said Cheryl A.
Leanza, a lawyer for the Media Access Project, a nonprofit
telecommunications law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed loosening of the FM band has come under attack by
the National Association of Broadcasters and Rep. William J.
Tauzin, R-La., who is chairman of the House subcommittee on
telecommunications. Among the issues the FCC must resolve is
whether to allow low-power stations to sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo plan has raised concerns among local broadcasters.
``We feel it's going to be a real detriment to small-market
radio,'' said Paula M. Maes, executive director of the New Mexico
Broadcasters Association, which has 150 stations in its membership.
She said it was likely even so-called micro-broadcasters would sell
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Divvying up the meager advertising revenue in small towns, where
a 30-second spot sells for as little as $6, will hurt small
broadcasters like Susan Coe, who owns an AM-FM operation in
Lovington, N.M. ``She does the morning show, does the news and in
the afternoon sells ads,'' Ms. Maes said. ``Put a microstation in a
community that small, and one of them will go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maes said the commercial broadcasts that reach into the
reservation provide adequate local information. She pointed out
that four stations provided live broadcasts of the recent state
championship basketball game between top high school girls teams.
``Localism is the key to our success,'' Ms. Maes said.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, a low-power station would seem impractical on
the 25,000-square-mile reservation. Yet economic self-determination
is what underlies Navajo interest. The nation already owns KTNN-AM
and KWRK-FM, a high-power, traditionally run country-western music
station in Window Rock that reaches the reservation and surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins envisions a low-power sister station on the public
radio model, with broadcasts in the Navao language tailored to
concerns like health (diabetes is a major issue), education and
culture. Programming for such a station could be rebroadcast at
school-based stations on the reservation and by Indian centers in
Phoenix, Albuquerque and Los Angeles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The month-old Navajo administration of Kelsey A. Begaye has
pledged to develop a digital infrastructure, and low-power radio is
a first step. ``We see it bridging the gap,'' Ms. Hopkins said.
``Because we don't have technology on the reservation, it's hard to
attract business. We have to educate people about what technology
means.''

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The seed of the triumphant new 50th-anniversary
revival of ``Death of a Salesman'' took root in the fall of 1997 in
downtown Chicago. Robert Falls, the artistic director of the
Goodman Theater, was walking to dinner with Brian Dennehy, the
actor with whom he had collaborated on three major productions
since 1986, when he noticed his friend was limping. The physical
imperfection suggested a frailty that Falls had never seen in
Dennehy, and at that moment a casting decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd re-read the play recently,'' Falls said during a joint
interview with Dennehy just before opening night of the New York
production this month. ``But I'd been thinking, `Brian's too vital,
too energetic, too larger than life.' But his knees were bothering
him, and he was hobbling along and he was getting ready to turn 60.
And I thought, `Jesus Christ, I can see him as Willy Loman.' I
called him a week later and I said, `We're going to do `Death of a
Salesman.' And he said, `That's a great idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I said. I said, `We've done all these plays
nobody knows. We want to do a play everybody knows?' But I said
what I always say to Bob, which is `OK' &UR;  &LR; '' He paused for a belly
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now January or February rolls around,'' Dennehy continued.
``And even my crummy jobs have dried up. So I call him and I say,
`What am I doing? I don't have any money and I'm facing this
operation on my knees.' And he says to me, `You mean to tell me
you're crippled and you're broke and you're going to play Willy
Loman? That's perfect!'''
</P>
<P>
   Falls finished for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Brian, you're going to hit the stage and be so
sympathetic they'll be weeping.' And he said, `Yeah, my accountant
and my lawyer, that's who'll be weeping.'''
</P>
<P>
   Falls was the prescient one. When the show played in Chicago
last fall, Dennehy gave what Ben Brantley of The New York Times
called the performance of his career. His portrayal propelled the
show to Broadway, where it opened at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on
Feb. 10 (50 years to the day that the show first opened on
Broadway) to a sample case full of ebullient reviews. (Vincent
Canby in The Times was a notable exception.) Brantley was among
many critics to cite the collaboration between Falls, the director
who reimagined Arthur Miller's masterpiece about the final undoing
of a misguided man, and the star, who fulfilled Falls' vision of an
interior portrait of Willy's nightmarish breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the day after Falls and Dennehy told their
collective story that Brantley weighed in again. ``I could hear
people around me not just sniffling but sobbing,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The men are an intriguing pair. Enormous, lumbering Irishmen,
both weighing in at over 250 pounds and both buoyed by young
families (Dennehy's second, Falls' first), they are separated by a
generation (Dennehy is 60, Falls 44), by political persuasion
(Falls leans to the left; Dennehy, is, by his own description, a
reactionary) and interestingly, by disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Falls is an energetic optimist, which makes his recent anointing
as the director of the forthcoming Disney musical, ``Aida,'' a
sensible choice, even though his previous Broadway work, most
recently Horton Foote's ``Young Man From Atlanta,'' has been dramas
with limited commercial appeal. Dennehy, who takes his
character-actor persona in movies and mini-series as something of a
workingman's burden, evinces a Loman-esque self-doubt. He shook his
head in self-disparaging comparison as he ticked off the previous
actors _ Lee J. Cobb, George C. Scott, Dustin Hoffman _ who have
essayed Miller's great role on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting problem with Willy Loman,'' Dennehy said,
``the basic problem, is he's not a star, he's ordinary, less than
ordinary in many respects. But it is a star turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls said later, which his friend out of earshot: ``When we
were running in Chicago, Brian said to me, `You know, if it wasn't
for me, this production would be in Broadway in a minute. I'm not
Dustin Hoffman. I'm not George Scott. Am I going to sell any
tickets?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are connected by a passion for restaging classic
plays in the brawny, expressionistic style that has distinguished
Chicago theater for the last quarter century. The friendship has a
fraternity-brother quality, a genuine bond cemented with
profanity-laced endearments, teasing competition (at age 17 Falls
played Willy Loman in a high school production in suburban Chicago:
``Brian's pretty good, but I was damn good,'' he said) and a
penchant for finishing the other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be like talking to George Burns and Gracie Allen,''
Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite, but listen:
</P>
<P>
   Falls: ``I've always thought of Brian as my. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy: ``Sydney Pollack has Robert Redford. Bob Falls has
Brian Dennehy.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls: ``It's actually worse than that. When I was a young
director I always wanted a muse, and when I thought of a muse, it
was always a 17-year-old gorgeous girl. Little did I know Brian
Dennehy would turn into my muse. Anyway, we can always say we shop
at the same place, which is Al's Big and Fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy: ``I always knew that no matter how many posh events I
had to show up at in Chicago, Bob would be worse dressed than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls: ``We're competing for Raymond Burr's old wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They have known each other since 1985, when Falls, then the
artistic director of Wisdom Bridge Theater in Chicago, a small,
adventurous (and now defunct) group, produced Ron Hutchinson's
``Rat in the Skull'' and Dennehy performed in it. In 1986, when
Falls was chosen to lead the Goodman, Chicago's largest and oldest
nonprofit theater, then struggling with a sizable deficit, his
successful strategy for reviving it was to separate the Goodman
from the city's myriad younger groups by putting on large, serious,
expensive plays. His first was Brecht's rarely produced
``Galileo,'' and his only choice for the lead was Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed someone with vitality, intellectual capability, as
well as carnality,'' Falls said. ``This was a guy, Galileo, who was
a thinker, but he's also a pig. A voluptuary. And I've always
described Brian's acting as having that quality. He eats life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy snorted. ``Overeats life,'' he said. ``But seriously,
there are few people in my career _ a ridiculous word for this
series of accidents that has been my life _ that have gotten past
what I look like into something else, this possibility I have for
expression, and Bob is right at the top of the list. My
professional relationship with him is by far the most important one
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in the gaps between the movies (like ``Presumed
Innocent,'' ``Gorky Park'' ``Cocoon'' and ``Semi-Tough'') and
television mini-series that made Dennehy familiar enough to be
confused with Charles Durning and Brian Keith, he has starred at
the Goodman in Falls' productions of the O'Neill epics ``Touch of
the Poet'' and ``The Iceman Cometh,'' which received glowing
notices but never, perhaps because of the dire economics of putting
on such difficult work, a chance at the national spotlight in New
York. ( Dennehy last appeared on Broadway in 1995 in Brian Friel's
``Translations.'') That ``Iceman'' is to arrive on Broadway this
spring, with Kevin Spacey in the central role as Hickey, has
escaped neither man, though they are certainly less rueful with the
lavish greeting that ``Death of a Salesman'' has received.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the new production, both men agree, is Fall's concept
for the play, which was to cast aside the traditional staging, with
the tiny Loman house onstage, dwarfed by the built-up city skyline,
and present the play almost as a dream inside Willy Loman's head.
Miller considered titling the play ``The Inside of His Head,'' so
in a sense, Falls said, he was merely returning to the playwright's
initial intention. The set, by Mark Wendland, with the rooms of the
house appearing and disappearing on a revolving turntable with the
dark depths of the stage looming behind it, underscores Willy's
cheerless imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's experiencing violent emotions,'' Falls said. ``And I
wanted to tell the story from Willy's violent, emotional point of
view. In some ways the O'Neill works are more complicated, harder
emotionally, and drew on the Irish violence that Brian and I
understand. It includes ego, self-loathing and destructiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy put in: ``And impotence.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls continued: ``And epic melancholy. That all really informed
the O'Neill work, which is where our partnership was solidified,
and it was interesting to me to bring that to the world of
Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dennehy's Willy always seems on a tightrope between rage
and despair, a balancing act made more viscerally affecting by his
size, and that distances his performance from the last one on
Broadway, by Hoffman, whose Willy was a fussbudget, his disabling
mental problems evoked by idiosyncratic bits of stage business.
During rehearsals, Dennehy said, when he felt he hadn't figured out
the character, it was Falls' encouragement to proceed without
thinking so much that pushed him to discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good advice,'' Dennehy said. ``Willy is an
instinctive person. He's also having a great problem with his
rationality. The way I see it, what makes Willy's problems
fascinating is the breakdown he's going through. Willy is not
terrified of the world because he believes the world is the same as
he's always believed it is. What scares him is what's happening to
him. He's not in control of it and can't predict it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the reaction to the play, it seems to me, comes from
people who have seen breakdowns, and it becomes possible for an
actor to go for those notes, which have to do with mental illness.
Eventually I had to figure out the route he follows, but I never
got away from this instinctive, reactionary thing he does, the God
he has that tells him, `You're right, you're right, it's not what
you know, it's who you know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who attended rehearsals in New York and appeared onstage
after the opening-night performance, never saw the show in Chicago.
But he blessed the collaboration with an instinct of his own. After
the Goodman obtained the rights to produce the show, Falls said, he
received a letter from Miller, who suggested a British actor,
Warren Mitchell, to play Willy.
</P>
<P>
   Falls recounted calling the playwright as a courtesy: ``I said,
`Warren Mitchell is a wonderful actor, but I've got to tell you,
I'm committed. This is a collaboration with Brian Dennehy.' And he
said _ these were the first words out of his mouth _ `Brian
Dennehy? That's a hell of a good idea!'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Elektra'' has the quality of suddenness. Whether
updated on Broadway, read at home or set to music, Sophocles' play
comes to us as a quick, violent end to a story whose beginning we
know already. Strauss' operatic version, which returned to the
Metropolitan Opera on Friday night, finds apt musical equivalents
for pure theater: with two wildly demonstrative soprano parts and a
dark orchestra sound that bristles with hostility.
</P>
<P>
   In the opera as in the play, there are no intermissions.
``Elektra'' jerks audience members upright from the opening curtain
and propels them along the bloody course set for them. The opera is
scarcely two hours long, barely warm-up time for most of the
standard repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's production by Otto Schenk is 7 years old. Jurgen
Rose's facades create a shallow stage and tilt markedly; objects
and people are given, by and large, a shabby, fractured look. The
high walls and steep steps are not assertive images. Offered is a
credible backdrop for musical events; creative agendas are avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the house's three female principals carry the evening.
Deborah Voigt is in radiant voice as Chrysothemis. Not only is the
singing impregnable in the face of fierce music; the diction is
remarkably clear, the word seeming always to emerge before the
sound. Hanna Schwarz sings Klytamnestra with a wonderful presence
and a chilling vocal beauty. Summoning attention to a single figure
on this big stage is not easy, but here it is done.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriele Schnaut in the title role undoes, I am sorry to say,
much of the good being created around her. The voice is piercing
and tremulous, the apparent victim of one too many bouts with big
dramatic roles. There is no lack of force and size, but every forte
was like a cannon shot and one that usually aimed too high.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the persistent sharpness of pitch represented a singer
afraid of not being heard in a big opera house and pushing
unnecessarily hard. In any case, the coarseness was deeply
disturbing. Allowing Elektra to do her own dancing at the end
served no one well, least of all Ms. Schnaut.
</P>
<P>
   Monte Pederson, the evening's Orest, did very well in his debut.
Kenneth Riegel's Aegisth was appropriately grotesque. Readers must
be tired of hearing how well the Met orchestra plays under James
Levine. Yet how Strauss' orchestra writing could be made to sound
elegant while at the same time projecting grimness and violence was
a considerable feat. Paul Mills directed the revival.

DIGITAL PROJECTORS COULD BRING DRAMATIC CHANGE TO FILM INDUSTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly every facet of the movie industry has been
transformed in recent years by new technologies, from computerized
dinosaurs and other special effects to the collection and analysis
of box office data. But even with all the digital wizardry, motion
picture reels are made through a chemical film process and then
projected onto screens using technology that has changed in the
past century about as much as buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the industry is on the threshold of what many experts say
is a breakthrough that could bring dramatic change to the economics
of movie theaters and to the moviegoing experience itself.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that financial hurdles and industry politics can be
overcome, the potential benefits include silver-screen images free
of lint and scratches, new types of in-theater special effects, and
the ability of theater owners in the heartland to get the same
access to first-run hits as urban cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, movie theaters are expected to begin
installing the first generation of digital projectors. Reels of
35-millimeter film _ which are several feet in diameter and heavy _
would be replaced with electronic projectors that use magnetic tape
or digital disks.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, at a meeting of the National Association of Theater
Owners, two new electronic projectors _ one by Texas Instruments
that relies on a chip with more than a million tiny mirrors, and a
competing technology using what is called a light valve produced by
Hughes-JVC _ will demonstrate what they can do. The same
four-minute film clip will be shown on each of the new projectors,
as well as a traditional 35-millimeter projector.
</P>
<P>
   If several demonstrations here recently are a guide, the
exhibitors will observe a quality that is sharp, with colors as
rich and as warm as the most pristine film prints and without the
usual jittery frames, scratchy soundtracks and blotches of dust
that often mar the much-used theater prints.
</P>
<P>
   The theater owners are expected to witness, in short, the birth
of ``electronic cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology now exists to build the projectors,'' said Doug
Darrow, the manager for market and business development of the
electronic projector business of Texas Instruments. ``The real
issues are economics and emotion. The studios have to say, `We want
to make this change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Singleton, the president of American Multi-Cinemas Inc., a
chain with 236 theaters, added, ``We can't wait for the day when
we're unshackled from the 35-millimeter prints. But conversion is
first and foremost the biggest problem to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners insist that the costs of installing the new
projectors, which are expected to cost roughly $100,000 for each
system, compared with about $30,000 or so for a conventional
projection booth, will have to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives generally agree, but are wary of even
discussing the issue openly for fear they could taint what are
likely to be long and difficult negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look it, there's going to have to be some studio subsidy of
the installation of these projectors,'' said one senior studio
executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
``Until we know exactly how that will work, I'm not willing to say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What no one doubts is the benefits the new systems will create.
For one, the studios will no longer have to create and ship
thousands of reels of film. Each print costs in the neighborhood of
$2,000, and a major film requires as many as 5,000 prints. Those
costs would all but vanish under the new systems, in which entire
movies could be sent to theaters through a satellite signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands, most of the savings would go to the studios and
the costs would go to the theater owners,'' said William F.
Kartozian, the president of the National Association of Theater
Owners. ``Obviously, this will have to be a cooperative effort.
Unless it's good for everybody it's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of quality and consistency. In the
process of making prints from a master the copies lose some
vitality, in the form of a softer focus and less vibrant colors.
Films begin to show serious wear after 30 or so screenings, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic cinema would do away with many of those problems.
Movies would still be shot, and edited, on traditional
35-millimeter film, and the end-product would be at least initially
on film. Then, using a machine called a telecine, the digitized
print would be made, and every subsequent digital copy would be a
perfect replica. There would be no wear and tear from each showing.
</P>
<P>
   The image that people see in the theaters will still be cast by
a projector upon a screen. But instead of the projector producing
the image by shining a bright light through a strip of film, the
new, digital projector would be generating the image from data
stored as computer code _ the way an audio CD player or the new
home-video DVD disk players translate digital data into sounds and
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into one demonstration where the only way I could tell
the difference between the film and the electronic version was that
the film one had that jittery movement and the electronic one
didn't,'' said Martin Cohen, the head of post-production at
Dreamworks SKG. ``They are down to the nitty-gritty. They're
finally in the ball park on the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, digital movies are likely to be delivered to
theaters in the form of electronic tapes or disks. Eventually,
however, they are expected to be delivered via satellite, then
stored on a server in the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect excites some theater owners. Currently, theaters
in big cities tend to get the first prints available of popular
movies and cinemas in smaller towns must wait days or even weeks.
The new system could deliver the new films simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   It also means films could be switched and juggled instantly. If
a movie is doing well, a multiplex cinema could add showings to its
other screens with the click of a mouse rather than having to wait
days for the delivery of new prints.
</P>
<P>
   The language in which movies are shown could be switched
instantly, if different sound tracks are provided. A theater near
an Hispanic neighborhood, for instance, could schedule showings of
the same film in Spanish and in English at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional systems already use digital sound, and generally
have 6 tracks available for the audio portion of the movie; the new
systems could handle 12 audio channels. Those additional channels
would permit innovations that could dramatically alter the movie
experience. There could be everything from sound from above, behind
and below the audiences to programs in which a digital signal
engages devices that shake the seats on cue or even emit smells
into the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The new projectors could project screens images with the quality
of high-definition digital television. They could, for example, do
pay-per-view showings of prize fights, concerts or other live
events.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also major questions. It is currently estimated
that the studios lose perhaps $3 billion a year or more to illegal
copying of films. Most of the studios fear that, if movies are sent
to theaters through a satellite transmission, cyberthieves might be
able to intercept the signal and steal a perfect copy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is an issue that Cinecomm Digital Camera, one of the
companies trying to break into the business, believes it has
solved. Cinecomm is a new company jointly owned by Qualcomm Inc.,
which produces telecommunications equipment, and Hughes-JVC, a unit
of JVC of Japan that manufactures a digital projector. Qualcomm has
said it is bringing to the new company a sophisticated technology
for encrypting the movie transmission that is all but unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to eliminate that $2.5 billion a year or so of
piracy, but you're going to put a big dent in it,'' said Gary
Garland, the vice president of business development at Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest issues is who will control that
transmission to the theaters, and what it will cost.
</P>
<P>
   Cinecomm claims to have solved this question, too. It intends to
provide one stop shopping by providing the satellite uplink
facilities, the dishes for the theaters, the systems for encrypting
and compressing the transmissions, then decrypting them, and the
projectors, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to avoid the huge capital costs of removing the old
projectors and installing the new ones, Cinecomm said it intended
to bear all the initial costs itself. To cover these costs, it will
charge the theaters a fee based on the number of showings of each
movie.
</P>
<P>
   That all-in-one package makes many of the studios nervous,
however. The system would make the studios and the theater owners
dependent on a single supplier, and it would place a gatekeeper
between the distributors and the movie exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the buzz word: gatekeeper,'' said one studio executive.
``We won't permit a gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Williams, the president of the digital studio division of
Sony Pictures Entertainment, a major player in this field, said:
``Everyone acknowledges that the digitized image will have to be
encrypted, but no system has been accepted or endorsed by any of
the major studios. No one is going to put their faith in anyone who
has a proprietary black box. It has to be an open system.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinecomm waves off such concerns. ``There's certainly a concern
that anytime you have a single supplier you have questions,''
commented Michael Targoff, the chairman and chief executive of
Cinecomm. ``We have answers to all those questions. We're not
trying to get anyone in a position they don't want to be in.''

TURKISH PREMIER SAYS CHANGE POSSIBLE IF REBELS END VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Sunday that
Turkey could consider changing its policies toward the Kurdish
minority if the Kurdish guerrilla movement were to lay down its
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when conditions become more conducive to solving
certain problems, then new approaches may prevail,'' Ecevit said at
a news conference. ``A substantial decrease in terrorism would be
conducive to improvements and reforms in the social, economic and
political life of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders have for years been asking Turkish authorities
to grant Kurds broader cultural and political rights. Many foreign
governments have endorsed their appeals. Turkey has rejected them,
however, fearing that any concessions would encourage separatist
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been brought back to the forefront of public
debate in the wake of last week's capture of the principal Kurdish
rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan. A Turkish commando squad seized him
in Kenya, where he was living under the protection of Greek
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials, commentators and others have been offering
opinions about how their country can best take advantage of this
moment to end separatist violence once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autonomy is out of the question,'' Ecevit said Sunday. He also
ruled out any talks with either guerrilla leaders or their civilian
supporters. But he noted that many Kurds are serving in the Turkish
Parliament and said that he is ready to listen to their
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Any such suggestions, he quickly added, could be considered only
after an end to violence by the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party,
Ocalan's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' he said, ``public opinion is very sensitive
because every day our soldiers are being killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit did not say precisely what reforms he would favor, but he
asserted that the fundamental problem in the Kurdish region ``is
due to its feudal past.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Kurdish region, which lies in eastern and
southeastern Turkey, are still dominated by clan leaders who rule
according to traditions that are centuries old. Some keep women in
seclusion, enforce tribal codes by threat of violence, and consider
themselves virtual owners of groups of villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have addressed the issue from an economic, social and
educational angle,'' he said. ``As these parts of Turkey are
economically and socially developed, peace will prevail and
terrorists of any kind would not find any suitable atmosphere for
their acts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If terrorism decreases visibly, then it will become much
easier for us to take steps in the way of improving the economic,
social and political and educational problems of the country. I
can't foretell at the moment and I can't engage myself at the
moment in any such steps, beyond the stress that we have put on
economic and social development and education.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if young people ``entrapped'' by the rebel
movement realize that they are engaged in a futile action, if they
``leave terroristic acts and reincorporate themselves in the normal
life of the country, then things would become much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has proposed a ``law of repentance'' that would entitle
rebel fighters to pardons or reduced sentences if they surrender,
but the law has not yet been approved by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have often blamed Kurdish violence on foreign
countries, and today Ecevit laid much blame on Greece. He said
Greek efforts to protect Ocalan showed ``an unseemly attitude that
doesn't become an ally.''
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting European pressure on Turkey to grant autonomy or
self-rule to Kurdish regions, Ecevit said such pressure stems from
``subconscious traditions of racism in Europe that still exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concept of differences between Turks and Kurds,''
he said. ``I have formed governments several times, and it never
occurred to me to ask the ethnic origin of the members of Cabinets
that I would choose. Sometimes I would learn just by chance that
such-and-such a member of the government was of Kurdish origin.
This doesn't concern us at all. But this is very difficult to
explain to European public opinion.''

afford to finish their house. They are property owners, but they
are deeply disappointed in the new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   They still live in their old shack, which they have moved to
their new plot, hoping that their presence will keep thieves from
stealing their toilet, as has happened to other families nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not voting this time because things are worse now,'' said
Ms. Novula, who sometimes runs out of food for her two children and
asks Ms. Madima for help. ``Before it was possible to be finding
jobs, but now there is not even piecework. I thought that we would
have things now, but we have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As South Africa approaches its second post-apartheid election in
May, the giddy feeling of triumph that dominated the elections in
1994 is all but history. These days, South Africans are acutely
aware of the hard realities they face in remaking a society that
systematically kept the majority of the population uneducated and
poor. And despite progress like the skeleton houses, grumbling can
be heard all over. Ms. Novula is not alone in seeing the glass as
half empty.
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress party is
expected to win again easily. But much of that support appears to
have more to do with loyalty than with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa
indicates that there is widespread unhappiness among South Africa's
40 million citizens. The poll indicated that more South Africans
believed the country was going in the wrong direction than believed
it was going in the right direction. Just after the 1994 elections,
similar surveys registered overwhelming optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994 we had sentiment and ideals,'' said Justice Malala, a
political columnist for one of South Africa's largest weekly
papers, the Sunday Times. ``Now, we just have the hard slog.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has certainly had its successes. And given that
no African National Congress official had ever had experience in
running a country, the accomplishments are impressive. In the last
five years, political violence has been drastically reduced. More
than 3 million people now have access to clean water who did not
have it before. Power lines stretch through even the most dismal
squatter camps. Millions more have access to telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The country has adopted the world's most liberal constitution
and has passed an avalanche of legislation that has tackled far
more than racial inequality _ the use of mercenaries, women's
rights, smoking and tobacco advertising, and working conditions,
even for domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these victories are still symbolic and have not been
enforced. Most maids still work without contracts and far beyond
the 48-hour-a-week limit. White farmers still own most of the land.
In small towns, some restaurants still refuse to serve blacks.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of people cannot afford to pay for their new access to
electricity and water. Even Ms. Madima, for instance, who works as
a part-time saleswoman and whose husband is a part-time security
guard, has not paid her water bill for more than a year though she
says she will soon, when her house is furnished.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors continue to dominate almost every aspect of life in
South Africa: crime and unemployment. Despite South African
economic policies that have been lauded by the West, the country's
economy has grown very slowly. Some experts believe that South
African companies, adjusting to global competition and difficulties
in the mining industry, have trimmed 500,000 jobs since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate may be as high as 40 percent, and interest
rates are well over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's crime rate is among the highest in the world.
Whole neighborhoods are fenced in, and it is not unusual to see
guards with pump action shotguns pacing the driveways of private
homes. People commuting to work sometimes find their rides
interrupted by armored car robberies with the kinds of high-powered
machine guns and explosives usually seen only on battle fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The schools are little better than they used to be, and
corruption is a frequent topic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, black and white residents seem to be hardening their
attitudes toward each other. Many black South Africans believe
whites are not behind true transformation. And many white South
Africans see their way of life dissolving because of poor
management. Both sides are quick to cry ``racism,'' and public
arguments involving executives, government officials and academics
are frequent and brutal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, the sports minister has been locked in a
battle with the cricket league, threatening to force the league to
accept racial quotas unless it puts more black players on the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the overwhelmingly white national rugby team won
the World Cup, Mandela, with his unerring sense of the grand
gesture, donned the captain's shirt and encouraged black South
Africans to cheer the team _ and they did.
</P>
<P>
   But those good feelings dissolved quickly. Before the fight over
cricket, there was an even uglier tussle after Mandela set up a
commission to look into corruption and nepotism in rugby. After a
challenge by the rugby league, he was forced to testify in court
about his decision-making, the first time a sitting president has
ever had to do so.
</P>
<P>
   These days, even the usually conciliatory Mandela seems short of
patience. Not long ago, told how many whites were emigrating,
apparently in part because of the crime rate, he heaped scorn on
them. ``We are convinced that the real South Africans are being
sorted out in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the battles may be unavoidable. In the past, the country
was polarized over the clear issues of freedom and human rights.
Today the country is mired in the far fuzzier issues surrounding
reconstruction, transformation and reconciliation. There is not
even any agreement on what the goals are in each of these areas,
let alone how to get there. And the lack of job growth means that
everyone is fighting over the same limited pool of jobs. For blacks
to advance, whites must fall back.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics indicate that a small group of black South Africans
is in fact advancing. A black middle &UR; - &LR; class is emerging and doing
well. With a shortage of educated blacks, those who have skills can
often command 30 percent more than a white person for doing the
same job.
</P>
<P>
   But one recent survey indicated that black residents, who make
up about 79 percent of the population, still only had about 6
percent of the management jobs. The survey by the Breakwater
Monitor, a Cape Town University project, which looked at 153
companies, found that most of the black managers worked for a
relatively small number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after long and heated debate the country passed an
``employment equity'' bill, which is designed to force large
companies to develop affirmative action programs. Many whites feel
betrayed by the bill, but most blacks say it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Manyi, who is on the board of directors of the Black
Management Forum an association of 3,500 black business people,
said that just before the 1994 elections, executives rated
affirmative action their No. 1 priority. By 1996 it was way down
the list, replaced by ``global competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of racism here,'' said Manyi. ``Whites
want change, not transformation. They want to give out the crumbs.
Without the affirmative action bill to force progress, nothing
would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are also making inroads through so-called ``black
empowerment'' deals. Some involve important government licenses
that are reserved for bidders with at least some black partners _
for casinos, a television network and radio stations, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, many civic-minded corporations have sold
blocks of their stock to blacks at below-market prices. A year ago,
one study indicated that 10 percent of the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange was controlled by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, some economists are skeptical about whether that was an
accurate picture, since the stock is usually the collateral for
loans taken to buy it. Furthermore, the market dropped last year,
giving lenders reason to call in their loans. The forum is studying
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have African names, these companies, but investigate how
black they are and you will find that probably the real number is 2
or 3 percent control,'' Manyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Manyi does not blame the government for the country's
difficulties. He says it is doing ``OK.'' He is not alone, although
like many other blacks he is dissatisfied with the speed of change.
</P>
<P>
   Many whites, however, see things spiraling rapidly out of
control. They say that the government has betrayed them and that
instead of ``reconciliation,'' they are now facing discrimination
and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Serobro, a homemaker with two children who lives in
Johannesburg's white suburbs, says the country has disintegrated
with amazing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing violence, she and her husband, who owns and manages real
estate, went to the United States during the 1994 elections. When
the elections were peaceful, they came home, made a decision to
stay, and built their dream house, even if _ with electrified
fencing, video cameras at the gate and a guard at the end of the
street _ it is something of a fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Serobro is not feeling optimistic these days. She believes
the more than $40 million spent by the country's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission trying to put the apartheid past to rest
should have been spent on housing or schools. She objects to
Mandela's frequent trips abroad when there is so much to be done
here, and she resents a 300 percent increase in her taxes when she
said she sees more and more potholes in her neighborhood and raw
sewage down the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot more hopeful in 1994 than I am now,'' she said.
``I thought they would do things for the country not for
themselves. They have done the same as what all black governments
do, which is take as much money as they can for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Mrs. Serobro has no intention of leaving. She no longer
fears civil war _ just the slow unraveling of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going the way of Zimbabwe,'' is a phrase heard over and
over again from white South Africans.

   SCHOOL-DISCIPLINE _ The controversial centerpiece of Gov. Roy
Barnes' student discipline bill _ giving teachers more power to
remove disruptive students _ addresses a problem that most critics
and even supporters agree only occurs where leadership or resources
are sadly lacking. Specifically, the bill could force the principal
to find another place for a disruptive student when a teacher wants
to kick the student out of class. It's a rare situation, most
educators acknowledge, but it can happen, they say. (Cuming,

 KAGISO EXTENSION 13, South Africa: South Africans.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politically, the country is still divided largely along racial
lines, although the only new party, the United Democratic Movement,
is multiracial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent assassination of a top official of this
party, an explosion of political violence is considered unlikely
this election year. White right-wing extremists have all but faded
away. Polls indicate their political parties have minimal support.
</P>
<P>
   And the African National Congress appears to be succeeding in
ending its long and bloody rivalry with the Zulu-based Inkhatha
Freedom Party. The governing party has, some South Africans say,
hugged Inkhatha to death.
</P>
<P>
   There is much speculation that the ANC leadership will offer the
head of Inkhatha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the post of deputy
president if the ANC wins the next elections. Buthelezi, 70, has
regularly been filling in as president when both Mandela and Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki have been out of the country and appears to
enjoy that role. Mbeki is all but assured the job of president,
with Mandela's having said for years that he would not run for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   As South Africans contemplate the elections, the question is not
so much who will win but by how much. The ANC wants more than the
handy majority predicted by polls, and the campaign mud-slinging is
already fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mandela has joined in. At the annual dinner for foreign
correspondents in late November, he lashed out at ``Mickey Mouse
white parties'' that he said are ``apparently opposed to
transformation'' in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are traditional white parties in this country that are
blocking our programs to better the lives of our people,'' he said.
``We cannot tolerate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Leon, chairman of the largely white-supported liberal
Democratic Party, which always condemned apartheid and appears to
have gained considerable ground lately, shot back. He said that
Mandela was the head of ``a goofy government that has failed to
deliver on even its most minimal promises to the electorate.'' He
also criticized Mandela for making race an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Having received more than 62 percent of the vote last time, the
ANC already has the power to pass any bill it wants in Parliament.
But the ANC wants a two-thirds majority, which would also give it
the power to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some ANC officials maintain that they do not intend to alter the
constitution, which they helped write. But other key officials have
said they want the ability to review the powers of various
independent watchdog agencies. Opposition parties have used these
statements as arguments that they should get votes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opposition parties are jostling over what will
undoubtedly be a distant second place. The National Party, which
brought South Africa apartheid, got about 22 percent of the vote in
1994 but is in disarray, and polls indicate that its support may be
hovering between 8 and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties gaining ground are Leon's party, which has been
a very visible and successful critic of the Mandela administration,
and the United Democratic Movement. Both appear to be taking voters
from the former National Party, and to a lesser extent from both
the African National Congress and the Inkhatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   The United Democratic Movement was formed by a former ANC
official, Bantu Holomisa, and a former National Party official,
Roelf Meyer, and remains somewhat ill defined. It says it will push
for a referendum on restoring capital punishment and that it will
try to abolish affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its main appeal, however, seems to be the combination of
Holomisa, a lively speaker, and Meyer, the white former
heir-apparent of the National Party who was its chief negotiator in
writing the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that many South Africans have been sitting on the
fence, proving more independent than analysts had predicted,
expecting them to be slavishly devoted ANC supporters for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy and Maki Rapoo, for years loyal backers of the African
National Congress, are among them. They lived on the front lines of
a battle zone between the ANC and the Zulu-based party in Soweto
during the early 1990s. But they held their ground. Nowadays, Mrs.
Rapoo says she is not sure whom she will vote for.
</P>
<P>
   After the elections, the Rapoos moved, buying a lot in a former
``dead zone'' and building a new house for themselves. It has tiled
floors and lace curtains and a matching living room set protected
with plastic.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapoo, a sales representative for a chicken company, says
his business is worse than it has ever been. His wife says she is
afraid to sit in her own living room and watch television at night
because a bullet might come through the window. And then there are
the flies. The empty lot next door is full of garbage. The Rapoos
feel their City Council member is inaccessible and unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rapoo says she could never vote for a white person _ ``he
could not know me.'' But she is considering voting for Bantu
Holomisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see _ maybe,'' she said.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREE TO REDUCE RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ The prime ministers of India and Pakistan
pledged Sunday to take immediate steps to reduce the risk of
nuclear war and seek solutions to a half-century of raging
disputes, including their most volatile source of discord, the
conflict in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements between the world's newest nuclear powers were
announced in two signed documents and a joint statement, all issued
at the end of a historic weekend bus trip to Pakistan by Atal
Behari Vajpayee, the first Indian prime minister to visit the
country in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after the two nations tested their bombs, their
leaders spoke truculently of each other as both populations
celebrated a sort of nuclear euphoria. Now, eight and a half months
later, the two prime ministers amiably sat side by side exchanging
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must bring peace to our people,'' Pakistan's prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, said at a joint press conference in the
elegant mansion of the governor of Punjab. ``We must bring
prosperity to our people. We owe this to ourselves and to future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere of the summit meeting was decidedly cordial
_ and the very act of their meeting extraordinary _ there had been
some expectation of a monumental breakthrough, such as a joint
agreement to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had earlier mentioned a ``no first use,'' pact on
nuclear weapons, though that would have disadvantaged the
Pakistanis who have achieved strategic parity. On the other hand,
the Pakistanis had discussed a ``no war'' treaty, which would have
protected them against the superior conventional forces of a foe
they have been defeated by three times.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agreements were long on good intentions and short
on details. The two countries mostly talked about how they would
continue to talk, listing areas for discussion: the liberalizing of
visa rules, coordinating trade positions, releasing prisoners and
detainees.
</P>
<P>
   A ``memorandum of understanding,'' was presented, the nations
promising to build trust in each other through a series of
high-level bilateral meetings and to adopt measures that would
prevent any accidental launch of their destructive weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of a catastrophic war, the nations promised
to alert each other to ``any accidental, unauthorized or
unexplained incident'' that might trigger a nuclear exchange. They
promised to continue their declared moratoriums on further nuclear
trials. They agreed to announce in advance any testing of ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the mansion lawns before hundreds of invited
dignitaries, Vajpayee had explained the need for an era of
neighborliness and invited Sharif and his wife to make a return
visit to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can change history but not geography,'' he said. ``We can
change our friends but not our neighbors. We have seen hostility
for years. Now friendship must be given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But if friendship is to flourish, the two nations must find a
way to solve the issue that is their greatest source of friction,
the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In another of Sunday's documents, billed as the Lahore
Declaration, the nations stated that resolution of the Kashmir
question was ``essential'' and that they would ``intensify their
efforts'' to do it. Pressed to elaborate at the press conference,
neither prime minister was eager to say much more about a matter
that provokes dark passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Jammu and Kashmir is being discussed on an
agenda that has been accepted by the two parties,'' Vajpayee said
matter-of-factly. ``The discussion is going on. It is very
difficult for me to say what solutions will emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, once the Himalayan summer paradise of Mughal emperors,
has been the cause of two wars between India and Pakistan since
they became independent in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years before, the British had installed a Hindu
maharajah in the predominantly Muslim territory. At the time of
partition, this Hindu ruler, Hari Singh, desperately wanted Kashmir
to remain independent, though, after fighters from Pakistan invaded
his realm, he thought better of it and chose to be part of India.
</P>
<P>
   The war that followed made enemies of the two infant nations, a
bloody start that has presaged a bloody half-century. The fighting
was halted by a cease-fire in 1949 after the United Nations
interceded. At the time, India was in control of two-thirds of
Kashmir and Pakistan the rest _ more or less how things remain
Sunday. Pakistan wants its larger neighbor to honor a 50-year-old
pledge to give a choice to the Kashmiris through a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations have hundreds of thousands of troops stationed
along the 550-mile ``line of control'' that separates their
holdings. Volleys of artillery fire echo through the lush valleys,
a matter easier for the world to ignore before India and Pakistan
added nuclear bombs to their arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some 30,000-50,000 civilians have been killed in
the conflict, most of them victims of the struggle between Muslim
rebels and Indian forces. Pakistan claims to provide only moral
encouragement to the militants while India insists that the aid is
a lethal mix of training and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As if to dramatize the difficulties in any talks about Kashmir,
20 Hindus were murdered there on Friday night, an event that chased
some of Vajpayee's diplomacy off the front pages back home. As he
returned to New Delhi on Sunday night, reporters questioned him
about whether he had discussed the slaughter with his Pakistani
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the killings must stop,'' Vajpayee answered. ``If
the killing of innocent men, women and children continues, it will
be difficult to normalize relations between the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif faces similar suspicions about any appeasement regarding
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, thousands of Pakistanis protested
Vajpayee's visit, their chief concern being Kashmir. A Saturday
night banquet at the historic Lahore Fort was delayed for 90
minutes as 1,000 demonstrators pelted vehicles with rocks.
Baton-wielding police had to fire tear gas into the crowd and
charge them before the protest was dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, police fought with demonstrators near the Lahore
headquarters of Jamaat-I-Islami, the nation's main Islamic party.
About 100 people were arrested, including several senior party
leaders.

CHINA THREATENING TO END U.N. PEACEKEEPING IN MACEDONIA
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the peace talks over Kosovo limp along
outside Paris, Western diplomats here are increasingly fearful that
China will add to the troubles in the Balkans by abruptly ending a
U.N. peacekeeping force in Macedonia, which borders both Kosovo and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Macedonia, which broke from the former Yugoslavia in
1992, angered China by recognizing Taiwan in return for a
substantial but undisclosed aid package, reckoned here to be worth
anywhere from $1 billion to $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has
consistently sought to punish countries that recognize it as an
independent state. Conversely, Taiwan, with a prosperous
industrialized economy, is known to have offered substantial
rewards to the countries that do.
</P>
<P>
   The fear now is that in retaliation for this slight, China will
use its veto as a permanent member of the Security Council to block
renewal of the mandate of the 1,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force
that has been deployed as a kind of firebreak to war and
instability along Macedonia's border since March 1995. The mandate
is up for renewal at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Annan recommended that the Security Council keep the
Macedonia force in place for at least another six months. He said
its presence has helped insulate Macedonia, about a third of whose
population are ethnic Albanians, against ``spillover'' from the
fighting between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo as well as
from the general instability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence inspired by its presence has been useful in
defusing tensions that could have arisen as a result of the
continued crisis in Kosovo,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force which seeks to prevent arms smuggling across
Macedonia's borders comprises a 350-strong American Army mechanized
infantry battalion, a Nordic infantry battalion, Indonesian army
engineers, military observers and civilian police.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western Security Council members
feel the Macedonian peacekeeping force should be kept in place at
least until the crisis in Kosovo has been defused. But Chinese
diplomats have warned that they ``cannot be responsible for the
consequences'' of Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have also told the U.N. peacekeeping
department that they do not see the need for a continued force in
Macedonia if the Kosovo peace talks succeed and NATO deploys a
large and heavily armed peacekeeping force in Kosovo to preserve
order there.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, China has twice used, or threatened to use, its
Security Council veto to block U.N. peacekeeping operations in
countries whose friendly relations with Taiwan angered Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997 it blocked plans to send U.N. military observers
to Guatemala to supervise a cease-fire signed at the end of the
previous year between the government and a rebel movement there.
</P>
<P>
   This was apparently because Guatemala had tried to open
discussion of Taiwan's international status at the previous year's
session of the U.N. General Assembly. But 10 days later China
lifted its veto after receiving unspecified assurances from
Guatemala, which has never raised the Taiwan issue again.
</P>
<P>
   The following year China threatened to veto a U.N. peacekeeping
operation in Haiti, but in the end did not do so after intensive,
secret negotiations with the Haitian authorities.

SOME SCIENTISTS ATTACK PLAN TO RESTORE EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ambitious $8 billion plan to restore the Florida Everglades
to ecological health over the next several decades is coming under
fire from experts who say that, as now conceived, the proposed
measures will actually do little in the way of restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, these critics say, is that the federal-state
plan does not go far enough in re-establishing the natural flow of
shallow water that once moved in an unbroken sheet down the South
Florida peninsula, creating a habitat for one of the largest
assemblages of marsh wildlife in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say, the project would leave the Everglades much
as they are now: a series of disconnected fragments dependent less
on natural processes and more on human management involving a
complex system of levees, canals, pumps, gates and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little restoration, and most of it doesn't come
for the next 25 years,'' said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the
University of Tennessee in Knoxville who has worked extensively in
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Pimm and five other front-rank ecologists recently sent a letter
to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, asking him to submit the plan
to review by scientists who have not been involved in formulating
it, possibly under the auspices of the National Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signers, including Pimm, are to meet with Babbitt in
Washington on Monday to discuss their concerns. The secretary is
expected to announce then that a permanent, independent scientific
panel was being established to provide continuing evaluation of the
restoration project. A spokesman for the Interior Department said
establishment of the panel had been planned for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, there has been an extremely strong
commitment to science in this effort,'' said Patricia Beneke, an
assistant secretary of the interior. ``This is the opportunity of a
generation.'' She added, ``We're working very hard to do it and do
it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades plan, a major element of the Clinton
administration's environmental agenda, is for the most
comprehensive ecological restoration ever attempted in the United
States. Its basic outline is being put into final form and is to be
submitted to Congress in July.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the program's supporters fear that delay occasioned by
further review might disrupt a considerable amount of the hard-won
political momentum behind the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the ecologists said in their letter to Babbitt, a
scientific review ``might confirm the plans as the only ones that
are practicable.'' But if not, they said, it is better to find out
now, before billions of dollars are committed.
</P>
<P>
   The letter follows earlier reservations about the plan's likely
effectiveness expressed by scientists of the National Park Service.
Besides Pimm, signatories of the letter, dated Jan. 28, were Edward
O. Wilson of Harvard University; Peter Raven, director of the
Missouri Botanical Garden; Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University;
Gary Meffe of the University of Florida and Gordon Orians of the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take very seriously what they say,'' said Michael Davis, a
deputy assistant secretary of the Army under whose supervision the
Army Corps of Engineers falls. The Corps, along with the Interior
Department, is leading the restoration effort at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades today are about half the size they were a century
ago, and what remains has been divided into compartments separated
by levees. Canals draw off water for agriculture and urban use, and
to protect South Florida from floods. Every year, hundreds of
billions of gallons are pumped into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ecologists say, the natural flows and rhythms of
water in the Everglades, driven by rainfall patterns, have been
severely altered, depriving parts of the marsh of water at critical
times. And the ecological health of the marsh has seriously
deteriorated, the experts say. One sign is that the number of
wading birds breeding in the marsh has declined drastically from
natural levels.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would recapture the billions of gallons channeled
yearly into the Atlantic and the gulf, and then store some of it in
reservoirs and pump some of it, through wells, into the huge
aquifer underlying South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It would later be pumped out and released as needed through a
network of canals, many of them new. The water would supply the
water needs of South Florida's growing population and mimic the
natural flow of water in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The plan as developed so far is on a broad, conceptual scale,
with details still to be worked out. Federal officials say that
many of the issues raised by critics will be addressed in that
phase.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, it has been widely understood that no one
knows precisely what the ecological impact of the replumbing would
be. It has also been understood that the plan would not be perfect.
The aim, therefore, has been to make adjustments, over the years,
as experience dictates.
</P>
<P>
   But Pimm, for one, argues that the approach is flawed from the
start. He holds that it should restore natural water flow to the
maximum extent possible. The philosophy ought to be, he says, that
``natural is better than managed.'' Instead, he says, the plan
retains the fragmentation of the Everglades as well as ``the notion
that the entire system can be managed in perpetuity'' by humans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, some levees would be removed, lessening the
fragmentation, and others would be breached so water could flow
more easily. But Pimm argues that there is too little of this. He
also says that whatever restoration benefits the plan might hold
lie too far in the future. If that is so, said Davis of the Corps,
it is because it would take several years to put all the elements
of the replumbed system into place.
</P>
<P>
   The six scientists' letter to Babbitt cited comments about the
restoration plan made recently by the scientific and technical
staff of Everglades National Park. In a formal report at the end of
last year, the staff said the plan ``does not represent a
restoration scenario'' for the Everglades and ``largely retains the
fragmented management and compartmentalization characterizing
today's Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus technical opinion of the Everglades National
Park staff is that there is insufficient evidence'' that the plan
will ``result in the recovery of a healthy, sustainable
ecosystem,'' the report said. ``We find substantial, credible and
compelling evidence to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ring, the superintendent of the park, said discussions
aimed at improving the plan were continuing with the Corps of
Engineers and progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Corps has recently agreed to favor the use of
simple weirs for containing water within compartmentalized areas,
rather than a more elaborate ensemble of levees, gates and pumps.
This weir option, advocated by Ring, would make it easier and
cheaper to remove the structures during a future restoration phase,
thereby more readily breaking down the compartmentalization of the
marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the marsh must be compartmentalized for now,
because the land has sunk after being deprived of water for
decades. Restoring a natural flow now would make the water too deep
for many forms of Everglades life. But eventually, Ring said, the
land could be rebuilt, either naturally or on purpose. The weirs
could then be removed, the compartments would disappear and natural
water flow would resume.

<P>
   One day last spring, Gene Siskel was an in-studio guest on the
radio program I was co-hosting at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we talked about Siskel's beloved Bulls and their
chances for a sixth title, but we also played verbal racquetball
with a number of other topics _ and as always, Siskel was right on
his game and held nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned a rather mundane idea I had for a TV sitcom,
Siskel coated his words in sarcasm: ``That's really great, Rich,
you oughta move straight to L.A., because that's just the best idea
anyone's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an underappreciated skill _ and certainly a small thing
compared to Siskel's legacy as a dedicated family man who partnered
with Roger Ebert to form the most successful critic duo we've ever
known _ but Siskel was a terrific live guest, alone or with Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon last May, Gene had agreed to sit in for an
hour. He was crisp and lively and funny, and if you were listening
to the show you wouldn't have thought anything was amiss _ but
during the commercial breaks Siskel asked for a cup of water,
rested his eyes and said he didn't feel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some coffee the other day and I think it really affected
me,'' he said. ``I can't get rid of this headache.''
</P>
<P>
   We offered to cut the segment short, but Siskel insisted on
gutting it out. After we thanked him and said our on-air goodbyes,
Gene went out to the lobby to rest. Eventually he had to call for a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm sure he was thinking: Coffee. A headache. No big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Siskel would undergo emergency brain surgery in
a New York hospital. He returned to work briefly, but a full
recovery was not to be. Less than a year after that day in the
radio studio, we lost a great Chicagoan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Siskel's dearest friends worked in the media, and over
the weekend they delivered moving tributes in print and on the air.
The CBS affiliate in Chicago, where Siskel worked for more than two
decades, devoted nearly all of its main broadcast Saturday to
Siskel, and it was magnificent television. Several longtime Siskel
buddies in particular stood out, striking just the right note
between solid reporting and heartfelt eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   My own encounters with Siskel weren't nearly as deep or
personal, but we did have some moments. He had this tendency to
want to direct careers _ but always to the betterment of everyone
involved. Not long ago he decided I should be working at his TV
station, even though neither I nor the honchos at his station were
particularly in agreement on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he and Ebert were inducted into the Museum of
Broadcast Communications' Hall of Fame, he yanked me from my table
and marched me over to his TV bosses and said, ``All right, let's
stop ------- around and get you guys together.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was at lunch with these people _ both sides
really only there because we didn't know how to say no to Gene.
</P>
<P>
   In a column a couple of years ago about celebrities who are
rabid sports fans, I poked gentle fun at Siskel's courtside antics
at Bulls games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that if they were having a one-night
screening of a restored version of `Citizen Kane' at the Fine Arts
movie house (in Chicago) on the same night there was a Bulls
playoff game, Gene would be leaving Roger all alone in the
balcony,'' I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That day an ``anonymous'' caller with a very familiar voice left
a message on my machine: ``Way to give it to that Gene Siskel,''
said Gene Siskel. ``I really hate the way he acts at those Bulls
games. Keep up the good work, and keep giving it to Siskel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siskel and Ebert celebrated the 20th year of their TV
partnership, it was my privilege to interview them in the Loop
screening room where they spent countless hours in the dark, always
sitting apart, watching movies. The conversation included this
exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Times: You guys need each other. What happens if one of you
says, ``I don't want to do the show anymore''?
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: We've never discussed ...
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: Never discussed that.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: How'd you like how we finished our sentences, wasn't
that impressive?
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: I have a feeling we'll be doing this show until no one
wants us to, and at that point we'll stop.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: My fantasy is that in another 40 years we'll be in
wheelchairs and we'll have attendant nurses and we'll do the show.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it still would have influenced our moviegoing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of Siskel's passing Saturday, I said my prayers
for his eternal peace, and then I paid tribute to him in the
simplest way possible.
</P>
<P>
   I went to the movies.

games. Keep up the good work, and keep giving it to Siskel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siskel and Ebert celebrated the 20th year of their TV
partnership, it was my privilege to interview them in the Loop
screening room where they spent countless hours in the dark, always
sitting apart, watching movies. The conversation included this
exchange:

says, ``I don't want to do the show anymore''?
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: We've never discussed ...
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: Never discussed that.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: How'd you like how we finished our sentences, wasn't
that impressive?
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: I have a feeling we'll be doing this show until no one
wants us to, and at that point we'll stop.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: My fantasy is that in another 40 years we'll be in
wheelchairs and we'll have attendant nurses and we'll do the show.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it still would have influenced our moviegoing
decisions.

for his eternal peace, and then I paid tribute to him in the
simplest way possible.

   One day last spring, Gene Siskel was an in-studio guest on the
radio program I was co-hosting at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we talked about Siskel's beloved Bulls and their
chances for a sixth title, but we also played verbal racquetball
with a number of other topics _ and as always, Siskel was right on
his game and held nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned a rather mundane idea I had for a TV sitcom,
Siskel coated his words in sarcasm: ``That's really great, Rich,
you oughta move straight to L.A., because that's just the best idea
anyone's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an underappreciated skill _ and certainly a small thing
compared to Siskel's legacy as a dedicated family man who partnered
with Roger Ebert to form the most successful critic duo we've ever
known _ but Siskel was a terrific live guest, alone or with Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon last May, Gene had agreed to sit in for an
hour. He was crisp and lively and funny, and if you were listening
to the show you wouldn't have thought anything was amiss _ but
during the commercial breaks Siskel asked for a cup of water,
rested his eyes and said he didn't feel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some coffee the other day and I think it really affected
me,'' he said. ``I can't get rid of this headache.''
</P>
<P>
   We offered to cut the segment short, but Siskel insisted on
gutting it out. After we thanked him and said our on-air goodbyes,
Gene went out to the lobby to rest. Eventually he had to call for a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm sure he was thinking: Coffee. A headache. No big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Siskel would undergo emergency brain surgery in
a New York hospital. He returned to work briefly, but a full
recovery was not to be. Less than a year after that day in the
radio studio, we lost a great Chicagoan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Siskel's dearest friends worked in the media, and over
the weekend they delivered moving tributes in print and on the air.
The CBS affiliate in Chicago, where Siskel worked for more than two
decades, devoted nearly all of its main broadcast Saturday to
Siskel, and it was magnificent television. Several longtime Siskel
buddies in particular stood out, striking just the right note
between solid reporting and heartfelt eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   My own encounters with Siskel weren't nearly as deep or
personal, but we did have some moments. He had this tendency to
want to direct careers _ but always to the betterment of everyone
involved. Not long ago he decided I should be working at his TV
station, even though neither I nor the honchos at his station were
particularly in agreement on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he and Ebert were inducted into the Museum of
Broadcast Communications' Hall of Fame, he yanked me from my table
and marched me over to his TV bosses and said, ``All right, let's
stop ------- around and get you guys together.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was at lunch with these people _ both sides
really only there because we didn't know how to say no to Gene.
</P>
<P>
   In a column a couple of years ago about celebrities who are
rabid sports fans, I poked gentle fun at Siskel's courtside antics
at Bulls games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that if they were having a one-night
screening of a restored version of `Citizen Kane' at the Fine Arts
movie house (in Chicago) on the same night there was a Bulls
playoff game, Gene would be leaving Roger all alone in the
balcony,'' I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That day an ``anonymous'' caller with a very familiar voice left
a message on my machine: ``Way to give it to that Gene Siskel,''
said Gene Siskel. ``I really hate the way he acts at those Bulls
games. Keep up the good work, and keep giving it to Siskel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siskel and Ebert celebrated the 20th year of their TV

FTC   NOW TURNS TO ITS ANTITRUST   CASE   AGAINST INTEL

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``Wintel'' duopoly, as some have described the
domination of the computer industry by Microsoft's software and
Intel's hardware, is about to come under government assault on a
second front.
</P>
<P>
   With the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the
Microsoft Corp. wending its way to conclusion in a federal court
here, lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission are preparing to open
their trial against the Intel Corp. in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel case may wind up having a lower profile than the
Microsoft trial, and any penalties _ if Intel loses _ may not be
nearly as severe as what government lawyers may seek for Microsoft.
But the stakes for both the industry and Intel, the world's largest
maker of personal computer chips, are considerable all the same.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the government and the chip maker disclosed their
list of possible witnesses, and later this week the two sides will
file briefs detailing their theories of the case. But a broad
outline already has been sketched out in court papers. Despite some
crucial differences, the Microsoft and Intel cases fundamentally
are similar to the extent they involve the competing policy
interests of antitrust law and intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of similarities between the cases,'' said
Eleanor M. Fox, an authority on antitrust who teaches at the New
York University School of Law. ``Each company has control of 80 to
90 percent of its market, and both cases involve high-technology
intellectual property markets. Both cases also allege the dominance
of a monopoly firm by using its monopoly leverage to build a moat
around its power to prevent challenges that threaten control over
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are important differences between the Microsoft and
Intel cases over the facts and the law, as well as in procedures of
the two trials. The government is seeking a far more limited remedy
in the Intel case than it is contemplating in the Microsoft case.
There, the most extreme measure under consideration is the breakup
of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In Intel's case, the government simply wants the court to order
the company not to withhold its technical information from
customers who are also developing rival technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Intel's corporate future is not at stake, some
experts believe that if the company loses, the new ground rules
could have a long-term effect both on the profits of Intel and its
competitors and on computer prices generally. Chips are a much more
expensive component of personal computers than the operating system
software and Internet browsers at the center of the Microsoft
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Microsoft and the Intel cases present stark clash _
between the protections that intellectual property law is meant to
give companies and the protection of the public that antitrust law
are supposed to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual property law gives the holder of a patent a kind of
monopolistic protection over an invention or process. But under
antitrust law, companies with a monopoly position in a market are
not supposed to abuse their power by chilling potential competition
or innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Intel of a pattern of squeezing other
developers of chip technology who are also big customers of Intel
into surrendering technological advances to Intel as a quid pro quo
for receiving crucial information from Intel. Lawyers at the
Federal Trade Commission charge that Intel denied or threatened to
deny information about its chips to three companies that use those
chips in their own products _ Compaq Computer, Digital Equipment
and Intergraph _ as a way of coercing them to license their
innovations to Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's conduct threatened to injure, and did injure, the
ability of those targeted customers to remain competitive in
developing and bringing to market in a timely manner computer
systems based on Intel's microprocessors,'' the FTC said in its
complaint. Government lawyers assert that Intel's decision to
withhold the information stifled innovation and development of new
chip technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Agency lawyers announced on Friday that the witnesses they plan
to call include executives from companies that have been Intel
customers. One is Robert B. Palmer, who was chairman and chief
executive of Digital Equipment until it was acquired last year by
Compaq. Another is James W. Meadlock, chairman and chief executive
of Intergraph, a Huntsville, Ala., company that supplies computer
hardware, software and services for corporate and engineering
customers, based on Microsoft and Intel technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has not contested many of the facts of the case. Rather,
the company has said that antitrust rules do not outlaw its
decision to withhold technical information from anyone as a way of
defending itself from possible competition. Intel executives also
contend that the agency will be unable to show that the company's
decision to withhold information from its customers resulted in any
harm to competition or kept chip prices artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case that is not a classic antitrust case but an
effort by the staff of the FTC to create new law,'' says Chuck
Mulloy, an Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that it would take a different tack than Microsoft,
Intel announced on Friday that its witnesses might include its
chairman and co-founder, Andrew S. Grove, and its chief executive,
Craig R. Barrett, executives who not only transformed the industry
but also personify the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, by contrast, purposely kept its chairman and founder,
William H. Gates, and president, Steven A. Ballmer, from taking the
stand. Gates' evasive deposition, played on videotape in court by
Justice Department lawyers to great effect, has dented both the
company's image and its legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Procedurally, the Intel case is also on a far different footing
than Microsoft's. The Intel proceeding will be heard by an
administrative law judge, James P. Timony, who has been on the
bench since 1976 and before that was a lawyer at the agency,
Administrative law judges, who work for the government's executive
branch, not the judiciary, are the professional referees of the
federal agencies. Both Intel and the FTC have won and lost their
share of pretrial skirmishes before Timony.
</P>
<P>
   If Intel loses in the administrative proceeding, and also at the
next level _ before the full commission _ the company would have
the right to select the federal circuit court in which to file its
appeal. ``Court shopping'' gives Intel to ability to select the
appeals circuit with the least stringent interpretation of
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is defending itself before a federal judge, Thomas
Penfield Jackson, whom it had sought to have removed from the case
because of his previous rulings against the company. If Microsoft
loses, it would have no choice but to proceed to the federal
appeals court in the District of Columbia _ not necessarily an
undesirable situation for Microsoft, since last year the court
handed Microsoft a major victory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the contrasts of the two cases, and the similarities, are
some odd common threads _ including a six-degree-of-separation
aspect to some of the lawyerly relationships. A few years ago, for
example, Intel's main trial lawyer, Robert E. Cooper, beat David
Boies, the Justice Department's marquee lawyer in the Microsoft
trial, in a predatory price fixing case brought by Continental
Airlines and Northwest Airlines against American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Intel's public relations war with the government
has been at a lower decibel level than Microsoft's, its legal
maneuvering has been just as bare-knuckled. Court filings made
public this month show that Intel's lawyers secretly and
unsuccessfully attempted to knock the government's top trial
lawyer, Richard G. Parker, out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Parker had done legal work for the chip maker Advanced Micro
Devices Inc., an Intel competitor, before joining the government.
In that capacity, he was involved in responding to an FTC request
for information during the agency's investigation of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In denying Intel's request to remove Parker, Timony found that
the lawyer's participation in the proceeding would violate no
ethics rules, a finding that was also made by both the agency's
ethics lawyer and the Office of Government Ethics.

THEY GOT EACH OTHER, BABE _ AND OH BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a lesbian nightclub in Los Angeles, way back in 1961, a
mutual friend introduces Sonny to Cher.
</P>
<P>
   She turns in her chair, lifts her brown eyes, gives Sonny a
quick and bemused appraisal and says ``hi'' to his ``hey.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, showbiz history. The moment is so incendiary that the TV
screen nearly curls at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny is a meat deliveryman hustling on the fringes of the music
business. Meeting Cher _ you'll have to forgive me for this _ he
looks as if he's just run into with a tree.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first big event in ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny
and Cher Story,'' an ABC movie airing Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, ``Ally McBeal'' is on, and there's an NBC movie, and
everybody is quite taken with Raymond on CBS. But don't miss this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Beat Goes On'' is ditsy, dumb, trite and gaudy. You'll
laugh yourself breathless when you should blubber with sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But cartoonish as it is _ maybe because it's so cartoonish _
this movie is more fun than a greased pig at a skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stammering, eternally optimistic Sonny Bono (Jay
Underwood) propelling himself and Cher (Renee Faia) to stardom
while Cher invariably finds some reason to complain.
</P>
<P>
   She even wears down Sonny. When she wearies of their TV series,
he tells her, ``You hate it when we're working, you're bored when
we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Cher want, anyway? Other men, for starters. As the
marriage unravels, Cher tells Sonny in their Las Vegas hotel suite,
`'I want you to leave the room.'' Sonny wonders why. ``Because Bill
is coming up. I want to sleep with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she'd already caught Sonny, after a previous quarrel,
on the sofa and in the arms of a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Not so surprisingly, given the tilt toward Sonny's point of
view, the movie is based on Bono's autobiography. It's produced by
Bono's onetime attorney, Larry Thompson, and co-produced by Bono's
widow and congressional successor, Mary. Cher wasn't involved in
the production.
</P>
<P>
   The music is a willy-nilly combination of actual Sonny and Cher
recordings, Underwood and Faia singing Sonny and Cher parts and
Kelly Van Hoose Smith impersonating Cher. There's at least one
instance where all three methods are used in one song.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Beat Goes On'' isn't exactly a tapestry of the '60s
and early '70s. It's more of a throw rug, focusing narrowly on
Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to exist in their own cocoon, a couple of dumbstruck
sudden stars in hippie garb, incongruously occupying a Bel-Air
mansion and wondering how to keep their popularity afloat in fickle
times.
</P>
<P>
   The fur vests and leggings are outlandish, the colors are
joyously garish and the restaged TV shows are a hoot. Here they are
on ``Shindig'' in 1965, doing ``I Got You Babe,'' Sonny prancing
toward the camera while Cher flings her arms spastically in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Go on. Miss that. You'll hear someone talking about it tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stars, I think it can safely be said that Underwood
isn't ready for the Royal Shakespeare. He simply flings himself
into Sonny Bono, and in the fur-and-feathers commotion that follows
there emerges a lovable dreamer who is strangely savvy to American
pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Faia, a former costume assistant for TV shows, is the more
talented actor. Granted, her performance is largely a triumph of
mimicry _ the deadpan speech, the folded arms, the cocked hip, the
regal disdain. But it works; she's convincing. And if you watch
closely you'll see that she's ready and able to take on Barbra
Streisand, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, inspired mimicry fills the bill wonderfully in a case
like this. Just as Sonny professes to know only three chords
(``Those three chords are gonna put us on top''), this movie knows
its limitations and giddily plays them to the hilt.

<P>
   David Cohen had an idea for a sure-fire Internet money maker: He
would design a Web page around Lemon Boy, a cartoon environmental
hero he dreamed up, and use to it sell Lemon Boy-themed watches at
$19 a pop _ $10 more than the watches would cost him.
</P>
<P>
   But like any Web entrepreneur worth his bits, Cohen, ran the
idea past a New York consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's guru, Harry Lowenstein, convinced him that the chances
of enough people stumbling onto the page, then clicking on the
watch icon, and then wanting to pay $19 for a watch, were awfully
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry intrinsically understood the Web's limitations,'' said
Cohen, who at Lowenstein's urging is drastically overhauling plans
for his Lemon Boy Web site.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable is not that Cohen, 31, heeded the consultant _
but that his Web adviser, Lowenstein, is a 79-year-old former owner
of a furniture manufacturing company, who retired long before
anybody coined the term ``E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not news when retired people are pulled into the computer
age by a desire to e-mail their grandchildren or check their stock
portfolios on the Internet. But Lowenstein is one of 12,400 members
of Score, the Service Corps of Retired Executives, a group with 389
chapters around the nation that offer free guidance to
entrepreneurs. Score's members, recognizing that they cannot bill
themselves as small-business experts without fully understanding
what the Internet has added to the party, have immersed themselves
in the nuances of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some old folks sit around and talk about their ailments,''
said Abraham Kaplan, a retired investment banker who belongs to
Score's New York City chapter. ``Well, we now all talk about our
computer problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, Score has tried to steep its
counselors in computerese. Score chapters have brought in guest
speakers to talk about using the Internet for promotions, sales and
researching the competition. Many have installed networks of
computers with Internet access and hired consultants to teach
counselors to use them. Score's headquarters in Washington soon
will distribute a brochure about the ways the Internet affects new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Score's two-year-old Web page (www.Score.org) guides would-be
clients to the closest Score office and even offers hot links to a
few sites, including the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is letting clients, through the Web page, ask advice of
Score members via e-mail. So far, 544 counselors have listed their
key skills _ tax law, say, or the textiles trade _ in Score's
electronic data bank. When a client e-mails a question, the
computer searches the data base for an electronic match between the
query and a counselor's stated skills. Robert Souza, the retired
economist who administers the e-mail counseling system from
Honolulu, says Score handles about 3,000 e-mail queries a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing beats face-to-face counseling, and you can't learn to
write a complex business plan through e-mail,'' Souza said. ``But
it eliminates telephone tag, and it lets people ask and answer
questions from home, at any time of day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   It also lets them tap into a national network of experts. Ervin
Simon, chairman of Score's Colorado Springs chapter, tells of a
woman who runs a hot-dog stand in a small Montana city _ a long
drive from the nearest Score office _ who wants to base a business
on her sauerkraut relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped with her business plan, a Southeastern patent lawyer
helped with her trademark, and a California woman who had been in
food manufacturing counseled her on that,'' Simon said. ``E-mail
pulled our whole network together for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The same system kept Daniel Adamovich from making what might
have been a disastrous business move last year. Adamovich, a
52-year-old retired Air Force pilot then living in St. Louis,
e-mailed Simon for advice on how to start a 1950s-theme restaurant
in Colorado Springs, where he hoped to move. Simon asked a Score
colleague who had been a restaurateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``They persuaded me that restaurants were too tough a business
for someone without experience,'' Adamovich recalled. So, in June,
Adamovich, who always had enjoyed tinkering with computers, opened
a Computer Renaissance franchised store in Flagstaff, Ariz.
(Colorado Springs already had one), where he fixes old computers
and assembles and sells new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail setup has its limitations. There are no pull-down
menus for helping clients navigate the 600 key skills listed in the
data base. A lot of counselors refuse to use the e-mail system
because _ having come of age in a business world where presidents
presided and secretaries typed _ they have poor keyboard skills.
</P>
<P>
   But Score's headquarters executives are betting that training
and time will raise the counselors' comfort level. ``Our goal is to
develop a truly comprehensive computerized list of every
counselor's skills, one that all counselors can tap into whenever a
client asks a question they cannot answer themselves,'' said W.
Kenneth Yancey Jr., Score's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But there is sometimes a gulf between the requisite will and the
necessary skill _ as Lisa Sykes discovered six months ago, when she
volunteered to show Score's 38 counselors in New York City how to
operate their chapter's new computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to show them what the system can do, and a third of
them are saying, `What do you call this little thing, a mouse?' or
`Where did you say the on button is?''' recalled Ms. Sykes, who is
28. ``Half of them hadn't even seen Score's Web site!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Sykes, a principal of the consulting firm of Miller Sykes
New Media Services, originally had volunteered a couple of hours a
week, assuming she herself could pick up some business tips in the
process. But demand for her services was such that, about two
months ago, Score began paying her to come in about eight hours a
week to conduct one-on-one tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sykes notes that her pupils are not always cheerful
gleaners. Most of the Score counselors were bosses for much of
their careers, and are used to being the source of guidance and
knowledge, not the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But she says the breakthroughs have been heartening. ``One man
found a CD-ROM with sample business plans on it, and his reaction
was, `What am I supposed to do with this thing?''' Ms. Sykes
recalled. ``Now he knows how a CD reader works, he's asking the
publisher's permission to print out sample plans for clients, and
he's looking for Web sites that offer similar things.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys survived mainframe computers, fax machines,
calculators, lots of revolutionary technologies that became vital
tools of business,'' she said. ``It'll be like that with the
Internet, too. Once they grasp it in their head, the knowledge will
filter to their guts.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The showdown in 1996 _ when Microsoft threatened to
stop selling the Windows operating system to Compaq Computer unless
Compaq also included the software maker's Internet browser _ is a
central chapter in the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But a look beyond the court documents indicates that was not the
first time the dominant software maker and the largest producer of
personal computers had clashed. A dispute between the two
companies, over Compaq's plans to become a software player in its
own right, was creating tensions as early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the companies' sometimes contentious past is
crucial. For in deciding the antitrust case, the court has to make
a judgment about the Compaq-Microsoft relationship: Has even the
largest personal computer maker bent to Microsoft's will in ways
that stifle competition and harm consumers? Or is the relationship
more one of headstrong equals in an often bumpy partnership over
the years?
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was upset
about the Compaq Computer &UR;  &LR; Corp.'s software plans. Compaq had
decided to load a software ``shell'' on its machines for the home
market. Compaq saw the shell _ a layer of software that ran on top
of Microsoft's Windows _ mainly as a way to make computers easier
to use.
</P>
<P>
   But a report to Compaq from the consulting firm, McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
noted that the shell could also give the computer maker a measure
of independence from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The shell, as was later the case with the Internet browser, was
software that rested atop the operating system and housed start-up
icons for other programs. Such functions would potentially
undermine the gatekeeper's role that Windows plays in modern
computing and allow Compaq to guide users to software it chose to
feature. And at the same time, Compaq was building up its own
software development unit in Silicon Valley, eventually staffed
with about 150 engineers.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, the Compaq moves were regarded as almost acts of
treason by a longtime business partner, posing a threat to
Microsoft's control of the desktop screen and a potential assault
on Windows, according to a former Microsoft executive, who spoke on
the condition that he not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop this,'' the former executive recalled Gates
saying in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He was still worried the following summer. In a meeting with
executives of personal computer chip maker Intel in July 1995,
Gates expressed concern about Compaq's shell software and other
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things they're trying to do are dangerous,'' Gates was
quoted as saying, according to notes taken by an Intel executive
and introduced as evidence in the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Compaq has been the most aggressive among the
personal computer makers in seeking a measure of independence from
Microsoft, even as it is one of Microsoft's closest allies and
largest customer. Frequently, Compaq's actions have not fit neatly
into the picture of a company in Microsoft's monopolistic grip,
constantly seeking favors and ever-fearful of reprisal _ the
picture the government tried to paint in court last week when a
Compaq executive took the stand as a defense witness for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also true that there is an established pattern to the
Compaq-Microsoft relationship: Compaq takes an independent path,
Microsoft bristles and an accommodation is made.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq removed its software shell as an alternative for the
desktop, or main screen, in 1996. The move came after Microsoft
tightened contract restrictions on computer makers, but also after
the introduction of Windows 95, which made PCs easier to use _
addressing the key problem the shell was intended to solve.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Compaq closed its software development unit. And after
being threatened with losing its Windows license, Compaq restored
the icon for Microsoft's Internet browser on the desktop screen for
all its machines.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding whether this was business brinksmanship by two
equally powerful companies or a demonstration of Microsoft's power
to force Compaq to back down is a key to the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not an easy determination, judging from descriptions
of the Compaq-Microsoft relationship by former Compaq executives
and industry executives close to the company. It is a partnership,
they say, that rests on mutual dependence and cemented by money.
They agree with John T. Rose, the Compaq executive who took the
stand last week, that there has been ``significant give-and-take
over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they also say that ultimately Microsoft has the upper hand
in the relationship because, as Rose testified, there is no genuine
alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system, but there are
many PC makers that are potential customers for Microsoft's
software.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what the executives think of Microsoft's market
power, most of them also said that having a dominant technology _
instead of a handful of competing operating systems _ has helped
fuel the growth of the industry and drive down prices as consumers,
software developers and hardware manufacturers gain the efficiency
of working with a single standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Microsoft is a company with some monopoly capabilities,
but we always viewed Microsoft as a partner first,'' said Gary
Stimac, a former senior vice president at Compaq. ``And that
partnership benefited Compaq tremendously, far more than it ever
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that Microsoft essentially bought its
special relationship by giving Compaq a special price for Windows.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has kept the testimony on pricing
secret by closing the courtroom to the press and public when this
confidential business information is being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose, the Compaq witness, did testify that it was his
company's belief that it got the lowest Windows price in the
industry, mainly because it is the largest producer. The government
contends that Microsoft uses the price it charges manufacturers for
Windows as a way to reward companies that give favored treatment to
a wide range of Microsoft's products and punish companies who do
not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A consultant who worked for Compaq until recently said that
Compaq paid about $3 less for each copy of Windows than most of its
competitors. Half of that money went straight to Compaq, while the
other half went into joint marketing, training and development
efforts by the two companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the context of the broad relationship with Microsoft,
the former Compaq and industry executives say, that the dispute
over Internet software must be viewed. Rose testified that the
problem arose because of ``a communications breakdown'' within
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in Compaq's consumer division agreed in a deal with
America Online &UR;  &LR; Inc. to feature its service and remove the desktop
icons for Microsoft's MSN online service and its Internet Explorer
browser, in return for fees. But Rose testified that the consumer
unit did not realize that more senior Compaq executives had already
agreed to include Microsoft's browser and online software on the
Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   According to e-mail introduced in court last week, executives in
Compaq's consumer unit wanted to hold onto the America Online deal
and the cash it represented. ``Some of the discussions inside the
company got really ugly,'' said a former Compaq executive, who
insisted on not being identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer group was losing money at the time,'' the former
executive said, ``and they wanted the dollar or two per machine
they might get from the America Online deal. But that would
jeopardize the partnership with Microsoft in which, because of the
price discounts, millions and millions of dollars were flowing back
and forth to the benefit of both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' the former executive said, ``I believe sanity
prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that Compaq's consumer group simply misunderstood
the Windows contract, which treated the browser and MSN icons as
part of the operating system and thus not removable.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their past differences, Compaq and Microsoft are
probably more closely aligned today than ever. Compaq increasingly
sees its future as moving up the computing food chain, taking the
low-cost economics of the personal computer to tackle
industrial-strength corporate computing _ the traditional bailiwick
of mainframes, minicomputers and big machines running the Unix
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Compaq is betting that Microsoft's
industrial-strength operating system, Windows NT, can scale up to
handle mainstream corporate computing.

<P>
   SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ No place on this entire
island, a tropical teardrop of land in the Pacific Ocean, has an
address.
</P>
<P>
   There are no names on the roads that meander alongside the lazy
palm trees, nor on the streets that crisscross the island's modest
capital city. No house has a number _ not the humble shacks on the
hilly inland roads nor the fancy estates that stretch out beside a
lengthy beachfront, not even the modern office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound forlorn, but it is not. It is a way of life. The
sun shines every day in Saipan, where the fragrant and summery air
rarely dips below 70 degrees or climbs above 80. The locals, a mix
of Pacific islanders and Caucasians, wear shorts and flip-flops
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little sense of urgency about anything in
Saipan. Street names and numbers, many people here say, would be an
unnecessary bother, an unwelcome intrusion of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you need an address, when you know where everything
is?'' asked Lou Drenian, a legal secretary, giving voice to a
nonchalance as pervasive as Hawaiian shirts. ``If I go someplace
new, I just ask.''
</P>
<P>
   And ask. And how.
</P>
<P>
   People in Saipan are so accustomed to asking and giving
directions that they think nothing of lengthy and roundabout
discussions involving odd landmarks. Bumps in the road,
funny-looking trees, anything distinctive can help, since the
streets are nameless.
</P>
<P>
   That may have seemed logical in the old days, early this
century, when Saipan was a distant outpost populated by only a few
hundred people, and everyone knew everyone and where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Saipan's population has climbed to 70,000. After being
ruled by Spain, then by Japan, then by the United Nations, Saipan
became a U.S. Commonwealth in 1978 as part of the Northern Mariana
Islands. Modern features of life, like fast-food joints and luxury
beach resorts, make Saipan look like any other tropical corner of
America. Except, of course, that there are no addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Postal delivery in Saipan is no problem. There is none. Instead,
residents all have boxes at the central post office, which
naturally has become a lively social center, since everyone goes
there regularly.
</P>
<P>
   At first, finding one's way around Saipan can be confusing. But
many newcomers settle into a comfortable addresslessness before
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I thought it was the dumbest thing in
the world,'' said Terry McLaughlin, librarian at the Joetian Public
Library, who moved to Saipan last year. ``After a couple of months,
it becomes quite normal. It personalizes things, keeps things
local.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a portion of Saipan's work force is getting impatient
for addresses, even if they are a minority. Just imagine how hard
it is to deliver a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real headache,'' said Robert Brilliantes, a pizza
deliverer for Pizza Forum, located just off Saipan's main road. (It
doesn't have a name.) ``It's hardest when I have to go up in the
hills, looking for houses surrounded by trees, where you can't see
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Brilliantes takes down a detailed explanation of how
to find a customer's house, and relies on his mobile phone for even
more specific directions after he gets lost. He is always getting
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up Navy Hill, left by the broken pump, the white house across
from the basketball court,'' Brilliantes said, reciting the
directions he was given earlier in the day. ``But when I got there,
there were three white houses. I had to call twice before I figured
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the slow-moving local government, which one local
businessman described as alternating between laziness and vacation,
has recognized the need to name and number streets. A commission
was set up to do so, but that was in 1988, and little discernible
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The commission apparently got bogged down as soon as it came to
picking the names. A dozen large and extended families own most of
Saipan, and each one wanted roads and streets named for a family
patriarch or illustrious relative.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the bickering, the Saipan Senate passed a new bill
in January, recommending action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``To date the task of naming and numbering the streets has yet
to be completed,'' said the bill. ``The situation is reaching
crisis proportions and, especially in these tough economic times,
the Legislature finds that Saipan needs organization of this sort
to encourage economic efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellyn Villajuan is all for efficiency. She runs Saipan's
Federal Express office, and making deliveries without addresses, as
she put it, is not always express.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it's easy?'' she asked, laughing, apparently pleased
that anyone sympathized about her predicament. ``I think I have the
hardest Fedex job in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Saipan residents have more mundane concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victoria's Secret won't deliver to a postal box,'' complained
Jill Howard, a teacher who has lived on Saipan for more than four
years. ``It's a real pain. You have to have them deliver to your
family in the mainland, and have them send it out.''

DESPITE TRADE SANCTIONS, LAUDER-LED FIRM DOING BUSINESS IN SERBIA
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In apparent defiance of a U.S. policy that
prohibits investment in Serbia, a company chaired by Ronald S.
Lauder, the cosmetics heir and former New York mayoral candidate,
has entered into a commercial deal with Yugoslavia's state-run
communications company.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton imposed economic sanctions last summer after
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia stepped up his campaign
of violent repression in Kosovo, an impoverished region in southern
Serbia where ethnic Albanians have taken up arms against rule from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Clinton's executive order, one of Lauder's
companies, RSL Communications, signed a contract with Telekom
Serbia to provide long-distance telephone services to and from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury department learned of the telecommunications deal
from an article in a government newspaper in Belgrade three months
after the agreement was signed. Department officials then sent a
letter to RSL saying that it appeared to violate the sanctions and
asking for more information, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Lauder, a candidate for mayor of New York
in 1989, attended a telecommunications conference in Belgrade,
during which he met with a senior Yugoslav official and
businessman, Zoran Lilic.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lauder said he talked with Lilic about the
Jewish community in Belgrade, and had not discussed business.
</P>
<P>
   RSL denies that it has done anything improper. ``Our belief is
that we have not violated the sanctions,'' said Avery Fischer,
legal counsel for RSL, a publicly traded company with headquarters
in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that before the deal was signed in August, the
company briefed the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the treasury
department office that enforces American sanctions in place against
a handful of countries, including Iraq, Iran, Cuba, North Korea and
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got no objection,'' said Fischer, who declined to say how
much the deal was worth.
</P>
<P>
   A treasury department spokesman said that no approval had been
given to the deal, and that it was still under active review.
Fischer said the company's response to the Treasury Department was
that this deal is not an investment within the meaning of the
sanctions law, and that if it is, it is subject to an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer also said the company had gotten approval for the deal
from someone in the State Department, but said that he could not
recall the person's name.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's special envoy for Bosnia, Robert S.
Gelbard, said that to his knowledge no one in the department had
given approval, and if RSL did apply for a license, ``our
inclination would be to oppose it, because we look at these
sanctions very strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the only time that Lauder, who was ambassador to
Austria in the mid-1980s, has skidded into controversy as he has
sought to build a media and communications empire in Central and
Eastern Europe, where governments are struggling to cope with
political and economic forces unleashed by the collapse of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday in London, another of Lauder's companies, Central
European Media Enterprises, was named in a civil lawsuit and
accused of having acted illegally in securing a television license
in Ukraine two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by a competing media company, Atlantic Group
Ltd., alleges that Central European Media conspired to get the
Ukraine government to take away a lucrative advertising and
broadcast license from Atlantic Group and give it to Central
European.
</P>
<P>
   An officer of Atlantic Group, David Stewart, said last Friday
that during the trial the plaintiffs will argue that Central
European Media had reason to believe that bribes were paid to
obtain the license.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Central European Media, Jerry Buckland, said
that the lawsuit was ``factually false, legally meritless and
motivated by a desire to extract money from CME.`'' He added that
the company ``categorically denied'' that any bribes had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people named as a co-conspirators in the lawsuit is
Vadim Rabinovich, Lauder's partner in Ukraine, who spent nine years
in a Soviet prison and who American and European intelligence
officials say has links to Russian organized crime. &UR;  &LR;  At the time
of founding Central European Media, which operates television
stations throughout Eastern and Central Europe, Lauder entered the
burgeoning global telecommunications field with RSL, the company
name coming from his initials.
</P>
<P>
   RSL, which operates in more than 20 countries, displayed its
boldness last May when it signed a deal to provide international
telephone services in the Republic of Srpska, the
Serbian-controlled section of Bosnia, a region that has been
shunned by most foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   This helped Lauder when he sought the contract to provide
long-distance telecommunications services in Yugoslavia, a Yugoslav
official said. The official, who insisted on anonymity given the
repressive nature of Milosevic's rule, said that RSL had secured
the contract by going ``through political channels at the highest
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said he had been surprised that Lauder was entering
into the deal given the U.S. trade sanctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sanctions of varying degrees of severity have been in place
against Yugoslavia since 1992; after the Dayton peace agreement
that ended the fighting in Bosnia, many of the sanctions were
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, to punish Milosevic for his actions in Kosovo,
Clinton signed an executive order prohibiting all investment in
Serbia, one of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia; the other
republic, Montenegro, whose president has challenged Milosevic and
received diplomatic backing from Washington, was exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from the United States, which was trying to
block foreign investment in Serbia to keep the pressure on
Milosevic, Italian and Greek companies bought a combined 49 percent
of Serbia's telephone company two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody from RSL ever contacted the American Embassy in Belgrade
about the propriety of doing business with Milosevic, an embassy
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   If RSL had done so, the embassy would have told the company that
the deal was a violation of law and policy, American officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Clinton administration is trying to persuade
a French company not to enter into a contract with a Yugoslav
company, and RSL's deal is making it harder to make that case,
American officials said.

 &HT;    Student discipline bill finds support even among critics
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The controversial centerpiece of Gov. Roy Barnes'
student discipline bill -- giving teachers more power to remove
disruptive students -- addresses a problem that most critics and
even supporters agree only occurs where leadership or resources are
sadly lacking. Specifically, the bill could force the principal to
find another place for a disruptive student when a teacher wants to
kick the student out of class against the principal's wishes. It's
a rare situation, most educators acknowledge. But whether the
proposed solution is the best one when things get this bad is a
matter of intense disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony taken by a House subcommittee for the first time last
week made this much clear: The bill is flawed, but has too much
support to be stopped. The subcommittee is expected to pass it on
today to the House education committee.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how much critics will be allowed to tinker
without threatening the broad alliance that came together privately
to back the bill. Barnes made a campaign promise to support the
concept, and polls suggested that voters were enthusiastic too. But
keeping together the alliance of education groups is only a holding
pattern for Barnes, who will convene a commission to build his own
education plan for next year. ``This bill is not the governor's
position on education,'' said Rep. Winfred Dukes (D-Albany), who
presented the bill for Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Christmas, whose 46,000-member teacher organization
Professional Association of Georgia Educators (PAGE) supports the
bill, at least officially, testified that it won't change anything
``where there is strong leadership.'' But where the teacher doesn't
have the skills to handle these students, she said, removing them
from class can make a difference for the other students in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ashley, head of the Georgia School Boards Association,
which is also pushing the bill, said the only real change is a
valuable one _ the bill ``will highlight poor teachers and poor
principals.'' Good teachers, he explained later, will get fed up
with having to take difficult students from the weak teachers and
district administrators will recognize that there is a problem with
a principal who is frequently being overruled by subordinates on a
student placement panel. The proposed panel, which would be made up
of the teacher's peers, would decide whether to back the teacher's
decision to permanently remove the student from class.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Kathy Ashe (R-Atlanta), a former teacher who last year
heard months of testimony from experts on student discipline, said
poor teachers and principals don't need a new law _ there are
plenty of neglected laws and polices that ought to be put to better
use, she said. What is needed from legislators is more funding to
address the academic and social problems that lead to disruption,
especially in elementary grades, Ashe said.
</P>
<P>
   GAE lobbyist Bob Cribbs said worries that conflicts between
teachers and principals are overblown, arguing the bill will
instead encourage more collaboration by forcing the teacher,
principal and members of the review team to discuss various
options.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, especially those representing the poor and minority
groups, picked at what they said were the bill's many flaws. The
Rev. Joseph Lowery, former president of the civil rights group the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, humored the hearing by
playfully asserting his preacherly prerogatives, then skewered the
bill as giving up on troubled children. ``We need to welcome them
in,'' he said. ``Saving their futures _ you ain't going to save it
sending them to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the bill's critics, instead of calling for its
defeat, sought compromise to address their concerns. They seek
amendments such as:
</P>
<P>
   Offering a role to parents of students removed from class. The
bill seeks parent involvement in framing local policies, but not in
deciding how their child is disciplined. Schools are required to
notify parents after the child's removal from class, but that could
happen as much as a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Safeguarding a student's right to a hearing whenever the student
is being removed from class for more than 10 days. Critics worry
that giving principals the unilateral power to place students into
``an alternative education program'' would send students into
long-term alternative schools without a formal hearing, as is now
guaranteed for any suspension of more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Making discipline of elementary-grade students different from
that of older students. The bill does not distinguish between a
5-year-old and a 17-year-old disruptive student, nor does it
provide an alternative place, such as a time-out room or smaller
class, specifically for kindergarten through 5th grade students.

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the pioneering heart surgeon, is
accustomed to having an audience when he wields his scalpel. Since
he performed the first successful human heart transplant in the
nation more than 30 years ago, a steady stream of medical
professionals and students have watched him at work in the
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, Cooley appeared in front of a a wider audience than
he had ever had before. He performed a 3 hour 40 minute coronary
bypass procedure in Houston that was transmitted live over the
Internet. More than 150,000 people tuned in to the Webcast over the
course of the day. In the months since, tens of thousands more have
reportedly logged on for information about the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was one of nine medical procedures put on the Web in
recent months by AHN.com, the World Wide Web companion to the cable
channel America's Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   Since AHN.com made headlines last June with its Webcast of the
birth of a baby, the site has made a signature _ and a multimedia
educational experience _ of these live medical dramas.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of attracting attention and audience, Victoria's Secret
fashion shows they are not. But they do generate publicity for the
network. They also help overcome one of the primary difficulties
faced by independent ventures: getting carried on cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distribution is the most obviously challenging part of the
cable network business these days.'' said Webster Golinkin,
president and co-founder of America's Health Network, which is
based at Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. ``While people talk
about the 500-channel environment, it's not here yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the network started the site to extend its reach,
and, Golinkin said, to respond to a growing public interest in
health information on the Web. ``Most other media businesses kind
of have their priorities in one place rather than the other,''
Golinkin said. ``It's either an Internet company or a cable
network, and if they have the other thing it's a stepchild.''
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network is available in 9.5 million American
homes, and an average of 2 million people around the world visit
the Web site each month, where a live signal of the television
channel is available, said J. Tod Fetherling, president of the Web
venture. Its potential to reach a wider audience is limited only by
the availability of Internet connections. Twenty-two percent of its
users come from overseas, said Fetherling, who cites traffic from
places like China, Malaysia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When partnerships that place AHN's content on ABCnews.com,
Yahoo, ESPN.com and Real Networks are figured in, it is probable
that AHN reaches a wider audience on the Web than it does on
television. (A syndication deal with Katz Dimensions, a subsidiary
of Katz Media Group, puts AHN content on radio, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast surgeries, accompanied by the subdued play-by-play
of a narrator, have the voyeuristic, cinema verite feel of
behind-the-scenes emergency room shows.
</P>
<P>
   These broadcasts almost did not happen. The television staff was
concerned about showing the childbirth live, but the Web staff
jumped on the idea, Fetherling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being interactive folks, we said, `Heck, yeah, let's try it.'
We had 1.4 million people watch the video stream live, and it blew
everybody away,'' he said. ``It showed us health on the Internet
and what it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   While television can demystify and humanize medical procedures
for information-hungry viewers, Fetherling said, the Internet
allows ``on demand'' access about specific procedures and ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is episodic,'' he said. ``You go on a research
binge when you are diagnosed with cancer or diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of the Internet as the digital age Dr. Spock is a
growing one. In addition to two coming cable health channels from
Discovery and Tele-Communications Inc., health resources on the
Internet have proliferated over the last several months. CNN.com
has just announced a partnership with an online health resource
called WebMD. In March, a private online service for doctors called
Medcast, which bills itself as the ``Bloomberg for the medical
profession,'' is being started by Greenberg News Network in
Atlanta. Alan Greenberg, a former publisher of Esquire magazine,
had built Medical News Network for Whittle Communications earlier
this decade before starting his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Another offering, the Seattle-based Onhealth.com, provides news,
columnists and data bases of health information, and features a
weekly audio talk show whose host is Brooke Gladstone of National
Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Two things have radically changed the way the public looks at
its health: managed care and the Internet, said Rebecca Farwell,
the editor in chief of Onhealth.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, you don't have to go to the library and look at
books published two years ago for information,'' Ms. Farwell said.
``You don't have to go to a support group, or talk to your doctors.
You can get everything in one place on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, increasingly, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals,
which can be purchased on line at the click of a button.
Advertisers are eager to offer their wares to a natural audience
for them. At the same time, doctors say they are eager to demystify
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting how little the average person knows about
physiology and anatomy,'' said Cooley, the heart surgeon, who added
that he was honored to perform a coronary bypass on the Internet.
``It helps people to know what goes on during the procedure, for a
person to see a beating heart.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When LuAnne Borzych filed a sexual harassment
charge last year with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
against an Orlando, Fla., shipping company, her complaint might
have disappeared into the commission like so many others in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the commission's branch office in Miami
suggested last April that Ms. Borzych and her employer submit their
dispute to official mediation. They agreed that if they reached a
settlement, the matter would not go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before a trained mediator took one day and involved
no lawyers. And while the small cash settlement she received was
not all that Ms. Borzych hoped for, she pronounced herself
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady that took care of the case was extremely good at what
she was doing,'' Ms. Borzych, 38, said in a telephone interview.
``She made me understand it on my level, everything that was being
said. She didn't guide me or direct me. I have to say I was
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borzych's experience illustrates what has been a significant
change in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency
that has long been considered one of the most troubled and
ineffective in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was an agency that barely got around to
investigating complaints, let alone taking any action against
companies that engaged in biased practices. The best that people
who filed charges could hope for was that after 180 days of sitting
on the complaint, the agency would grant permission to sue the
company in court _ a right the alleged victim already had.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the agency has more than halved its
backlog of cases, from a high of 111,451 in June 1995 to slightly
more than 52,000 today. In recent years it has won large
class-action discrimination cases against Mitsubishi Corp. and
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Congress boosted its budget by $37 million last year, the
agency's first increase in years. And even some critics among civil
rights groups and plaintiffs' lawyers have started to once again
recommend that victims of alleged bias on the job file complaints
with the agency. That is a marked change from the last years of the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying we are thrilled with the state of the
commission in 1999,'' said Nancy Kreiter, an official with Woman
Employed, a Chicago-based civil rights organization, who has been
one of the agency's harshest critics. ``But relative to the totally
broken agency that it was, it has been mended and put back together
and on its way to being a fully functioning enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the commission's resurrection has gone to
Gilbert Casellas, the former chairman who instituted a number of
reforms to bring down the backlog, promoted alternative ways of
resolving disputes, including mediation and arbitration, and looked
to file high-profile lawsuits that jolted other companies into
becoming aware the kind of practices that often spawned
discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups were able to pressure the
Republican-controlled Congress into providing more funds for the
agency by asserting that it was hypocritical for conservative
opponents of affirmative action to say all that is needed is to
help minorities and women is the strict enforcement of anti-bias
laws, and then not to increase funds for agencies like the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   And some labor experts say the thriving economy has also helped,
since allegations of bias often proliferate during times when
companies are laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot mediation program that handled Ms. Borzych's cases was
begun two years ago as one of a number of reforms. In 1997, the
program won $10.8 million in settlements for 780 people. Last year,
settlements climbed to $17 million for 1,500 complaints. With new
funds, the agency is planning to expand the program with a goal of
reaching 8,000 settlements in the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Ida Castro, the current chairwoman of the commission hopes that
by diverting more cases into mediation, ``we can invest our
resources to go after the really bad actors, those companies that
simply refuse to adhere to the law.'' In addition, Ms. Castro said
the agency would have more time and money to devote to cases that
would help clarify and establish precedents in federal employment
discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect, however. The agency still takes an average
of 276 days to adjudicate a complaint, nowhere near the goal of
fewer than 120 days that Ms. Castro has set. And Casellas said too
many lawyers in the agency's field offices still file frivolous and
poorly thought-out class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got too many cowboys out there who want notches on their
belts,'' Casellas said. ``Everybody's looking for the next
Mitsubishi.'' Begun in 1965 to handle complaints of job
discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin and
age (disability was added later), the agency has always been a
bureaucratic mess. Unlike other regulatory agencies, such as the
Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it has never had the resources or management talent to
prevent the large number of complaints filed with it annually from
piling up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deals with real people as opposed to other regulatory
agencies that deal with industries where there are big dollars at
stake,'' said Lawrence Lorber, a labor law lawyer who represents
large corporations. ``So there is an institutional interest _
whether people like them or not _ to have those agencies work well.
You've never had that with the EEOC.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlog grew significantly during the chairmanship of
Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court Justice, who believed that
each complaint, no matter how trivial, should be fully
investigated. The number grew even more during the 1990s with the
tenure of Evan Kemp, who took over the agency at a time when its
responsibility expanded following the passage of the Americans With
Disabilities Act. The act made it unlawful to discriminate against
people with physical and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency drifted without leadership in the first years of the
Clinton administration. Casellas, Clinton's first appointed
chairman, did not take over until October 1994. Five weeks later
the Republicans took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   `The overarching strategy was to get the backlog down, keep the
Republicans in Congress engaged and committed and show them that I
wasn't a firebrand,'' said Casellas, who is now in private
business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He instituted a system of triage both for pending cases and new
complaints. Investigators would look at the charges and urge those
filing complaints to submit them first to binding arbitration, and
later, when money became available for the pilot program, to
mediation. People were urged to drop those complaints that looked
as if they had little or no merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it was clearing out the junk in the system, and more
carefully screening the in-coming cases,'' Casellas said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also began holding seminars with businesses to
explain the intricacies of federal employment discrimination law.
The view was that if businesses were more familiar with the law,
they would take fewer actions that might result in complaints to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the agency vigorously pursued a series of
high-profile class-action discrimination lawsuits in recent years
that got the attention of many large corporations. It negotiated a
$34 million settlement in a sexual harassment suit against
Mitsubishi Motor Corp.'s American subsidiary last year, and a $183
settlement in 1997 in an age discrimination complaint that had been
filed against Lockheed Martin's predecessor, Martin Marietta.

 &HT;    Springfield coaxed back to TV by old `ER' pal
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner does George Clooney walk away from ``ER'' than Sherry
Stringfield comes back. Not to ``ER,'' but to NBC, where she stars
in a TV movie, ``Border Line,'' at 9 tonight (20629).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clooney, who has development deals and movie roles, and
who honored his contract by staying on ``ER'' even though he could
have left sooner, Stringfield departed ``ER'' suddenly and somewhat
strangely at the end of 1996. Her character, Dr. Susan Lewis, was
getting some of the series' juiciest stories _ a halting love
affair with Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) after having adopted,
then given back, her crazy sister's baby.
</P>
<P>
   She said at the time she wanted to slow down, move back to New
York and get married, all of which she did. She said, in so many
words, that the hectic grind of filming ``ER'' was getting her
down. ``It's a lifestyle thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Stringfield has hosted a Lifetime
documentary, directed some theater and taught acting classes at
State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because people say, you know, 'the comeback,''' she
says. ``And I'm like, well, I didn't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of offers,'' she says of her hiatus away from
the spotlight. ``But it was just really time for me to go, 'It
doesn't work for me right now.' Acting, I was kind of staying away
from.''
</P>
<P>
   What did work for Stringfield was a call from her old pal
Edwards, who was executive producer of ``Border Line.'' (NBC will
pretty much let Edwards, the star who holds ``ER'' together now, do
anything he can find the time for.) He and his production partner,
Dante DiLoreto had bought an old feature film script that had been
banging around for years and had it adapted into a TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Border Line,'' Stringfield plays an immigration attorney
who uncovers an Asian crime ring smuggling immigrants. Christopher
Reid (former high-haired member of rap duo Kid 'N Play, now with
regular hair) is a private detective and ElizabethPena is her
helpful nanny.Kloer writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution

 &HT;    Sign of the Times: Six-time champion Bulls battle for
respectability
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago _ Sign of the times for the NBA champions: There was no
police motorcade for the Chicago Bulls on Sunday from Hartsfield
International Airport to the downtown Ritz Carlton. No extra
security at the hotel, no mob of adoring fans awaiting their
arrival. And there was no need for reserve guard Randy Brown to
check in under last year's alias ``Fred G. Sanford.'' They are
champs in name only now, their stature stripped like a car left on
a dark New York street.
</P>
<P>
   The special treatment of the Bulls of Michael Jordan, Scottie
Pippen, Dennis Rodman, et al., no longer exists. These Bulls of
Rusty LaRue, Kornel David, Cory Carr and Charles Jones could be a
rock-band backups, for all that an NBA observer knows, while the
old crew got rock-star attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's definitely different around here,'' said guard Ron
Harper, the lone carryover starter from the championship teams. He
used to smoke cigars and play poker on chartered flights as a
post-victory routine with Jordan and Pippen. Now, he's resigned to
a set of headphones with music blasting to take him as far away
from the atrocity that is the1999 Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   With the retirements of Jordan and coach Phil Jackson, Pippen's
sign-and-trade deal to Houston and the club's unwillingness to
bring back the enigmatic Rodman, the three-peat champions
disintegrated into something less than ordinary. It has been a
rapid descent to the doldrums, the Bulls no longer a team that
signified the ultimate in team sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too different to even describe,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times for the NBA champions: In the Bulls' last
visit to Atlanta, an NBA-record 62,046 fans showed up at the
Georgia Dome. It was widely thought to be Jordan's last game here,
and the fans paid great homage. Tonight, Chicago receives the
ultimate local indignation _ they play the Hawks at Georgia Tech,
which seats a paltry 9,300. And they still might not fill up the
building.
</P>
<P>
   This from a team that played before a sold-out building in every
game since Jordan returned from playing baseball in 1995. In their
first game of the season, at the Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago
attracted fewer than 7,000 fans at the Sports Arena. It was as if
the Clippers were playing Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``A looong time,'' Brown said when asked about how long it had
been since he played in such an atmosphere. ''Weird.''
</P>
<P>
   It is weird also to be in Chicago and not overhear conversations
at the malls or restaurants about the brilliance of the Bulls.
Weird to see empty spaces on the coat rack in the press room; media
coverage has dropped off as much as Windy City interest.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hawks played in Chicago last Tuesday, neither the
Chicago Sun-Times nor the Chicago Tribune had a columnist cover the
game _ unheard of in previous years, no matter the opponent. When
the Bulls traveled during the glory days, every local television
network affiliate sent at least one sports anchor on the road with
the team. This year, Jim Rose of the Chicago ABC affiliate _ who
has covered virtually every Bulls game in the last three years _
said he had made one trip so far and will not make any others the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. The Bulls were gutted so severely by
general manager Jerry Krause that there hardly is a semblance of
the team that captured a city. Worse, the talent left behind _ Toni
Kukoc, Brown, Harper _ is surrounded by mostly unheard journeymen
or unproven youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough,'' Kukoc said.
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times for the NBA champions: Right now, the people
are still coming to the games (546 home sellouts in a row), but the
no-shows are piling up. They've already sold out every game and all
the suites for this season, although many fans who anted up had
hoped for a Jordan return. But the United Center has the atmosphere
of a car show. People quietly watch what's on display.
</P>
<P>
   One of the loudest and most intimidating buildings in the league
has become an oversized stock room. Without Jordan and Co., it's
like visiting the Sistine Chapel without the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray Clay, the public-address announcer at the United
Center, introduces the Bulls, the noise level rises slightly above
a whisper. The adrenaline was siphoned off with the talent. In the
past, Clay's voice could hardly be heard over the cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost a little bit of the luster,'' Clay said in a gross
understatement. ''We have to work harder to make it exciting for
the fans. Sometimes we had to do that anyway, because the fans got
complacent because they knew the Bulls would win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we just hope for the team to score 70 points. It's still
fun for me, but you hate to see it like this. I'm just glad I've
got the memories to hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times for the NBA champions: Teams can't wait to
face the Bulls. It's payback time, and in a big way. ''No, I don't
feel sorry for them,'' said Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens, whose teams
in Cleveland and Atlanta were eliminated in the playoffs by Jordan
and Co. four times.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments are shared around the league. All that
swagger the Bulls carried during the championship years is gone.
They have one win _ over the equally woeful Clippers _ and entered
the weekend as the worst-scoring team in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is first-year coach Tim Floyd, coaching the
players signed by his pal Krause. Kukoc is talented but in need of
help. Forward Mark Bryant is a credible addition. But many others
seem out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Kornel David is the first NBA player from Hungary. Cory Carr,
Corey Benjamin and Charles Jones are little-known rookies. Center
Andrew Lang is a 10-year veteran whose best days are behind him _
and those weren't that good. Brent Barry, signed as a free agent,
starts in Jordan's spot. He's been less than average so far.
</P>
<P>
   So, a year after a third consecutive title, the Bulls are a
motley crew. They still run the once-vaunted triangle offense, but
now it's more like the octagon offense, with players scrambling all
over the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spacing is atrocious,'' center Bill Wennington said.
''Guys are running into each other. It's a system that works.
That's been shown. But it's not easy to run. It takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, it seemed NBC and TNT were the Bulls' flagship
stations. Last year, they were featured 23times in the regular
season on national television. This year? Once.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one former Bull understands the destruction of
the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going to win a championship without Michael
Jordan,'' said Steve Kerr, who had two late three-pointers to help
his new team, San Antonio, beat Chicago last week. ''I think the
time was right for everyone to move on. But if they kept us
together without Michael, we may have gotten to the second round in
the playoffs before losing. Michael is the greatest player ever. We
weren't going to win another one without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bulls are doing it the right way, rebuilding the thing,''
Kerr added. ''Emotionally, the fans have to realize it's the only
way to do it. I know it's going to be tough. But people have to be
patient for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a long while.

GINGRICH'S CHOICE TRYING TO AVOID A RUNOFF IN HOUSE RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Voters in Georgia's 6th Congressional District will
choose an heir to former speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday, and the
only suspense seems to be whether Gingrich's hand-picked successor,
Johnny Isakson, the state school board chairman, will win without a
runoff in a nonpartisan race against five opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, a prominent businessman, longtime former state
legislator, and twice-failed statewide candidate, is by far the
best-known, most-experienced, and best-financed candidate in the
field. Like all but one of the candidates, he is a Republican. The
6th District, which arcs across the affluent northern suburbs of
Atlanta, is considered one of the most reliably Republican
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, 54, has conducted a safe, front-runner's campaign,
embracing much of the Republican congressional leadership's
economic agenda while downplaying moderate stands on social issues
that have alienated conservatives in his past campaigns. With
several of his opponents running to his right, Isakson has
portrayed his centrism as more a matter of style than of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused oftentimes in this race of being a consensus
builder and I don't run away from that,'' Isakson said Sunday in
the only televised debate of the campaign, which was sponsored by
the Atlanta Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced shortly after last November's elections, when
the House Republican majority lost five seats, that he would resign
both the speakership and his congressional seat. Political leaders
in the district have fretted that his loss will mean reduced
federal support for defense contracts for Lockheed Martin, a
significant employer, and for pet Gingrich projects like land
preservation along the banks of the Chattahoochee River.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich has not formally endorsed Isakson, the former
speaker encouraged him to run by issuing a statement that called
him ``a very close personal friend'' who would ``do a great job of
representing Georgia's 6th District.'' Since announcing his
candidacy on Nov. 11, Isakson has raised nearly $1 million and
added $500,000 of his own money, dwarfing the combined fund-raising
of all of his opponents. He has maintained a steady advertising
presence on television and radio for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate with any name recognition is Christina
F. Jeffrey, 51, a professor at Kennesaw State University who was
hired and then fired by Gingrich in 1995 as historian of the House.
Gingrich dismissed her after learning that, while heading a federal
panel that reviewed an academic course on the Holocaust, Ms.
Jeffrey complained that the curriculum did not reflect the views of
the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates are Leigh Baier, 58, a businessman and
lawyer; Barry A. Doublestein, 45, the Republican chairman in the
neighboring 11th District; Marco Longo, 27, a sales representative;
and Gary Pelphrey, 63, a Democratic lawyer who was defeated by
Gingrich last November.
</P>
<P>
   To win on Tuesday, a candidate must win more than 50 percent of
the vote. If no one gains a majority, the two top candidates will
compete in a runoff on March 16.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russell K. Paul, the state Republican chairman, said the race
resembles a Republican primary far more than a general election,
and he said the contest has centered on stylistic differences more
than substantive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas Newt was referred to as a bomb-thrower and a
revolutionary, he was also a bridge-burner,'' Paul said. ``And
Johnny Isakson is perceived as the quintessential bridge-builder.''
Ms. Jeffrey, he said, is more dogmatically conservative than
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   When running in a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in
1996, Isakson took the unusual step of using a television
commercial to highlight his support for abortion rights. In this
campaign, he has spoken about that position only when pressed, and
his advertising has focused on his support for a 10 percent tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's debate, Ms. Jeffrey referred to herself as ``the
real Reagan Republican in this race,'' and said she would call for
even deeper tax cuts. She also said she was ``unashamedly
pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson was the only candidate who complimented the impeachment
process, saying the civil nature of the proceedings demonstrated
that ``the Constitution of the United States of America works.''
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates all criticized the process. ``The
Constitution was misused in the impeachment process in order to get
the problem out of the way, and the senators wanted the problem out
of the way since the polls said the people wanted it out of the
way,'' Ms. Jeffrey said. ``We lost a tremendous opportunity to
provide leadership, to discuss the question of honor, to discuss
the question of what it is we want in a president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Doublestein said that ``our leaders should be held to a
different standard. They should be above reproach. And frankly I'm
a little tired of our president talking about ending the politics
of personal destruction when in reality we should be asking him to
stop the politics of personal deceit.''

 &HT;    World Championship drawing great interest
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlsbad, Calif. -- Whether it becomes as important as a major
championship seems doubtful. But the inaugural event of the World
Golf Championships, the Andersen Consulting Match Play, has
generated major interest.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a draw sheet of the world's top 64 players presents a
heretofore missing bit of, well, February Madness. In the pro
ranks, so little match play is conducted that when such a
tournament comes along -- featuring a $1 million first prize -- it
brings a refreshing brand of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   First-round matches begin Wednesday morning at the La Costa
resort, just north of San Diego, culminating with a 36-hole final
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``In a 72-hole event, we
put a lot of emphasis on, `Oh, it was a good tournament. I had a
top 10.' What I think match play brings to the table is either win
or lose, period.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tiger Woods being so impressively resurgent lately, he's
the logical favorite. But there's also David Duval, who has played
significantly better than Woods for the last year and a half. Duval
is not fond of match-play competition; Woods normally thrives in
such an head-to-head environment, as evidenced by his three U.S.
Amateurs and a record 18 straight match-play victories. He will be
playing in his home area on a course he knows well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost put Tiger in the quarterfinals or semifinals
because of his record,'' Fred Couples said. ``He's the guy to beat
-- not Greg Norman, not Ernie Els, not anyone. Tiger Woods would
have to be licking his chops when he gets to La Costa.''
</P>
<P>
   While the PGA Tour has over-hyped a new competition such as the
Presidents Cup, attempting to draft on the success of the Ryder
Cup, the WGC's Match Play Championship has caught on without
prodding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that in not that far off (the match play) has
the potential to become a major event,'' Mickelson said. ``Not in
that sense that you will look at it as a major championship, but I
think very close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole purpose of this event -- getting more
worldwide exposure,'' John Cook said. ``Getting more worldwide
players to play together instead of just the Ryder Cup or the Open
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, playing for the first time on the PGA Tour this year,
also should be a factor at La Costa. Els has three World Match Play
victories in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with match play every fan wants to see a bit of a dog
fight, a head-to-head fight,'' said Els, whose unflappable demeanor
is suited for the tournament. ``We play so many stroke-play events
through the year that I think people have forgotten how exciting
match play can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In) a stroke-play event you kind of play yourself into
position, hopefully for the weekend to make your move,'' Els said.
``But with this event, you've got one match a day, and if you lose,
you go home. It's good-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who won the short-lived Andersen
Consulting World Championship of Golf, knows La Costa well, being
in the back yard of Callaway Golf's Carlsbad headquarters.
Montgomerie won the Andersen event last year, but that competition
lasted almost eight months and was seeded regionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I'm the defending champion, it's a different event
than it was when I won,'' said Montgomerie. ``I think there is
excitement regarding the World Golf Championshp events, and it's
important to put into perspective that they're not major
championships. . . . But there's plenty of space on the calendar
for the world's top golfers to get together more often. I think
individual tour rankings will become more meaningless as the years
go on, and a world ranking will become even more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will play against a struggling Nick Faldo in the first
round. If Woods advances, he could play Atlanta's Stewart Cink in
the third round.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREE TO REDUCE RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ The prime ministers of India and Pakistan
pledged Sunday to take immediate steps to reduce the risk of
nuclear war and seek solutions to a half-century of raging
disputes, including their most volatile source of discord, the
conflict in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements between the world's newest nuclear powers were
announced in two signed documents and a joint statement, all issued
at the end of a historic weekend bus trip to Pakistan by Atal
Behari Vajpayee, the first Indian prime minister to visit the
country in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after the two nations tested their bombs, their
leaders spoke truculently of each other as both populations
celebrated a sort of nuclear euphoria. Now, eight and a half months
later, the two prime ministers amiably sat side by side exchanging
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must bring peace to our people,'' Pakistan's prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, said at a joint press conference in the
elegant mansion of the governor of Punjab. ``We must bring
prosperity to our people. We owe this to ourselves and to future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere of the summit meeting was decidedly cordial
_ and the very act of their meeting extraordinary _ there had been
some expectation of a monumental breakthrough, such as a joint
agreement to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agreements were long on good intentions and short
on details. The two countries mostly talked about how they would
continue to talk, listing areas for discussion: the liberalizing of
visa rules, coordinating trade positions, releasing prisoners and
detainees.
</P>
<P>
   A ``memorandum of understanding,'' was presented, the nations
promising to build trust in each other through a series of
high-level bilateral meetings and to adopt measures that would
prevent any accidental launch of their destructive weaponry.

CHINA THREATENING TO END U.N. PEACEKEEPING IN MACEDONIA
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the peace talks over Kosovo limp along
outside Paris, Western diplomats here are increasingly fearful that
China will add to the troubles in the Balkans by abruptly ending a
U.N. peacekeeping force in Macedonia, which borders both Kosovo and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Macedonia, which broke from the former Yugoslavia in
1992, angered China by recognizing Taiwan in return for a
substantial but undisclosed aid package, reckoned here to be worth
anywhere from $1 billion to $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has
consistently sought to punish countries that recognize it as an
independent state. Conversely, Taiwan, with a prosperous
industrialized economy, is known to have offered substantial
rewards to the countries that do.
</P>
<P>
   The fear now is that in retaliation for this slight, China will
use its veto as a permanent member of the Security Council to block
renewal of the mandate of the 1,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force
that has been deployed as a kind of firebreak to war and
instability along Macedonia's border since March 1995. The mandate
is up for renewal at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Annan recommended that the Security Council keep the
Macedonia force in place for at least another six months. He said
its presence has helped insulate Macedonia, about a third of whose
population are ethnic Albanians, against ``spillover'' from the
fighting between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo as well as
from the general instability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western Security Council members
feel the Macedonian peacekeeping force should be kept in place at
least until the crisis in Kosovo has been defused. But Chinese
diplomats have warned that they ``cannot be responsible for the
consequences'' of Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan.

U.S. URGES RUSSIA TO HELP AVOID FALSE NUCLEAR ALERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The United States has urged Russia to set up a joint
missile-warning center before the end of the year to reduce the
risk that the year 2000 computer problem might trigger a false
nuclear alert.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was made in talks last week between U.S. and
Russian defense officials, a senior Pentagon official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a broader effort to prevent the millennium bug
from disrupting Russian systems used to warn of enemy attack and to
maintain control over the nation's vast nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians responded with interest,'' the official, Edward
Warner, an assistant secretary of defense, said in an interview.
``We just informed them within the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 approaches, experts around the world have been
concerned about computer breakdowns that might occur if software
misinterprets the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has received substantially less attention in Russia
than in the West. It remains a worry for military specialists,
however, who fear that computer problems might disrupt radar and
command systems on which the Russians depend to retaliate against a
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say the danger of an accidental nuclear war
is minimal, even if the millennium bug is not fully eradicated. A
sober-minded military leadership and a general awareness of the
year 2000 problem, they say, should be sufficient to prevent the
Russians from inadvertently firing their nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression that either side has a fully computerized
system is false,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon does not want to take any chances. Even
before the year 2000 problem arose, experts had been concerned that
miscalculation might lead the two sides to stumble into a nuclear
war. In 1995, for example, the Russian military initially
misinterpreted the launching of a Norwegian scientific rocket as a
possible submarine missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Russia's network of early-warning radars and
satellites has decayed, adding to U.S. concerns. The Russian radar
station at Skrunde, Latvia, has been closed, leaving a gap in the
military's radar coverage in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian decision to abandon its radar at Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, has also left the nation with a gap in the northeastern
part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Begun during Soviet times, the construction of that radar system
violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which stipulated
that such systems be located on the periphery of each side's
territory. The radar was dismantled during the waning years of the
Soviet Union at the insistence of the United States, which was
primarily worried about the Soviet military threat.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal that Pentagon officials presented last week is
actually a variant of a plan on which the two sides agreed when
President Clinton met with President Boris Yeltsin in September,
but it has yet to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   During their summit meeting, they signed an accord uner which
the United States and Russia would instantly share data about the
launching of ballistic missiles and space payloads.
</P>
<P>
   It was a major step toward cooperation between the former
adversaries, which would have been unthinkable during the Cold War.
But the very easing of tensions that made the agreement possible
also seemed to detract from the urgency of carrying it out _ at
least, for the Russians, who have been preoccupied with political
and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon still hopes to carry out the September accord. But
fearful that the agreement may not be carried out before January
2000, it is now urging that it be put into effect on a temporary
basis, if necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to build a temporary bridge across the year
2000,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it would work. A joint missile-warning center would
be established, probably in the vicinity of Moscow. It would be
staffed with both U.S. and Russian officers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would transmit data about missile launches
from its satellite and land-based radars to that center and also
separately to the Russian military's command center.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. data, in effect, would help the Russians plug the gaps
in their early-warning system and help prevent them from
misidentifying a launch. The U.S. officers would help sort out any
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only step under discussion. Pentagon officials
plan to return in about a month and discuss technical issues about
how the year 2000 problem can be diagnosed and fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has been reluctant to allow
outsiders, including Russians who do not work for the agency, to
inspect its computers. But U.S. officials may be able to provide
some useful advice without inspecting the Russian systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has publicly said that it has the
situation under control. Other Russian officials have not been so
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to admit that not all agencies have achieved positive
results,'' Alexander Krupov, chairman of the State Communications
Committee, said last month. ``Such structures as the Defense
Ministry have significant difficulties as regards all types of
missiles.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frigid air will cover the Northeast as a large high-pressure
system over Quebec transports unseasonably cold air into the
region. A storm will strengthen well off the New England coast, but
its expansive circulation will send clouds and snow showers toward
Cape Cod. A pool of very cold air at 5,000 feet over the northern
Appalachians will cause cumulus clouds and a few flurries near the
southern end of Lakes Ontario and Erie.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be chilly but dry, with plenty of sunshine.
After a cold morning with freezing temperatures near the Gulf
Coast, the afternoon will be pleasantly cool with light winds.
Onshore flow will bring ocean clouds into southeast Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will gather from the Mississippi Valley to the western
Plains as a potent disturbance exits the Rockies. Light to moderate
snow will fall from the Dakotas to northern Kansas. A few showers
will develop farther south once the humid air from the Gulf of
Mexico arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds and cool air will invade the southern Rockies along
with clear skies. High pressure will build into Nevada from the
eastern Pacific. On its southern flank, offshore winds will draw
mild, dry air to the southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   An intense storm will skirt Vancouver Island as very mild, moist
air is drawn into the Northwest. Gales and heavy rain will buffet
the coast, with snow levels rising steadily in the Cascades.
Showers will dampen sections of the interior Northwest as cold air
retreats; there may be wet snow or ice in some valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Party Is Over
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose to a record 84 degrees at Hollywood, Fla., on
Saturday, eclipsing the previous record set in 1988 by 1 degree.
This warmth ended on Sunday as a cold front pushed through south
Florida. Despite the early signs of spring and summer around
southern Florida, the chilliest air of the year should arrive this
week. A persistent and strong wind from the north will drive colder
air far down the peninsula. After a very mild winter, with readings
averaging 3 to 5 degrees above seasonal levels, a shift in the jet
stream will make some Floridians shiver before long.

NIGERIAN ELECTIONS REAFFIRM STANDING OF LEADING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENUGU, Nigeria _ With a week to go before Nigeria is scheduled
to hold presidential elections, preliminary results from the
weekend's legislative contests showed the main party clinging to
its lead despite a weakening of support in the eastern section of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two smaller parties, the Alliance for Democracy
and the All People's Party, garnered fewer than half the seats for
the Nigerian Senate and House of Representatives. The People's
Democratic Party still dominated the elections, the third set in as
many months. But its support eroded here in eastern Nigeria, which
has become the battleground for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The two smaller parties have joined forces by presenting a
common presidential candidate, Olu Falae, a former finance
minister, against Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who was president from
1976 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As the party with the most money and the backing of powerful
retired generals, the People's Democratic Party is still favored to
win the presidency on Saturday. But it appeared to have lost
support here among the Ibo, one of the country's three main ethnic
groups, along with the Hausa-Fulani of the north and the Yoruba of
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, during primaries in the central city of Jos, the
party chose Obasanjo, a Yoruba, as its presidential candidate over
Alex Ekwueme, a former vice president and probably the most
prominent Ibo politician in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jos convention was a major coup for us,'' said Arthur
Nwankwo, a leader of the Alliance for Democracy, in an interview in
his office here.
</P>
<P>
   In local government elections in December and statewide
elections last month, the People's Democratic Party swept Enugu
state. But as results of Saturday's elections here for the national
legislature were announced Sunday, they showed that the two small
parties had won the Senate seats _ two for the Alliance for
Democracy and one for the All People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, of the eight House of Representative seats, the
Alliance for Democracy captured two seats and the All People's
Party three. Three went to the People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the People's Democratic Party here downplayed the
results. They said the results reflected the successes and failures
of individual candidates and predicted that their party would
dominate in the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we don't have these problems,'' said Ayogu Eze,
the party's secretary in Enugu state. ``We do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the edges have been blunted out,'' he added, explaining
that party leaders had reduced the initial general anger over
Ekwueme's loss and that by Saturday most voters here would support
their party.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives and senators will shape legislation in a
country ruled by the military for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 36 states will be represented by three senators,
with the federal capital territory of Abuja getting one seat. As in
the United States, the number of representatives for each state
will vary based on the population.
</P>
<P>
   Results were released Sunday night for 74 of the 109 Senate
seats. The People's Democratic Party won 43; the All People's Party
13 and the Alliance for Democracy 18.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 273 Representative seats, out of 360, for which results
were announced, 154 went to the People's Democratic Party. The All
People's Party and the Alliance for Democracy captured 47 and 72,
respectively.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saturday's elections were marked by a low turnout across the
country, but, like the two previous elections, were generally
considered fair.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Democratic Party won overwhelmingly in the local
and statewide elections in the last two months. As a result, the
All People's Party, whose base is in the north, and the Alliance
for Democracy, which is basically a Yoruba party of the southwest,
decided to present a common presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Among Saturday's winners in the House of Representatives was
Lola Abiola-Edewor, the daughter of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the Yoruba
businessman whose apparent victory in the 1993 presidential
elections were annulled by the military. Abiola was jailed by Gen.
Sani Abacha, the late dictator, and died in detention last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha himself had died a few weeks earlier, paving the way for
his successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who quickly announced the
end of military rule and the elections _ which are expected to
culminate in a handover to a civilian government on May 29.

 &HT;    Michael Dell joins the tech book club
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Dell, the manufacturing and marketing innovator,
billionaire and philanthropist who turns 34 on Tuesday, adds
another category to his resume with the March 4 publication of his
book, ``Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an
Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder, chief executive and chairman of Dell Computer Corp.
will announce the book in New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the company will have a reception at the University of
Texas, where he started the business in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Dell will travel to Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Washington, D.C., Chicago, Boston, Dallas and Houston on a media
tour to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly TV broadcast media in major city centers,'' he
said, adding with a laugh, ``We won't be appearing at the local
bookstores.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell talked with Austin American-Statesman tech writer Jerry
Mahoney recently at Dell's headquarters in Round Rock. This is an
edited transcript of that interview:
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't sensed from you any eagerness to position yourself
as a giant in the industry. But this book is going to (Dell laughs)
... You know, all those airport bookstands: Your picture is going
to be all over the place. How do you feel about that?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's a little bit hard to hide at this point. (Laughs) I mean,
I have some reluctance about it just because I don't tend to like
to shine the spotlight on myself. I do think that if you read the
book, you'll find it's highly oriented toward the company and the
company's business as opposed to, you know, let me tell you all the
wonderful things I did, or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Well, there were instances during my reading of the book that
I wished there had been more personal glimpses.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself saying, what was it like, what were you feeling?
You know, when you're 28 years old, a $2 billion company and you
hit the wall? Who is the book aimed at?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think the book is really aimed at a very broad audience, and
_ I'm not sure I'd be too excited here _ I think it's going to be a
broadly accepted business text on a new way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is that a gut feeling or have there been surveys?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's more of an intuitive feel based on interest that there
seems to be. I previewed the book with a couple of people _ many of
whom have provided quotes, like Idei-son (Idei Nobuyuki), who is
the CEO of Sony. And, you know, Dell in Japan is sort of thought of
as a whole new way of doing business. There seems to be enough
indication that would suggest it's going to be fairly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It will be published in Japanese?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're working on several foreign-language translations.
Japanese and Chinese are pretty high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Is your remuneration for the book tied to sales?
</P>
<P>
   A:All the compensation for the book goes to the Dell Foundation,
which benefits probably more Austinites than it does people around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What was the origin of the project?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, I had a number of people, publishers, who were coming to
me for, you know, really years, saying, ``You've got to do a book,
gotta do a book, gotta do a book.'' And I thought, ``I don't want
to do a book, leave me alone, go away.'' (Laughs)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it just became an obvious thing to do. I guess you
could partially say that I did the book because I wanted to tell
the story in my own words and not have somebody else write a book
and tell it as an outsider's view.
</P>
<P>
   It also _ not trying to be too commercial here _ is a great
explanation of the strategies and competitive advantage that Dell
derives, which I think will be a boost to our brand and to the
company's success. I didn't really write the book for this reason,
but a number of people inside the company have told me that they
think it is almost a handbook for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Q:And a lot of young businesses will be looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   A:Yeah, I also think that there's a role that I end up playing,
which is as an example for other people that want to start
businesses. And that's an important role for me to play. So this
gives the next guy who wants to go start a business some
inspiration to think about things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Early in the book, you say you recognized that you needed to
grow in employees and management staff and so on, because you saw a
need for a ``healthy balance'' in your life between work and
family. Have you got that?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think so, yeah. Sometimes after a long trip, you know, I
feel kind of tired (laughs). But I think I have a reasonably
healthy balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You've probably got some insights there that some people would
like to hear, in terms of managing your time.
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, you kind of have to schedule, just like anything else.
But, you know, most people in the business world could occupy well
more than 100 percent of the available hours and even the
unavailable hours of the day with things. What I've realized is
there is a diminishing return to my effectiveness beyond a certain
number of hours, and you're not very happy if you don't have the
other sides of your life. Whether it's with your family, and with
your kids, with exercise, with sleep, and all the things that keep
us happy and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You were a little bit harder dealing with IBM than Compaq in
the book. You talk about IBM's effort to put essentially a
proprietary system out there to regain market share. And you saw
that wasn't going to work.
</P>
<P>
   A:If you go back to 1987, when IBM introduced the PS/2. This was
basically the biggest legal transfer of wealth in the PC industry
that ever occurred. (Laughs) They basically gave the market to Dell
and Compaq, because they abandoned the (system) that every customer
was buying.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some customers went along with them, but most customers
said, ``Forget that. We're staying with the industry standard.''
And the ball got handed off to Dell and Compaq. And of course,
Intel was very happy to work with us. Microsoft was very happy to
work with us. The OS/2 thing was under the guise of this is going
to be better, it's going to have all these advantages, but it
really didn't deliver for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q:When I saw the recent news of Microsoft's restructuring by
customer segments, I wondered, did any of that seem familiar to
you?
</P>
<P>
   A: What a lot of technology companies are realizing is that
customer behavior is different, whether you're a consumer, or small
business, a large or mid-sized company, K-12, higher education or a
global company. It's not enough to have groups that are building
products for those customers. You really have to understand how the
customers behave, which affects not only the products they want,
but the way they buy, the way they need support.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly segmentation, as I think I describe pretty fully
in the book, has been a wonderful strategy for us. It's been a
strategy that's very hard for our competitors to copy, because they
tend to sell through the indirect channel.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get CompUSA to sell to K-12 or to higher education,
and know the specifics about those markets. ... Not only do they
not have the margin to do it, they don't really have any way of
gaining a body of knowledge, where Dell has very large buildings
full of people who just serve very particular markets.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In the book, you talk about the early '90s and you were
thinking about expanding in Britain. You're in the office of
British Petroleum, and it's expensive real estate and they have
almost a whole floor dedicated to configuring their PCs. You said
Dell could do that for them.
</P>
<P>
   A:Right. We were selling them the box, and they would put the
network card in and put the software on and put the asset tag on.
</P>
<P>
   It started with us loading basic software images and then
migrated to things like network cards, which seem pretty simple
today. But at the time, it was quite revolutionary. The customer
said, ``Oh, you can put the network card in for us? That's
incredible. How do you do that?'' (Laughs)
</P>
<P>
   Some early customers sort of pushed us into this direction, and
we were learning from them. And we would talk about our best
customers as the ones who taught us new things. They would kind of
help us learn what we needed to do to be an even better partner for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How much later did you get to DellPlus?
</P>
<P>
   (Note: DellPlus is the name of Dell's innovative factory process
that installs a customer's proprietary software and other
customization to thousands of computers before they are shipped.)
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, it was very gradual. I mean, I think we started this
with two or three customers and then 10 or 20, and then 30 or 40.
Then it became more of a standardized business, but it occurred
over really a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Does Dell's experience apply to other companies and
industries?
</P>
<P>
   A:That's a very good question. I think there are lessons from
our experience in the past 15 years that apply across any business.
Let's say you have five companies that all compete in a given
industry, like cars, for example. And nobody has broken out of the
mold doing things differently. Well, they could actually exist in
that state for a long time, unless somebody or until somebody sort
of says, ``Hey, you know, we've got engines over here, we've got
frames over here. We could sell the cars this way. We don't need to
use this old business model.'' Then the guys who have been in the
business for a long time are kind of left to react.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There are voices out there in the industry that say the PC as
we know it may not be around all that much longer: The Internet's
going to change things, people don't need processing speed, they
need bandwidth, etc. But your argument has been that worldwide
penetration of some computing devices is so low that there is going
to be a market.
</P>
<P>
   A: I also believe that as you have more ``information devices,''
whether they're telephones or televisions or cars that have
information processing of some type, that will only expand the
universe of the whole overall market, with the PC growing as well.
I don't think a telephone that provides Internet access will
replace a PC.
</P>
<P>
   It may cause people to use their PC more, because now they kind
of get this phone and go, ``Hey, now I get Internet access, but I
can't quite see everything on the phone, so I'll go back to my desk
and work.'' Or they may get introduced to the Internet with a
telephone or with a television, but the next purchase _ not to make
the telephone or television go away _ the next purchase they make
as consumers might be a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Have you given any thought to, five years down the road, what
might be the sequel to ``Direct from Dell?''
</P>
<P>
   A:(Laughs) I've been thinking more about what happens in the
next two or three years, than necessarily writing another book.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A corporate duel between Italy's two largest telephone companies
unfolded over the weekend with all the trappings of a Fellini epic:
part drama, part farce, part mystery.
</P>
<P>
   By the accounts of people close to the companies, Olivetti's bid
began taking shape last fall, when it first approached Italian
government officials and financiers about a takeover. But what now
looms as among the largest European corporate takeovers ever took
final shape on a weekend ricochet between board rooms and lawyers'
offices in Rome and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay opened on Friday, when Olivetti, Italy's No. 2
phone company, announced a board meeting for Sunday to discuss a
hostile bid for its major domestic rival, Telecom Italia, the
former state-owned monopoly phone company. Olivetti's share price
had soared on rumors of the impending deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be caught napping, Telecom Italia summoned its board to
its Rome headquarters for a Saturday afternoon meeting, presumably
to devise a defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Olivetti feared that a Telecom Italia announcement could
pre-empt its own. So it gathered its board even earlier on
Saturday, at a lawyer's office in Milan, beating Telecom to the
punch with the announcement that it would go after its much larger
rival with a combination of cash, stocks and bonds worth $60
billion.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the deal makes little sense for Olivetti, the
former typewriter company that has reinvented itself in recent
years as a provider of phone service. To finance its assault,
Olivetti said it would sell the most profitable parts of its phone
business to its phone business partner, the German giant Mannesmann
A.G., for about $10 billion, then raise the remaining $50 billion
through debt and the sale of assets.
</P>
<P>
   For Olivetti, the offer is fraught with risk and uncertainty.
Telecom Italia remains a bloated and inefficient company that has
undergone three major management changes in the last 18 months.
Moreover, the original terms set by the Italian government for
Olivetti's entry into the phone market now make it questionable
whether the company can sell its existing phone businesses to
Mannesmann without special government permission.
</P>
<P>
   And the deal will be very expensive. Fed up with the foundering
at Telecom, its shareholders in December enlisted Franco Bernabe to
turn Telecom around. Bernabe, 50, one of Italy's most talented
turnaround artists, had been running the big Italian oil group, ENI
S.p.A.. Since he took over, Telecom's share price has shot up
nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all these hurdles, Olivetti Chairman Roberto
Colaninno insists the logic of the offer is clear. In interviews
over the weekend, Colaninno said that Telecom faced the threat of a
foreign takeover that would leave one of the nation's industrial
jewels in non-Italian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno started thinking seriously about taking over Telecom
Italia as early as last fall. It was then that he met with
government officials in several departments seeking support, people
close to the companies said. The government cannot officially
support the bid, but officials expressed interest then in Telecom's
remaining an Italian entity, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Colaninno was lobbying the government, Olivetti
executives were conferring with advisers about how to structure a
deal to take over their bigger rival. Like everything in this
offer, that too is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti expects to make its offer through Tecnost S.p.A., a
separately traded Olivetti unit that makes equipment for lotteries.
Olivetti has already announced plans to sell assets to raise cash,
money it plans to funnel into Tecnost. The tender offer will
consist of cash, shares and debt, including five-year Tecnost
bonds. Olivetti needs two-thirds of Telecom Italia shareholders to
agree to the offer. And if approved, Tecnost and Olivetti will, in
effect, combine their operations.
</P>
<P>
   But several things have to fall into place for this offer to
succeed. First Olivetti has yet to file complete and formal
takeover documents with Italian securities regulators. Regulators
have to approve the offer before Olivetti can begin tendering
shares. But even in a best-case scenario, that could take more than
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Olivetti has to guarantee that bank financing is committed
before it can tender. That has not been done yet, although banks
are already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the formal offer, said one person close to the
companies, is likely to have a laundry list of ways Olivetti can
opt out of the deal if it wants to.
</P>
<P>
   Those delays could give Telecom Italia ample time to marshal its
own forces. But they also have the effect of putting the company in
play. Over the last few years, several companies _ including
British Telecom and Vodafone Group PLC, another British company,
along with American concerns like Bell Atlantic _ have talked to
Telecom Italia or its wireless concern, Telecom Italia Mobile,
about a possible combination or venture, industry analysts said. So
far, nothing has materialized from those discussions, making
Colaninno's argument for protecting Italy's prime property seem
like a rationalization for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   At this point it is difficult to tell whether the strategy is
based on miscalculation. As the deal's engineer, Colaninno, 55,
figured that Olivetti's overture would be welcomed by Telecom,
given his success in bringing Olivetti back from the brink of
bankruptcy in the mid-1990s. And the Italian government, which
holds a controlling ``golden share'' in Telecom, appeared not
unfriendly, if also noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left cabinet of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, a
former Communist, sees in Colaninno a useful ally. In an interview
Friday, D'Alema said, somewhat cryptically, that while he thought
Olivetti was taking a step longer than its legs, he admired its
courage in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For Telecom Italia, despite its view of the bid as hostile,
there seemed to be no urgency to respond. After meeting Saturday,
Telecom's board issued a statement saying it considered Olivetti's
bid documents incomplete from a formal legal standpoint and would
thus not respond. Since then, Telecom has declined to make any
comment. For the time being, its apparent strategy is to bide its
time and await market reactions Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the more curious aspects of the deal is that the biggest
potential winner would probably be Mannesmann. Once known primarily
for heavy machinery and steel pipes, Mannesmann is now the largest
digital mobile phone provider in Germany and one of the most
powerful phone companies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti, for its part, appeared to be taking on one of the most
thankless management tasks in Italian business _ unlocking the
unrealized value at Telecom _ in exchange for surrendering to
Mannesmann the nimble, lean and profitable mobile phone business
that is Olivetti's crown jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann confirmed Sunday that it would pay Olivetti $8.5
billion for Olivetti's shares in Omnitel Pronto Italia, Olivetti's
mobile phone venture, and its fixed-line provider, Infostrada, but
only if Olivetti's bid for Telecom succeeded. On Friday, Olivetti
said it had already pocketed $375 million from Mannesmann in
exchange for a 12.4 percent stake in Oliman N.V., the
Netherlands-based holding company that controls Omnitel and
Infostrada.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mannesmann, which stands to gain a strong and
profitable foothold in the fast-expanding southern European market,
insists that the idea for Olivetti's bid did not arise in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not involved in the planning,'' said Manfred
Soehnlein, Mannesmann's spokesman in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since it had been privatized, in 1997, Telecom,
though it is the world's sixth-largest phone service provider, had
been caught up in management turmoil that had left it with neither
a coherent strategy nor international alliances to take on domestic
and overseas competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime mover behind the Olivetti bid, observers here said, was
Mediobanca, the secretive Milan-based investment bank. In recent
years, Mediobanca has seen its market share slip, under the
onslaught of big international competitors, most notably from the
United States, and it evidently believed that a major takeover
would be an ideal way to regain prestige and increase fee income.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with good ties to Rome's political establishment,
Mediobanca was able to make the connections necessary to get the
ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   To warm D'Alema's government to the idea, Olivetti played the
patriot card, suggesting that Telecom, if left to drift, would be
an ideal takeover target for big foreign investors. In published
interviews, Colaninno, who quarterbacked the bid, emphasized the
goal of keeping the company in Italian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though Telecom has had talks over the years with several large
industry players, including Vodafone of Britain, and signed a
cooperation deal with AT&AMP;T in 1997, nothing has come of its efforts
at alliances. And few big European competitors, taken up as they
are with their own struggles for market position, appear willing to
take on the reorganization Telecom requires. Moreover, the largest
shareholders in Telecom are already British and American pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   For now, D'Alema's government is taking a wait-and-see attitude.
Michele Lauria, undersecretary of state in the Telecommunications
Ministry, said today that it would be ``inopportune and premature''
for the government to take sides. But, he added, that did not mean
it assumed the ``attitude of Pontius Pilate.'' Only after Olivetti
presented an industrial plan and the government consulted with
other shareholders, he said, would Rome make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the decision difficult is Telecom's move in December
to enlist Bernabe, who turned ENI into one of Italy's most
profitable companies in his six years there, to design a strategy
for Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe reported finding a big mess at Telecom when he arrived.
In Telecom's corporate communications department, for example, he
found more than 400 people scattered through 20 regional press
offices. Earlier this month, he announced a sweeping reorganization
plan for Telecom to cut costs, to rethink a costly foray into
digital television and to forge international alliances. Since his
arrival, Telecom's share price has soared 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the shareholders the government will certainly listen to
is the powerful Agnelli family of Fiat. Though their stake is
small, and they have kept a low profile until now, theirs could be
the deciding vote on Telecom's board.

OUTLOOK BRIGHTENS FOR CIENA   AFTER CATASTROPHIC '98 DROP 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beleaguered shares of the Ciena Corp. rebounded Friday after
the company reported a surprising return to profitability in its
first fiscal quarter. Lost sales and a scuttled acquisition by
Tellabs Operations Inc. last September had eroded much of Ciena's
once-stellar valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena shares closed Friday at $22.4375, up $1.5625, or 7.5
percent, in Nasdaq trading. While that is still a fraction of the
stock's 52-week high of $92.37, reached after the initial
announcement of the Tellabs deal, it is still a significant
multiple of the 52-week low of $8.12 last October.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger of Ciena and Tellabs, originally valued at
$7.3 billion, survived Ciena's loss of a product sale to AT&AMP;T that
had been estimated at more than $100 million. But it subsequently
unraveled after the company lost out to Pirelli SpA in the bidding
for a $25 million contract with Digital Teleport Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md., was an early leader in dense
wave-division multiplexing, a technology for expanding the capacity
of fiber optic networks by dividing the light into different
portions of the color spectrum. But the company's star dimmed as
larger, more diverse competitors like Lucent Technologies Inc.
undercut its pricing to grab sales and gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, analysts say the company may have turned a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ciena said it had received a three-year exclusive
contract from Telemonde Ltd. a London-based wholesaler of data and
communications services. Telemonde forecasted a $200 million
roll-out of Ciena equipment over the life of the contract.
Separately, Ciena said that extended its existing relationship with
Ciena as the supplier of optical networking products for a European
network to be built through April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure looks like it's headed in the right direction,'' said
Paul Silverstein, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
``From a 50,000-foot level, what you have here is a company that
remains at the cutting edge of technology in a very hot,
fast-growing marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But before declaring Ciena in the clear, he said, ``I'd be more
comfortable seeing another quarter of income.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, Ciena reported earnings of $2.3
million, or 2 cents a share, compared with $39.7 million, or 37
cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues
fell 31 percent, to $100.4 million from $145.1 million in the first
quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Ciena to lose 1 cent a share, according to
First Call. In the quarter ended Oct. 31, Ciena lost $3.9 million
on revenue of $91.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ciena has broadened its base of core customers to 13
from 2 in 1997, it is still far too dependent on a few companies,
Silverstein said, noting that three of its customers account for 71
percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that Sprint alone generated $40 million of the $100
million that Ciena reported in the most recent quarter. ``When you
have limited visibility of future revenues, and high customer
concentration, those are risks,'' Silverstein said.

BLACK ENTREPRENEURS SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT `DIGITAL FREEDOM'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though comparatively small in number, and nearly invisible in
the greater New York Internet and new-media industry, black
Internet entrepreneurs are organizing a support network, outlining
steps to success and finding their own role models.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy Friday evening earlier this month at New York
University, a group of black executives, professionals and students
met to discuss ways to use information technology for ``digital
freedom,'' as they put it. The event was sponsored by the Blacks in
New Media Association, a student group that was started last fall
in the university's interactive telecommunications program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playing field is as level as it's going to get,'' said B.
Keith Fulton, a technologist and lawyer who is now director of
technology programs and policy at the National Urban League. ``You
don't need a $10 million marketing budget to put up a Web site,''
Fulton said. ``But there is consolidation in the industry, and as
the Internet matures, new barriers are going to arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist was Bob Ponce, who wields a great deal of
influence in the new-media industry as president of the World Wide
Web Artist Consortium (www.wwwac.org), a grass-roots organization
that has a far-reaching e-mail discussion list and that is host to
numerous events for Web designers. Ponce, who is African-American,
is established in the broader business world, but he believes that
catering to the interests of black Americans might provide some of
the best opportunities for black entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we need to help get our community on line,'' he said,
referring to black Americans as a group. ``Then you help create
your future customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans definitely are coming on line, according to
research from Forrester Research of Boston. According to the firm,
2.7 million African-American households (out of about 11 million)
have access to the Internet, whether it be from home, work or
school. That is up from two million households at the beginning of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   What's important from a business standpoint, Ponce said, is that
people know that blacks are alive and well in the wired world. ``We
have to let people know we are technology savvy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Auriea Harvey, who is a Web site designer and
founder of Entropy8 (www.entropy8.com), is doing just that. She has
a digital camera pointed at her desk so that visitors to her Web
site can watch her work. ``I want to make a point that I'm here,
that I'm a woman and that I'm black,'' Ms. Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harvey, who has designed the Web sites of Virgin Records
America and PBS, among others, wasn't always so eager to emphasize
her race. ``At first, the anonymity was important to me,'' she
said. ``I wanted people to see my work and judge me solely for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Harvey said she had come to realize that working in the
virtual world offered her advantages as a black woman over working
in the real world. ``On the same day you'll be working with someone
on the West Coast and then someone in Switzerland,'' she said.
``They may not even know your color, and if they find out later,
it's just trivia.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to raising money for a new business, though, the
interpersonal may play a role, one panelist, Omar Wasow said. ``The
primary barriers are more just about being a start-up, not being a
black start-up,'' said Wasow, an African-American who is the
Internet correspondent for the cable channel MSNBC. ``But this is a
business where social networks count for a lot,'' he said, in an
interview after the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Wasow, a 28-year-old New York native and Stanford graduate, is a
Silicon Alley pioneer, having started New York Online
(www.nyo.com), originally a subscription-supported dial-up online
service, in 1993. He initially sought to create an online community
that would reflect the diverse personalities of the city. But as
community tended to take a back seat to commerce, Wasow shifted to
concentrate on Web site design.
</P>
<P>
   Wasow, who divides his time between MSNBC and his company, says
that the bulk of the challenges he faces as a businessman have
nothing to do with race. ``Because this industry is so young and
new and there's so much turmoil, it's still a wide open game with
plenty of opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be scant industry data about the amount of
capital that goes to black-owned new-media firms. But the consensus
of that Friday night discussion seemed to be that while the venture
capital door is open, it may not always be open wide enough.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the New York City Investment Corp., which is backed by
10 banks, has a mandate to finance minority ventures. The fund,
started in 1996, acts more like a bank than a venture firm, giving
out loans of $50,000 to $1 million in return for equity or
royalties. Though the $25 million fund does not necessarily focus
on technology companies, it has lent close to $1 million to two New
York-based black-owned technology firms _ Data Industries, a
computer personnel staffing company, and Axicom Communications
Group, an international telecommunications firm. Howard Sommer, who
manages the fund, says it is now focusing more on Internet and
new-media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a smattering of venture funds have been started to
take advantage of underserved, or overlooked, minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations, like Blacks in New Media, are sprouting up to
help give African-American businesses a foothold in New York's
Internet economy. The New York new-media industry as a whole is
seeking ways to attract more minority entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the attendees at our events,'' said Alice Rodd
O'Rourke, executive director of the New York New Media Association.
``And we ask, `Where are the people of color?' We want everyone to
know this industry exists and what the opportunities are.''

   Under ``Arch Music for St. Louis'' lies a story of the interplay
of fear and imagination in an act of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arch Music,'' which will have its New York premiere at 8 p.m.
Tuesday when Hans Vonk leads the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra at
Carnegie Hall, is the work of the Dutch composer Peter Schat. He
said that when he received the commission from the orchestra in
1997, ``I knew immediately what I wanted to do: to create a musical
equivalent to Eero Saarinen's monumental Gateway Arch.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one little problem, though. Schat fears heights, and
the Gateway Arch, beside the Mississippi at St. Louis, rises to 630
feet. Schat said he saw and touched the monument but did not have
the nerve to ascend. ``While composing the piece,'' he said, ``I
therefore had to rely entirely on my imagination, putting myself in
place of the traveler heading heavenward in his tiny cabin _ an
imaginary journey in tones.''

   CIENA SHARES REBOUND AFTER STRONG FIRST QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered shares of Ciena rebounded after the company
reported a surprising return to profitability in its first fiscal
quarter. Lost sales and a scuttled acquisition by Tellabs last
September had eroded much of Ciena's once stellar valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena shares closed Friday at $22.4375, up $1.5625, or 7.5
percent, in Nasdaq trading. While that number is still a fraction
of the stock's 52-week high of $92.37, reached after the initial
announcement of the Tellabs deal, it is still a significant
multiple of the 52-week low of $8.12 set last October.

GINGRICH'S CHOICE TRYING TO AVOID A RUNOFF IN HOUSE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Voters in Georgia's 6th Congressional District will
choose an heir to former speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday, and the
only suspense seems to be whether Gingrich's hand-picked successor,
Johnny Isakson, the state school board chairman, will win without a
runoff in a nonpartisan race against five opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, a prominent businessman, longtime former state
legislator, and twice-failed statewide candidate, is by far the
best-known, most-experienced, and best-financed candidate in the
field. Like all but one of the candidates, he is a Republican. The
6th District, which arcs across the affluent northern suburbs of
Atlanta, is considered one of the most reliably Republican
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, 54, has conducted a safe, front-runner's campaign,
embracing much of the Republican congressional leadership's
economic agenda while downplaying moderate stands on social issues
that have alienated conservatives in his past campaigns. With
several of his opponents running to his right, Isakson has
portrayed his centrism as more a matter of style than of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused oftentimes in this race of being a consensus
builder and I don't run away from that,'' Isakson said Sunday in
the only televised debate of the campaign, which was sponsored by
the Atlanta Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   The only other candidate with any name recognition is Christina
F. Jeffrey, 51, a professor at Kennesaw State University who was
hired and then fired by Gingrich in 1995 as historian of the House.
Gingrich dismissed her after learning that, while heading a federal
panel that reviewed an academic course on the Holocaust, Ms.
Jeffrey complained that the curriculum did not reflect the views of
the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan.

`SYSTEM ON A CHIP' AT HIGHER SPEED FROM IBM
</HEADLINE>
   ( ms ) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM plans on Monday to announce its entry into the market for
technology used in making so-called system-on-a-chip
semiconductors. In recent years, as it has become possible to
squeeze more and more transistors onto silicon chips, designers
have gradually begun putting all the key components of a computer
system on a single chip _ sharply lowering the cost while
increasing the performance of computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Although by no means the first company to create such systems,
IBM will enter the market with transistor technology that computes
more quickly than current system-on-a-chip products, company
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, computers deal with information in two ways: as
memory (or storage) and as logic (or processing). Previous
system-on-a-chip designs have been based on the circuitry of memory
transistors, which tend to handle information more slowly than
logic transistors. IBM's new approach will be based on the
circuitry of logic transistors, which the company said should
create higher-speed processors.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, IBM's new technology will be capable of creating
chips with as many as 24 million transistors, by using the
company's semiconductor process that can etch circuits only 0.15
micron apart _ less than one-six-hundredth the width of a human
hair. The company said that such circuit densities could yield
computers with up to eight times the performance and as much as two
to four times the memory of the typical personal computer today.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives expect that the first application for the new
technology will be in data communications, but that it could be
rapidly applied to consumer products ranging from computers to
smart appliances.
</P>
<P>
   IBM would use the technology for its own chip-making operations
or sell it as a tool kit for other chip designers. The company
plans to make the first tool kits available in April and predicts
that the first commercial products containing the new chips will
reach the market next year.

   FOR THE BIG CORPORATION, 24-HOUR LINUX SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Is it time for Bill Gates to worry? This Linux thing seems to be
getting serious.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, of course, is a Unix-based computer operating system that
is widely available free and is rapidly gaining at least symbolic
value as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows and Windows NT
programs. Last Thursday, IBM announced it would preload Linux on
certain of its network server machines, alongside Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   And as of Monday a small San Francisco-based start-up, Linuxcare
Inc., will be offering large corporations an around-the-clock Linux
support service.
</P>
<P>
   ``An uninformed user is a bad thing,'' said Arther Tyde III,
chief executive of Linuxcare. The company's customers will be able
to call for help at any hour, paying annual service rates up to
$150,000, depending on what options they sign up for.
</P>
<P>
   As word of Linux's reliability spreads and more corporations
adopt it, ``a technical support service like Linuxcare is
absolutely needed now,'' said Sandra Potter, a senior analyst at
the Aberdeen Group of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Linuxcare (www.linuxcare.com) does not sell Linux itself, but
supports a variety of commercial versions, including ones sold by
Red Hat and Caldera. Caldera is expected to announce this week that
it has been selected by several big hardware and software companies
to train and certify Linux engineers. As part of its new service,
Linuxcare has set up a Web-based system it calls Caretracker to let
customers trace the handling of their cases on line, much as
Federal Express enables users to track packages.
</P>
<P>
   And starting next month, Linuxcare intends to make its
``knowledge base'' of technical information freely available to the
public over the Web. That data base will be continually updated,
the company said, as new information pours in from its experience
providing technical support.

   THE ROAD PROVED DAUNTING &UR;  &LR; TO MAKER OF GAMES FOR GIRLS
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Laurel spent the last two and a half years creating
software for girls, a product intended to ``comfort while it
entertains.'' But competitive pressure and shrinking profit margins
in the computer game market made business anything but comfortable
for her company, Purple Moon LLC, which closed its doors last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to save the situation until the last possible
moment,'' Ms. Laurel, a 48-year-old executive who has spent much of
her computer career involved in game design and research into the
people who play them, said in an interview. ``Now we'll all try to
take what we learned and apply it elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Laurel, elsewhere might be another software start-up or
a job developing games software for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon, whose backers included the Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen, had a staff of 40. The company considered its games for
preadolescent girls, like ``Rockett's New School,'' a way of
addressing what Ms. Laurel sees as a gender gap between the action
games that prevail for boys and the fashion-oriented Barbie titles
from Mattel Inc. that are aimed at girls.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon's games were designed for girls 8 to 12, and
addressed friendships, families and the pressures of growing up,
with the intention of increasing self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, Ms. Laurel plans to tackle gender stereotypes by
developing software for boys. ``I care about both boys and girls,''
she said. Before founding Purple Moon, she spent four years at
Interval Research in Silicon Valley studying the differences
between the ways girls and boys play. She says boys are interested
in more than the ``military metaphors'' that many computer games
offer. ``I'm going to spend some time looking at that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ms. Laurel was optimistic that Purple Moon, whose
first products came out in autumn 1997 and sold relatively well,
could hold its own in a market dominated by Barbie. But the
competition intensified. The number of titles in the girls'
software market doubled _ Mattel alone released more than a dozen
Barbie games _ while shelf space in computer stores dwindled as a
result of mergers and consolidations. At the same time, the average
retail price of computer games dropped $6.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a big company to absorb a hit like that,'' she
said. Purple Moon was not yet a big company.

Albright decided to say in public on Sunday what she had been

Serbs. The ethnic Albanians have long argued that air strikes were
the best way to end the repression by the Serbs in Kosovo and to
force them to a peace deal. By Jane Perlez.

FRICTION BETWEEN WEB STANDARDS EMERGES OVER MICROSOFT APPLICATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich.,   Calif. , Wash.)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Web site developers were angered earlier this month when
they learned that the Microsoft &UR;  &LR; Corp. had received a patent
covering a fundamental technology adopted by the World Wide Web
Consortium, a nonprofit group working to standardize the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the furor arose because Microsoft, a member of the
consortium, had not told members that it had applied for a patent
covering aspects of a technology known as ``cascading style
sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   These style sheets are essentially templates that reduce the
cost of developing Web sites, make it easier to redesign a site on
the fly and cut the cost of maintaining a site.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft since has said that its failure to disclose the patent
application was inadvertent and, more important, that it will
freely license the patent. But technologists say that the Microsoft
patent is a worrisome symptom of a much larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has begun to issue a spate
of patents that were applied for several years ago when the
Internet was just becoming viable commercially. Some fear that
these patents threaten the very architecture underlying the online
world.
</P>
<P>
   While patents are intended to reward innovative work done
independently by individuals or companies, the World Wide Web is in
many respects the result of innovation that is by definition
collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works because everyone has some basic underlying
agreements about basic technical standards, not because everybody
went out and tried to make their own web,'' said Daniel K.
Weitzner, director of technology standards for the World Wide Web
Consortium. ``If everyone did go out and make their own web, we
would have no Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Resnick, associate professor at the University of
Michigan's School of Information, said the friction between patents
and standards was spurring a ``revolution in how we think about
property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both innovation and standardization create value for
consumers,'' he said. ``Patents are good for rewarding innovation.
But they can inhibit standardization. And the value that is created
by standards accrues to everyone. ''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's patent, No. 5,860,073, covers part of the technology
behind ``cascading style sheets,'' templates into which fresh data
can be poured repeatedly. The style sheets are used with HTML, the
common language of the Internet. The patent also covers a similar
template approach for XML, a next-generation language described as
``HTML on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   George Olsen is a design director at 2-Lane Media in Los Angeles
who heads up the Web Standards Project, a lobbying group for
developers who want to see Web standards broadly adopted, so that
virtually all sites can be viewed easily with any type of browser.
</P>
<P>
   When Olsen's group first heard of the Microsoft patent, they
hotly threatened to press the Patent Office to re-examine it. But
the group's tempers have cooled since Microsoft announced that it
would freely and widely license the patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're in a trust-but-verify mode,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Microsoft patent has been the subject of ire outside
the World Wide Web Consortium, also known as the W3C, a different
patent seems to be the main focus of concern within the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The Intermind &UR;  &LR; Corp., a consortium member, did disclose to the
consortium that it had applied for a patent covering aspects of
``metadata,'' which is essentially information tagged to data so
that it can be sorted or classified. (An ``R'' rating tagged to a
movie, for example would be metadata about a movie.) The consortium
adopted a metadata standard known as the Platform for Privacy
Preferences, or P3P. But members were taken by surprise when
Intermind announced, after it had been issued patent No. 5,862,325
_ a huge, 130-page document _ that it would exact licensing fees
from fellow members, who had helped developed P3P.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reardon, a Microsoft program manager who is the company's
representative with the consortium, said his company was serving as
a model of how consortium members should treat their patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is currently absolutely zero patent policy at the W3C,''
said Reardon. Instead, each of the consortium's 300 members post
their own policy regarding licensing. Microsoft's is far more
liberal than that of any other company, he said, comparing it to
``much stricter terms'' offered by Sun Microsystems or IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think what we're doing is pretty striking,''
Reardon said. ``We're saying, `It doesn't really matter what the
patent says, you can have it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft is not giving away its patent for nothing.
In return, companies must grant Microsoft a reciprocal license for
any related technology. ``We're not going to give something for
free and then be held hostage by somebody we just gave to,''
Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if other companies follow Microsoft's example, other
thorny issues will probably emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Eolas Technologies, &UR;  &LR; a company in Wheaton, Ill., that is not a
member of the consortium, recently sued Microsoft for infringing
its patent, No. 5,838,906. Mike Doyle, the founder of Eolas,
contends that the patent covers aspects of ``embedded technology''
_ the so-called applets and plug-ins that make it possible to
experience music, video and animated graphics on the Web. These are
used not just by Microsoft but by other software makers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Should Eolas and others not in the consortium be able to reap
the benefits of standardization while at the same time exacting
licensing fees for patented technologies?
</P>
<P>
   Resnick contends that such questions are going to require a
radical rethinking of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big issue; it's fundamental,'' he said. ``There's not
going to be an easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pernell Whitaker knew he would have to deploy more
offense than usual to defeat Felix Trinidad Jr., the International
Boxing Federation welterweight champion, at Madison Square Garden
on Saturday night. Whitaker also knew that that strategy meant a
greater risk of getting hit _ something that Whitaker had arduously
avoided during his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker took the plunge and he took a beating, the worst of his
long, illustrious career. Trinidad (34-0) pounded out a 12-round
unanimous decision to retain his title and set up an even bigger
welterweight showdown against Oscar De La Hoya, the World Boxing
Council champion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker showed terrific courage, fighting from the sixth round
on with a broken jaw. He had surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Manhattan early  &UR;  &LR; Sunday morning to have plates placed in his jaw.
Whitaker expects to recover in two weeks and said he wants to
continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, Whitaker's trainer, asked the fighter if he wanted
to quit when they thought his jaw was broken after the sixth round.
Whitaker said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy that the only way you can get him out of
the ring is to carry him out,'' said Lou Duva, Whitaker's longtime
co-manager. Duva said that the broken jaw was the result of
Trinidad's hitting Whitaker with his elbow. Duva also said that
Brooks complained to the referee, Benji Esteves, that Trinidad was
using his elbows, but that the pleas were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disputing the decision,'' Duva said. ``But I am
disputing the way the fight was handled by the referee.''
</P>
<P>
   Don King, Trinidad's promoter, scoffed at Duva's assertion that
Trinidad's elbow broke Whitaker's jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his jaw is broken, then it's from one of those rights or
lefts upside his head,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   King said the only thing he noticed was that Whitaker sat down
in the corner twice to avoid punches during the fight and that
those were not scored knockdowns. Trinidad scored a legitimate
knockdown in the second round with a right that caught Whitaker on
the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking and dodging has been a staple of Whitaker's superb
defensive arsenal, but he did less of it Saturday night and decided
to throw punches in bunches at Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker threw 749 punches, but landed only 234 (31 percent),
according to Compubox punch statistics. But by throwing so many
punches, Whitaker opened himself up for an offensive assault by
Trinidad, who threw 512 punches and landed 278 (54 percent).
Consider that Whitaker's last 20 opponents had landed an average of
only 28 percent of their punches against him, and it's easy to see
that he was not the defensive marvel he has been in the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad said he was not hurt by any of Whitaker's shots,
although Whitaker backed Trinidad up with a sharp left and caught
Trinidad with a right uppercut that jarred him. But overall,
Whitaker lacked the firepower to send Trinidad to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved Trinidad's status as one of the top
welterweights. De La Hoya remains atop the division, because of his
drawing power and because he has now scored victories over two
top-tier welterweights, Whitaker and Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the fight, King, waving a Puerto Rican flag,
started calling De La Hoya out to meet Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to stand up and be macho De La Hoya, not chicken De La
Hoya,'' King said. ``If he turns down this fight, he cannot walk
through the streets of Mexico without a lot of
cock-a-doodle-doing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   King said that Trinidad, 26, has an IBF mandatory defense
against Vincent Petway in May, which is the second of a two-fight
deal that King and Trinidad have with HBO. King said that he saw no
obstacles to a De La Hoya-Trinidad fight being made before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fight would have to be broadcast on TVKO, an HBO
pay-per-view subsidiary, because De La Hoya has an exclusive
contract with HBO. But one thing that could hold up a possible bout
is Trinidad's insistence that he get the same amount of money as De
La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, has been adamant that there
will not be parity in pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't about parity,'' King said. ``That's the way you block
deals from getting done by saying what you won't take. I say let's
do it 50-50, and he pays his fighter what he wants to and I'll pay
my fighter what I want to. The fight will do two million buys on
pay-per-view.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Whitaker, Duva said he and his family would sit down with
the 35-year-old boxer, a six-time champion in four weight classes,
to discuss whether he should hang up his gloves for good. Duva said
he would support whatever decision Whitaker makes. &QL;

PIAZZA, AT LAST, FINDS HIMSELF AT HOME WITH THE METS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ There was no surer sign that it was a new
year here at the Mets' spring training facility than when Manager
Bobby Valentine greeted his everyday catcher with a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The only smooch Valentine would have liked to give Todd Hundley
was one signifying goodbye. But Hundley is up the road in Vero
Beach now, after being traded to the Dodgers over the off-season.
In his place _ and occupying his old spring locker _ is Mike
Piazza, among the most feared right-handed hitters in the game. And
it is obvious that Valentine _ who had many celebrated run-ins with
Hundley over the last two seasons _ could not be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, meanwhile, just seems happy, which is also something of
a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is absolutely one of the best players to ever play the
game of baseball,'' Valentine said. On the larger-than-usual crowds
that appeared for the Mets' first official workout, Valentine
gushed, ``There's no doubt that Mike brings a different aura to our
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager hopes that Piazza will help bring Valentine to a
place he has never been: the post-season. Piazza, meanwhile, has
set his sights just a little bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been recognized as a Silver Slugger and an All-Star,''
said Piazza, who re-signed with the Mets in the off season for $91
million over the next seven years. ``I have lived a dream, gone so
much farther, accomplished so much more and made so much more money
than I ever figured I would. The World Series. That's the only
thing left.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of last summer _ and after being traded twice within a
week in May _ Piazza was booed at Shea Stadium. And there were not
many who thought he would choose to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure did get miserable there for a while,'' Valentine said
Sunday. ``And it wasn't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza never faulted the fans. Instead, he blamed himself.
His father, Vince Piazza, said Sunday that ever since the second of
his five boys was a child, Mike has always directed his anger at
himself.
</P>
<P>
   And Vince Piazza thinks that it was a meeting with Ted Williams
when Mike Piazza was 15 that might have helped Piazza through his
longest summer last year. Williams, Vince Piazza recalled,
accompanied him to the family home in Valley Forge, Pa., one winter
day to see young Mike hit in the hitting facility built there.
After praising the then first baseman who was batting left-handed
at the time (Piazza switch-hit through high school), Williams
nevertheless cautioned that good mechanics are only 50 percent of
the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's older brother, Vince Jr., remembers what Williams said
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest is up here,'' Vince Jr. said, pointing to his head as
had Williams _ who had plenty of battles with the fans at Fenway
Park that he later regretted _ that day. ``Ted Williams gave Mike a
good pep talk about how to block things out and it stuck with
him,'' said Vince Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Never would Mike Piazza need the advice more than last season.
``You are going to have bad days,'' Piazza said Sunday. ``And for
me, I go into a shell. People who know me know that about me. When
I'm not happy, I don't put up with any sort of distractions. And
there were times last season when I had to refocus.''
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza was doing so, he often seemed to alienate his new
teammates, who did not seem to understand. But eventually, Piazza
was able to turn the jeers into cheers and regain the confidence of
his team. He batted .347 in August and .378 in September, carrying
the Mets offensively for prolonged stretches before they fell just
short of their first post-season appearance since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival here this spring, Piazza _ who wound up hitting
.348 for the Mets last season, .329 over all _ pronounced that he
has turned the page on 1998. The six-time All-Star knows that the
Mets are again relying on him to shoulder a substantial amount of
the offensive burden this season, even with a revamped and
recharged lineup in place.
</P>
<P>
   That is fine, said Piazza, as long as he doesn't have to do it
all by himself. He said he has put his Dodger days behind him.
``That's done,'' Piazza said. ``When you get pushed out, the door
closes behind you. You don't scratch to get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, Piazza is now a transplanted New Yorker. He
said he likes to walk around Manhattan, where he is sometimes
recognized. (``Garbage trucks would stop and the guys would get
out,'' Piazza said.) Piazza is a semiregular guest on the Howard
Stern show. His face will grace the April issue of GQ magazine. And
he has placed his old Manhattan Beach, Calif., condo on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he seem comfortable in his new surroundings, but
Piazza, who once symbolized the Hollywood athlete, also genuinely
seems happy to have a new place to call home.

DENVER, THE CROSSROADS OF INDIAN COUNTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the old days, when Ute was the lingua franca of what
is now Colorado, Indian bands would travel the Old North Trail,
skirting the Rocky Mountains to camp and trade in cottonwood groves
here at the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River.
</P>
<P>
   This year, near Confluence Park, Denver's convention center is
host to a string of modern Indian gatherings: Indian youth, Indian
scientists, Indian gambling executives, Indian bison managers and
Indian artists. Next month, thousands of Indian dancers and traders
are to converge at a bend in the South Platte for the Denver March
Powwow, the annual kickoff of the West's powwow season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver has become the crossroads again, the place to meet and
to exchange,'' Jack Gladstone, a Blackfoot musician from Montana,
said during a break between performances at an annual Indian market
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the far-flung archipelago of Indian country, Denver is
emerging as the informal capital. Denver has the nation's largest
concentration of national Indian groups, about 15 associations
ranging from the leading Indian law firm to the leading scholarship
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling Denver to center stage have been the city's
neutrality in tribal affairs and its centrality in transportation.
Free from the political sway of a large reservation, Denver is a
seven-hour drive from Colorado's only reservations, the two Ute
homelands in the state's far southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the urban Indian political world, Denver is the primary
city,'' Kevin Gover, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, said
from Washington. Gover, an Oklahoma Pawnee who most recently lived
in New Mexico, observed, ``If we need a location where we are not
favoring one group over another, Denver is neutral ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway between the large reservations of the Northern Plains and
the Pueblos and reservations of the Southwest, Denver is at the
geographic center of Indian America, the nation's fastest growing
racial group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regionally accessible _ it is a day's trip home for most
people,'' said David Cournoyer, a South Dakota Rosebud Sioux, who
is spokesman for the American Indian College Fund, an educational
group based here.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's new $5 billion airport, with its white-peaked terminal,
designed to look like tepees billowing on the prairie, has emerged
as a hub for the airports that serve Indian country: Billings,
Mont.; Cortez, Colo.; Dickinson, N.D.; Farmington, N.M.; Rapid
City, S.D., and Riverton, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is centrally located as far as airplane travel, and we
have clients all over the country,'' said Walter Echo-Hawk, a
Pawnee who is a lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund, the
nation's leading Indian law firm. ``We moved here because we didn't
want to be branded as a regional organization, which you do if you
are in the Southwest or the Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders also praised the city's racial tolerance.
Enveloped by the largest metropolitan area in the Rockies, Denver
is a city with a black Mayor, Wellington E. Webb. One of Colorado's
Senators, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne and a
Republican, is the only Indian in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver has a welcoming personality,'' said Kay Culbertson, an
Assiniboine-Sioux from Montana. ``I have gone to Rapid City, to
Billings, and I have felt the racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Culbertson, who runs the Denver Indian Health and Family
Center, a government-supported clinic, said that Denver's booming
economy drew Indians from reservations with high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents moved here because they wanted us to succeed, but
to still be Indian people, to be proud of being Indian,'' said Ms.
Culbertson, who moved here in 1966. ``Many native American people
have realized that Denver represents the chance to realize the
American dream, that you can be prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 4,000 Utes live on reservations in Southwest
Colorado, about 25,000 Indians live in the greater Denver area. Of
the Denver population, about one-third are Lakota Sioux and about
one-third are Navajo, largely descendants of Washington's
relocation policy of the 1950s. Although Indians are Colorado's
smallest racial minority, accounting for 1 percent of the
population, they are the fastest growing group in Colorado schools,
jumping by 51 percent in the 1990s, to 8,000 students today.
</P>
<P>
   Indian residents here face many of the hurdles that Indians face
nationwide. Barely half of Denver's American Indian students
complete high school by the age of 20, the lowest rate for any
racial group in the school sysem. About two-thirds of American
Indians now live in cities.
</P>
<P>
   To help build an off-reservation sense of identity, Denver has
granted the region's Indian community a park area, Tallbull
Memorial Park, where there are regular powwows, sweat lodges,
lacrosse games and running meets.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's largest powwow is the Denver March Powwow, which has
ballooned in 25 years from a small affair with a $6,000 budget to a
gathering with a budget last year of $200,000 and an attendance of
55,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is camaraderie all around,'' said Grace Gillette, the
executive director. ``People are laughing, greeting, shaking hands.
A lot of people, especially in the Plains, have cabin fever at that
time, and they just want to dance. They want to show off the dance
outfits they made during the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   With many roads in Indian America leading to Denver, it would be
the ideal location for a permanent Indian convention and cultural
center, says Danny G. Abbott, chief executive officer of the Native
Power Corp., an energy consulting company here. ``Denver is the
natural spot,'' he said. ``If you are going from Billings to
Albuquerque, you are going to stop in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shakespeare Cummings, an Arapaho who was selling her
traditional dolls at an Indian market here recently, has a
different idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver represents the homeland where the Arapaho once used to
live,'' Mrs. Cummings said, noting that the county immediately east
of Denver is called Arapahoe County. More than a century ago, the
Arapaho were moved from Denver to Wyoming, where they now share a
reservation with the Shoshones. ``It would be really cool if Denver
opened up some land for the Arapaho to come down here again.''

IN MATCH PLAY, IT'S PUT UP OR GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bring 64 of the world's best golfers together. Put them in a
match-play format, where the only thing that matters is who wins
each hole and where each day's losers are out. Offer $5 million in
prize money, with $1 million going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like a compelling event? We are about to find
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship begins Wednesday
in Carlsbad, Calif., the first event in the new World Golf
Championships series. Expect it to be both unpredictable and
controversial, and with a little luck, it could be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   The field alone is enough to whet the appetite: Tiger Woods,
David Duval, Greg Norman, Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, Lee
Westwood and Nick Price are together in the same event for the
first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure-packed, head-to-head nature of match play has the
potential to fuel rivalries, to deflate egos, and to leave the
winner feeling as if he has accomplished something significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be great for spectators,'' said Els, one of at least
12 players who could be labeled a favorite. ``I think every fan
wants to see a bit of a dog fight, a head-to-head fight. We play so
many stroke play events, I think people have forgotten how exciting
match play can be. You lose your match, you go home. I think these
World Championship events are good for golf.''
 &UR;  &LR; This week has the potential to be dramatic. Since the PGA
Championship switched from match play to stroke play in 1958, the
only significant professional match play event has been the Ryder
Cup, held just once every two years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, other professional match-play events have
included the Presidents Cup, the 12-player World Match Play
Championships, and the previous version of the Andersen Consulting
event, an invitational 32-player event played in different segments
at different locations.
</P>
<P>
   This event at La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa will be a new experience,
because of the field's quality and depth, and because of the prize
money. Even the first day will offer marquee matchups, the most
prominent being Tiger Woods against Nick Faldo, a clash between the
Masters champions of 1996 (Faldo) and '97 (Woods). The road to the
final four, climaxed by Sunday's 36-hole final, will be littered
with turning points, pressure putts, key shots and blunders.
</P>
<P>
   In stroke play, a conservative approach is often the best,
particularly early in a tournament. But in match play, the first
day can be your last, so players are forced to play aggressively.
It is an atmosphere that leads to more birdies, more bogeys, more
mistakes, and more spectacular shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I play match play, as opposed to stroke play, I
always play the opponent,'' said Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA
Champion. ``If he hits it down the fairway, I try to hit it down
the fairway. If he hits it in the rough, I just get it in the
fairway. I just try to do better than he does. Scoring, to me,
becomes irrelevant. I shoot for pins I normally wouldn't shoot for
and try to sneak a hole away. I gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   On a given day, any of the world's top-ranked players can beat
another. No. 1 against No. 64 in golf is a much more even match
than Duke against Murray State in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Sunday's final could offer a showdown
between Duval and Woods, or Bob Estes and Glen Day.
</P>
<P>
   A final four of say, Duval, Woods, Mark O'Meara and Norman would
be riveting. But how many people would tune in Sunday to watch a
Patrick Sjoland-Frankie Minoza final? ABC television doesn't want
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be important to have top names in the final four,''
said Phil Mickelson, who will be drawing from his successful match
play experiences, like his victory in the 1990 U. S. Amateur
championship. ``But I think match play can add a lot to the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   With proven match play performers like Vijay Singh, O'Meara,
Davis Love III, Justin Leonard, Fred Couples and Elkington joining
the other favorites, most players expect the final four to have
star quality. And Woods, with his three consecutive U.S. Amateur
championships and a 20-2 record in the U.S. Amateur championship
tournament, hopes to add to his match-play legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods is the man to beat, not Ernie Els, not Greg
Norman,'' Couples said earlier this year. ``Look at his record in
match play. I would think that Tiger Woods is licking his chops.
When you get a great player, he should be there the whole match.
Now if it comes down to the 18th hole, a 12-handicapper can hit his
best two shots and win one hole. But it's going to take a great
match to take Tiger to the 18th hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Faldo is capable of doing just that, and it will be interesting
to see how players react to the single-elimination pressure. At a
stroke-play tournament, top players simply try to stay in the hunt
on Thursday and Friday, then worry about winning on the weekend.
But starting Wednesday, nerves will be frayed on the first tee,
because one lousy round, or even a good round against a hotter
opponent, can send you to the hotel front desk for an
embarrassingly early checkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the biggest fan of it,'' Duval admitted about match
play. ``You never get what you deserve in match play. You could
conceivably have the No. 1 player in the world shoot six under par
and get beat, and the No. 2 player might shoot three over par and
win. That's not right. I think everybody is a little anxious, and
apprehensive as well, to see how it comes off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Duval complained, he also planned to show up. The
money, coupled with the competition, was enough to convince top
European players like Montgomerie, Westwood, and Darren Clarke that
the trip was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main objectives of the World Golf Championship series
was to bring the world's best players together more often, and for
this tournament, that objective has been realized.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo and Woods are not often paired together, yet on Wednesday,
they will match shot for shot, with all the psychology and strategy
that accompanies match play. A player may concede a four-foot putt
to his opponent on the first hole, but he might not concede it on
the 17th hole. And seeing top players face each other in match play
may help fuel some of the one-on-one rivalries that fans and media
crave.
</P>
<P>
   And if added incentive is needed, $1 million awaits. Not bad
compensation for five days worth of work. And the first tournament
will help set the tone for how the World Golf Championship is
ultimately viewed by the public, and by the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important tournament, the first of its kind,''
said Els. ``Obviously, it's going to be very beneficial to your
bank account as well. It's going to be draining. But it will be
satisfying if you win.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Martin takes flag at North Carolina Speedway
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ ``Wonder Boy'' won't win them all.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon finally
faltered on Sunday when engine failure forced him out of the
Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400 at North Carolina Speedway. The mechanical
malfunction snapped his three-race winning streak, but also put
some drama back on the NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   With Gordon off the 1.017-mile oval of ``The Rock,'' Mark Martin
led the final 36 laps to win at NCS for since 1989. Martin held off
Dale Jarrett for the final nine laps, beating him to the finish
line by 1.397 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte finished third, while Jeff Burton who led 227 of
the 393 laps, was fourth. Jeremy Mayfield finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' Martin said. ``It just would have been a lot
better if we'd finished Daytona instead of wrecking. There's a lot
of racing left, but we look a lot better (Sunday) than we did a
week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is one of four drivers who look a lot better, thanks to
Gordon's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's race was only the second date on the Winston Cup
schedule, Martin and three other candidates expected to challenge
Gordon _ Burton, Jarrett and Labonte _ entered Rockingham trailing
``The Kid'' by at least 87 points in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of Sunday's race completed, it appeared
their deficit would grow even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who opened the `99 season by winning his second Daytona
500, led 90 of the first 310 laps here. But his fortunes turned on
the back straightaway of the 310th lap, when the engine in his No.
24 Chevrolet blew up. Gordon drove his car to the garage and pulled
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled like a grenade went off underneath the hood,''
Gordon said. ``It's unfortunate. We were running good and doing
exactly what we wanted to do. We led at times and I think we were
going to be a big factor at the end. But these guys don't let me
down very often, especially the engine department.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished 39th, ending his 21-race streak of top-10
finishes. It was the first time he didn't finish a race since the
13th event of last season. The last time engine failure forced him
to the garage was during the race in Atlanta in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so fortunate with motors and things over the last
few years, it was bound to happen sometime,'' he said. ``For us to
win a championship, we've got to be consistent every week. We got a
jump start on a lot of those guys last weekend, but this is going
to close things up quite a bit. There's probably going to be some
guys that get a jump on us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon fell to 11th place in points, 84 behind Mike Skinner and
the No. 31 Chevy, who took over the top spot with a sixth-place
finish at ``The Rock.'' Labonte jumped 20 spots to fourth, while
Burton, Jarrett and Martin each gained 23 spots in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate (Gordon) doing that -- waiting on us,'' Jarrett
said. ``Jeff had a little bad luck and it gave us all a chance to
get back in the race. It should be fun from here on out and we're
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin didn't wait on Jarrett, who finished second for the
sixth time in the last seven races at North Carolina Speedway, even
though Jarrett had plenty of oppotunities to catch the No. 6 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   With only 14 laps remaining, Ernie Irvan lost control of his No.
36 Pontiac in turn 3, hitting the wall and bringing out the third
caution flag in 25 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there was another restart or caution, it just made
it more difficult to win,'' Martin said. ``Believe me, I've lost a
lot more races than I've won and there's all kinds of ways to lose
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only contender to pit during the four-lap caution was Rusty
Wallace, who was eighth when the cars lined up in single file for
the restart with only nine laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Martin exploded coming out of turn 1 after the restart, and
Jarrett never really challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restart was pretty good, but once we got down into turn 2
he got away,'' Jarrett said. ``On the restart I thought about
trying to make a move and I thought about the outside. But after
we'd run the tires, I just couldn't make it stick. That was gonna
be my one shot, but he got to the corner before I did so that was
kind of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton dominated the first half of the race in his No. 99 Ford.
He led the race eight different times, including a 72-lap stretch
until Martin passed him during a yellow-flag pit stop. That
five-lap caution started with only 36 laps remaining because of
debris on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Burton entered pit road on the front straightway in the lead,
but Martin was first driver out of the pits. Jarrett followed
Martin out, causing Burton to drop two spots to third. Labonte
passed Burton for third place on turn 3 of with only eight laps
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (restarts) hurt us,'' Burton said. ``We were better on
long runs, especially with the way our setup was. We just lost our
track position (during the cautions) and it's really hard to pass
with good cars in the front. We've gotta get better on pit road. It
wasn't a fast pit stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burton's fourth-place finish was better than Gordon and
Dale Earnhardt, the runner-up in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt crashed
in turn 4 of the 275th lap and finished 41st in the 43-car field.
He fell to 17th in points, trailing his teammate Skinner by 105
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't working good at all,'' Earnhardt said. ``The car
was too tight and it was wearing the front tires down. It went to
skating, skating and pushing. We weren't handling all day. We were
fighting it and just didn't have the right combination. We were way
off on the chassis.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, Gordon's competition can enjoy the fact
that he's not leading the points race. After all, it had been
nearly 16 months since he hadn't. That could change in two weeks at
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew (we) were human,'' Gordon said. ``It pretty much
shows that it doesn't matter what you did in Daytona. You've got to
do it every weekend. We went from hero to zero.''

 &HT;    Atwater to test Falcons' interest
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ With the NFL scouting combine concluding today,
the Atlanta Falcons are expected to step up efforts to bolster
their secondary this week.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Peter Schaffer, who represents at least three unrestricted
free agents in whom the Falcons have indicated interest, said free
safety Steve Atwater will meet with coach Dan Reeves today. A
seven-time Pro Bowl performer, Atwater was released by the Denver
Broncos last week.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater, 32, was brought into the NFL by Reeves, who selected
him in the first round of the 1989 draft. The 10-year veteran also
is expected to visit this week with the New York Jets and Kansas
City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something will happen quickly with Steve because of the level
of interest in him,'' Schaffer said. Schaffer continues to talk
with Atlanta officials about cornerback Ronnie Bradford and wide
receiver Chris Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   The team also plans to bring Chicago Bears strong safety Marty
Carter to Suwanee this week. Carter, 29, a native of LaGrange, has
been a consistent performer and during the past few years his
tackle totals are superior to those of Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials confirmed interest in Cincinnati cornerback
Ashley Ambrose, but concede they might not be able to afford his
asking price. The addition of Ambrose could be a tacit concession
the Falcons feel that former No. 1 pick Michael Booker still is not
ready to be a full-time starter.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons free agent defensive end Antonio Edwards is considering
a two-year, $1.4 million offer from Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Tony Martin, under federal indictment for the
alleged laundering of drug money and conspiracy, is scheduled for
arraignment today in Miami. It is expected that his attorneys will
request his trial be delayed until next February, to allow him to
play the 1999 season.

SCANDAL-HUNGRY PUBLIC RETURNS TO JONBENET SLAYING MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Bereft of Monica, scandal-deprived Americans
pounced last week on the death of JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment drama ran out of steam, ``Perfect Murder,
Perfect Town,'' by Lawrence Schiller, went on sale here last
Thursday, three weeks earlier than HarperCollins had originally
planned to release it. The book is an encyclopedic 621-page
reconstruction of the investigation into the slaying here in
December 1996 of JonBenet Ramsey, a 6-year-old beauty pageant
princess.
</P>
<P>
   Television producers booked Schiller for a marathon of
interviews with 12 national shows, including ``Good Morning
America'' and ``Rivera Live.'' By Thursday, the book was already at
the top of two Internet best-seller lists. As the first hardcover
run of 150,000 copies dwindled, a second printing was started.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tracey, a University of Colorado journalism professor
who interviewed the Ramseys for a television documentary last
summer, described Schiller's timing as ``absolutely brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey, who was born in Britain, added, ``America has an
insatiable appetite for the sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Boulder grand jury expected to reach a decision on an
indictment in the case before the jury term ends on April 21,
interest in the mystery is expected to remain high. With the
witness list largely exhausted, John and Patsy Ramsey, the girl's
parents, are expected to come any day now from their home in
Atlanta to testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Schiller does not say who he thinks killed the
girl. But he does contribute new details that provide grist for
amateur detectives.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that a Boulder police detective told him that, less
than half an hour after John Ramsey emerged from his wine cellar
with his daughter's body, he telephoned his private pilot, trying
to arrange for the family to fly out of Boulder that night.
Schiller also writes that four fibers found on the duct tape that
covered the girl's mouth appeared to be from a jacket that her
mother wore on the night of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller also writes that only someone familiar with the Ramsey
house would have known how to obtain the white blanket that was
found wrapped around the girl's body. He wrote that Linda
Hoffman-Pugh, the family's housekeeper, has studied crime scene
photos and has concluded that the blanket was probably taken from a
washer-dryer unit that was concealed in an upstairs cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Friday, Schiller said he and a team of
researchers spent two years preparing the book, conducting 571
interviews and reading 1,800 pages of law-enforcement files and
many internal memorandums from the Boulder district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The book highlights a feud that was known to exist between the
Boulder police department and the office of the Boulder district
attorney, Alexander M. Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the biggest bombshell was Schiller's contention
that in fall 1997, Hunter tried to use tabloid reporters to dig up
dirt on Police Cmdr. John Eller, then the lead detective in the
case. The intrigue reached such a level, Schiller writes, that
Boulder police detectives took a tabloid reporter to a bar, plied
him with beer and then secretly tape-recorded his boasts that he
was working with Hunter to discredit the police commander.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the book came out, Hunter released a statement
saying he would not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramsey case has chewed up careers. Eller took early
retirement last year and moved to Florida. Tom Koby, the police
chief who initially led the investigation, has resigned and left
Boulder. After public complaints crested last summer over Hunter's
unwillingness to take the case to a grand jury, the case was
largely handed over to Michael Kane, a grand jury expert brought in
by Boulder prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives, amateurs and professionals alike, largely agree that
shoddy police work on the first day crippled the investigation.
Since then, the Boulder police and prosecutors have spent $1.6
million in the most expensive criminal investigation in the city's
history.
</P>
<P>
   With the new JonBenet book flying out of stores, Lisa Herling, a
spokeswoman for HarperCollins, said last Friday from New York that
there was ``no correlation'' between the end of the Monica saga and
the speeding up of the book's release date.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been so popular that the inventory manager at the
Boulder Book Store, the largest independent bookstore in town,
quietly went to a discount shop last Thursday night and bought its
entire stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book came out yesterday, and it was pretty crazy,'' said
Arsen Kashkashian, the manager at the Boulder Book Store. ``We sold
98 copies and put another 50 on hold for people. I have been here
for six years, and I can't remember a book selling that fast on the
first day.''

MEMORIES PUT A LUMP IN ONE'S THROAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A university professor of communications at the University of
Montana once defined a journalist as ``a newspaperman without a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So we should all be suspicious when ``journalists'' enter into
debates about the second-oldest profession. Currently, one of those
debates challenges whether newspapermen and women operating under a
joint operating agreement _ like those at the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Times _ can maintain a competitive
fire.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence _ piled as high as a mountain of mashed potatoes _
insists that they can and do.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a really important issue like mashed potatoes, since
somebody used that simile.
</P>
<P>
   I've known Brand X columnist Emmett Watson over the lifespan of
at least six of his departed mutts. But when he insists _ as he
recently did _ that mashed potatoes are supposed to have lumps,
well, the battle is on.
</P>
<P>
   Watson can write about politics, civic boosterism, sports
stadiums or small dogs and I will try to be tolerant. But when he
picks up a knife and fork, he is liable to poke somebody's eye out.
Obviously, this man has no mashed-potato credentials. I think Dan
Quayle learned how to spell potatoes from Emmett Watson.
</P>
<P>
   My sainted mother, a Scot, taught me how to mash potatoes, by
hand. The task required at least 10 minutes of heavy breathing and
three or four knuckle cramps. And the task was not completed to my
mother's satisfaction if she detected even one lump as big as a
B-B.
</P>
<P>
   I spent two years peeling potatoes in a fraternity kitchen under
the watchful gaze of a motherly cook who set the same standards,
even though we mashed the potatoes in a cement mixer. There was
only one unforgiven sin in that fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   Meat is expensive. Potatoes are cheap. So you never, ever ran
out of mashed potatoes. I never did. And the first thing I
explained to Alice when we were married was that meat is expensive
and potatoes are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Well, to be journalistically accurate, not all meat is
expensive. For example, you can create a gutbuster of a meal out of
three turkey legs, which you can sometimes buy for two bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But you see, you have to like dark meat. Watson is not able to
differentiate. For a few decades he foisted a recipe for something
called Thompson Turkey on an unsuspecting public. A Thompson Turkey
emerges from the oven neither white nor dark. It is usually charred
blacker than a newspaper columnist's soul. Not so with:
</P>
<P>
   Good Lookin' Legs
</P>
<P>
   3 large turkey legs
</P>
<P>
   3 celery tops
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Water as needed
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the legs into a large pot. Add the celery, onions and
water to cover. Add the salt, bring the water to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer 2 hours. Let turkey cool in the water, then with
your fingers pick off and reserve the turkey meat, discarding the
bones and skin.
</P>
<P>
   This should give you about 4 cups of turkey meat.
</P>
<P>
   Three-legged Casserole
</P>
<P>
   Meat from 3 turkey legs
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons Wondra flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet
</P>
<P>
   1 can (4 to 6 ounces) sliced mushrooms, drained
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon powdered sage
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup butter, margarine or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 package Stovetop Stuffing
</P>
<P>
   Water as needed
</P>
<P>
   Distribute the turkey meat over the bottom of a casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the 3 cups of chicken broth in a saucepan. Mix the flour
with 3/4 cup cold water and stir until smooth. Stir this mess into
the broth and boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 1
minute. Stir in the Kitchen Bouquet and sage, add the mushrooms and
let sit over very low heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan dump contents of the dressing spice pack
and the butter or oil. Add 1 and 2/3 cups water. Bring to a boil
then simmer 5 minutes. Stir in the dried stuffing until it has all
been moistened. Or, you can make your own favorite turkey stuffing,
if you have the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the gravy over the turkey meat. Scatter the dressing over
the top of the casserole. Shove dish into a 350-degree oven for 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   Three-Legged Soup
</P>
<P>
   Meat from 3 turkey legs or equivalent of cooked chicken meat
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 small green pepper, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces Mexican-style canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces cooked pinto beans
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chunky style salsa
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces chicken or turkey broth
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large pot and toss in the onions and green
peppers. Stir-cook 3 minutes. Add the garlic, cook another minute,
then add all the other ingredients, including the turkey or chicken
meat. Simmer 30 minutes, then taste to see if it needs more salt,
pepper or salsa. Makes eight bowls of soup.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could combine the meat from the legs with some turkey
gravy and serve over some you-know-what.

SHIITE CLERIC'S SLAYING HEIGHTENS TENSION IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The assassination of Iraq's leading Shiite Muslim
cleric was the latest in a series of killings of Shiite clergymen
in that country, and could heighten tensions between the
Sunni-dominated government and the Shiites who comprise a majority
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, was
shot to death on Friday, in his native town of Najaf, a Shiite holy
city 100 miles south of Baghdad. His two sons were also killed in
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Iraqi government condemned the killers ``and those
who pushed them.'' A statement by the Information Ministry hinted
at suspicions of foreign involvement, suggesting that those behind
the attack had been ``desperately trying to sow sedition among our
unified people.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also unconfirmed reports that the killings had
provoked further clashes. In faxes sent to Western news agencies,
several Iraqi opposition groups said that street clashes had
erupted in sections of Baghdad between Iraqi security forces and
Shiite civilians who staged protests in response to the killing of
Sadr, a respected figure who was the third Shiite cleric to be
killed in Iraq in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   There have long been deep tensions between the Sunni-led regime
of President Saddam Hussein and Shiite Muslims, who make up 65
percent of Iraq's population but are mostly centered in the south
of the country, where government forces violently put down a
Shiite-led rebellion at the close of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The crushing of the rebellion prompted the United States and its
allies to clamp a no-flight zone over the southern part of Iraq in
part to protect the Shiite population.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Iraqi troops have nonetheless succeeded in
suppressing a low-level insurrection, but at the same time, several
Shiite clerics have died in mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a special U.N. investigator, Max van der Stoel, in a
report on human rights in Iraq, asserted that the killings appeared
aimed at silencing dissent in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iraqi opposition groups reported Sunday that riots had
resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen people. Those reports
could not be verified, but reports of other protests by Shiites in
neighboring Iran, Syria and Jordan showed that the murder had
indeed ignited anger against an Iraqi government widely seen by
Shiites as repressive.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, at least 2,000 people, most of them Iraqi refugees,
marched briefly through the streets of the capital, Amman, to
demand revenge for the death of Sadr, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement faxed to news agencies in Cairo, the outlawed
Iraqi Communist Party, accused the government of Hussein as being
behind ``this latest murder.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sadr was highly respected among Shiites, who have virtually been
excluded from a ruling Iraqi elite that is made up almost entirely
of the minority Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the ayatollah had been seen to be closely
aligned with the Iraqi government, which in 1992 appointed him as
the country's leading Shiite cleric.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship has become strained in recent months over a
religious edict that the ayatallah issued last year. The edict, or
fatwa, calls on Iraqis to attend Friday Prayers in the mosques
rather than by watching television at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government does not approve of large crowds, and the
ayatollah's edict was seen by many observers as an attempt by him
to distance himself from the government and to establish himself an
independent base of power.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said Sunday that it had caught some members of a gang that
assassinated Sadr, but it did not provide any details about the
suspects.

 &HT;    Backup to starter, no sweat for Nixon
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lake Buena Vista, Fla. _ Otis Nixon arrived in spring training
on Sunday with a little bit more on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   Five days ago, when Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with
lymphoma, Nixon went from being a backup to the Braves starter in
left field. But for Nixon, that move is completely natural. He's
beenstarting ever since the Braves put him in center in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to change anything because I'm stepping back into
the same situation,'' Nixon said. ``From my standpoint it shouldn't
be any added pressure. It gives you something extra to play for.
Hopefully everybody will stay healthy the rest of the year. I'm
looking forward to playing with Brian Jordan and the rest of the
guys. ... I just want to come in, get my work done, and get ready
for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has played center most of his career and said he hasn't
played any left since he left Atlanta in 1993. He doesn't think it
will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can catch a ball anywhere,'' Nixon said. ``Left, right,
whatever. I can make some quick adjustments. ... Every now and then
I go over there (to left field) and take balls just to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon also is comfortable in the clubhouse, where some former
Braves teammates can stillbe found, including Tom Glavine, Greg
Maddux, John Smoltz, and Brian Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding around 285 in Atlanta; you go around and
around and get back to the same point,'' Nixon said. ``Things do
work themselves out for whatever reason. They always say good
things happen to good guys, good ballclubs. So be it. If you're in
Minnesota or some of the other teams, we'd probably be crying.''
</P>
<P>
   On deck
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the position players are scheduled to report today
to begin full-squad workouts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss ready to go
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss is in camp a few days early. After spending
all of last season fighting through a hamstring and a subsequent
quadriceps injury, Weiss is hoping and preparing for a healthier
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange year,'' Weiss said. ``I couldn't run pretty
much the whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   To guard against it happening again, Weiss didn't start running
this offseason until January and he did more sprint work. He did
his workouts on a track, running short distances with bursts of
speed.

DESPITE TV SHOWS, BOB NEWHART REMAINS A STANDUP GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was during an engagement at Seattle's Paramount Theatre in
1981 that Bob Newhart came up with the idea for ``Newhart,'' his
popular sitcom about the proprietors of a Vermont inn.
</P>
<P>
   The show aired on CBS for nearly 10 years, from October 1982 to
August 1990, attracting viewers with such quirky characters as an
odd trio of backwoods brothers _ Larry, his brother Darryl and his
other brother Darryl _ and slow-thinking caretaker George Utley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newhart'' followed another successful series, ``The Bob
Newhart Show,'' which finished a six-year run on CBS in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were staying at a small Seattle hotel,'' Newhart
said by phone from his home in Los Angeles, ``and while we were
having lunch one day in the cafeteria with some of the employees, I
thought to myself, This is really like an extension of `The Bob
Newhart Show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Newhart, who returns to Seattle in April to perform at
``Foolproof: The Northwest Comedy Festival,'' called his manager.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Bob Newhart Show' had been off the air for about four
years. I told him, `I think I'm ready to go back on TV.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to ``Nick at Nite,'' ``Newhart'' (as well as ``The
Bob Newhart Show'' of 1972-78, co-starring Suzanne Pleshette as
Newhart's wife Emily) enjoys an audience too young to have
remembered the original series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of fan mail now written in crayon,'' Newhart said
with a chuckle. ``You get letters that say, `I'm 10 years old and I
love your show.' And that makes you feel good. You're reaching a
whole new generation. It's a tribute to the writing and the
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhart's last TV show, ``George &AMP; Leo'' (with co-star Judd
Hirsch), didn't do so well. It went off the air last year after
only one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had writing problems,'' Newhart said, struggling to
explain why one of the most successful TV comedy stars of the '70s
and '80s couldn't make a go of his last show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never found itself. My scenes with Judd were pure joy, but
the chemistry for the rest of the cast, which is so essential,
really wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhart said the fight for ratings took a lot out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard to make it work and then it doesn't. It's not
so much a physical exhaustion as it is a mental exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhart grew up in Chicago and began his standup comedy career
at local clubs before becoming a writer and performer for an
unsuccessful variety show that followed ``The Tonight Show,''
starring Jack Paar.
</P>
<P>
   When Warner Bros. Records expressed an interest in recording
some of his material for an album, Newhart borrowed a tape recorder
and headed to the Tidelands, a Houston nightclub. The year was
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Opening for Ken and Mitzi Welch, who later wrote material for
Carol Burnett, Newhart recorded some of the routines that would
launch his career: ``The Driving Instructor,'' ``The Submarine
Commander'' and ``Sir Walter Raleigh Explains Tobacco'' (``You put
the leaves in your mouth and you set fire to them!''). They were
often performed as though he were having a telephone conservation
with a silent caller.
</P>
<P>
   Newhart was dubbed the ``button-down comedian'' because of his
button-down shirts and low-key style. The deadpan delivery loved by
millions of TV viewers evolved naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't survey the comedy scene and say, `Oh, look there's
nobody doing deadpan humor. Or there's no one stammering either. So
the two of them together would be a great combination.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just my way of looking at life. I don't think you can
manufacture that.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition from standup comedy to TV also came
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comic knows how to time a joke and he always knows what's
funny and what isn't funny, at least for him,'' Newhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a voice that every comedian has and it's either
someone else's voice or it's their own voice. And when you see
somebody who has their own voice, it jars you. You think, That
guy's going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's comedy stars tend to push the envelope and that's good,
Newhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I first played Harrah's Club in 1960. There
was a sign in the dressing room, `No Blue Material.' They had the
right to excise anything they felt was unsuitable for their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone from Harrah's came back to my dressing room afterward
and said, `I loved the show. ... By the way, you had four hells and
three damns.' That's pretty mild stuff today.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his TV career, Newhart continued doing standup
comedy. His performance at the Foolproof festival (his first
Seattle performance since a scholarship benefit for Seattle
University at the Westin Hotel in 1984) will feature new material
as well as some of the famous routines of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a standup is a little like being a prostitute,'' he
said. ``The first time you get paid for it, you automatically
become a professional. And there's no going back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Newhart doubts he can resurrect his TV career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never say never, but I don't picture myself going back
on the tube. It's a different time and a different kind of humor.
It's a different world now.''

he does. How 30,000 Cincinnati Reds fans had turned their
affectionate ``Booooone'' chants into just plain ``Boooooo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was trying to make me feel better, said `They're
saying Boone,''' Boone said. ``I said the hell they are!''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves new second baseman was joking about it last week in
the Braves' dugout at Disney. That's because he's a great season
and a team removed from that miserable 1997 season. But the
memories remain -- a third generation major-leaguer suddenly felt
odd at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in my life I was not confident,'' Boone
said. ``I didn't believe that I was going to go to the plate and
get a hit. It was the lowest point of my career. I couldn't wait
for it to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Boone's problem was the more he went after home runs,
the longer his swing got, and it was already long to begin with.
His average dropped to .223. His home runs dipped into single
digits (7) for the first time since his rookie year in Seattle. For
the first time in four years with the Reds, he failed to get 100
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tests you, to see what you've got,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   After the `97 season, Boone did some rethinking on his swing. He
shortened it by taking the bat off his shoulder and opening up his
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The results in 1998 were convincing. His average climbed 43
points to .266. He had a career-high 24 home runs and 95 RBIs, to
finish third in both categories among second baseman behind Jeff
Kent and Damion Easley.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether he'll be able to continue his
offensive trend in Atlanta. The heat is on Boone to do it,
especially given the loss of Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why I can't look for even better things this
year,'' said Boone, who also won a Gold Glove for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   One place he'll go for some help is hitting coach Don Baylor,
who played with Bret's father Bob Boone for the California Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that arrogance about him where you want to strangle him
half the time,'' said Baylor, who's known Bret since he was a boy.
``He's a good player. He understands the game. He's a determined
guy. He takes every at-bat personal. You like that kind of
desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who's in the second year of a four-year contract, can
demand to be traded at the end of this season. But he'd rather
renegotiate his contract with the Braves and stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   He signed an $11.4 million contract in February of 1997, and is
scheduled to make $2.9 million this season and $3.75 the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not coming in here to cause a lot of headaches,'' Boone
said. ``I'd like to get it done quietly. I'd like to get it done
quickly. I'm going to leave that up to John (Schuerholz). For me,
my first thing is to come and play. I'm on a new team, I'm in a
great situation. I want to go out and have a great year and not
worry about that.''

MALONE HUMOR BACKFIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ When spring training began, Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone used humor as he tried to find an antidote for
some of the venom being spewed by other baseball clubs about L.A.'s
$105 million signing of pitcher Kevin Brown, and its $84 million
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees acquired Roger Clemens earlier in the week,
Malone talked, with tongue in cheek, about how the Yankees would
need the five-time Cy Young Award winner when they faced the
Dodgers in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   What Malone got in return were a lot of headlines, ranging from
``Dodgers GM: Yanks-L.A. series'' to ``Malone's Crystal Ball Shows
Yanks-Dodgers'' to ``Los Angeles GM forecasts Dodgers-Yankees World
Series matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing about it,'' Malone said. ``It's old news.
It's water under the bridge. The last couple of days I've made some
comments, and they weren't all serious. . . . I'll always learn
lessons and I've learned some lessons here.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect dryer statements from Malone in the future, but he also
said the comments have motivated him to get back to the on-field
situations regarding the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me get focused once again and to get back to the
hard work that is needed to get to where we need to go,'' Malone
said. ``We're focusing on what we've got to do to be the best we
can be for April 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Making an impression: So far, only 42 of 60 players are in town,
but a few pitchers have caught the eye of manager Davey Johnson.
Tops on the list is starting pitcher Ismael Valdes, which could
fuel the Dave Mlicki trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like what I've seen in Valdes,'' Johnson said. ``I
heard he had a decent arm, and seeing him throw, I really like the
way he's handled himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said he liked what he saw from Mlicki. Not
coincidentally, there is speculation that the Dodgers will try to
trade a starting pitcher as camp progresses, and Mlicki is the
leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malone said he hasn't gotten any phone calls inquiring
about Mlicki since the winter, partly because Malone said he
wouldn't make a move until spring training was underway and he was
sure all his starting pitchers were healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added he was impressed with what he saw from nonroster
invitees Chris Haney and Pedro Borbon, both lefties, and 40-man
roster guys Mike Judd and Eric Gagne, both right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Koufax at camp: Johnson was a few minutes later than usual
getting to the practice field Sunday because he was talking with
legendary Dodger Sandy Koufax in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a young pitcher, if Sandy Koufax was to say hi to me,
I may not hear him because I would be in such awe,'' Johnson said.
``It was great to see him. Maybe he'll help out some of our guys.
Not only was he a great pitcher, but he has a great way of relating
to pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was also quick to point out that he got the last hit off
Koufax, a single in the 1966 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was washed up then,'' Johnson said. ``He knew it
was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre contract: On a team whose payroll will hover near $80
million on Opening Day _ depending on who's traded or not _ the
projected starting third baseman might make a quarter of a
percentage point of that figure. Beltre, due into camp in the next
few days, is yet to sign a contract for this season, though it's
nothing more than a procedural thing since he has no bargaining
position. Beltre is expected to make slightly more than
major-league minimum, which was raised from $170,000 to $200,000
this season.

THE WAY TO TELL A BANANA IS BY THE SPIEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an invitation to ``Designing Miss Chiquita.''
It sounded like a porn film screening.
</P>
<P>
   But it was actually a 100th birthday celebration for Chiquita
Brands held last week. The company was unveiling a new costume for
its fruit-hatted ambassador _ Miss Chiquita, first drawn in 1944 _
and New York designers had been invited to create Chiquita-inspired
fashions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Banana dresses? Chiquita's new peels? It was too good to pass
up.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were singing and passing leaflets outside a tent on
42nd Street, where the event was held _ ``Ban This Banana! Don't
Let Chiquita Cheat Us!''
</P>
<P>
   Security guards checked invitation-bearing guests before opening
the doors. Inside there was a second scan against a guest list.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, the bars were running out of supplies. Several
hundred people milled around, drinking, seeing and being seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady Bunny'' strolled by wearing a zebra-print caftan, three
sets of false eyelashes (two on top, one on lower lids) and
possibly the largest mass of blonde curls ever assembled on a wig.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of several drag queen encounters. Curly blonde
wigs were the hair du jour, along with fishnet hosiery, false
lashes and strappy platform heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iggy'' had on the requisite fishnet hosiery to go with his
yellow maillot _ a women's swimsuit, for you who don't follow
fashion _ plus a cluster of red cherries where his cleavage should
have been and a red, faux-fur jacket made by his mother. There were
bananas hanging from each hip and a cascade of green ruffles and
sequins from derriere to ankle.
</P>
<P>
   He was willing to divulge anything but his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9 p.m., guests were allowed into the tent for the
fashion show. Faux banana peels littered the floor. Dozens of
oversized inflated bananas bounced around the room.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went wild over a male model bursting out of a padded
yellow banana peel. They screemed over a model in a yellow vinyl
dress with the Chiquita logo on her left buttock.
</P>
<P>
   One runway dress _ ripe and fragrant _ was covered with real
banana peels.
</P>
<P>
   Another model walked on stilts covered with banana-like boots.
There even were white chenille robes with yellow and green bananas
woven in.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Heptinstall, executive vice president of Chiquita Banana
North America, said it had taken about a year to execute the
introduction of Chiquita's new blue dress _ a very modest design
with yellow edged ruffles on sleeves and skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita gets to keep her new dress. The designer versions will
be sold at a private auction to benefit the Council of Fashion
Designers of America.

   &UR; SCANDAL PUTS A BLUSH ON THEIR CHEEKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nancy Etcoff &LR; , author of ``Survival of the Prettiest''
(Doubleday; $23.95), puts her own spin on the recent White House
scandal, &LR;  in an excerpt that appears in the latest issue of Cosmo:
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can say about the women in the Clinton scandal _
for the most part, they're looking better every day.
 &UR; Paula Jones &LR;  has straighter hair, pearlier teeth and a new nose,
and  &UR; Linda Tripp &LR;  has an upswept do and a downsized figure.
 &UR; Monica &LR; 
 &UR; Lewinsky &LR;  looked glamorous in photos by  &UR; Herb Ritts &LR; , and
 &UR; Hillary &LR;  is hotter than ever. ... We can laugh at how vain these
women became once the limelight hit them. But at the same time,
we're taking these women more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Etcoff concludes her essay on the importance of looking good by
telling women that they shouldn't worry about spending their lunch
hours looking for lipsticks or getting facials: ``It's not vanity.
It's the new power lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The New York Post reported last week that Lewinsky visited
the studio of  &UR; Patrick Demarchelier &LR; , the photographer best known
for his stunning portraits of  &UR; Princess Di &LR;  (that black-and-white
cover of People magazine, for example). Lewinsky was posing for the
British edition of Marie Claire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. A separate beauty lesson was learned by  &UR; Ted Stevens &LR; ,
R-Alaska, whose Senate seat places him directly behind whoever is
speaking, and who became the focal point of a  &UR; Jay Leno &LR;  shtick
when an impeachment trial video showed him picking his nose. Caught
by the cameras, Stevens gave a medical excuse: He had bothersome
nose hairs, he said, because he is missing a bone in his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, says Roll Call, Senator  &UR; Daniel Inouye &LR; ,
D-Hawaii, presented Stevens with a battery-operated nose hair
remover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AGAIN, LOOKS COUNT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; James Brown &LR; , the editor of British GQ, was forced to quit last
week after he lauded the fashion sense of Field Marshal  &UR; Erwin &LR; 
 &UR; Rommel &LR;  and the Nazi army in a feature about the best-dressed men
of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of this general alongside some of the world's most
gifted actors, musicians and designers makes decent people want to
vomit,'' said  &UR; Lord Janner &LR; , chairman of the Holocaust Education
Trust. Conde Nast announced Brown's departure, ``by mutual

IMPLAUSIBLE FINALE LEAVES `BORDERLINE' DANGLING; `BEAT' IS BUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For your February-sweeps viewing enjoyment, NBC and ABC offer a
distinct choice Monday night at 9: a gallon of Ripple or a sip of
Sherry.
</P>
<P>
   The Ripple, as you'd expect, is cloying and not very complex.
The Sherry is infinitely better, though not completely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has the Ripple, with ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and
Cher Story,'' featuring neither Sonny nor Cher. NBC has the Sherry
in ``Border Line,'' with Sherry Stringfield starring in a film
produced by her friend and former ``ER'' co-star, Anthony Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   In a VCR-less world, the choice would be easier than a
three-chord Sonny Bono song. ``Border Line,'' a fairly standard
pulse-pounder with a cliched and overwrought ending, still has
moments of intelligence that elevate it several classes above ``The
Sonny and Cher Story,'' which seems to be a refugee from some sort
of amateur-hour show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   In her return to television, Stringfield chose to work with
Edwards' production company, playing an immigration lawyer in Los
Angeles who stumbles upon a sophisticated operation that smuggles
Chinese aliens. For more than half its running time, the film works
well on several levels as Stringfield's character, Allison Westlin,
wrestles with the career woman/single mom question as well as with
her own unexplored fears and prejudices in a world where human life
is often treated as cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Border Line,'' which is good enough to hold a
viewer's interest for about 90 minutes, unravels with an
unimaginative and hugely implausible final act in which Westlin
foolishly places herself in peril as she tries to bring down the
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Originally written for the big screen by Ron Bass (``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' ``Rainman''), ``Border Line'' actually has the
look and feel of a theatrical movie at the beginning. Photography
is crisp yet comfortable. The writing doesn't insult the viewer.
And small but notable performances by some big names _ Carl Lumbly,
Len Cariou and John De Lancie _ help out immeasurably. Elizabeth
Pena is especially worth mentioning as Maria, the woman who takes
care of Westlin's daughter and who awakens Westlin to issues she
has been too busy _ or too afraid _ to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the rewrite for television by Ian Deitchman and Kristin
Rusk ultimately makes ``Border Line'' look like so many other TV
movies: predictable and highly derivative.
</P>
<P>
   If that makes ``Border Line'' just average, be warned that ``And
the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story'' is so far below
average that even Sonny's singing voice would be considered stellar
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Bono's book, ``And the Beat Goes On,'' the film lists
Bono's widow, Mary, as an executive producer. Though not unkind to
Cher, it clearly is the story of Sonny and Cher's rise in the
entertainment world as told by Sonny's side of the partnership.
More to the point, it is not a very good telling of the Sonny and
Cher story.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Underwood, who looks nothing like Sonny, plays him as a
good-natured hustler whose dreams always exceeded his talent.
Underwood is earnest, but his portrayal never quite rings true,
even with plenty of voiceover narration to make up for an
uninspired script. Renee Faia, who does look a little like Cher,
gives a more subtle performance as the conflicted young singer who
is first thrilled with her newfound success and then haunted by it.
</P>
<P>
   The film spans roughly a decade, from Sonny and Cher's rise to
success in the mid-1960s with their hit song, ``I Got You Babe,''
to their divorce in 1974, which temporarily ended their popular TV
show, ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.'' The TV series came back a
couple of years later, but the film doesn't get into that, or into
what happened to Sonny and Cher afterward, save for their
appearance together on David Letterman years later.
</P>
<P>
   Though nostalgic and familiar to many, the film remains
unsatisfying because of its simplistic production. Those compelled
to watch may still find some redeeming value in the wonderful pipes
of Kelly Van Hoose Smith, who provided Cher's singing voice for
most of the film's song segments.
</P>
<P>
   But trust me. The beat will go on without help from this movie.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN MIGHT HOST TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now it appears the Cal State Northridge women's
basketball team has an excellent shot at hosting the Big Sky
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference bent on keeping its image on the upswing, there
might be concern among its officials that its premier women's
basketball event will take place in a gym that seats only 1,600. It
doesn't help that CSUN is last in the league in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky assistant commissioner Ron Loghry said he isn't worried
about CSUN hosting the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never pull a tournament from somebody because of
their site,'' he said. ``They won it and they earn the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace Collins, CSUN's associate athletic director in charge of
business affairs, said two weeks ago that hosting the women's
tournament does not have a financial impact on a department which
is already on a shoestring budget. Unlike the men's tournament, the
women's teams absorb the costs for travel and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky break: So how was CSUN able to schedule a nonconference
football game against Kansas less than seven months before the
season starts?
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors can thank the University of North Texas. Almost two
weeks ago, the Eagles pulled out of their Sept. 11 game at Kansas
to play at Louisiana State on the same day. That left the Jayhawks
scrambling for a team for its home opener.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said he was talking to South Florida
coach Jim Leavitt on the phone and Leavitt told him North Texas had
pulled out of its game at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano wasted little time in contacting Brian Swanson, CSUN's
assistant athletic director who is in charge of football
scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Brian to call (Kansas) that day and he did,'' Ponciano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said the paperwork was completed within days and the
game was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just play phone tag around the country and sometimes you
get lucky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher visibility: Adding Kansas means the football team plays
two Big 12 teams in '99; the Matadors were already scheduled to
play at Southern Methodist on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice progression for us,'' Ponciano said. ``Our next
hope is that we can compete and not embarrass ourselves. In the
(Big Sky) Conference meeting, we all spoke about national
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gem: The women's soccer program received another boost
when it received a letter of intent from Chaminade midfielder Amy
Watts, a four-year starter. Watts was also considering UC schools
and CSUN didn't appear to be in the running as late as last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought we had a good chance,'' said Allison Lee,
CSUN's interim head coach. ``When she found out more about CSUN's
academic program . . . she was pleasantly surprised. That was
actually a selling point.''
</P>
<P>
   Amari honored: Junior forward Lynda Amari was named the Big Sky
women's basketball player of the week after she scored 51 points in
two Matadors victories.
</P>
<P>
   Amari had 28 points and 13 rebounds in CSUN's 71-67 win over
Portland State on Saturday night that moved the Matadors into sole
possession of first place in the conference.

SELF-GOVERNMENT A STEP CLOSER FOR NATION'S CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C., Va.)   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The District of Columbia is a step closer to
realizing the goal of self-government, reflecting a confidence by
Congress in Mayor Anthony Williams that it never felt for his
predecessor, Marion Barry.
</P>
<P>
   With a credibility built on his years as the District's chief
financial officer, Williams has impressed lawmakers enough in his
first weeks in office that the House of Representatives passed a
bill last week that would shift authority for the day-to-day city
government operations from the District's control board back to the
city's elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to act favorably on the measure when it
returns from its recess.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House vote, Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., who is
chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the District, said
it was a ``new era'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill gives Mayor Williams the tools he needs to do his
job,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's delegate in the House,
noted that Williams' ``rare record of bringing financial
responsibility'' to the city before becoming an elected official
influenced many members. ``Mayor Williams was anxious to get
authority back,'' Ms. Norton said. ``And he earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Barry, Williams has acted quickly to bring changes in the
city's operations. This week, he announced several cabinet members,
and said he would make other appointments soon. He announced a
series of public initiatives, including measures to reduce waiting
time at the Department of Motor Vehicles, expand the hours of city
agencies, demolish abandoned buildings, fill potholes and remove
graffiti. These efforts have further broadened support for the
mayor after his easy election victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hired as the city's chief financial officer in
October 1995 and served as intermediary between the control board
and city leaders, who often disagreed with its decisions. But in
large measure, the board's effort to restore financial
accountability to the District paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The District has recorded budget surpluses for the last two
years. And this year's surplus of $445 million represents the first
positive balance for the city in a decade _ eradicating a debt of
more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the city can balance its budget for two more years, the
control board will be shut down automatically under the bill that
created it.
</P>
<P>
   But until the vote in Congress last week, residents were often
confused about who was in charge of making daily decisions for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will streamline reporting of authority,'' Ms. Norton said
of the House measure, which would permit Williams to oversee the
city's nine largest agencies and to hire and dismiss senior
managers in the government. The District Council will regain
authority to approve mayoral appointees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of the fact that those who have worked
tirelessly for the District of Columbia truly believe in democracy,
truly believe that the citizens of the District of Columbia are
capable of governing themselves,'' said Rep. James Moran, D-Va.,
the ranking minority member of the House subcommittee that oversees
appropriations for the District. ``You cannot hold them responsible
without giving them the authority to make decisions on their own.
This gives them that authority.''

TYSON FACES HEARING FOR THROWING TELEVISION SET
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md., Ind.)  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson faces a disciplinary hearing at the Montgomery County
Maryland jail Monday after he lost his temper Friday night and
threw a television set against a wall in a communal room at the
facility. Depending on the outcome of the hearing, Tyson could have
some privileges, such as visitation, restricted.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also complicates negotiations for a reduction in
the one-year jail sentence that Tyson drew on Feb. 5 for assaulting
two men after a minor traffic accident in Gaithersburg, Md., last
Aug. 31. Tyson, 32, pleaded no contest to the two misdemeanor
assault charges on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has been confined to an isolated cell since Friday's
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Seleznow, a spokesman for the detention center, said the
former heavyweight champion will go before members of the
correctional staff for a hearing to determine disciplinary action.
Seleznow said it appeared that Tyson's act was not directed at any
inmates or members of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Tyson said he had not had his prescribed
dosage of Zoloft since last Wednesday. Tyson has taken the
antidepressant every day for the last four months _ except the week
of his fight against Francois Botha on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The person said Tyson's medication was cut off because of a
dispute over his treatment between the detention center
psychiatrist and Tyson's personal psychiatrist, Dr. Richard
Goldberg, who heads the Georgetown University Medical School
Department of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   The institution's psychiatrist wanted to examine Tyson before
allowing him to continue taking Zoloft, but Tyson refused because
he was already under the care of Goldberg, who has been seeing
Tyson weekly since he went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznow said he could neither confirm nor deny that there was a
dispute between the two psychiatrists or that Tyson was off his
medication because he had not spoken to the jail's psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's lawyers have been trying to negotiate an early release
that would let Tyson resume his boxing training within the next
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is whether Tyson's assault on the motorists put
him in violation of the terms of his probation on a 1992 rape
conviction in Indiana. There is the possibility that he could be
sent back to prison in Indiana for four years.

   When Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the pioneering heart surgeon,
performed a coronary bypass procedure in August that was
transmitted live over the Internet, more than 150,000 people tuned
in to the Webcast over the course of the day. In the months since,
tens of thousands more have reportedly logged on for information
about the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was one of nine medical procedures put on the Web in
recent months by AHN.com, the World Wide Web companion to the cable
channel America's Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   Since AHN.com made headlines last June with its Webcast of the
birth of a baby, the site has made a signature _ and a multimedia
educational experience _ of these live medical dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, America's Health Network, which is based at Universal
Studios in Orlando, Fla., started the Web site to extend its reach
and to respond to a growing public interest in health information
on the Web, said Webster Golinkin, AHN's president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   AHN is available in 9.5 million American homes, and an average
of 2 million people around the world visit the Web site each month,
where a live signal of the television channel is available,
</P>
<P>
   But when partnerships that place AHN's content on ABCnews.com,
Yahoo, ESPN.com and Real Networks are figured in, it is probable
that AHN reaches a wider audience on the Web than it does on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they welcome the opportunity to demystify their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting how little the average person knows about
physiology and anatomy,'' said Cooley. ``It helps people to know
what goes on during the procedure, for a person to see a beating
heart.''

ALBRIGHT RULES OUT BOMBING IF BOTH SIDES BAR PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ With the Kosovo peace talks in limbo after
ethnic Albanian delegates suddenly balked at the proposed deal,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spelled out Sunday that
NATO would not bomb the Serbs if the Albanians also spurned a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails because both parties say `No,' there will not be
bombing of Serbia,'' Albright said after spending more than three
hours with the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have long argued that airstrikes were the best way
to end the repression by the Serbs in Kosovo and to force them to a
peace deal before Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But for raids to be considered, the United States must have the
ethnic Albanians agreeing to a peace settlement, leaving the Serbs
and their leader, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, as
the spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   A day after reluctantly agreeing to extend the 2-week-old Kosovo
talks here, Albright was the only foreign minister to visit the
negotiations on Sunday. She urged the ethnic Albanians to accept
what is on offer for Kosovo, rather than insisting on a referendum
for Kosovo's independence, as demanded by the guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, it was not clear whether the ethnic Albanians, who
the United States thought would be the easy part of the equation in
the peace talks, had returned to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Their sudden standoff on Saturday left the peace talks in limbo.
Combined with the refusal of the Serbs to accept NATO soldiers as
peacekeepers in Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' intransigence forced
Albright and the other negotiators to move a deadline previously
described as immovable back to Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had lunch with four ethnic Albanians, including Hashim
Thaci, the influential 29-year-old guerrilla leader, and Veton
Surroi, the publisher of the largest-circulation newspaper in
Kosovo, who is considered the most pragmatic man on the 16-man
ethnic Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, according to participants at the conference, Surroi
gave an impassioned speech to his colleagues, urging them to stop
being shortsighted and to sign so that pressure could be exerted on
Milosevic to accept NATO troops or face NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the objections, which were made by the five
delegates who are members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, was the
fact that the draft proposal lacked the word ``referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   The mantra of the guerrillas has been that after the three years
of autonomy envisaged by the proposed peace accord, a referendum in
Kosovo, where 90 percent of residents are ethnic Albanians, would
result in their long-sought independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi, who is fluent in English and well traveled, remarked
last week that the ``referendum had become a four-letter word'' for
the foreign mediators at the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ethnic Albanians have won considerable leeway in
the latest drafts of the political settlement, including a
reference to an international conference which, among other things,
would consider ``the will of the people'' when final status is
decided in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also spent an hour on Sunday with the Serbian
president, Milan Milutinovic, in an effort to encourage the Serbs
to drop their opposition to NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has insisted that a 28,000-member
NATO-led force, including 4,000 U.S. soldiers, is an integral part
of a peace settlement for Kosovo. Without foreign soldiers to
oversee the withdrawal of Serbian security police, who have
conducted most of the repression in Kosovo in the last year, and
the drawdown of soldiers of the Yugoslav army, a peace settlement
would never become reality on the ground, administration officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary apparently made much less progress with
Milutinovic, who is Milosevic's man in Rambouillet, than with the
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   After her meeting with Milutinovic, Albright said the Serbs
continued to refuse to deal with the military aspects of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have objected to NATO peacekeepers, on the grounds
that they represent an infringement of the sovereignty of
Yugoslavia and Serbia. Yugoslavia is composed of two republics,
Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo, stripped of its autonomy in 1989 by
Milosevic, is a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington hopes to have the ethnic Albanians signed on to the
peace deal by Monday so that attention can turn to Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A European diplomat said Sunday it was possible that ``someone''
from the West would go to Belgrade before Tuesday's deadline to
persuade Milosevic to accept NATO ground troops. ``Whatever serves
the purpose is a good thing,'' the diplomat said. ``If it's
necessary for someone to go to Belgrade, then it's `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is known for holding out until the last second of a
negotiation, and then caving after someone important goes to see
him. Albright has said she is highly unlikely to go. The British
foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the French foreign minister,
Hubert Vedrine, have not ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats are asking what price Milosevic will
demand now that the ethnic Albanians have shown themselves to be
more prickly than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   As the wording in the draft for the peace settlement became
increasingly refined, human-rights experts said they were troubled
over the vagueness about the United Nations' war crimes tribunal in
The Hague, the Netherlands. Milosevic has so far refused all any
meaningful cooperation with the tribunal, which wants to
investigate alleged war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The current draft, according to the International Coalition for
Justice, a nongovernmental group concerned with the Hague tribunal,
drops assurances that investigators and forensic experts of the
tribunal must be given access to Kosovo to investigate massacres of
ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   One of the demands of the Serbian delegation on Sunday night,
according to a participant in the conference, was for all reference
to the Hague tribunal to be eliminated from the settlement.

   NEW YORK _ ``Seven Sundays ago you started all this,'' Tim
Russert told Sen. Robert Torricelli on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
Sunday, alluding to the Democratic senator's comment on an earlier
program that he would like Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for the
Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just making small talk,'' Torricelli answered. ``You
made it into a national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like throat clearing, a cloying yet harmless way
to ease into an interview: Russert promotes his own program and
Torricelli banters back with flattery. But the New Jersey senator
had a point. Since President Clinton's impeachment trial ended (was
it only 10 days ago?) television has been filled with small talk
that has become big talk about a possible Hillary
Clinton-for-Senate campaign. There could be not a more dramatic
example of how 24-hour news, with its obsessive focus on a single
story, can shape political events.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a Hillary Clinton campaign would have been a
story even in the pre-cable era, but it would not have turned into
such a gigantic snowball. The Hillary Clinton story quickly filled
the post-impeachment void. It was a media-made event that fed on
itself, kept alive by strategic comments wafting from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, speculation about Mrs. Clinton's future
dominated broadcast and cable programs, from CNBC's ``Hardball with
Chris Matthews'' to CNN's ``Crossfire,'' from NBC's ``Today'' to
ABC's ``Nightline'' and a half-dozen MSNBC chat shows.
</P>
<P>
   The possible campaign has been so thoroughly scrutinized that it
is only a slight exaggeration to say Mrs. Clinton doesn't need to
do her own research. She can turn on television and see the latest
polls that show her beating Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. She can hear
Democrats predict she will win, and Republicans call her a
``carpetbagger,'' a word that probably hasn't been uttered so much
in one week since Reconstruction. The issues were treated with the
sophistication of a horse race. Will she run? Will she win?
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Clinton herself has been mum, the speculation can
go anywhere, fueled by tantalizing hints. Her spokeswoman's comment
that Mrs. Clinton would give ``careful consideration'' to running
set off a frenzy. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., whose
announcement that he would not run for re-election started this
speculation, met Mrs. Clinton at the White House for a lunch and
strategy session Friday; the meeting was well-publicized , his
arrival and departure well-photographed.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has been good for Mrs. Clinton's possible
opponents, too. At times the coverage seemed to be
All-Rudy-All-the-Time, a Giuliani media blitz: On Thursday the
mayor appeared on ``Crossfire,'' on Friday on ``Today'' and CNN's
``Inside Politics,'' and Sunday on ABC's ``This Week'' and CNN's
``Late Edition.'' He got to talk about the city and solidify his
position as the likely Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who has said she may run but only if
Mrs. Clinton doesn't, was on ``Fox News Sunday'' and ``Late
Edition'' Sunday, graciously saying she respected Mrs. Clinton's
timetable. And why shouldn't Ms. Lowey be gracious? Now she is on a
national stage positioned as the Hillary Clinton understudy, when
two weeks ago few people knew her name outside her Westchester
district.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton-for-Senate barrage suggests that one
wall-to-wall story will always be with us, in some ways the past
week merely hints at what television news will be like post-Monica.
For a full year journalists from Dan Rather to Matt Drudge have
been following the same story. There may be a fork ahead where the
high and the low roads diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Minor differences have already emerged. When they weren't
discussing Mrs. Clinton, the cable shows, particularly on MSNBC,
returned to their all-purpose fallback position, hashing over the
JonBenet Ramsey murder. That conversation was spurred by the
publication of ``Perfect Murder _ Perfect Town,'' a book on the
subject by Lawrence Schiller, an NBC consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday talk shows covered more substantive issues. On ``Meet
the Press,'' a panel of governors discussed Social Security, taxes
and education. ABC's ``This Week'' was defiantly nonglitzy as it
introduced a new regular segment, ``On the Campaign Trail.'' In a
taped interview, George Will, never their most dynamic commentator,
talked to John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. The pablum
questions and nonanswers about the need to save Social Security
provided exactly the kind of drone that would send even serious
viewers fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   But if those shows feel too proud of their high-minded stances,
it is worth noting that only CNN's ``Late Edition'' devoted a
segment to the Kosovo talks, in a live interview with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Kosovo may be the most dangerous and
immediate issue at hand, but it is even less sexy than the 2000
election. More telling, none of the Sunday talk shows resisted
``Will Hillary Run?''

BRUTAL SLAYING FORCES BRITISH TO EXAMINE POLICE RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Jamaica, Calif.)  (jw) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ Police stopped Carl Josephs on suspicion
of having a stolen car. They stopped him on suspicion of having a
criminal record. They stopped him on suspicion of carrying drugs,
of not wearing a seat belt, of driving where he did not belong.
They stopped him, he said, 34 times in two years, until finally he
started taking the bus to work.
</P>
<P>
   Because he never was found to have done anything wrong _ never
ended up with so much as a speeding ticket _ Josephs, a
quality-control supervisor in a meat factory, could only conclude
that he was singled out because he was black and drove a car with a
big picture of Bob Marley, the late Jamaican reggae star, on the
back. ``Every time I went out of the house, the first thing I
thought is, `Am I going to be harassed?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he couldn't take it any more. In the first case of its
kind in Britain, he sued the West Midlands Police, complaining that
he had been racially harassed. And though he won on only one of his
complaints _ that he had been wrongfully stopped on one occasion _
his case added to what has become an increasingly noisy debate in
Britain about the way police treat people from minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   For years, black and Asian Britons have complained about what
they see as overt and tacit police racism, and except at times of
particular upheaval, like the riots in Brixton in 1981, no one in
authority in Britain has paid much attention.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few months, the issue has been at the forefront
of the country's consciousness. More and more people like Josephs
are making public complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw recently told a parliamentary
committee that he planned to require Britain's police departments
to hire more minority officers. And the government is poised to
release a stinging report about race and the police that is likely
to order nothing less than a sea change in British police culture.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for all this is the six-year-old case of Stephen
Lawrence, a case that Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of
Black Lawyers, described in an interview as ``Rodney King without
the video.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, an 18-year-old black student who was set upon and
stabbed to death in South London in 1993 by a group of white youths
who directed a racial epithet at him. What happened to him _ and
how police apparently botched the inquiry _ has proved a
galvanizing force among minority groups, as well as forcing the
rest of the public to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stephen Lawrence case has got such exposure that in other
places, like Birmingham, cases of racial terror and injustice are
finally being recognized,'' said Maxie Hayles, chairman of the
Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit. ``It's a shame that it
should take the death of a schoolboy to bring this out in the open,
but unfortunately that's what did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Straw is due to release a much-anticipated independent report
this month on police handling of the case. The report is expected
to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial
prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's
largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Norton-Taylor, whose play about Lawrence's killing,
``The Color of Justice,'' has been playing to rave reviews in
London, said that the attention paid to the Lawrence case and
others was a sign that British attitudes toward the overarching
authority of the police and other institutions were finally being
called into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an antipathy building up toward the cops for all
sorts of different reasons, but it hasn't been part of the culture
to have movements, to protest in an organized way,'' he said. ``But
what we're seeing now is that there's a slow building up of demands
for more openness, whether on racism or consumerism or medical
matters. There is much less deference.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That there may be racism in the Metropolitan Police hardly seems
surprising in a city where 20 percent of the population, but only
2.3 percent of the police force, is made up of people from minority
groups. Of the 860 or so black and Asian police officers, only 24
hold the rank of inspector and above, and only about 20 are
sergeants, said Inspector Leroy Logan, chairman of the National
Black Police Association. (As a whole, ethnic minorities account
for 5.6 percent of the British population, and 2 percent, or 2,500,
of the 127,000 police officers in England and Wales).
</P>
<P>
   But it has taken Britain _ at least white Britain _ until now to
ask whether there is anything unusual about these numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has never had anything like the American civil rights
movement. Nor has it had an affirmative action system or a system
of racial quotas. Large numbers of black residents began arriving
only about 50 years ago, coming by boat from the Caribbean as part
of an influx of post-war immigration, giving parts of Britain a
sizable minority population for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a history of slavery here. But black residents and
members of other minority groups have had a hard time beating their
way into the corridors of power. Efforts to change the status quo
have been difficult: Britain has traditionally been a society of
deference, in which institutions of authority, like police
department and other government agencies, are meant to be
respected, not questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Britain, people have traditionally acquiesced, rather than
insisting on standing up and being counted,'' Logan said. ``In
America the response has always been much more militant, more in
your face. Here, until recently, racism was not a word that was
generally discussed in the media, and it was not something on every
chief constable's agenda. Suddenly, the community has been
galvanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that confidence in the police is falling. In a
poll conducted by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, 60 percent of
people interviewed said that they were satisfied with the way the
police do their job, compared with 74 percent 10 years ago. At the
same time, a third of those questioned said they believed the
police treated black and Asian people worse than they treated
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the Lawrence case been so important? If it hadn't been
for the determination of Stephen Lawrence's parents, his death
would probably have been quickly forgotten and filed away. But
Neville and Doreen Lawrence pushed for answers from what they said
was a high-handed police department. When none of the five young
white men who were identified by numerous informants as the likely
murderers were brought to trial, Stephen's family brought a civil
suit against them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was insufficient evidence to find anyone
guilty of Stephen's murder. But the civil case _ and an inquest in
which all five suspects smirkingly refused to answer questions on
the advice of their lawyers _ provoked widespread outrage, even
from such unlikely quarters as the right-leaning Daily Mail
newspaper, which daringly printed the suspects' names and embarked
on a campaign on behalf of the Lawrences. In addition to
Norton-Taylor's play, the case has been the subject of numerous
television programs, including documentaries and a searing
docudrama examining the case from the Lawrences' point of view.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government not only ordered an inquiry
into the case, but also began examining the culture of the
country's police forces. Now, Straw is considering changes to a
system that has protected police officers guilty of misconduct and
allowed them to retire early with their pensions intact. Such
officers, under legislation he is looking at, would have their
pensions cut by up to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders say that they are impressed by the Labor
government's efforts. ``There is quite a sea change with the Blair
administration,'' said Herbert of the Society of Black Lawyers.
``It empathizes and understands that if you have an injustice
against part of society, than sooner or later it affects
everybody.''

HOUSTON'S 26 HELP KNICKS ADD TO BULLS ' MISERY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan Houston acted as if he did not notice. He
simply ignored the dip in atmospheric conditions Sunday as boredom
spread through Madison Square Garden like a drop of ink in a pool
of water.
</P>
<P>
   One dash of the new Bulls and the flavor of this once great
rivalry was altered for everyone in attendance. One glimpse of a
Bulls team that has been stripped to its primer coat, and they knew
this once glorious day of drama had become nothing more than a
staged practice session for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   For years, this day meant Michael Jordan's magic, Patrick
Ewing's bravado and down payments for ticket scalpers patrolling
Eighth Avenue. Sunday, it meant a cheap chance for a victory as the
Knicks methodically and mercifully ended another deflating day for
Bulls Coach Tim Floyd, 79-63, with the help of a season-high 26
points from an awakened Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not like the Knicks and Bulls of old,'' said
Ewing, who offset a difficult shooting day _ just 4 of 15 for 10
points _ with 7 blocked shots. ``Without Michael, Scottie Pippen or
Dennis Rodman, it takes some of the buzz out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without that edge in the air, there were a few slumbering
moments for the Knicks (6-3). After taking a 15-point lead in the
third quarter, the Knicks allowed the Bulls (1-8) to close to four
points during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Houston, refusing to give in to the sleepy feel of
the game, asserted himself against the unthreatening defense of
Brent Barry and Rusty LaRue and put the game out of reach with two
consecutive jumpers, topped by a drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Allan has had pretty good shots most of the year, but
he's gotten on a good roll now,'' said Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who
watched Houston score 25 against Philadelphia last Friday. ``With
him rolling, breaking 80 is still a chore for us. It's hard to put
the burden on him, but he basically has to produce for us to have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In this lockout-shortened season, Houston can ill afford his
traditional two-month warmup. Perhaps his turnaround in the last
two games is a sign that his early season struggle to hit his
outside shot is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been shooting all my life,'' said Houston, whose
consecutive string of 3-pointers _ a team record-tying 10 over the
last three games _ came to an end in the third quarter. ``It's not
something I worry about. To be honest, I haven't changed anything
in my motion. You have to keep everything the same and remain
confident that it's going to go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you struggle for two games, it's like eight games this
year. But I don't put pressure on myself. I don't think about that.
I just remove it from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to motivate himself on this day. There was no rivalry to
do it for him. The Bulls have taken on the look of a burned out
building with only the chimney _ that being Toni Kukoc _ remaining.
It's no wonder that their 63-point total Sunday matched a franchise
low, and their 1-8 start equals the worst for a Bulls' team since
1978. There was nothing tantalizing or electric about facing this
shell of a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never had to get anyone's attention before a Bulls game,''
Van Gundy recalled. ``They had their fear of ... well, I don't want
to say God, but a basketball god. They knew if they didn't play
well, it would be ugly. And that's why today's game wasn't about
statements or any of that. This day was about taking care of
business, going out there, giving a professional effort and playing
hard. And I thought, for the most part, we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston followed Van Gundy's to-do list, as did Kurt Thomas. He
scored 17 points by connecting on five of seven shots from the
field. To start the game off with an energetic burst, the Knicks
fed the ball to Thomas in the post, and he delivered six of their
first nine points. To defeat a lull in the action, Thomas pulled
off two of his three steals to push the Knicks ahead by 12 points
at the lazy start of the third quarter. Like Houston, Thomas was
not affected by an uninterested crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone could blame them. There were few rousing moments
in a rivalry that exists in only the faint memory of Jordan and the
vintage Nikes he wore in his last game at the Garden a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bulls,'' Houston said. ``They might not have had the
best record in the league, but we had to go out there and play
hard. We still had to finish the game out strong.'' &QL;

BAFFERT HORSES LEADING THE CHARGE TO THE DERBY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Two months or so before the race of their
lives, the Kentucky Derby candidates in this year's confusing class
of 3-year-olds are still waiting for someone to play the role of
leader.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the class is entirely short of good
horses, but they seem to be running mostly in California and
especially for the barn of Bob Baffert, who has won the last two
Kentucky derbies with Silver Charm and Real Quiet. Now, Baffert is
shooting for a threepeat. And he has about half a dozen horses
leading the charge, most notably the colt Exploit, undefeated in
five starts and the early favorite for the Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit will probably not run again until March 13 in the San
Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita, which will be the same day that
leading contenders in the East try to pass their next milestone:
the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. And by then, they will be
turning into the homestretch on the road to the Kentucky Derby,
struggling to keep contending in prep races like the Santa Anita
Derby, the Blue Grass Stakes, the Wood Memorial and the Arkansas
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The usual mystery surrounding young 3-year-old horses is
compounded this year by the added mystery of quality: How good is
this bunch? Nobody knows for sure, but there are no signs that a
potential star is waiting alongside the road to ambush Exploit. And
no new clues were provided at Gulfstream Park last Saturday when
Vicar won the Fountain of Youth Stakes by a neck over Cat Thief,
with Certain three-quarters of a length back in third.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll all get better,'' predicted Carl Nafzger, who trained
Unbridled to his victory in the 1990 Kentucky Derby and now trains
Vicar. ``The more they run, you'll see these horses shaking into
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Another element complicating the picture: Only three fillies
have won the Kentucky Derby in 125 years _ Regret in 1915, Genuine
Risk in 1980 and Winning Colors in 1988. But this year it appears
that three fillies have reasonable shots at testing colts in the
Triple Crown if their trainers and owners decide to defy the odds.
They are Silverbulletday, last year's juvenile filly champion, and
her stablemate, Excellent Meeting; and the Juddmonte's Farm's
Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is also confused by the cycles and slumps that
affect young horses. Nick Zito, who won the Kentucky Derby twice in
this decade with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin in 1994,
had reason to believe that he had two Derby prospects this year:
Doneraile Court, a speed horse, and The Groom Is Red, a closer. But
in the Fountain of Youth, both struck out. The Groom Is Red ran
seventh; Doneraile, 10th and last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel I've blown a whole month,'' Zito lamented this
morning. ``The Groom Is Red didn't have that stretch kick he
usually has. And it's back to the drawing board with Doneraile
Court. I don't know what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Answer Lively about life on the ``road.'' Last year, Bobby
Barnett's colt won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the juvenile
championship, and became the favorite for the Kentucky Derby. But
no horse in 20 years has progressed from juvenile champion at 2 to
Derby winner at 3. And, sure enough, in his first start this year,
Answer Lively finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He came closer Sunday when he ran second as the 3-5 favorite in
the Risen Star at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. He made a mighty
rush down the homestretch but lost in a photo finish to Elliott
Walden's Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some redemption for a falling champion, perhaps. But, like other
Kentucky Derby candidates, he was still a question waiting for an
answer.

ALBANIANS `NAY' PUTS MILOSEVIC IN ROLE OF YEA-SAYER
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-TALKS, U.S.-SERBIA-TRADE) 
(ms) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanians took the
pressure off Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by failing to
agree to terms at talks outside Paris, Serbian officials and
analysts said Sunday, allowing Milosevic to create at least
temporary divisions within the West.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic remains prepared to make a deal, these officials and
analysts said, but he will want, in return, to ease his country's
economic and diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Western diplomats here said that the inability of Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright to get the ethnic Albanian
delegation to agree to the detailed plan on offer made it
impossible to end the talks and go ahead with NATO's threatened air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Serbian delegation's willingness to sign
on to the political arrangements for Kosovo, while objecting to the
presence of NATO troops to implement the deal, enabled the Italians
and the Russians, two of the six nations in the contact group that
organized the talks, to argue that the Serbs were moving toward a
deal and could not be punished now, the officials and diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other nations in the contact group, which has backed the
plan being presented at the talks in France, are the United States,
Great Britain, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians have put a foot wrong and made the work of the
contact group harder,'' said a Western diplomat here. ``There's a
long way to go, but it would be a mistake for Milosevic to feel too
cocky about a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline in Sunday's issue of the Belgrade newspaper
Politika, a government-controlled daily, read: ``Contact Group in
Disarray.'' Milos Vasic, a military expert with the independent
weekly magazine Vreme, suggested ironically, ``Sometimes I think
the Serbs and the Albanians make pretty good partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are balking at the military aspect of the plan on
offer. The Europeans in the contact group are considering a variety
of incentives to offer Milosevic, but have not yet seriously
discussed these with the Serbs, the officials and diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives range from lifting certain sanctions against the
former Yugoslavia imposed last summer over Kosovo to Yugoslavia's
membership in international organizations like the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe or even NATO's Partnership for
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions include a spottily implemented ban on flights by
the Yugoslav national airline, JAT, to the United States and
European Union countries, a ban on private investment in Serbia and
a ban on European trade preferences for Serbian goods, important
for an economy that is in terrible shape.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Americans are concentrating on getting the ethnic
Albanians to line up and mending the unity of the contact group,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is still open,'' said Bratislav Grubacic, a
well-informed Serbian journalist. ``I think Milosevic will accept
the deal that comes out, but for now he's managed to divide the
contact group.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is attempting to dilute the NATO role in any military
implementation force and have foreign troops in Kosovo under the
auspices of the United Nations or Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Some here suggest that he is personally
worried that NATO troops so close to Belgrade might come to arrest
him if he is secretly indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Grubacic regards Milosevic efforts as purely tactical,
designed to divide the contact group. ``For ordinary Serbs, it
makes no difference if the foreign troops in Kosovo are under NATO
or the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vasic, the Vreme analyst, said that Milosevic's distinction
between NATO and a body like the OSCE is mere face-saving. ``He
wants to appear in public as a fighter, as someone who can make the
great powers deliberate,'' he said. ``Nothing has actually changed.
It's still the same old boring question, as in Dayton, of how
Milosevic will save his face and agree.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Dayton agreements ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   One possible indication of Milosevic's openness to an agreement
was the almost complete absence of comment in the official media
from the Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj, a virulent
nationalist who is now a member of the Milosevic government. Seselj
would ordinarily be publicly fulminating against any sort of
foreign armed presence in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the views of a fellow government member, former
democracy activist Vuk Draskovic, are being emphasized. Draskovic
has been much more conciliatory toward the idea of Western help in
solving the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo itself, violence continues even as talks proceed.
Serbian and ethnic Albanian sources in the province's capital,
Pristina, told The Associated Press Sunday that two police patrols
came under fire, and the bodies of four ethnic Albanians _ two of
them loyal to the Serbian government _ were found.

YANKEES REDIRECT WILLIAMS' ENTHUSIASM TO WORK OUT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Having agreed to pay Bernie Williams $87.5
million, the Yankees Sunday kicked Williams out of their training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of days, anyway. Williams, the highest-paid player
in Yankee history, appeared at Legends Field for the first time
this year, took batting practice and shagged fly balls in center.
This was done contrary to baseball rules, however, and after the
workout, General Manager Brian Cashman reminded Manager Joe Torre
that position players are not allowed to work out in camp until
Tuesday; Williams must train with other position players at the
minor league complex about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But Cashman and Torre appreciated the thought in Williams' first
spring training since signing a seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the contract in my next seven years, I have peace of
mind,'' Williams said. ``What you think of yourself as a player,
though, you should never feel comfortable being in one place,
because if you feel comfortable in one place, you start getting
complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the Yankees' recent trade of David Wells, who
pitched a perfect game and won 18 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened a few days ago, that's the biggest example of
what I'm talking about,'' Williams said. ``You can have a great
year and still be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembered how he considered whether to stay with the
Yankees or sign elsewhere. The Boston Red Sox offered him a $91.5
million contract; the Arizona Diamondbacks offered $100 million.
After the season, ``it took me three days to pack when I went to
the stadium because I kept forgetting things,'' Williams said.
``Every time I went back, I went to the field and took a long
glance at the stadium. I had all these emotions about when I was
there playing. Even though nobody saw me, it was very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be back,'' he said. ``I was trying to kid myself
into thinking otherwise, that it could be better some other place.
Rather than start from scratch someplace else, it's good to know
that I'm back here where I know the system, know the coaches, know
the organization. I don't have to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was asked how Yankee fans would react to him now that
he had signed a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's in direct proportion to my play,'' he said.
``If I keep playing well, they'll love me. If I go bad, they'll run
me out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams arrived with a spot of whiskers in the middle of his
chin, just below his lip. Before he took the field, Williams leaned
over a laundry bin and wiped off the facial hair, per George
Steinbrenner's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody pointed out the hair in the bin next to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of my soul patch,'' said Williams, ``which was
deleted.'' &QL;

`ALL NEW' IS AN OLD TRICK ON CABLE  
 BRITISH GQ EDITOR FIRED  
 NEW YORK DAILY NEWS EXPANDS SUNDAY EDITION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most television viewers probably thought the last ``all-new
episode'' of the series ``Murder She Wrote'' was broadcast on CBS
three years ago, when the series stopped production.
</P>
<P>
   But on the A&AMP;E channel last week, in the break just before 10
p.m., there was a breathless announcer promising: ``Coming up next:
an all-new episode of `Murder She Wrote.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time that cable channel had made such a
misleading promise. On another night last week, just before 11
p.m., the same announcer urged viewers to stay tuned for ``an
all-new episode of `Law and Order.' '' That may have surprised the
folks at NBC, who are under the impression that they own the rights
to all the new episodes of that crime drama.
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``all-new'' episodes of ``Law and Order'' on the
A&AMP;E network; all of the episodes on that channel previously have
run on NBC. Nor has Angela Lansbury made a comeback as Jessica
Fletcher to solve new crimes on A&AMP;E. All the episodes of ``Murder
She Wrote'' that now appear on A&AMP;E were previously seen on CBS, and
also on the USA Network, which ran each episode dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, A&AMP;E gets away with branding episodes of series that
have appeared multiple times on other channels ``all new,'' a term
that has become familiar to viewers of network television as a
signal that the episode so described is an original and not a
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably the same relaxed standard that lets cable
channels apparently get away with having old episodes of network
series listed in TV Guide and other services without the big R
enclosed in parenthesis, signifying repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mohamad, the vice president of marketing for A&AMP;E, said:
``I didn't see that promotional spot. I think somebody was taking a
little license there.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that A&AMP;E was merely trying to signal to its audience
that these episodes were new to A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that a better description would be: ``Coming up next,
an episode of `Law and Order' new to A&AMP;E.'' But he argued, ``People
who watch A&AMP;E recognize they are not watching a first run, people
are not being fooled by this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   British GQ's Editor Fired
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Many readers apparently failed to get the joke last
week when the British edition of GQ magazine included ``the Nazis''
in a list of the 200 most stylish men of the 20th century. The
list, which appears in the March issue and also includes Che
Guevara, Batman, Dracula and John F. Kennedy, was illustrated with
photographs of some of those named, including one of German Field
Marshal Erwin Rommel in his Nazi cap.
</P>
<P>
   At first, GQ's owner, Conde Nast, said that the article was a
``humorous piece and not to be taken too seriously.'' But in the
face of criticism from Jewish groups and advertisers, it changed
its mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the company fired the magazine's editor, James
Brown, saying that ``philosophical differences have arisen between
James and Conde Nast over some aspects of the magazine's content.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were pouring in from groups like the Anti-Nazi League
and the Holocaust Education Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of this general alongside some of the world's most
gifted actors, musicians and designers makes decent people want to
vomit,'' Lord Jenner of the Holocaust Education Trust told the
Observer of London.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers were none too thrilled, either. ``If this level
of taste continues, we will reconsider advertising in GQ,''
Hamilton South, president and chief marketing officer of Polo Ralph
Lauren, one of GQ's biggest advertisers, told the Observer.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the Nazi incident was the last straw in what has
been an increasingly rocky relationship between the 33-year-old
Brown and his bosses at Conde Nast. Brown vaulted to prominence in
the London magazine world a few years ago, when he created Loaded
magazine as a celebration of what Britons call ``laddism'' _ a kind
of hard-drinking, babe-watching, childish ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's downmarket ideas did not go over so well at GQ, which
does, after all, have the word ``Gentleman'' in its title. The
March issue included, among other things, a picture of a naked
woman, trussed up and apparently stabbed, lying in a blood-filled
bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brown said he had enjoyed his 18 months at GQ and
that he was ``looking forward to my next challenge.''

   Sunday News Gets Bigger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under the editorial watch of Edward Kosner, a former
editor of Newsweek, New York and Esquire magazines, The Daily News
will introduce not just one, but several new Sunday magazine
sections on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, who was appointed to the post of Sunday editor in
November, said the new sections would present ``lots and lots'' of
service information, as well as entertainment and cultural
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The sections will be separate from the main newspaper but will
be printed on standard newsprint, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition to The Sunday Daily News will be a new opinion
section, to appear in the main body of the newspaper, that will be
edited by Michael Kramer, a former Time magazine political
columnist and a former editor of Brill's Content.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said that his section was a work in progress, but that he
was aiming for ``as eclectic a mix as possible, with a lot of short
stuff as well as traditional, column-length pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   He said opinion, now confined to one page on Sunday, will be
spread over as many as six pages.
</P>
<P>
   The News is the sixth-largest Sunday newspaper in the country,
but circulation has dropped in recent years. For the six-month
period that ended in September 1998, Sunday circulation had slipped
to 810,295 from 979,030 for the period in 1995, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday edition carries a third of the newspaper's
advertising, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner, has said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the editorial structure at The Daily News, Kosner reports
to Harold M. Evans, editorial director, not to Debby Krenek, the
editor in chief of The News. Evans said that if anyone knew enough
to talk about the Sunday magazine sections, it would be Kosner.
``I'm just in the back shoveling coal here,'' Evans said.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: IMPATIENT OWNERS SHAKING UP NFL'S STATUS QUO
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happened in Chicago earlier this month has turned the
National Football League on its ear _ Michael McCaskey dumped by
his own mother. For the past 15 years, McCaskey had been the
Chicago Bears chief executive officer and president. Enough, said
his mother, Virginia Halas McCaskey, daughter of George Halas.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive 4-12 seasons, the bungling of deals for a new
stadium and the fumbling of the hiring of a new coach, mom gave son
the boot.
</P>
<P>
   Blood may be thicker than water and it may sound like a nice
idea to keep dirty linen in the family, but, really, this is an
extreme and rare case of interior images finally _ and exactly _
mirroring exterior images.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, whenever McCaskey's name was
mentioned at Soldier Field during Bears games, fans would boo
nastily. He became the focus of the ire of Bears fans, of Chicago
politicians and of people inside his organization, too. His teams
were mediocre and so was his defense of the mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Among his peers across the league, few took him seriously. He
was rarely sought out by the commissioner's office as a man of
impact or insight, or as a man of vision. And then it came to a
head when the Bears announced last month that they had hired a head
coach who, in fact, had not yet been hired.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis, the Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator, was
said by the Bears to be their new coach even though a contract had
not been negotiated. McGinnis balked. McCaskey's mother and others
tried reeling him in, but McGinnis refused. Dick Jauron, the
Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coordinator, was then hired by
McCaskey. And soon after, mother replaced son with Ted Phillips,
the Bears' former chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, coaches and players across the NFL have looked at
these series of events and marveled.
</P>
<P>
   There is more. Marty Schottenheimer, a fixture as head coach of
the Kansas City Chiefs, quit under criticism that his teams were
underachieving in the post-season and, as a last straw, that he
could no longer discipline his players.
</P>
<P>
   And another wave of veteran players who have helped define their
teams, such as safety Steve Atwater of Denver and Warren Moon of
Seattle, have been tossed aside by their clubs. Change sweeps. Heat
rises.
</P>
<P>
   The early success of expansion teams Jacksonville and Carolina
changed the expectations for quick success. The dramatic turnaround
by the Jets last season accelerated the notion. Why them? Why not
us? The desire to win and win now in the NFL and the pressure from
it is boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Heads are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played for teams where we teased the fans and we teased
ourselves,'' said cornerback Ryan McNeil, who spent four years with
Detroit and the last two with the Rams. He is a free agent now,
shopping for success. Looking for a dramatic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   He asks, why not me?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on teams that were so close yet so far away,''
McNeil said. ``Those kinds of teams continually let close games
slip away. In Detroit, it was always then about Wayne Fontes and
his job security and how that day-to-day situation took away from
the focus of the club. We were 9-7 and 10-6 and 9-7 again and then
fell to 5-11 in '96. We played three playoff games while I was
there and lost all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come to Detroit from the University of Miami where we
had won two national championships and lost only five games in my
five years there,'' McNeil said. ``At Miami, the practices were
harder than the games. It wasn't like that in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil became a St. Louis Ram in 1997 and suffered through a
5-11 season but led the league in interceptions with nine. Last
season, it was worse, a 4-12 year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk by the players that training camp was too
physical and guys were missing meetings and missing planes,''
McNeil said. ``It was incomprehensible to me that considering the
amount of talent we had that we did not win more. I thought we had
more talent the second year than we did the first. Losing makes
everything taste bad. Your bumps and bruises hurt more. Winning is
the cure. That's the ultimate goal of any professional athlete, to
be fairly compensated and to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is an elusive achievement for several NFL clubs and it is
elusive for a batch of players, prime-time ones and unheralded ones
alike. Stars such as Barry Sanders of Detroit, Marshall Faulk of
Indianapolis and Derrick Thomas of Kansas City have never even
sniffed a Super Bowl. Yet, offensive lineman Dan Neil of Denver has
played two pro seasons and won two Super Bowl rings. For McNeil,
the pain was greater this year because the Super Bowl was held in
Miami and he lives in downtown Miami. He saw the sights, the
sounds, the aroma of the game. So close and yet so far away.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, 28, awaits his seventh pro season. Where will he land?
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the league running a 4.39 and I can run a low 4.5
in the 40 now,'' he said. ``I'm a more analytical player and more a
student of the game. I'm 6-2, 198, so I can play some of the bigger
receivers in the game and I've had success there. I'm durable. I
played left corner my first four years and right corner my last
two. I want to be the missing piece instead of being one of many
pieces in a puzzle missing. I was born to succeed and I was raised
in a manner that I can only succeed. It's time. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL ownership has a similar idea. &QL;

PAIN RELIEF IMPROVES MIDDLE RELIEF FOR THE YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Once the Yankees completed their 125-victory
season with a World Series sweep last fall, forgotten was the fact
that the team did possess weaknesses in the long year. Through most
of July and August, Manager Joe Torre fretted about what the
condition of his middle relief might be in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson and Darren Holmes were out with back trouble, and
Mike Stanton, Torre's primary left-hander, was giving up homers at
a staggering rate of one every five innings. But they rebounded and
performed effectively in the last two months of the season, and
with Nelson and Stanton back this year and Holmes believing he has
made a necessary adjustment to his pitching mechanics, the Yankees'
bullpen could be as deep and strong as the rest of the team appears
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, placed on the disabled list in June with a bulging disk
in his back, seemed headed for surgery in August after a setback in
his rehabilitation. But he got the name of George Steinbrenner's
chiropractor, and ``after that, I really didn't have any more
pain,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stiffness in the morning, but there is always going to
be that with a disk thing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson recovered to pitch well in September and in the
post-season, with a good fastball, and in the off season he
maintained a routine with chiropractors, having his spine adjusted
once a month. During the season, Nelson intends to get an
adjustment once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes had a back injury similar to Nelson's, and he went out of
action in July, with a 4.05 earned run average and a long string of
inconsistent performances.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes felt completely out of sync in his delivery, and it
showed in his results: every time Torre used him in a tight
situation, it seemed, he was hit. When Holmes returned to his North
Carolina home to rest his back, he picked through some old
videotapes of when he was throwing effectively for the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   What Holmes saw on the tape struck him immediately. In the past,
he had started his delivery with his hands held behind his head,
the ball virtually hidden behind his ear. Over time, however, his
hands had dropped to the point that they were almost chest high. He
and Billy Connors, the Yankees' pitching coordinator last season,
re-established the position of his hands during a 10-day
rehabilitation stint here, and Holmes felt much better, with more
of a rhythm. His fastball popped, and his slider _ nonexistent in
the first three months of the season _ had great movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, had been trying to
get Holmes working from a windup in the first few months of the
season, rather than from the stretch, as Holmes was accustomed.
That was all scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes went back to pitching as he had for the Rockies, and in
the final month of the season, he allowed just one run in eight and
a third innings and was one of the Yankees' better pitchers. ``I
can't argue with the fact that the changes must've helped,''
Stottlemyre said, ``because he was much better after he came
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton is mostly puzzled by his inconsistency last season, by
the inordinate number of home runs that he allowed. He had his
usual trouble maintaining his pitching mechanics, which was nothing
new _ Stanton sometimes rushes his motion and falls to the side as
he throws, rather than driving directly at home plate, and this
reduces his control and the effectiveness of his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Stanton had a solid season. Opponents batted
just .239 against him, and he allowed only 26 walks in 79 innings.
Only 23 percent of the runners he inherited scored, better than the
major league average of 33 percent. But there were all those home
runs _ 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they were on really good pitches,'' Stanton said,
standing to demonstrate one home run he allowed to Shawon Dunston.
``Remember where the ball was?''
</P>
<P>
   He flashed a hand low, mimicking the movement of catcher Joe
Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way down and in,'' Stanton said. ``I couldn't believe it. You
know, I really believe this _ a lot of that was really just a
streak of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was throwing the ball that badly. If you look
at my stats and take away the home runs and my earned run average,
I had a pretty good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton is the Yankees' only left-handed reliever, but the
bullpen remains deep, with the closer Mariano Rivera and the long
reliever Ramiro Mendoza as well as Nelson, Holmes and Stanton. The
depth and effectiveness of the starting pitching, which eliminated
much of the usual pressure on the bullpen _ Yankees relievers threw
395 and one-third innings in 1998, the fewest in the American
League _ should help as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel like this should be a pretty strong group,''
Stottlemyre said. &QL;

U.S. URGES RUSSIA TO HELP AVOID FALSE NUCLEAR ALERTS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The United States has urged Russia to set up a joint
missile-warning center before the end of the year to reduce the
risk that the year 2000 computer problem might trigger a false
nuclear alert.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was made in talks last week between U.S. and
Russian defense officials, a senior Pentagon official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a broader effort to prevent the millennium bug
from disrupting Russian systems used to warn of enemy attack and to
maintain control over the nation's vast nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians responded with interest,'' the official, Edward
Warner, an assistant secretary of defense, said in an interview.
``We just informed them within the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As the year 2000 approaches, experts around the world have been
concerned about computer breakdowns that might occur if software
misinterprets the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has received substantially less attention in Russia
than in the West. It remains a worry for military specialists,
however, who fear that computer problems might disrupt radar and
command systems on which the Russians depend to retaliate against a
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say the danger of an accidental nuclear war
is minimal, even if the millennium bug is not fully eradicated. A
sober-minded military leadership and a general awareness of the
year 2000 problem, they say, should be sufficient to prevent the
Russians from inadvertently firing their nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression that either side has a fully computerized
system is false,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon does not want to take any chances. Even
before the year 2000 problem arose, experts had been concerned that
miscalculation might lead the two sides to stumble into a nuclear
war. In 1995, for example, the Russian military initially
misinterpreted the launching of a Norwegian scientific rocket as a
possible submarine missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Russia's network of early-warning radars and
satellites has decayed, adding to U.S. concerns. The Russian radar
station at Skrunde, Latvia, has been closed, for example, now that
Latvia is an independent country. That leaves a gap in the
military's radar coverage in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian decision to abandon its radar at Krasnoyarsk,
Siberia, has also left the nation with a gap in the northeastern
part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Begun during Soviet times, the construction of that radar system
violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which stipulated
that such systems be located on the periphery of each side's
territory. Following years of pressure from the Reagan
administration, which was primarily worried about the Soviet
military threat, the radar was dismantled during the waning years
of the Soviet Union at the insistence of the United States, which
was primarily worried about the Soviet military threat.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal that Pentagon officials presented last week is
actually a variant of a plan on which the two sides agreed when
President Clinton met with President Boris Yeltsin in September,
but it has yet to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   During their summit meeting, they signed an accord under which
the United States and Russia would instantly share data about the
launching of ballistic missiles and space payloads.
</P>
<P>
   It was a major step toward cooperation between the former
adversaries, which would have been unthinkable during the Cold War.
But the very easing of tensions that made the agreement possible
also seemed to detract from the urgency of carrying it out _ at
least, for the Russians, who have been preoccupied with political
and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon still hopes to carry out the September accord. But
fearful that the agreement may not be carried out before January
2000, it is now urging that it be put into effect on a temporary
basis, if necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to build a temporary bridge across the year
2000,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it would work. A joint missile-warning center would
be established, probably in the vicinity of Moscow. It would be
staffed with both U.S. and Russian officers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would transmit data about missile launches
from its satellite and land-based radars to that center and also
separately to the Russian military's command center.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. data, in effect, would help the Russians plug the gaps
in their early-warning system and help prevent them from
misidentifying a launch. The U.S. officers would help sort out any
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only step under discussion. Pentagon officials
plan to return in about a month and discuss technical issues about
how the year 2000 problem can be diagnosed and fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has been reluctant to allow
outsiders, including Russians who do not work for the agency, to
inspect its computers. But U.S. officials may be able to provide
some useful advice without inspecting the Russian systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry has publicly said that it has the
situation under control. Other Russian officials have not been so
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to admit that not all agencies have achieved positive
results,'' Alexander Krupnov, chairman of the State Communications
Committee, said last month. ``Such structures as the Defense
Ministry have significant difficulties as regards all types of
missiles.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A study to be issued Monday by the government's own auditors is
highly critical of a key part of the Clinton administration's
effort to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons by helping to employ scientists from the former Soviet
Union on peaceful projects.
</P>
<P>
   The study of two Energy Department programs by the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concludes that
U.S. aid may have instead supported scientists still working in
Russia on projects related to weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those scientists or their institutes, the report says,
may also have provided expertise not only to the weapons programs
in Russia but also to those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The programs have been aimed at keeping poorly paid Russian
biological, chemical and nuclear scientists working on peaceful
civilian projects and at preventing them from being lured away to
work for foreign governments or terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two programs has enormous overhead and is poorly
supervised, the report concludes. It also says that the program
subsidizes the United States' own national laboratories more than
the Russian scientists it is ostensibly intended to help.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first in-depth review of the Energy
Department's efforts to reduce the risk posed by unemployed weapons
scientists by helping them work in commercially viable ventures. It
is due to be distributed Monday, but a draft was made available in
advance to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   While the report says the Energy Department's effort appears to
have helped keep thousands of former Soviet weapons scientists at
some 170 institutes at home, not one of some 79
Washington-supported projects reviewed in the report is yet a
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   The report urges the Energy Department not only to make
significant changes in one of its programs, but also to delay plans
to expand an ambitious newer venture to employ thousands of
scientists and technicians within Russia's 10 once-closed nuclear
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The department responded by saying it had already adopted many
changes recommended in the report. But a senior official strongly
disagreed with the study's conclusion that the projects might have
strengthened Russia's military capabilities, and insisted that
agency funds ``do not pay scientists to perform weapons work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is good for national security,'' said Leonard
Spector, the official who oversees these and other programs to halt
the spread of weapons, on which the department spends almost $500
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the two programs, the so-called Nuclear Cities
Initiative, is a centerpiece of the U.S. effort to create peaceful
employment opportunities for the thousands of impoverished Russians
in research institutes and atomic plants in their country's nuclear
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors warn that the program could cost up to $600
million over the next five years. Rather than help Russian nuclear
scientists convert their work into profitable ventures, the
initiative threatens to become ``a subsidy program for Russia for
many years,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Foreign Relations
Committee, said after reading the study, which he had requested,
that failure to adopt the sweeping reforms recommended would ``not
only jeopardize continued support'' for the programs, but ``cast
doubt on the wisdom of the administration's desire to plow $4.5
billion into expanded nonproliferation programs in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's programs are only part of a wide-ranging
effort by the Clinton administration on nonproliferation, the term
that diplomats and the military use to refer to efforts to stop the
spread of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the programs are run by the Pentagon and some by the
State Department. For each of the two Energy Department programs,
the administration is asking for $30 million this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   As of last December, the Energy Department's initial program had
spent more than $63 million supporting more than 400 projects in
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, 80 percent of them in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report is the first independent
review of the Energy Department's 5-year-old effort, known as the
Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, and was based on a
three-week visit last fall by a team of government auditors to 15
defense institutes in Russia and an investigation of 79 projects.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's key findings are:
</P>
<P>
   _ About $39.8 million, or 63 percent, of the program's money
that was supposed to support former Soviet weapons scientists, was
actually spent in the United States, mostly by the Energy
Department's 10 national laboratories in charge of administering
the projects. Only 37 percent of the money reached the designated
scientific institutes in Russia and other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   _ The amount of money that reached scientists at Russian
institutes is unknown, ``because the institutes' overhead charges,
taxes and other fees reduced the amount of money available to pay
scientists.'' Russia, in other words, taxes U.S. foreign aid. For
instance, the report notes, officials at the State Research Center
of Virology and Biotechnology told the investigators that about 40
percent of scientists' salaries were taken out in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is ``some evidence'' that scientists ``currently working
on Russia's weapons of mass destruction program are receiving
program funds'' or are still working on military-related or other
potentially dangerous projects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight of the nuclear-related projects approved from 1994 to
1996 could ``unintentionally'' provide useful military-related
benefits to scientists in Russia and other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the auditors say, some Russian institutes that
received U.S. money and the scientists who worked there had never
done weapons-related germ or chemical research. In addition, they
say, the Energy Department lacks detailed records about who
receives how much U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said there was no evidence in the files of some 19
projects involving germ and chemical institutes that the State and
Defense departments had carried out required reviews of joint
projects to assess their potential impact on national security.
Only ``cursory reviews'' were done to ensure that the projects
would not harm U.S. national security, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   Spector of the Energy Department strongly challenged that
finding, saying the department had taken ``the greatest of care''
in reviewing biological or chemical projects.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the report concludes, while the program has helped
institutes that might otherwise have been forced to close, there is
``some evidence'' that at least four institutes had ``contacts with
countries of proliferation concern,'' including Iran, Libya,
Pakistan, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   While the institutes told auditors that the sales and training
provided to those countries were harmless, the report urges greater
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the auditors have urged the energy secretary to
review the programs to ensure, among other things, that his
department got ``more accurate data'' on the number and background
of key scientists supported by the program.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for the program intended to help scientists at Russia's
formerly closed nuclear cities, the auditors have urged the
department not to expand the program from three to 10 cities over
the next five years, as the Clinton administration intends, until
the projects are likely to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet weapons scientists echoed many of the auditors'
criticisms in interviews in Russia and Kazakhstan last fall. They
complained that much of the U.S. aid intended for them was siphoned
off not only by the U.S. national labs, but in taxes and overhead
charges by their own institute administrators, many of whom are
still connected to Russia's security services and opposed to
cooperation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been the case in the administration's other
programs, whose supervisors have learned from mistakes made early
on by the Energy Department, the scientists and Clinton
administration officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance from a multilateral program run by the State
Department is not taxed by Russia and is deposited directly into
individual bank accounts of the scientists working on joint
projects with their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Friday, Helms said it was ``totally
unacceptable'' for Russia to tax U.S. foreign aid. He vowed to
follow up what he called the ``deeply disturbing'' charges in the
report about the Energy Department programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely unacceptable for the Clinton administration
to donate the U.S. taxpayer's money to Russian scientists who spend
their time working on poison gas, biological agents and the new
nuclear-weapons designs for the Russian government,'' Helms said.

GOVERNORS SCOLD CLINTON, CONGRESS TO PUT PARTISANSHIP ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Del., Idaho, Ill., Maine, Minn., Okla., Texas,
Utah)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the bluntest possible terms, governors of both
parties meeting here over the weekend told President Clinton and
Congress to abandon the poisonous partisanship of the impeachment
proceedings and get back to work on education and other issues of
immediate concern to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of arriving in Washington for their winter meeting,
the governors tried to elevate the political debate from the depths
to which they said it had sunk. And Republican governors were just
as forceful as Democrats in deploring Congress' single-minded focus
on the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the governors present themselves as modern managers, and
this year 13 new governors injected new energy into the National
Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   George H. Ryan, the Republican who took office last month as
governor of Illinois, spoke for many of the states' chief
executives when he said: ``It's time for all this political
rhetoric to be put to bed. The American public has had enough of
political posturing. People want results.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the scandal that engulfed President Clinton for the
last 13 months, Ryan said: ``People who get up and go to work every
morning, drive to work and carry their lunch are ready to put this
whole issue behind them. It's done and over with. People are
concerned about health care, education and transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors will continue their meeting this week as Congress
reconvenes, primed to debate Social Security, tax cuts, patients'
rights and federal aid to education. Clinton will meet on Tuesday
at the White House with congressional leaders, but neither side
expects more than a shaky image of bipartisan cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as millions of Americans criticize Congress as obsessed
with impeachment, governors routinely rate among the most popular
politicians in the country. Republican governors emphasized
repeatedly during the impeachment process that the strength of the
party was not in Washington, but in state capitols.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by many of the Republican governors also highlight
the deep divisions in the party over its direction. Some Republican
leaders, including several governors, are concerned that the party
will be defined by impeachment and that Democrats will use the
issue to make electoral gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the most conservative wing of the Republican Party, to which
some members of Congress and some presidential hopefuls remain
attentive, wants the Clinton scandal to remain alive.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic governors are repeating the White House strategy of
wanting to be seen as focusing on substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a Republican re-elected in
November by a landslide, complained: ``The obsession of the last
year has been to embarrass the president. We need to get off that.
It's impossible to embarrass this president. He's beyond shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the leaders of either party use the impeachment issue for
political purposes in coming months, they need to have their heads
examined. The American people are sick of it. It's over. Goodbye.
People want to know what we are doing to improve the quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the governors' association, Thomas R. Carper of
Delaware, a Democrat, said, ``The American people hunger for a
sense of civility and consensus building,'' and for an end to
``this enmity, this bitterness and rancor that have characterized
so much of what's happened in this city in the last several
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two governors outshone their peers. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
won support from many Republican governors _ conservatives and
moderates alike _ who said he would make an excellent candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   But at times he was upstaged by Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota,
the Reform Party candidate who won an upset victory in November.
Ventura arrived wearing a buckskin jacket on Saturday, but Sunday
he wore a more traditional governor's uniform, a blue business
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Republican
Governors' Association, said: ``Jesse brings a fresh perspective,
the eyes and ears of the ordinary citizen. If Republicans and
Democrats don't address the concerns of the ordinary citizen, there
will be a lot more independent candidates like Jesse Ventura.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's only other independent governor, Angus S. King Jr.
of Maine, said Ventura's election should send a signal to party
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a Republican answer,'' King said. ``There isn't a
Democratic answer. People want us to fill the potholes, make
schools work and get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican who is vice
chairman of the association, said, ``Governors operate in a far
less partisan atmosphere'' than federal officials. ``To the extent
we are able to rub off a little on the congressional leadership,
hopefully that will be productive,'' Leavitt said.

</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the productivity of the 106th Congress vary.
One theory holds that it will be difficult for lawmakers to
overcome the distrust bred by the searing ordeal of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are already calibrating their moves to
maximize their gains in next year's elections, with some Democrats
hoping to recapture the House by depriving Republicans of any
significant legislative accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But some see a real potential for agreement. Congressional
Republicans, according to this theory, want to show they can do
more than impeach a president, while Clinton wants to lock down a
legacy of achievement that includes the long-term solvency of
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Recent comments by the new speaker, Dennis Hastert, suggest that
he may be more open to compromises than his predecessor, Newt
Gingrich, but it is unclear whether he can deliver the votes for
such compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' agenda underscored the differences between their
priorities and those of Congress. On Saturday afternoon, after
expressing scorn for Congress' preoccupation with Clinton's
extramarital affair, the governors held a seminar on information
technology, with executives from Microsoft, TRW and IBM Corp.
Governors learned how they could use Internet technology to
revolutionize the operations of state government, to improve
services to citizens and to foster economic development.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m. Sunday, the governors began a two-hour session with
professor Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School, who
declared that ``states are the core economic unit'' in America
today. He said each governor must devise a strategy to transform
``a critical mass of companies in the same field'' _ wineries, oil
and gas, biotechnology, for example _ into a powerhouse that could

A MALL'S OPPONENTS DON'T GIVE UP EASILY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST NYACK, N.Y. _ When the Palisades Center mall opened here in
March, the developers might have thought their long battle with
opponents in the community was finally over. They would have been
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 300,000 shoppers pass through the glistening mall
doors each week. They pick up lumber at Home Depot and pressed
linen suits at Ann Taylor, kitchen elegance at Williams Sonoma and
bargains at Target.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of Rockland County residents who opposed this
mall-cum-city since it was first proposed in 1985 are not to be
found among the crowds. They still are shocked that the mall, all
four stories and three million square feet of it, was not only
built but has apparently triumphed, while they are still scarred
and paying legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have devoted a quarter of their lives to
fighting this mall,'' said Linda Rauer, a former shopkeeper and
inveterate environmentalist who became involved in opposing the
mall in the early 1990s when she found out that it was being built
on top of two landfills about 20 miles northwest of Manhattan.
``They are not going to just give up, walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents, some of whom still hope to close the mall down,
are now focused on insuring that a proposed expansion of the
Palisades Center is voted upon in a public referendum, as promised.
The expansion, which would permit the use of 1.15 million square
feet of unoccupied space at the center, would make it the second
largest mall in America.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rosie O'Donnell, who lives in Nyack, went on her morning
talk show last month and joked about rumors that the mall in her
town was sinking and would soon close, it only made the acrimony
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rauer and the loyal members of the Rockland Civic
Association, a grass-roots organization that was formed to stop the
mall, were incensed. Their last hope for closing the mall _ the
possibility that cracks in the concrete floor and a distinct shimmy
in the structure meant it was unsafe _ was being turned into a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a public safety issue,'' Ms. Rauer said. ``We
want a structural engineer to come in and measure whether the mall
is settling. We want a seismic engineer to find out why that
building shakes. The mall is built on two former, unregulated
landfills,'' she said, adding that she fears that despite a system
designed to collect them, contaminants could percolate through the
soil and end up in the drinking supply.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Valenti, a developer of the Palisades Center, concedes
that the underground parking lot at the mall has settled, that
cracks run helter-skelter across the bare concrete floors and that
the building's shake is disconcerting. None of it, however means
the mall is dangerous, Valenti said. He noted that the mall has
been inspected by engineers and backed by bonds that put the
Pyramid Companies, the nation's largest mall developer behind the
$390 million project.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are never satisfied with anything you do,''
Valenti said. ``You clean up landfills and that's not good enough.
You solve the traffic problems, stop the roads from flooding and
that's not good enough. No matter what solution you provide, it's
never going to be good enough for them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Palisades Center was built by the Pyramid Companies of
Syracuse, and their reputation for aggressiveness preceded them
when they came to Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The company was investigated by the New York Commission on
government Integrity for spending $776,967 to influence the 1985
election of the Poughkeepsie Town Council to elect members who
favored the construction of the Poughkeepsie Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Karl S. Coplan, co-director of the Pace Environmental Law Clinic
in White Plains, brought five suits against Pyramid. Copland, who
lives in West Nyack and in good weather kayaks across the Hudson
River and then bicycles to work, became involved in 1996 when
Pyramid announced its plan to expand from 1.85 million square feet
to more than 3 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The developer prevailed in all five of Coplan's suits.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow to the opponents came when Pyramid, without
approval from the Clarkstown Planning Board or Town Board went
ahead with plans to build 3 million square feet rather than the
1.85 million that officials had approved. The only approval Pyramid
obtained for the larger structure was from the town building
inspector, Aldoph Milich.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the additional space remains empty, on floors above Lord
&AMP; Taylor and Filene's. A Supreme Court judge ruled, after the
building already was under construction, that the extra space could
be completed but not occupied. It is that empty space that the mall
opponents hope to stop from being filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how they operate, you can understand why no one
in town believes a word they say,'' said Coplan.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Lasker, the founder of the Rockland Civic Association,
decided that the only way to fight the expansion of the mall, and
what she sees as the overdevelopment of Rockland County, was to run
for the Clarkstown Town Board. She ran in 1997 and lost in a close
election.
</P>
<P>
   She is gearing up for another race this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I loved, what I came here for, the parkland, the open
space, is nearly gone to overdevelopment,'' said Ms. Lasker, 48,
who teaches disabled children and has lived in West Nyack for 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lasker, like Ms. Rauer and other devoted members of the
Rockland Civic Association, don't patronize the mall. Coplan,
however, has had to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your son is invited to a skating party at the ice rink,
you can't very well tell him that it's the Death Star and you just
can't go,'' Coplan said. ``I went, but I didn't enjoy it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Their lockers are about three feet from each
other, separated only by a television and a videocassette recorder.
Those items should not be a hindrance to Hideki Irabu in his
attempt to watch, to absorb and to learn from Roger Clemens, the
legendary pitcher to his right in the Yankees' clubhouse at Legends
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody Clemens _ who had the
locker next to their famous father in Toronto _ it is Irabu living
in this prime real estate. Irabu should not overlook the potential
impact of being in this beneficial setting. If Irabu is
industrious, he will study everything Clemens does and mimic him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the first day pitchers and catchers reported to
camp, Manager Joe Torre sent a powerful message when he was asked
if anyone needed to prove something to him and he instantly said
Irabu. So Irabu, the pitcher who dazzled during the first half of
1998 and has disappointed for most of the rest of his two years
with the Yankees, has been warned.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unfair to compare any pitcher to a future Hall of
Famer like Clemens, it is not unfair to ask any pitcher to emulate
Clemens' dedication and work ethic. Irabu has never electrified the
Yankees with his approach, usually doing the minimum and showing
scant enthusiasm for a job that pays him almost $13 million over
four years. It should not be a chore to work a few hours. Maybe
watching Clemens will affect Irabu. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger used a great word yesterday, grind,'' Torre said. ``I
think if Hideki could get into that frame of mind, grinding, and,
in order to pitch well, it doesn't always have to go his way. In
the past when things didn't go well, he didn't react too well. You
just have to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said of Irabu,
``With his general conditioning and the way he goes about his
business, you'd like to see him put a little more life into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu spoke reverently about Clemens, but he had not yet had the
chance to actually quiz him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at him, the first thing I've noticed is that he
works very hard,'' Irabu said. ``He does the conditioning and work
that needs to be done to be successful. When he's pitching, his
fighting spirit is unbelievable. He really gives his all. We're on
the same team and we'll hang out a little bit. I think there will
be many things I can learn from him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's wet workout, Irabu walked ahead of Clemens toward
the weight room and Clemens told George Rose, Irabu's interpreter,
``Any time he needs anything or has questions, tell him no
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, Clemens also vaguely said ``they,''
which probably means Torre and Stottlemyre, have asked him to try
to influence Irabu. Torre would smile for a week if he saw the
paunchy Irabu running side-by-side with the rock-solid Clemens. It
was not a good sign for the Yankees when Irabu laughed after being
asked if he could acquire conditioning techniques from another
pitcher. ``There's never been a winning pitcher who hasn't done the
work, the conditioning,'' Irabu said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrasts between the two are revealing. While
Clemens was lacing his sneakers to exercise at 9:44 a.m. Sunday,
Irabu, his hair tousled and his eyes droopy, did not arrive at the
field until 10:08. While Clemens treated a 59-pitch throwing
session on Saturday like it was a World Series game, Irabu has
annoyed the Yanks by lobbing his warm-ups between innings. Very
often, his fastball started at 88 miles per hour and reached 93 by
the end of the inning. Would Irabu have started at 93 if he had
uncorked his warm-ups with vigor?
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, it's got to rub off on him,'' Stottlemyre said.
``Everyone should pay attention to what he does and how he does
it,'' the coach said of Clemens. ``He's serious about his work. He
does a lot of extra running. He's great not just because he can
throw a baseball. He's great because he does a lot of things that
keep him that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was 9-3 with a 2.86 earned run average through 17 starts
last season before laboring and finishing 13-9 with a 4.06 era. He
did not toss a pitch in the post-season, an indication of how far
he had plummeted. Even David Cone said he was ``not sure Joe Torre
has seen what he's looking for'' from Irabu. By looking at Clemens
and copying him, Irabu has a better chance of convincing the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer and myself, our idea was to take him out for sushi, not
hit the weights,'' said Cone, referring to how he and David Wells
affected Irabu. ``He'll see Roger do his work, the intensity he
shows every day. He's so intense. That could help him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Irabu helps himself. &QL;

WELL-RESTED BRUINS ROUT SYRACUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't exactly a textbook practice schedule _
nothing Thursday, a light workout Friday, nothing Saturday _ and it
took the Bruins by surprise. Hankering for activity, guard Baron
Davis found a gym and a rim and practiced on his own when
Saturday's session was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But for UCLA coach Steve Lavin, it was an obvious decision. The
Bruins were tired, as Earl Watson's airball from the foul line
against USC showed. Also, because of a gymnastics meet Saturday,
the Bruins could not practice in Pauley Pavilion; it was the Wooden
Center or nothing. Finally, Lavin spoke to several coaches last
week, including Purdue's Gene Keady and Pepperdine's Lorenzo Romar,
about late-season fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches lose a game and they want to have a 3{-hour practice _
they think that will help,'' Lavin said. ``But the kids are worse
because they have no energy.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lavin gambled. He gambled that fresh legs were more important
than correcting the myriad mistakes UCLA made against USC. He
gambled that whatever preparation the Bruins needed for Syracuse
could be handled with videotape.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled _ and he won.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh legs, a full tank and harrowing pressure defense, the
Bruins sprinted past Syracuse 93-69 Sunday before 11,721 at Pauley
Pavilion, in one of their most impressive victories of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised when (Lavin) canceled the (Saturday)
practice,'' said Davis, who matched his career high with 27 points.
``But I felt real fresh. I'm not saying practice is bad, but this
helped my knee and it helped my head.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone. Watson admitted fatigue last week in the Bay
Area, then hoisted the airball against USC. But before Sunday's
tipoff, he told Lavin, ``I've got my legs back,'' then contributed
11 points and eight assists in his best game in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The rest also helped center Dan Gadzuric, whose
tendinitis-plagued knees always need a break. He had 12 points and
nine rebounds in his most active, efficient game this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those couple days off re-energized my knees and legs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fresher and faster Bruins (19-7) were quicker to loose balls,
squeezed passing lanes and dominated the rebounding (39-30). They
pressed throughout the second half, outscored Syracuse 60-40, and
shot 60 percent from the field. Just as the Bruins sometimes look
as if they've never faced a zone defense before, Syracuse looked as
if it had never faced full-court pressure before. The Orangemen
committed 21 turnovers, including five by guard Jason Hart, an
Inglewood native.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't handle the pressure very well at all,'' Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim said. ``Their full-court press caused us a lot of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Pac-10 will let UCLA go at warp speed, but the
unknowing Orangemen took the bait. They countered the full-court
pressure just as UCLA hoped _ with long passes that were
intercepted and quick shots that created fast-break opportunities
for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to play anybody at that tempo,'' Davis said. ``That's
playing right into our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the prime beneficiary. He roamed center court on
defense, plucking away passes left and right. Seconds later, he
turned those steals into dazzling passes and Bruins baskets. In the
game-breaking sequence, Davis converted a three-point play, stole a
downcourt pass and fed Watson for a reverse layup that gave UCLA a
53-37 lead with 14 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   When Syracuse did slow the pace and play its zone defense, the
Bruins had an answer. They positioned Davis at the high post
(foul-line area), which allowed him to direct the attack from
within the zone. He received entry passes from the wing, which
forced the zone to collapse, then turned to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Baron in the middle opened up everything,'' Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   And UCLA was fresh enough to capitalize, earning a victory that
will weigh heavily on Selection Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line,'' Lavin said of the practice schedule. ``You
don't want to back off, but you want to give them enough off-time.
After the Stanford game, I knew we were tired.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BULLS DESCEND FROM CHAMPIONS TO SHAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks leading up to Sunday's Knicks-Bulls game,
I'd been troubled by a feeling that I couldn't place. The feeling
had actually been present ever since the owners marched their
players into camp and put them to work following the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Then I read that Tim Floyd, the Chicago Bulls' rookie head
coach, had implored Dickey Simpkins, Chicago's journeyman center,
to give his 1-7 team an inside presence Sunday against Patrick
Ewing, the Knicks' veteran center. I also read that Floyd had
implored Charles Jones, the former Long Island University star, to
give the Bulls a scoring lift. Charles Jones? Give the Bulls a
lift? He wasn't even drafted last season.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it clicked; that's when I recognized the gnawing
feeling inside. It was the same sinking feeling that followed me
throughout the National Football League's humorous, humiliating
``replacement player'' games in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the situations aren't the same. In the NFL strike,
teams were a hodgepodge of veteran players who crossed the picket
line and replacements. After the NBA lockout, the real players are
back, with one supreme exception. But the basketball owners showed
the players they were willing to cancel a season, confident that
fans would come back because what they were ultimately attracted to
were the teams, the league, the logos. In other words, the NBA felt
that it could market anything.
</P>
<P>
   The messages from ownership were, after all, the same: the
players are expendable and interchangeable. And the result has been
the same: two fraudulent seasons, with a similar fumbling and
bumbling quality of play, a lack of cohesion. The team that
stumbles the least wins.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to salvage time and recoup money after the
lockout, NBA players have been set to run at a frantic pace.
Sunday's game at Madison Square Garden was the Knicks' fifth in
seven days; the impostor Bulls played the first of six games in
eight days. And the lockout highlighted how many players, far from
playing for the love of the game, are playing to pay for the
multiple mortgages, fleets of luxury cars, child support and other
obligations that drove them back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is the poster team of this sham season in which money is
all that matters. Michael Jordan, the best player ever to play the
game, retired, Scottie Pippen was sent off to Houston, Dennis
Rodman was left to his own bizarre devices. Jerry Krause, the
general manager being portrayed as the wounded genius hero, is
plunging the team into obliteration and telling Bulls fans, ``Don't
worry.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield wrote, ``If there's a hell below, they're all
going to go.'' Toni Kukoc, Chicago's hope for this season, must
think he has descended into the basketball version of hell. The
Bulls are 1-8 for the first time since 1978. Their point total in
Sunday's 79-63 loss was the lowest for a Knicks' opponent since the
inception of the 24-second shot clock in 1954. Kukoc scored 16
points in 40 minutes on 6-of-19 shooting. After six years of riding
the Jordan-Pippen-powered gravy train, Kukoc now feels the burden
of carrying dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc is being counted on to do all the things he's not equipped
to do: produce fire, provide leadership, motivate demoralized
troops. ``It's tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the answer to that,'' he said, staring ahead. ``I'm
not going to comment on that.'' No comment needed. Jones took one
shot and missed it, grabbed one rebound and blocked one shot.
Simpkins played 35 minutes, made two of 10 shots and hauled down 11
rebounds. Ewing was four of 15 in 34 minutes, and managed six
rebounds and seven blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivalry is not the same, it's definitely not like the
Knicks-Bulls of old,'' Ewing said afterward. There was a time, when
the NBA was rebuilding itself and still needed faces and images,
flesh and blood, when valor, competitive integrity and winning for
the team had meaning. Then the team became the franchise, the
franchise became a multifaceted corporation, and the league became
willing to tear down its own star system. In the dog-eat-dog world
of this truncated season, Chicago's woes simply mean another
victory for the Knicks. That's what it's come down to: not rivalry
and not necessarily compelling basketball either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Michael, Scottie or Dennis, it takes some of the buzz
out of it,'' Ewing said. ``But we still have a job to do,
regardless of who is out there.'' That was a phrase we heard a lot
in 1987 from beleaguered NFL coaches, forced to coach furniture
salesmen-turned-football players and players they had cut three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there are games to play and a season to finish
out. For the Knicks and Bulls, there are two contrasting missions
in two different markets. The Knicks cut off appendages and grow
attractive new ones for fans mesmerized by the process more than
the product. The Bulls, in a less sophisticated basketball market,
blow themselves to pieces and ask for patience and mercy.
</P>
<P>
   What's disconcerting is how much this all feels like 1987: the
NBA's grinding, crushing capitalism has committed the players to an
odd strain of socialism. A world where everybody is Dickey Simpkins
and Charles Jones.

UCLA'S BIG MEN COME ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins found their legs and their big men
Sunday, welcoming back Jerome Moiso from injury and Dan Gadzuric
from frustration while they raced past Syracuse 93-69 at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging to have both of them get quality minutes,''
Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``Jerome needs more time, and Dan is
coming on strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, who missed two games with tendinitis in his feet, played
12 scoreless minutes in what figures to be a slow return to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no timing and I'm out of shape, but that's normal,''
Moiso said.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric has struggled with bad knees, foul trouble and poor
fundamentals _ dribbling too much in the low post, for example. But
he played his best game in weeks on Sunday, registering 12 points,
nine rebounds, three steals and three blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt more comfortable out there,'' Gadzuric said. ``I didn't
have foul trouble because I played smart. And I'm in better
condition because I've been practicing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushing around: While Baron Davis scored the most points (27)
and received the loudest applause, freshman forward JaRon Rush
played perhaps his best game of the season _ 23 points (a
career-high) and nine rebounds. He made 9 of 12 shots and hit two
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sacrificing my body,'' said Rush, who leads the
Bruins in floor burns. ``I felt real fresh after taking a couple
days off. I didn't have tired legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really excited to play Syracuse. Because Connecticut
beat Stanford, I didn't want Syracuse to ruin the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast track: No one showed greater improvement last week than
freshman forward Matt Barnes. He was scoreless against Stanford but
had seven points and six rebounds in 18 minutes against Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes played well in November, then faltered after an ankle
injury over Christmas break. After weeks of frustration and
sporadic playing time, he's back in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the flow now, and I hope I can keep the production
up,'' he said. ``Before I got hurt, I felt like I was contributing.
It's taken this long to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Ex-Bruins J.R. Henderson (Vancouver), Toby Bailey
(Phoenix) and Jelani McCoy (Seattle) were all placed on the injured
list last week.

RUTGERS' RALLY FAILS WHEN LAST CHANCE IS DEFLECTED
</HEADLINE>

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There were bragging rights at stake when
Rutgers and Seton Hall met Sunday, and much more: a possible
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth for
Rutgers, a possible National Invitation Tournament bid for Seton
Hall. And after nearly 40 minutes of ragged yet inspired play, it
all came down to one chance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hodgson, Rutgers' senior co-captain, had the ball at the top
of the key with 11 seconds to play and the Scarlet Knights trailing
by 2 points. The play had broken down, as had many of Rutgers'
chances Sunday, and Hodgson tried to make something happen. He
started a drive down the right side of the lane as Geoff Billet,
the other captain, drifted toward the corner to try to pull his man
clear. But Shaheen Holloway took a chance and quickly darted a hand
toward Hodgson, slightly deflecting the ball, which bounded off
Hodgson's leg and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nightmare,'' Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon said. ``He felt he
had a lane to the basket. You can't knock a kid when he makes a
strong move, but it was certainly a clean play. He slapped the ball
and it went off his leg out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ty Shine then hit two free throws that gave the Pirates a
4-point lead, and they hung on for a 57-55 victory in the teams'
only regular-season meeting. The loss left Rutgers' record at 17-9,
9-7 in the Big East, with Georgetown and Miami still to play, and
the NCAA bid that seemed so certain now appears more uncertain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take a step forward,'' Hodgson said. ``Are we out of
it? No. Each loss is a setback, but we're not out of it by any
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Amaker, the coach of Seton Hall (13-12, 7-9), said: ``I
think Rutgers deserves to go. I think they've played a terrific
season in terms of how they've operated all year, the improvement
that they've made from last year to this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers never seemed to be in the game, which was played before
a crowd of 16,587 at Continental Arena. The Scarlet Knights set a
season low with only 15 field goals. After they tied at 27-27, on a
pair of free throws by Dahntay Jones 22 seconds into the second
half, Seton Hall answered with 11 consecutive points and built
leads of 52-38 with 7 minutes 27 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had just one field goal in the first 11:30 of the second
half, but the Pirates had their problems, too. After Chuck Moore,
who led Seton Hall with 13 points, hit a 3-pointer with 7:55 to
play, the Pirates tried only two more field goals and made neither.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights slowly chipped away, pulling within 54-49
when Jeff Greer converted a 3-point play with 2:54 left. Charles
Manga and Greer, who scored 15 points to lead Rutgers, traded free
throws before Billet drained a 3-pointer from the left corner with
59.4 seconds left, narrowing the Rutgers lead to 55-53.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall, holding the lead and with its point guard, Holloway,
playing with an injured right shoulder, held on to the ball; a
desperate air ball by Shine was the Pirates' fifth 35-second clock
violation of the game, and their third in the final 6:32. That gave
Rutgers a chance to tie or go ahead, but after the ball slipped off
Hodgson's leg, Shine made his free throws, and Jones' rebound
follow basket with 2.7 seconds left was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking, try to put some pressure on the
defense,'' Hodgson said. ``The play was actually for an open three
at the top of the key and I passed up on it, broke the play, and
didn't finish it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said of his gamble: ``Geoff was in the corner, and I
just reached my hand in there. Geoff was open. If he made that
pass, I would have been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Billet added: ``I saw what was going on and I just hoped maybe
he would grab his arm or something. When you're down at the end and
they're shooting free throws, it's no fun. But we still have life.
It's not the last game, not the end of the world. We have to bounce
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry concluded, the teams now must finish out the week
and then hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me crazy,'' Holloway said. ``I think about the NCAA It
sounds crazy, but you never know. In the Big East tournament,
everybody is equal. It's getting down to crunch time and a lot of
teams are not getting better. We are. Now we have to build on
it.'' &QL;

OLOWOKANDI HAS KNEE SORENESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a precautionary move, the Clippers made Sunday's trip to Salt
Lake City without Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Are they protecting the rookie center's vulnerable ego from the
big, bad Utah Jazz? No, they're protecting his sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, who is expected to join the team today in time for
tonight's showdown with the defending Western Conference champs,
checked in with knee soreness Sunday morning. He participated in
``noncontact'' drills during practice at the Sports Arena, where
the team decided to have a precautionary MRI administered this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just making sure we're covering all the bases,'' coach
Chris Ford said. ``We have a lot of games coming up this week and
we want to make sure he's fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi had 11 rebounds in Saturday's loss to the Dallas
Mavericks but made only four of his 13 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-no and seven: The NBA's only winless team will spend this
week playing five games against four teams (two vs. the Lakers)
with a combined record of 24-13 through Saturday. At 0-7, Ford and
the Clippers are nine defeats shy of the futility mark set by Bill
Fitch's first Clippers team that began the 1994-'95 season at 0-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no short cuts in getting out of it,'' Ford said of
the losing streak. ``No one's going to feel sorry for you.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes losing even more frustrating for their first-year
coach is the lingering presence of familiar mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the seventh game,'' Ford said, ``but we've been
talking about the same things for seven games. You'd like to move
on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Probable cause: Backup point guard Sherman Douglas participated
in Sunday's practice and is listed as ``probable'' for tonight's
game in Utah. Douglas missed Saturday's game with Dallas, but his
minutes were ably handled by Pooh Richardson. Richardson had six
assists and four points in 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Darrick Martin had his strongest game of the season
Saturday, scoring 13 points, handing out 10 assists and committing
only two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, he's played OK,'' Ford said of Martin. ``I have no
complaints with him.''

PACERS ' LAST-SECOND FIELD GOAL THWARTS RALLYING NETS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ This one was different. It was not embarrassing,
not one they should have had, not more evidence that the Nets are
in trouble. But it was a loss and a heartbreaking one at that.
</P>
<P>
   With four seconds remaining, Mark Jackson, known more for his
passing than penetration, dribbled past Eric Murdock and made a
short one-handed runner over the outstretched hands of Keith Van
Horn that ruined an otherwise inspiring performance by the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's only basket of the game gave the Indiana Pacers an
80-79 victory Sunday over New Jersey before a raucous crowd at
Market Square Arena. It was the Nets' sixth loss in seven games and
dropped their record to 2-7. But unlike their previous two defeats
to Houston and Cleveland, their was no late-game collapse, no
reason to be ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Nets who rallied this time, outscoring
Indiana by 10-0 over a 7:56 minute stretch of the fourth quarter to
turn a 72-65 deficit into a 75-72 lead with 1:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Reggie Miller hit a 3-pointer to tie the score,
and 30 seconds later Chris Mullin hit one from 25 feet to put the
Pacers up 78-75. Keith Van Horn answered for the Nets, scoring over
Dale Davis with 33 seconds remaining, and then hitting what could
have been the game winner on a driving 7 footer with 10.2 seconds
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   That shot gave the Nets a 79-78 lead, and set up the final
sequence that included great defense by Kerry Kittles on Miller
and, of course, Jackson's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're getting closer,'' Nets coach John Calipari said.
``This is the first time this season that a team took the wood to
us and we didn't go away. All I can tell our guys is to keep doing
this and we'll win games and the bad start will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's late baskets highlighted a strong performance of 25
points, 8 rebounds and a career-high 3 blocked shots. Jayson
Williams, coming off an awful game last Saturday at Cleveland and
playing with ligament damage in his right thumb, was just as
strong, recording 17 points, 13 rebounds and a career-high 5
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, who scored 14 in the first half, led Indiana (7-3) with
21 points, and Miller followed with 18. Jackson had only 2 points
on 1-of-3 shooting but dished out 9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari had been imploring his players to get to the free-throw
line more, and they obliged by earning 18 first-half attempts, two
more than they shot in the entire game against Cleveland, and 33
over all. Van Horn was the catalyst in the first half, hitting 7 of
10, as the Nets scored 14 points from the stripe. Their aggressive
drives to the basket were a sharp contrast to their play of late,
when their insistence on avoiding contact in the lane left them
ranked 26th in the league in foul shots attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Murdock, who made his first start of the season in the
absence of Sam Cassell, hit two free throws to put the Nets ahead,
40-31, with 3:38 remaining in second quarter. But the euphoria was
short lived, as Murdock took two ill-advised shots and made a
turnover in the next two minutes to help Indiana end the half with
a 10-1 run that tied the score at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse was similar to the late-game troubles New Jersey
has had in its last two losses. Last Thursday, the Nets led
throughout before the experienced Houston Rockets rallied to force
overtime, and they had Cleveland down, 72-65, with less than 8
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari said before the game that he was waiting to see how the
team responded in the crucial two- and three-minute stretches of
the game, and he could not have been pleased with the answer he
received before the break, especially when things turned for the
worse early in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting 6 of their first 7 shots, the Pacers surged ahead,
56-49, at the 5:06 mark. Reggie Miller and Rik Smits led the charge
with 7 and 4 points, respectively. With the crowd waving balloons
and cheering madly, the Nets seemed to be done. But the inspired
play of Williams got them back in it. He scored 6 points and
grabbed 4 rebounds during the third to help New Jersey pull to
58-57 at the 3:41 mark. The Pacers, however, were able to push
their advantage back to 64-59 heading into the fourth. After making
just 37 percent of its shots in the first two quarters, Indiana
shot 54 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In starting, Murdock was joined by Kerry Kittles and Kendall
Gill on the wings, giving the Nets their sixth starting lineup of
the season. Gill, who sat out all but the final two minutes
Saturday with a sprained left ankle, replaced Scott Burrell.
Burrell's move to the bench was no surprise, as he had foundered in
the last four games. After averaging 16.7 points over a three-game
stretch that ended on Feb. 11 in Milwaukee, the small forward
totaled just 13 points on 5-of-16 shooting over the next four
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell played two minutes in the fourth quarter but his obvious
limp made his useless. After recording 18 points and 5 assists in
23 minutes against Cleveland, he is hoping to return to the lineup
Tuesday against the Knicks. ``By then I'll be back to where I was
Saturday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While that might be good enough to play, it may not be good
enough to help the Nets win. Cassell said he played at 60 percent
capacity against the Cavaliers, but that estimate might be
generous. Though his craftiness and accurate jump shot allowed him
score, he struggled defensively. Limping noticeably and moving with
the speed of a cumbersome center, he was nearly at the mercy of
Brevin Knight, the Cleveland point guard.

SOMETIMES SURVIVAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm always riveted by passing stories, and I use ``passing'' as
an adjective, not a verb: stories of people who pass from one
identity to another or pass themselves off as something they are
not. Negro as Caucasian, Jew as Christian, working-class striver as
high-handed aristocrat, male to female or female to male.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more American. Passing has been a right, a privilege
or a necessity since those first boatloads of ordinary Englishmen
and women scrambled onto the shores of a New World to establish
themselves as gentlemen, ladies and rulers of all they surveyed.
And it can be a survival tactic, a better guarantee of equal
opportunity than any law. Or an intensely private psychic
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   (An example of all three: the narrator in James Weldon Johnson's
``Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man,'' a novel of 1912 based on
the real-life experiences of a childhood friend, who witnessed a
lynching in Georgia and, shamed that he belonged to a race that
could be lynched and a country that could lynch, decided to live
the rest of his life as a white man.)
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes for a more treacherous family secret than passing.
Nothing makes clearer that we are as much the offspring of our
designated race, religion, ethnicity or gender as of our parents.
Our nation's vision of us and itself shapes us as thoroughly as our
family does.
</P>
<P>
   I am a great admirer of memoirs that try to get at this mingling
of _ what? Our analytic and narcissistic selves or the historical,
the social and the personal? Helen Fremont's new memoir, ``After
Long Silence'' (Delacorte Press) does all this, with a story of
safe but costly passage from one identity to another that takes us
from Europe to America via World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fremont and her sister Lara are Midwestern Roman Catholics
whose parents, emigres from Poland, leave church before communion
every Sunday. Their mother has a low opinion of confession and
disdains confirmation as an American invention. But she insists on
teaching Helen the sign of the cross and the Lord's Prayer in six
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fremont knew that her grandparents had been killed in the
war. And, she writes: ``I also knew that my parents had been in
concentration camps. I misunderstood the meaning of
``concentration'' and assumed that in prison, the inmates were
consumed by intensely focused mental activity. I believed that
these camps were so deadly that they had sewn my parents into
pockets of complete silence. And so I understood that two things
could happen to you in a war: either you were suddenly,
breathlessly, swept off the streets by a bomb, or you were scooped
into a concentration camp, where you swallowed a terrible
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   This gets exactly that innocence and prescience that children
have. They can't grasp the factual reality of adult suffering, but
if those adults are their parents, they can't help feeling the
emotional truths. And consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The facts were these. Kovik and Maria Buchman were Polish Jews.
Kovik had spent six years in a Siberian prison camp. Maria and her
sister Zosia (who was married to an Italian count), had survived
the war by pretending to be Polish Catholics. They had been unable
to save their parents, and Maria had finally fled Poland in 1943,
disguised as an Italian soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fremont and her sister got at the truth by turning
themselves into investigators, gathering information from museums,
archives and family friends who were also survivors. They uncovered
what she calls ``overlapping layers of history and family, fact and
omission.''
</P>
<P>
   But were they investigators or inquisitors? Their parents wanted
no part of this. Her father, Ms. Fremont says, ``suffered from the
realization that his life had been unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, on the other hand, suffered from the illusion that
it was not so bad as it really was.''
</P>
<P>
   And in proving those beliefs false, their two children (how
perfect that Ms. Fremont was a lawyer and her sister a
psychiatrist) ``exposed the hole that lay like an enormous crater
at the center of my mother's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing narratives are detective stories. The criminal is a
viciously unjust society and the intended victims escape by
disguising themselves beyond recognition. But there is no such
thing as a trustworthy detective. Even if the danger has passed,
anyone who questions the disguise becomes a psychological threat,
even a criminal. ``Don't try to tell me you're doing this for me!''
Ms. Fremont's mother cries. ``You're not doing this for me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking only of yourself,'' her aunt tells her, and
then adds, mercilessly and desperately: ``You're a Nazi! You're
worse than Hitler! ... You're a beast!''
</P>
<P>
   I think Ms. Fremont has restored a fuller portion of their lives
to her parents and aunt. Those qualities of temperament, those
ambitions and habits and longings, the everyday stuff that makes us
what we are, have finally been retrieved from the war ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But thank goodness she has the intelligence and imagination to
question her own motives. This allows her to question the memoir
form, even as she deploys it so beautifully. (And no literary form
so incendiary should be used without being questioned.)
</P>
<P>
   On one hand she says, ``Believing we were Jewish offered me the
possibility that my parents were still in hiding, that we were all
in hiding, that all the underground emotional tunnels in our house
were not just figments of my imagination.'' On the other, ``It's
crazy, I told myself _ these wild guesses of Jewish roots _ as if I
were casting about for some adventure to beef up my ordinary
American existence.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, that infinitely desirable thing that anyone who has
ever fled a beleaguered identity seems to strive for. Some were
born to it, some achieved it, some got impaled on it. You could
call it the American dream. I'd call it the American cover story.

AMERICAN TEAM TAKES ANOTHER STEADY BABY STEP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Thomas Dooley got an inside look at
America's soccer future Sunday, even as he was bidding farewell to
international competition. From what the 37-year-old defender could
see, United States soccer is on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely doing things the right way,'' said Dooley,
who played his 81st and final international match for the United
States in a 2-1 victory over Chile before 14,896 at Lockhart
Stadium. ``I'd say 90 percent of this team Sunday will play in the
World Cup qualifying. And there's a lot of young talent here, a lot
of depth. It just takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Arena, now 2-0-2 as the United States coach, chose
to test his young players Sunday. Every starter was under 30 except
for Dooley, who wore distinctive red and white shoes for his
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Only four starters from the team's eye-catching 3-0 victory over
Germany 15 days ago were in the lineup. Of the 22 players on the
roster, 17 have played five or fewer matches for the United States
senior national team.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Chileans, who had played to a 1-1 draw with
Guatemala last Wednesday, fielded six starters from their 1998
World Cup roster. But the top scorers Marcelo Salas and Ivan
Zamorano were not with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the players on the United States team _
midfielder Ben Olsen, a 21-year-old from Middletown, Pa., who had
played for Arena at the University of Virginia and on DC United of
Major League Soccer _ provided the game's first fireworks in his
first international start.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Brian McBride set him up with a nifty cross in front of
the net in the 58th minute, and Olsen hit it with a side volley
past goalie Marcelo Ramirez into the net's left corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the best example of what this game was about,''
midfielder Eddie Lewis said. ``To come in and not only play well,
but to score a key goal, that's exactly what Bruce is looking for.
Now he has one more player competing for a roster spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen admitted he was a ``little too star-struck'' at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty nervous,'' he said. ``I didn't feel like I had my
feet under me. But at halftime I calmed down, and in the second
half I played how I think I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not have long to rejoice in Olsen's
success. Chile tied at 1-1 on an unassisted goal in the 64th
minute. Midfielder Roberto Cartes boomed a 30-yarder that eluded
goalie Tom Presthus _ who had replaced Zach Thornton after a
scoreless first half _ in the net's upper-right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as a large Chilean contingent finished a feverish
chant of ``Chi-le! Chi-le!'' the Americans recaptured the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came in the 65th minute, after Dooley's free kick
reached McBride inside the penalty area. The ball bounced to Lewis,
who promptly shot. The ball ricocheted off defender Pablo Contreras
for the game-winner. It was Lewis' first goal in international
play.
</P>
<P>
   Looking a little ragged at this point, the Chileans made three
substitutions in the game's final 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young team, with an average age of 22, and we've
only been together for two days,'' Chilean Coach Nelson Acosta said
through an interpreter. ``So under the circumstances, I thought we
did well.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only the second victory for the United States over
Chile in six meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave some of our guys a taste of international soccer
today,'' Arena said. ``The result only speaks well of our
future.'' &QL;

HURRICANES' FIRST-PERIOD BLITZ BEWILDERS THE ISLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain, sat on
a folding chair in the visitors' locker room 20 minutes after
Sunday's game against the Hurricanes. His face wore a blank look,
and his left hand was crushing a paper cup.
</P>
<P>
   Linden was seething. The Hurricanes had abused and taunted his
Islanders, who left the Greensboro Coliseum ice humiliated by
Carolina, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they outworked us, out-battled us,'' said Linden,
whose team lost for the first time since a 2-0-2 stretch. ``They
out-hit us. When you get in a game like that you have to match them
hit for hit. I know our team is not the most physical in the
league. But we didn't meet the challenge at all.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not much team toughness on display, and that seemed to
be the heart of the problem for the Islanders (18-34-7).
</P>
<P>
   They missed the rugged defenseman Rich Pilon, who was in
Saskatchewan attending his grandmother's funeral. Without him, the
Islanders were abused by Carolina in the first period. And that was
all the time the Hurricanes (27-22-10) needed as they scored three
unanswered goals.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Salo, the Islanders' goalie, was thrown to the ice by
6-foot-5-inch Keith Primeau. Robert Reichel, a smallish forward for
the Islanders, was punched by a much bigger Jeff O'Neill. Zigmund
Palffy and Kenny Jonsson were pushed around by the Hurricanes'
tough guy, Gary Roberts. None of those actions invoked retaliation.
Once, the ``Chicken Dance'' was pumped through the public address
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was addressed,'' said Islander coach Bill Stewart, who is
5-5-4 since taking over from Mike Milbury on Jan. 21. ``Have a look
at the penalty minutes. They have one defenseman who has 47 penalty
minutes, that's it. They got a guy with eight minutes running all
over the place. Answer the bell. I didn't like our mentality
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our `B' game,'' he added. ``That's all about learning
how to be consistent and learning how to win. We have to be ready
and we can't spot any teams three goals and expect to be successful
at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Making Sunday's effort even harder to comprehend: the Islanders
had beaten the Devils in New Jersey less than 24 hours earlier.
Three days earlier, they snapped Pittsburgh's 10- game winning
streak. Before those victories, they earned ties against Buffalo
and Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any consistency,'' said Jonsson. ``We had a good
comeback yesterday. And today, we didn't show up in the first
period, and it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes carried the play in the opening period,
overwhelming the Islanders with size and speed on both ends. By the
end of 20 minutes, Carolina was leading by 3-0. And it could have
been worse, much worse, had Salo not been sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Salo faced 37 shots; Arturs Irbe faced 29 in the Carolina goal.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau opened the scoring on a sparkling play at 8:07. The
Hurricanes' captain and leading scorer crossed the blue line with
speed and turned Islander defenseman Barry Richter inside-out
before faking Salo to his knees. With Salo down and out, Primeau,
the Hurricanes' captain and leading scorer, slipped the puck into
the net for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill scored the Hurricanes' second goal of the first period
on the power play at 17:10. Standing in front of Salo's crease,
O'Neill knocked down Ray Sheppard's shot from the point.
</P>
<P>
   Not a minute later, Sheppard was celebrating a goal of his own.
After digging the puck out of the corner, he skated in front of the
Islanders' net uncontested. As Islander defensemen David Harlock
and Barry Richter watched, Sheppard stuffed the puck between Salo
and the near post.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began taunting the Islanders' goalie with the chant,
``Salo! Salo!'' Then they offered sarcastic applause when Salo
handled a non-threatening dump-in.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Nemchinov scored the Islanders' goal at 2:19 of the third
period. As Irbe looked for the puck, Nemchinov tapped in his own
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard scored an empty-netter with nine seconds left.

COMMENTARY: DANGER: CHINESE TINDERBOX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Singapore's dictator, Lee Kuan Yew _ a friend and
sometime adviser to China's leaders _ told reporters in Europe
recently that he saw ``a tinderbox quality'' in the dissatisfaction
rampant in China's coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income disparities'' have caused a large part of the
population to feel dispossessed, noted Lee, ``and that is a society
which for 40 years had it drummed into their heads that disparities
are wicked and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Bill Safire thinks it's all right to be rich,'' Lee
told us, ``a lot of people who are not rich think it's not all
right, and that they should have part of it, so this makes for
social pressures. . . . Just across the border from Hong Kong is a
Wild West town, and not for want of trying to police it.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what you like about Lee (and I say any government like
Singapore's, long dominated by one party, is inherently corrupt,
which he assures me is not libelous), he knows what goes on inside
China. In a follow-up interview, I asked why Beijing's leaders were
so fearful of a relative handful of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're never sure of that. They look at Tiananmen,'' said
Lee, referring to the massacre whose 10th anniversary will be
marked in June. ``That was a relative handful of students, and
people like Fang Lizhi, a harmless astrophysicist, behind them. But
it snowballed. They know they're vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest single fear they have is the corrosive effect of
graft and the revulsion that it evokes in people. They're never
quite sure when it will blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was careful to add: ``It's not that they're all corrupt. I
mean, you take Jiang Zemin or Zhu Rongji: in the center, they are
quite clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore businessmen tell Lee that many bureaucrats ``really
don't notice how much resentment there is. I mean, even over whole
areas, it's just illegal levies, not on the books. Just `squeeze
the farmers.' He's the boss, the Party secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   China has a history of brutish force in dealing with
criminality. ``Take the way they shoot their criminals. It's a
public demonstration. They bring them in, bent, pushed, humiliated.
You kneel down, I shoot you in the back, one bullet. And they make
the family pay for that bullet. It's a public demonstration . . .
to terrorize others into not doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule by fear?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Because they haven't gotten a police system that can
maintain a different kind of regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are we to decide whether it's right or wrong? Can we
change them?'' Why not? ``Ha! You try.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside punishment of criminals, what about the total
repression of political freedom _ can that be changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a gradual process. You have an idea how the
country should be,'' said the dictator. ``And you say, `Well, let's
change them' because you've got the levers. They sell you more than
you buy from them. So _ you say `change.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``I don't think they can change their ways.
And if they did, they would run very serious risks of internal
unrest that may abort the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and I profoundly disagree about the way to deal with what
dictators call ``internal unrest'' and what dissidents call ``the
spirit of human freedom.'' He sees multiparty democracy as the
threat to stability; I see it as the solution to China's stumbling
growth and growing instability.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because America is keeping the less free world
economically afloat, Lee now denies the existence of a ``Singapore
model'' and claims he never called the West ``decadent.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he cloaks as ``Confucian communitarian'' his
anti-individual statism, I posed a philosophical question: Do
people have an inherent right to rebel against despotism?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the Confucianist concepts,'' Lee replied.
``That's what the Chinese leaders fear most. Revolution in China is
called qiyi _ the qi, `to arise' and the yi for the ferociousness.
So when an emperor is despotic, corrupt, evil, it is a righteous
cause to rebel. This is part of the Chinese folk culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what is worrying the regime today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes. Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   As times toughen, China's political rigidity invites upheaval.
When Prime Minister Zhu arrives in Washington in April, Clinton
should link our trade lifeline to the relaxation of China's
repression. Political crackdown is no answer to economic slowdown.

EDITORIAL: RISKY BUSINESS IN BELARUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Stepan Simonuk is a farmer in Belarus who recently bought some
pigs from a state-owned farm. But he made the mistake of paying
cash _ a crime in Belarus, which requires those doing business with
a state farm to pay by taking out a loan from the state bank. Now
Simonuk has been fined 4.5 billion Belarussian rubles _ about
$45,000 at the official exchange rate. Since he cannot pay, he is
about to lose his 108-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   Simonuk's story is one of those told by the Belarussian
filmmaker Leonid Mindlin in a new documentary, ``Fear,'' about how
Belarus' neo-Stalinist dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, keeps
control. Lukashenko, who makes no secret of his admiration for
Stalin, does not merely persecute independent politicians,
journalists and human rights activists. He also crushes
entrepreneurs like Simonuk, who are Belarus' only hope for escaping
poverty. Thousands of Belarussians have run afoul of a web of
arbitrary, obscure and sometimes retroactive decrees and laws
regulating taxes, exchange rates and other aspects of business.
Many are in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has kept 85 percent of Belarus' industry and 90
percent of its agriculture in state hands, which has allowed him to
reward loyalists and direct much of the profits to an off-budget
fund he controls himself.
</P>
<P>
   The network of laws on business also provides him with a handy
club against critics or independent thinkers, especially those who
have money. Several dozen well-known independent politicians are
now charged with business-related crimes. Vasily Staravoitov, a
leading critic of government-controlled agriculture, is on trial
for alleged embezzlement of state property. Some of the other
victims of these laws were members of Belarus' freely elected
parliament, which Lukashenko disbanded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment and business development in Belarus have
declined steadily under Lukashenko, and a recent crackdown on small
business has been especially harsh. Lukashenko's philosophy is a
puzzling one for a country whose economy has essentially collapsed.
But what matters to him is not prosperity, but absolute control.  &QL;

NEW YORK MAYOR CRITICIZES FIRST LADY, WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST
HER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sounding very much like a candidate for the Senate
in 2000, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani used interviews on
three local and national television news programs Sunday to
criticize Hillary Rodham Clinton and to tout his own potential as
New York's next junior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Democratic suggestions that he would skip the race if
Mrs. Clinton jumped in, Giuliani said he would relish running as an
underdog against the first lady and combatively asserted that he
would be more likely to declare his candidacy if she declares hers
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think quite honestly there probably will be more of an
inclination to do it if she were to decide to run,'' Giuliani said
on ``Late Edition'' on CNN. ``It would be the most focused-on race
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a Republican, also reiterated his sharp criticism of
Mrs. Clinton for saying last year that creating a Palestinian state
was ``very important for the broader goal of peace in the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By one of the most influential people in the Clinton
administration saying Palestinian state, in essence you have given
that away without being able to shape it and you basically side
with the Palestinians against the Israelis,'' Giuliani said on
``Sunday Edition'' on WCBS-TV in New York.  &UR;  &LR; He called Mrs.
Clinton's comment ``a very big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her statement would be fair game for her opponent in a
Senate campaign, Giuliani replied, ``If she's the candidate,
obviously it would be an issue and it would be one that people
would have to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said that if he ran against Mrs. Clinton, he would
not attack her for never having lived in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have said they have not decided
whether to run for the seat now held by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who plans to retire at the end of next year. But the
mayor, in his television appearances Sunday, was exceptionally
forceful in his attacks on Mrs. Clinton and unusually candid in
musing about why he would be the Republicans' strongest candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in three races for mayor of New York City, and two
of them, before I got re-elected, I was behind by substantial
margins,'' he said on ``ABC News This Week.'' Being an underdog, he
added, ``kind of gives you the impetus to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' he said, ``it challenges you even more.''
</P>
<P>
   If he runs, Giuliani could face a primary contest with Rep. Rick
A. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican. On the Democratic side, Rep.
Nita M. Lowey of Westchester has said she probably will run if Mrs.
Clinton does not.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's attention to Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate
candidacy rose to fever pitch Sunday as the story was featured on
five national television news programs as well as on the covers of
this week's issues of Newsweek and Time magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every politician appearing on one of the Sunday talk
programs in Washington had a view on Mrs. Clinton for Senate. On
``Fox News Sunday,'' the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
warned that even Chicago politics could not compare to the
toughness of New York campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why anybody from Illinois wants to stick their
nose in New York politics,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Late Edition'' on CNN, Susan Molinari, the former
congresswoman from Staten Island, ventured a guess that Mrs.
Clinton would not run because ``this is not the kind of rough and
tumble she wants to put herself back into after getting through a
very difficult time in their personal and professional lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And on ``Face the Nation'' on CBS, former New York City Mayor
Edward I. Koch predicted Mrs. Clinton would win if she ran and said
it was ``ridiculous'' of Giuliani to attack her position on a
Palestinian state, contending that most Israeli and American Jews
support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Giuliani to raise that shows you how low a blow he's
willing to strike,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. &UR;  &LR; Mitch McConnell, the chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, which raises funds for Republican Senate
candidates, said on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC that Republicans
would relish having Mrs. Clinton run in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of talk about how much money the first lady
would raise,'' McConnell said. ``She'd raise it for both sides. I
can't think of anything that would energize our base not only in
New York but across the country as a campaign by the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell added that it would be fair for Republicans in a
Senate race to raise every scandal that has plagued the Clinton
White House over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing on the same program, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli,
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said,
``If their campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton is to simply be
an extension of the Starr investigation, they're going to take a
sizable Hillary lead and make it into a rout.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he considered it unlikely that Mrs. Clinton
would run for the New Jersey Senate seat that Frank R. Lautenberg
plans to relinquish next year because both Mrs. Clinton and her
husband ``had decided some time ago to live in New York City when
they left the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Clintons has said publicly where they plan to
settle after the President completes his term at the end of next
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey said
she would ``seriously'' look at the New Jersey Senate seat. ``But I
love the job I've got,'' she said, noting that running for the
Senate in 2000 would require ending her final term as governor ``a
year short.''
</P>
<P>
   Using an argument he used unsuccessfully for himself last year,
former Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, contended that Mrs.
Clinton would not be able to deliver federal aid to New York state
as well as a Republican. ``I can't see a liberal Democrat being
able to deliver in a Senate that will be Republican-controlled,''
he said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also said he was still thinking about running for Senate
again, calling it ``very tempting'' and the kind of opportunity
that true-blue politicians like himself ``salivate over.'' But even
many of D'Amato's allies do not think he is serious about running
again.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's strongest endorsement Sunday came from the woman
who would probably emerge as the Democrats' leading candidate if
the first lady declines to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the fact that she comes from outside New York
will be an element in this race,'' Ms. Lowey said. ``She'll be
talking about the issues and her positions and her strengths, and
her ability to be an effective senator and bring home the dollars
for New York will be the issue that will decide the election. And
she'll win.''

 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly every facet of the movie industry has been
transformed in recent years by new technologies, from computerized
dinosaurs and other special effects to the collection and analysis
of box office data. But even with all the digital wizardry, motion
picture reels are made through a chemical film process and then
projected onto screens using technology that has changed in the
past century about as much as buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the industry is on the threshold of what many experts say
is a breakthrough that could bring dramatic change to the economics
of movie theaters and to the moviegoing experience itself.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that financial hurdles and industry politics can be
overcome, the potential benefits include silver-screen images free
of lint and scratches, new types of in-theater special effects, and
the ability of theater owners in the heartland to get the same
access to first-run hits as urban cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, movie theaters are expected to begin
installing the first generation of digital projectors. Reels of
35-millimeter film _ which are several feet in diameter and heavy _
would be replaced with electronic projectors that use magnetic tape
or digital disks.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, at a meeting of the National Association of Theater
Owners, two new electronic projectors _ one by Texas Instruments
that relies on a chip with more than a million tiny mirrors, and a
competing technology using what is called a light valve produced by
Hughes-JVC _ will demonstrate what they can do. The same
four-minute film clip will be shown on each of the new projectors,
as well as a traditional 35-millimeter projector.
</P>
<P>
   If several demonstrations here recently are a guide, the
exhibitors will observe a quality that is sharp, with colors as
rich and as warm as the most pristine film prints and without the
usual jittery frames, scratchy soundtracks and blotches of dust
that often mar the much-used theater prints.
</P>
<P>
   The theater owners are expected to witness, in short, the birth
of ``electronic cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology now exists to build the projectors,'' said Doug
Darrow, the manager for market and business development of the
electronic projector business of Texas Instruments. ``The real
issues are economics and emotion. The studios have to say, `We want
to make this change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Singleton, the president of American Multi-Cinemas Inc., a
chain with 236 theaters, added, ``We can't wait for the day when
we're unshackled from the 35-millimeter prints. But conversion is
first and foremost the biggest problem to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners insist that the costs of installing the new
projectors, which are expected to cost roughly $100,000 for each
system, compared with about $30,000 or so for a conventional
projection booth, will have to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives generally agree, but are wary of even
discussing the issue openly for fear they could taint what are
likely to be long and difficult negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look it, there's going to have to be some studio subsidy of
the installation of these projectors,'' said one senior studio
executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
``Until we know exactly how that will work, I'm not willing to say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What no one doubts is the benefits the new systems will create.
For one, the studios will no longer have to create and ship
thousands of reels of film. Each print costs in the neighborhood of
$2,000, and a major film requires as many as 5,000 prints. Those
costs would all but vanish under the new systems, in which entire
movies could be sent to theaters through a satellite signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it stands, most of the savings would go to the studios and
the costs would go to the theater owners,'' said William F.
Kartozian, the president of the National Association of Theater
Owners. ``Obviously, this will have to be a cooperative effort.
Unless it's good for everybody it's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of quality and consistency. In the
process of making prints from a master the copies lose some
vitality, in the form of a softer focus and less vibrant colors.
Films begin to show serious wear after 30 or so screenings, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic cinema would do away with many of those problems.
Movies would still be shot, and edited, on traditional
35-millimeter film, and the end-product would be at least initially
on film. Then, using a machine called a telecine, the digitized
print would be made, and every subsequent digital copy would be a
perfect replica. There would be no wear and tear from each showing.
</P>
<P>
   The image that people see in the theaters will still be cast by
a projector upon a screen. But instead of the projector producing
the image by shining a bright light through a strip of film, the
new, digital projector would be generating the image from data
stored as computer code _ the way an audio CD player or the new
home-video DVD disk players translate digital data into sounds and
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into one demonstration where the only way I could tell
the difference between the film and the electronic version was that
the film one had that jittery movement and the electronic one
didn't,'' said Martin Cohen, the head of post-production at
Dreamworks SKG. ``They are down to the nitty-gritty. They're
finally in the ball park on the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, digital movies are likely to be delivered to
theaters in the form of electronic tapes or disks. Eventually,
however, they are expected to be delivered via satellite, then
stored on a server in the theaters.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect excites some theater owners. Currently, theaters
in big cities tend to get the first prints available of popular
movies and cinemas in smaller towns must wait days or even weeks.
The new system could deliver the new films simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   It also means films could be switched and juggled instantly. If
a movie is doing well, a multiplex cinema could add showings to its
other screens with the click of a mouse rather than having to wait
days for the delivery of new prints.
</P>
<P>
   The language in which movies are shown could be switched
instantly, if different sound tracks are provided. A theater near
an Hispanic neighborhood, for instance, could schedule showings of
the same film in Spanish and in English at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional systems already use digital sound, and generally
have up to eight tracks available for the audio portion of the
movie; the new systems could handle 12 audio channels. Those
additional channels would permit innovations that could
dramatically alter the movie experience. There could be everything
from sound from above, behind and below the audiences to programs
in which a digital signal engages devices that shake the seats on
cue or even emit smells into the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The new projectors could project screens images with the quality
of high-definition digital television. They could, for example, do
pay-per-view showings of prize fights, concerts or other live
events.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also major questions. It is currently estimated
that the studios lose perhaps $3 billion a year or more to illegal
copying of films. Most of the studios fear that, if movies are sent
to theaters through a satellite transmission, cyberthieves might be
able to intercept the signal and steal a perfect copy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is an issue that Cinecomm Digital Camera, one of the
companies trying to break into the business, believes it has
solved. Cinecomm is a new company jointly owned by Qualcomm Inc.,
which produces telecommunications equipment, and Hughes-JVC, a unit
of JVC of Japan that manufactures a digital projector. Qualcomm has
said it is bringing to the new company a sophisticated technology
for encrypting the movie transmission that is all but unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to eliminate that $2.5 billion a year or so of
piracy, but you're going to put a big dent in it,'' said Gary
Garland, the vice president of business development at Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest issues is who will control that
transmission to the theaters, and what it will cost.
</P>
<P>
   Cinecomm claims to have solved this question, too. It intends to
provide one stop shopping by providing the satellite uplink
facilities, the dishes for the theaters, the systems for encrypting
and compressing the transmissions, then decrypting them, and the
projectors, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to avoid the huge capital costs of removing the old
projectors and installing the new ones, Cinecomm said it intended
to bear all the initial costs itself. To cover these costs, it will
charge the theaters a fee based on the number of showings of each
movie.
</P>
<P>
   That all-in-one package makes many of the studios nervous,
however. The system would make the studios and the theater owners
dependent on a single supplier, and it would place a gatekeeper
between the distributors and the movie exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the buzz word: gatekeeper,'' said one studio executive.
``We won't permit a gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Williams, the president of the digital studio division of
Sony Pictures Entertainment, a major player in this field, said:
``Everyone acknowledges that the digitized image will have to be
encrypted, but no system has been accepted or endorsed by any of
the major studios. No one is going to put their faith in anyone who
has a proprietary black box. It has to be an open system.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinecomm waves off such concerns. ``There's certainly a concern
that anytime you have a single supplier you have questions,''
commented Michael Targoff, the chairman and chief executive of
Cinecomm. ``We have answers to all those questions. We're not
trying to get anyone in a position they don't want to be in.''

EDITORIAL: A CURIOUS CLAIM BY THE NIXON ESTATE   

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   An improbable lawsuit, a vestige of the Watergate scandal, has
been in trial in federal court since early December. The suit was
brought by Richard Nixon 18 years ago seeking payment from the
federal government for the millions of documents, thousands of
hours of tapes and other presidential records he left behind when
he resigned. The Nixon estate is asking for $213 million _ a figure
it says represents the market value of the materials in 1974, plus
interest.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no sense for the government to pay the Nixon estate for
having preserved for history the tapes that Nixon wanted destroyed
as well as for other presidential records that should properly be
considered public documents. In 1974, a few weeks after his
resignation, Nixon entered into an agreement with the head of the
federal General Services Administration that would have allowed
Nixon to destroy any of the tapes after five years, and would have
provided for the destruction of all the tapes by Sept. 1, 1984, or
upon his death, whichever came first. Congress quickly passed a law
in late 1974 nullifying the agreement and directing that all the
Nixon records, including the tapes, be preserved and kept in the
Washington area so that the public would have a full record of the
Watergate abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Congress passed a law making all presidential papers,
starting with those of the Reagan White House, government property
under the control of the National Archives. But the status of the
Nixon materials was not affected by that law. After years of
litigation, a federal appellate court ruled in 1992 that Nixon was
entitled to seek compensation for what traditionally had been
considered a president's private property. The government argues
the estate is owed nothing because there was no market for the mass
of untranscribed tapes and raw documents in 1974. The estate is not
seeking the records, it wants only the money.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Nixon Library in California hope to use the
money to help run that facility. But the federal government owes
them no operating support. Unlike other presidential libraries,
which are publicly operated because they have been donated to the
federal government and house presidential archives, the Nixon
Library is privately owned and does not contain the presidential
papers. Besides, the government has been paying for all the
preservation costs of the materials since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Every president from Herbert Hoover through Jimmy Carter has
donated his presidential records to the public. Only Nixon sued for
payment for such records. For years, Nixon's lawyers argued against
any public access to the tapes for privacy reasons. It is absurd
for the estate to argue now that it should be compensated for the
tapes, along with the other materials, because Nixon might have
cashed in on the evidence that drove him from office.

EDITORIAL: THE TANGLED KOSOVO PEACE TALKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   It was a frustrating weekend for the cause of peace in Kosovo.
With the deadline for agreement on a peace plan wisely extended
until Tuesday, both parties seemed to slip farther away from
signing a deal, and there is new division in the six-nation Contact
Group running the talks. The best chance for peace lies with
keeping the Contact Group focused on its original demands and its
threat to bomb Serbian military targets if the Serbian leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, remains defiant.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have been serious and cooperative
negotiators, and last week seemed ready to sign the deal. But on
Sunday, in what may be a temporary bargaining gambit, they insisted
that the plan's possibilities for an independent Kosovo were
insufficient, and called for a referendum on the issue in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   At last word on Sunday, the Albanians had not withdrawn the
demand. They should do so quickly. Though a referendum would be
certain to pass, it would not guarantee that the international
community would agree that Kosovo should become an independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that the ethnic Albanians will continue to
insist on a referendum, because their refusal to sign a peace
agreement will lessen pressure on Milosevic to allow NATO
peacekeepers in Kosovo. The peace talks began under the threat of
NATO air strikes against Serbian military targets if Milosevic
refused to make peace, and that threat must remain.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for a referendum, the ethnic Albanians make it more
difficult for NATO to use force against Milosevic, a problem
illustrated Sunday when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
that NATO would not carry out its threat to bomb Serbian targets if
the ethnic Albanians did not accept a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group, which consists of the United States, Russia,
Italy, Germany, Britain and France, should continue to insist on
disarming the guerrilla army, which has committed some abuses and
should not be able to threaten the ethnic Albanian democratic
politicians who will run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   European nations in the Contact Group should stop talking about
yielding ground to Milosevic and require free access to Kosovo for
the war crimes tribunal. Milosevic is a master at winning
concessions, and should get none here.

WITH ELS BACK ON TOUR, IT'S NOT A 2-MAN GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOHN STREGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ The South African Ernie Els made his
1999 PGA Tour debut here and issued a stern reminder Sunday that
golf is not the two-man game that it ostensibly had become.
</P>
<P>
   Els outplayed Tiger Woods and David Duval and overtook the
third-round leader Ted Tryba in the final round at the Riviera
Country Club, closing with a 3-under-par 68 to win the Nissan Open
by two strokes. Woods and Tryba both bogeyed the 18th hole and
finish tied for second with Davis Love III. Duval finished in a tie
for fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Els was married on New Year's Eve and has played only three
events since, two in South Africa and one in Australia. He won the
South African PGA Championship, but otherwise had become the
forgotten man in the wake of the blossoming Duval-Woods rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still six wins behind them, especially behind David,'' Els
said. ``I would like to think of myself as maybe No. 3 at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Els' victory was the sixth in his career on the PGA Tour. It was
worth $504,000.
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Riviera was redemption of a sort for Els, who in the
PGA Championship here in 1995 took a 3-stroke lead into the final
round, shot 72 and finished third behind Steve Elkington and Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around I played the fourth round better,'' Els said.
``I played the back nine the way it should be played. I guess the
golf course gave me something back today.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion, began the final round two
strokes behind Tryba and tied with Woods and Love for second. Duval
began play four strokes behind Tryba. Duval shot a 69, but never
threatened the lead. Woods shot a 70 and came to the 18th hole with
a chance to tie after Els had bogeyed the hole in front of him by
missing a 4-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   Into a stiff breeze, Woods drove the ball in the fairway, but he
lost his 5-iron approach shot to the right and the ball rolled down
behind a concession stand, effectively ending his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Els' move began at the sixth hole, where he made a 20-foot
birdie putt. He added another birdie at eight, then birdied 11, 12
and 13 to open a lead that he would not lose, although bogeys and
16 and 18 threatened his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing that 4-footer at 18 gave Tiger and Ted a chance,'' Els
said. ``I'm thankful that 18 was playing that hard. I've given
Tiger a chance or two in the past and he's taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, seventh in the world ranking entering the tournament, found
himself in the midst of a glamorous leader board that not only
included Woods and Duval, but Love and Nick Price as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, when you have players of that caliber in the field
and they're all playing well and you're in the middle of it and to
come out on top is very satisfying,'' Els said. ``The way the
leader board looked, I should have taken a picture of that. You
don't beat those guys very often. This will go down in my book as
one of the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, who established a course record with a 61 on Saturday,
was unable to maintain the momentum while playing in the final
group with Woods and Love. Still, he hung in gamely for a man
seeking only his second PGA Tour victory in seven-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed myself that when I'm playing well, I can play with
the best players in the world,'' he said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: INVESTIGATING KENNETH STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is said to be considering the
appointment of some kind of special investigative prosecutor to
look into charges of misconduct by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr. That is probably a good idea, provided that the inquiry is
independent of Ms. Reno. By blocking rigorous investigation of
President Clinton's fund-raising, she has shown that she cannot be
trusted by the American people to handle any matter touching on her
boss or his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, this means that the Justice Department's
Office of Professional Responsibility, which answers to Ms. Reno,
should not be used to examine whether Starr abused his
prosecutorial powers. What is needed is another independent counsel
from outside the Justice Department, who would, in effect, review
the work of the sitting independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be good to have the federal judges who supervise
Starr decide whether Ms. Reno has the legal authority to order such
an inquiry. The Independent Counsel Act says that she can dismiss
an independent counsel for cause, but does not specifically
authorize her to investigate a counsel's conduct. There is evidence
that Starr and his deputies may have improperly coerced witnesses
like Monica Lewinsky, secretly worked with lawyers for Paula Jones
and withheld possible conflicts of interest from the Justice
Department in seeking jurisdiction over the Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Reno's record clearly disqualifies her from being the
executive in charge of such an inquiry. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has already warned the
Justice Department about trying to run this investigation, and he
should move aggressively to expose any effort by Ms. Reno to take
it over. The law allows the attorney general to make the ultimate
decision as to whether any missteps made by Starr call for some
disciplinary action, ranging from a simple reprimand to removal.
But if the critical initial task of collecting and evaluating the
evidence is left to an experienced prosecutor outside of Ms. Reno's
authority, then the public may get what was never forthcoming in
the campaign-finance inquiry. That is a fair and unpoliticized
ruling from the attorney general.

DEVILS' ANDREYCHUK RETURNS A BIT RUSTY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Saturday night's game against the New York Islanders,
Dave Andreychuk laughed at talk that he was the answer to any
problems the New Jersey Devils were experiencing. There has been
speculation that the Devils are interested in making a trade to
bolster their offense for the post-season push, but the Devils hope
that, for now, the return of Andreychuk is enough.
</P>
<P>
   After 21 games on the sideline because of a fractured right
ankle, he made his return to action last Saturday and found himself
in front of the net flailing repeatedly at the puck on the
Continental Arena ice near where he had been injured. But
Andreychuk could not push the puck past Islanders goaltender Tommy
Salo and the Devils suffered an embarrassing home defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' difficulties scoring continued in the 3-2 loss, with
Andreychuk's return doing little to change their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But for Andreychuk, the good news was simply that he was back on
the ice after six weeks and made it through the game without
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shaky there in the first period,'' Andreychuk
said. ``I felt better as the game went on. I started making a few
more plays, making the right decisions. But I still had some
chances to win the game _ that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed. I could have been the difference in
the game. I come back, had some chances, could have won the game,
and I didn't. That's the disappointing part.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk played 20 shifts, totaling 16 minutes 44 seconds of
ice time. Though his play improved as the game went along, he is
well aware that it will take time to get his skills back to where
they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is other things you can add besides trying to
score goals,'' Andreychuk said. ``That's hopefully what I'm going
to bring, not just what happens on the ice. Still, I'm here to make
this team win by scoring some goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played well but could not put the Islanders away when
they had the opportunity. ``We didn't play for 60 minutes,''
Andreychuk said. ``That's the key. They've got good players and if
you're not on top of them, they're going to score.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andreychuk has rushed back, Patrik Elias was thrilled just
to be allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old left wing was a healthy scratch in two of the
last four games, including last Friday night's 3-1 loss at Detroit.
He scored a goal one minute into the Islander game and added an
assist. But he hardly seemed relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Elias felt that he was being singled out for blame in the team's
offensive struggles, believing that remarks by Devils coach Robbie
Ftorek, saying that only the hardest workers would play, seemed
directed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of pressure on myself because Robbie came in and
he said that he was only going to play the guys who work hard,''
Elias said. ``I think I worked hard before, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``After scratches this year, I feel different. I know that I'm
not producing as much as I can. I'm not happy with that either. I
have to just keep working hard, keep shooting, keep playing and try
to stay with it. I don't think it helps when if I don't get goals
in two games, I'll be scratched a game.'' &QL;

   While waiting at the corner of 59th Street and Third Avenue, I
realized that a cab was going to be more difficult to come by than
I'd anticipated. I was standing a few feet from the curb, partly in
the street but not too far out. My hand was raised way above my
head, waving ferociously, and although my attempts were
unsuccessful, determination and stubbornness kept the hand afloat.
</P>
<P>
   There I stood waving when all of a sudden out of nowhere this
guy came riding by on a bike. He reached up and smacked my hand and
gave me a loud ``Yeah, high five, lady.'' I began to smile and
before I knew it I was cracking up. A simple ``high five'' curbed
my irritation and altered my mood for the rest of the evening.

   A female colleague, looking for a new place to get a haircut,
recently asked me to survey some of my better-coiffed friends for a
recommendation. I dutifully sent off an e-mail to a friend and
asked her if she could pass along her hairdresser's name and
number. I had no idea how treacherous was the territory on which I
trod. Here is her response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know. This is the kind of information one
gives to one's closest, most intimate friend (as in maid of honor,
not bridesmaid). I don't even know this girl. The people that I
send to my guy are a direct reflection on me. I just need more
information. At most, with what I've got to work with, I can give
you two B-list people (they're both very good except that one is
more expensive, and the other I've never tried myself but have seen
his work on several others). If you personally guarantee this girl,
I'll give you The One. Men just don't know.''

performance of ``Death of a Salesman'' when he noticed Arthur
Miller, the playwright, sitting across the aisle taking notes.
Toward the end of the evening, there is a moment when the stage

wandered into the last gallery. There near one of the exhibits was
a crumpled figure on the floor, knees to his chest, head down, face
hidden. She stared for several minutes, as she had at each of
Hanson's creations.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of her contemplation, a young woman approached,
bent down and tickled the figure's neck. He sprang to his feet,
face beaming.

   Recently, my friends Ron and Polly were taking me out to a

destination has to be a surprise for the honoree. Ron drove us to
the Village and after circling numerous times without finding a
parking space, we decided to park several blocks away and walk.
</P>
<P>
   About two blocks from the restaurant, Polly asked a man at an
intersection, waiting for a light to change, how to get to Barrow
Street and whispered the name of the restaurant. Undoubtedly
thinking we were tourists, he led us there. Was this our first time
in the Village, he asked, and then, thinking we had taken a cab,
queried whether our driver spoke English. When we arrived at our
destination, we thanked him profusely.

CURTIS L. CARLSON, 84, FOUNDER OF INTERNATIONAL CONGLOMERATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis L. Carlson, who borrowed $55 from his landlord in 1938
and didn't look back until he had turned a fledgling grocery-store
trading-stamp company into one of the world's largest private
businesses, died on Friday at a hospital near his home in
Minneapolis. He was 84 and had been the sole owner of Carlson Cos.,
an international conglomerate with 150,000 employees and $20
billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For a corporation whose more than 100 separate companies include
the Radisson and Regent International hotel chains, TGI Friday's
and half a dozen other restaurant chains, several travel agencies,
a cruise line, the United States' largest marketing services
company, vast real estate holdings and a host of other operations
in 140 countries, the Carlson Cos. had distinctly humble
beginnings. So did Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, the son of a Swedish immigrant who became a
neighborhood grocer, had a childhood worthy of a Norman Rockwell
painting with highlights by John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   He was a golf caddy at 9, had his first newspaper route at 11
and quickly added two others. He also operated a newsstand at a
busy intersection, worked his way through college driving a
soft-drink truck and engaged in a little light loan sharking.
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise worthy of selling refrigerators to Eskimos,
Carlson as an 18-year-old summertime bank messenger would lend
cash-strapped tellers $5 on a Friday and collect $6 on payday the
following Monday, transactions whose three-day interest works out
to an annual percentage rate exceeding 2,400 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat redundantly studying economics at the University of
Minnesota, Carlson graduated in 1937 and went to work as a
$110-a-month soap salesman for Procter &AMP; Gamble. But he did not
stay there for long.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when some local department stores were seeking to
assure repeat business by giving customers Security Red trading
stamps, exchangeable for premiums, Carlson realized that such
stamps would be ideal for grocery stores, whose identical products
left them little room to distinguish themselves from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on his vision, Carlson created Gold Bond Stamp Co. in
1938, with a $55 loan _ and a bit of skulduggery: He paid a
department store secretary $10 for a copy of the Security Red Stamp
master contract, which became his blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that a grocer would pay Carlson $14.50 for stamps
that could be exchanged for products that cost $10 wholesale but
had a much higher retail value. That made the stamps attractive to
the grocer and to the store's customers, but not at first glance to
Carlson, whose $4.50 spread would barely cover costs and overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the business was that while the grocer would pay
for the stamps as they were issued, it might be months before
customers accumulated enough stamps to redeem them (a four-slice
toaster proved to be the most popular premium) and some would not
be redeemed at all, leaving Carlson with the float _ the use of the
money _ for other investments.
</P>
<P>
   The trick was to sell the program to enough stores to create a
sizable float. But as a salesman, Carlson _ who married his college
sweetheart, Arlene Martin, about the time he started the business _
was shameless. To draw attention to his program he had his wife
dress up in an eye-catching drum majorette uniform and march
through prospective stores extolling the glories of Gold Bond
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   By 1941, he had signed up 200 accounts, but shortages created by
World War II made sales incentives superfluous, and for a while he
had to take a job with his father-in-law's clothing business.
</P>
<P>
   Once the war was over in 1945, expansion came steadily. Indeed,
Gold Bond did well enough to finance a series of important
acquisitions. By 1962, the company had major investments in
suburban Minneapolis real estate, including the site of what became
its $300 million headquarters in Minnetonka, and acquired the
downtown Radisson Hotel, which rapidly expanded into a 350-hotel
chain.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the diversification, when the stamp business
began to decline in 1968, the company continued to thrive. It
changed its name to Carlson Cos. in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   According to company figures, annual revenue, which did not
reach $1 million until 1952, had climbed to $100 million by 1968,
reached $1 billion in 1976 and topped $10 billion in 1993, with
most of the growth resulting from a blistering pace of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acquired an 85-foot yacht, a luxurious hunting
lodge, a family compound at Lake Minnetonka and other trappings of
wealth, Carlson found nothing quite so much fun as business.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he became known as such a hands-on boss that his
executives made few major decisions, though they rarely complained.
He paid them so well (the top 25 getting new luxury cars every
year) that they were said to be bound to the company by golden
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Never tempted to sell stock to the public, Carlson took pains a
decade ago to keep his company private _ and in family hands _
after his death by placing all his businesses in a holding company,
which his two daughters, Marilyn Nelson and Barbara Gage, will now
jointly own. He also set up trusts to hold nonvoting stock for his
eight grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who is also survived by his wife, Arlene, and by a
brother, Warren, was so devoted to his business that after a brief
retirement and quadruple bypass heart surgery, he resumed control
in 1991 and continued to run the business until retiring again last
year in favor of his elder daughter, Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   A man who gave millions to the University of Minnesota and other
charities, Carlson insisted the lure of money was not what drove
him. ``You keep score with the money you make,'' he once said,
``but you've got to get a thrill out of doing something that
works.''

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE SUNDSTRAND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill.)   (ms) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Technologies Corp. is expected to announce as early as
Monday that it is buying Sundstrand Corp., an aerospace components
maker, in a deal valued at about $4 billion, people close to the
deal said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, if completed, would continue the consolidation
of the aerospace industry, which has come under pressure during the
decade as U.S. military spending has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrand would appear to fit in well with United Technologies,
an industrial conglomerate based in Hartford, Conn. United
Technologies already owns Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a leading maker of jet
aircraft engines. Sundstrand, based in Rockford, Ill., derives
about 60 percent of its $2 billion in revenues supplying various
equipment to aircraft manufacturers like the Boeing Co. and Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Although the terms of the deal were not available Sunday night,
United Technologies would appear to be ready to pay a premium of
roughly 25 percent for Sundstrand, which had a stock market value
of about $3.17 billion at the end of last week. Sundstrand's shares
jumped $6.375 on Friday, or 12.3 percent, to close at $58 on the
New York Stock Exchange following speculation about a possible deal
with either United Technologies or Allied Signal Inc.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies' shares also rose last Friday, gaining
$2.375, to close at $125.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies boards reportedly met over the
weekend to consider the proposed acquisition, and approval is
expected.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies makes a variety of products ranging from
Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators to Sikorsky
helicopters. Its Pratt &AMP; Whitney division competes with the General
Electric Co. and Rolls-Royce PLC. The company, which had revenues
of $25.72 billion last year, is considering selling its auto-parts
business.
</P>
<P>
   Along with aerospace parts, Sundstrand makes industrial
equipment, including pneumatic tools, pumps and air compressors, as
well as aerospace products.

COMMENTARY: ROOM APLENTY FOR SPRAWL IN SUBURBS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Urban sprawl has become a hot political issue, and it
is hard for New Yorkers not to take this personally. For decades,
the suburbs welcomed the city's huddled masses by turning open
space into homes. Now they're having a midlife crisis and suddenly
need their space. Was it something we said?
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps we shouldn't be so sensitive. Maybe the suburbanites
are just misguided. They've been confused by two alarms sounded by
Vice President Al Gore and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that vast amounts of land are being developed,
which is false. The second is that the resulting suburban
developments do not add to the sum of human happiness, which is
often true, but the reforms being advocated would probably only
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   The current furor is an updated version of the ``vanishing
farmland'' scare of the 1970s, which inspired headlines warning
that America would not be able to feed itself by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   The scare was set off by a report from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (which later repudiated the conclusions) wildly
overestimating how much farmland was being lost to development.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the farmland lost recently has not been sacrificed to
bulldozers. Three-quarters of it still is open space _ forests and
pastures, sometimes in private hands, sometimes in parks. Over the
last half-century, more open space has been turned into parks and
rural wildlife preserves than has been turned into suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, farmers have become so efficient on the remaining
farmland that they're growing twice as much food as in 1950, and
could easily grow much more if there were a market for it. But this
trend is being ignored by Gore, who has revived the old bogeyman by
warning that America could become a net importer of food if it
keeps sacrificing farmland.
</P>
<P>
   He and other leaders of the open-space crusade are fond of
telling audiences that 50 acres an hour are being lost to
developers. But this rate is actually much lower than it used to
be. Land was being developed at twice that rate during the 1980s,
and at four times that rate during the 1970s, according to Samuel
R. Staley, an urban economist who has done a study on sprawl for
the Reason Public Policy Institute, a research group in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   None of this development has significantly altered the ratio of
open space in the United States. In 1992, Staley points out, 95.3
percent of the land in America was undeveloped. Since then, as a
result of the 50 acres an hour being gobbled up by developers, the
ratio of open space has fallen to _ brace yourself _ 95.1 percent.
Even in New Jersey, the most built-up state, two-thirds of the land
is still undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open-space initiatives are solutions in search of a
problem,'' Staley said. ``Open space is a local issue in some
suburbs, not something that needs to be addressed at the national
or the state level. A county in northern New Jersey can decide how
much open space it wants. There's no reason for people in
California or southern New Jersey to help pay for the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing money to preserve open land, planners in
Washington and in state capitals are promoting rules for ``smart
growth'' _ or, as the Clinton administration calls its new program,
the Livability Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing the $10 billion program last month, Gore lamented
``decades of ill-planned and ill-coordinated development'' and
said, ``Plan well, and you have a community that nurtures commerce
and private life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with suburban development isn't a lack of
planning. The suburbs were planned all too well. With guidance and
money from Washington, experts built highways and wrote elaborate
zoning codes mandating single-family houses on half-acre lots in
strictly residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the resulting suburbs are deemed too diffuse and
sterile, today's planners want to impose a different set of rules
mandating dense development with a mix of houses, apartments,
stores and businesses. They want more compact and varied
communities, places that feel more like an old New York
neighborhood, or a Vermont village, or a small town in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But all those wonderful old communities have one thing in
common: They were built without the interference of urban planners
in state capitals and Washington. In those days, local officials,
builders and residents didn't need outside money or rigid zoning
codes. The only Livability Agenda they followed was their own.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sublimation, as Gustav Mahler repeatedly showed, can
be everything.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler was a bundle of neuroses and superstitions haunted by the
specter of death: his and others'. In 1904, as a father of two
young daughters and having already faced a death scare himself, he
completed the ``Kindertotenlieder'' (``Songs on the Death of
Children''), which were presented over the weekend in Lincoln
Center's New Visions series.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see this redirected response to one potential
tragedy as a premonition of another: the death of Mahler's older
daughter in 1907. (The poems, by Friedrich Rueckert, answered just
such a loss on his part.) But in fact the five songs here partake
of universal grief in just the way Schubert's (and Goethe's)
``Erlkoenig'' does.
</P>
<P>
   And when it came time to write a Ninth Symphony, matching the
fateful number achieved by Beethoven and Bruckner, Mahler dodged
artfully, conceiving instead a symphony of song, ``Das Lied von der
Erde'' (``The Song of the Earth''), which Kurt Masur and the New
York Philharmonic are currently performing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``Kindertotenlieder,'' this huge and exotic canvas,
completed in 1909, served to ennoble rather than betray the
composer's anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler finally did write a Ninth Symphony, of course, offering
valediction in terms as unmistakable as they are abstract. And
throughout his career he revealed much, but it is simply not true
that he ``let it all hang out,'' as the Stagebill notes for
``Kindertotenlieder'' suggest. That extreme was left to Robert
Lepage, who directed ``Kindertotenlieder'' at the John Jay College
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In this theatrical conceit, universal meaning is reduced to the
painfully particular, not to say trivial, as a singer prepares for
a performance of the work. The singer, it turns out, lost a
daughter four years before and is now 16 weeks pregnant. The
daughter appears in flashbacks, and the former husband returns to
whine self-importantly that the singer is sharing ``our grief''
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would all have made a stronger impression, on
Thursday evening, if it had been more sympathetically and ably
performed. Rebecca Blankenship sang in sounds breathily extruded
and swelled, which barely transcended the needs of musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the actors' speech was not acceptable even by theatrical
standards. Have actors, generally amplified to within an inch of
their lives these days, taken routinely to mumbling?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Suits, the pianist, on a 1904 Bechstein, supplied some
musical interest. Lincoln Center's New Visions series, which looked
so promising on paper, may yet afford valuable perspectives, but it
seems unlikely to do so by reducing timeless masterworks to
contemporary melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday
evening, was an altogether more conventional affair. Masur, like
some other German conductors, came to Mahler's music late, but he
appears intent on penetrating its depths. He showed a searching
temperament particularly in the symphonic interlude of the final
song, seeming almost to dismantle the music only to reassemble it
more compellingly.
</P>
<P>
   The singers, alas, both with lovely voices, were less
persuasive. Jennifer Larmore sang beautifully but did not project
strongly in the lower register, where, in Mahler, notes have to
roll and billow. Her final repetitions of ``ewig'' (``forever'')
hung on a slender but luminous thread. Richard Leech emitted
attractive tones and showed power at times, but more often seemed
overstressed by the weight of the music.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which will be heard again Tuesday, is filled out by
Gian Carlo Menotti's Violin Concerto, with Glenn Dicterow, the
Philharmonic's concertmaster, as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   This work, from 1952, is no neglected masterpiece, but it served
as a good vehicle for Dicterow. The spunky moments drew an
impassioned response from the violinist, though he didn't quite let
it all hang out, either, and like Mahler, benefited from that last
ounce of reticence.

`REALITY AT WORK' :  RAW PHYSICALITY FROM MIA MICHAELS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla. )   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The greatest pleasure of the program presented by Mia
Michaels and her RAW (Reality at Work) jazz-dance company on Friday
night at Playhouse 91 here was the go-for-broke physicality of the
choreography and its lack of assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Michaels and most of her performers have backgrounds in the
commercial dance of videos, industrial shows and television. That
world is seldom represented on New York dance stages, and the
commercialism of Ms. Michaels' four pieces was unfamiliar at first.
Eventually, however, one got used to not having to make an effort
to understand what was going on. The dispensation was enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Each dance had a theme, at least on paper. But the look was
similar: high-energy, thrusting, hurtling motion by tight-bodied
young dancers who had clearly spent time pumping iron. Ms. Michaels
is an extremely popular teacher in New York and in California and
Florida, and her choreography also looks fun though demanding to
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against the Current,'' set to music by Steve Reich and Albert
Sterling Menendez, introduced Ms. Michaels' vocabulary, a mix of
jazz dance, acrobatics, martial arts and robotic street dance for
ballet-trained bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Six women clung together in a taut cluster, separating and
regrouping, in ``Jacob's Well,'' danced to music by Menendez and
Sweet Honey in the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Michael's new ``00101.com,'' to music by M. Behrens, was an
ingenious piece for four video-game figures (Mark Meismer, Ronnie
Todorowski, Tiffany Tregarthen and Julia Wyda). The excerpts from
``No Strings Attached,'' set to music by Menendez, were a primer on
the slamming mating rituals of youthful millennialists.
</P>
<P>
   The company was completed by Jason Parsons, Corinne McFadden,
Ioana Alfonso, Shawnda James, Ariel Osterweis and Daniella
Cavaleri.
</P>
<P>
   Though grunts, shrieks and male jazz-warrior grimaces were part
of the show, Parsons' facial expressions detracted from the
intelligence of his dancing.

ENJOY THE MOMENT WINS FOR PINCAY, SPAWR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- There was a celebration of Chinese New Year's at
Santa Anita Sunday and trainer Bill Spawr was enjoying the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   After all it was his filly, Enjoy the Moment, that went wire to
wire with jockey Laffit Pincay for the win in the $125,000 Grade
III Las Flores Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Closed Escrow and Stop Traffic, both of which finished ahead of
Enjoy the Moment in the Grade I Santa Monica Handicap last month,
were left in the dust in Sunday's 6-furlong sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Spawr's filly earned a $78,720 purse with the win and paid
bettors $6.40, $4.60 and $4.80. Longshot Tomorrows Sunshine
finished second and paid $12.60 and $6.60.
</P>
<P>
   Closed Escrow took the show spot and paid $5.
</P>
<P>
   Although Enjoy the Moment has now won six races in nine starts,
Spawr has worried about the filly's health in light of some lung
problems. After Enjoy the Moment finished fourth last May at
Hollywood Park, it became obvious there was a significant problem.
</P>
<P>
   `She has some lung problems, but she's a very good filly,` he
said. `That day she was fourth, she was almost trying to pass out,
but today she was back to herself.` Pincay, whose share of winning
mounts is dwindling as he ages, also gets some credit for the win,
Spawr said.
</P>
<P>
   Some horse men have lost confidence in Pincay, `But, he's the
same for me,` Spawr said. `If his horse has a chance he's the best.
We're not like close friends, but I respect him as an athlete and I
respect him as a great rider.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay gave credit to Enjoy the Moment.
</P>
<P>
   `Today is the best she's ever worked,` he said. `She fools you
because she's unbelievably fast. She was just very powerful today
and she's a nice filly.` The win was Pincay's 240th stakes victory
at Santa Anita. Bill Shoemaker holds the record with 260 stakes
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Spawr said he plans to stretch the filly, running her ina route
soon.
</P>
<P>
   `She'll go a mile, and I'm sure she'll be in front, He said. `I
really want to run her a mile.`
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Jockey David Flores had three winners Saturday pulling to
within seven of Alex Soils in the standings, 42-35. His three wins
included rides aboard Winninginexcess, Hilltown and Controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The win aboard Controlled was a sort of fluke though. Flores was
sitting in for regular rider Gary Stevens, who was in New Orleans
Saturday riding Eclipse Award-winner Silverbulletday to a win in
the Grade III Davona Dale Stakes...
</P>
<P>
   ... on Sunday, Flores picked up right where he left off, winning
in third race aboard Cozy Spell. But Solis held him off with a win
in the seventh aboard Generally On.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Solis was still in the lead 43-36.
</P>
<P>
   BOX What did the nine horse in the seventh race and the one
horse in the ninth have in common Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   As handicapper Mike Superstein pointed out, the pair are full
brother and sister. As We Know It, a 3-year-old gelding entered in
the seventh race, finished out of the money.
</P>
<P>
   His big sister, Ticklish Issue, a 5-year-old mare finished third
in the ninth and paid bettors $3.20
</P>
<P>
   BOX Dome Thrice, the longest shot on the board in the ninth race
Sunday found the winner's circle in his 6 1/2 furlong race.
</P>
<P>
   For those taking a chance, Dome Thrice paid $154.60, $53.60 and
$18.20. That was the biggest payout of the meet so far ...
</P>
<P>
   ... Some lucky bettor hit the10th race superfecta with a $39
ticket and won $187,651.20. The winning combination was 10-5-1-11.

   RAMBOUILLET, France _ As the Western allies try to force
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept an imposed settlement for
Kosovo, a rift is opening between the United States and the rest of
the Contact Group on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The group, consisting of the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia, has given the warring factions in Kosovo
until 3 p.m. local time, Tuesday (9 a.m. EST) to reach a settlement
to end the fighting that has killed 2,000 people in the past year
and that threatens to further destabilize the perpetually fractious
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But dissension between the Americans and the rest of the Contact
Group surfaced, as the six nations tried to put the best spin
possible on their decision to extend by three days the Saturday
deadline they had imposed on the ethnic Albanians and Serbs three
weeks ago. NATO air raids had been threatened if the deadline was
missed.
</P>
<P>
   While the Europeans and Russians took a more neutral stance,
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright appeared to praise the
ethnic Albanian delegation for a willingness to compromise, and to
accuse the Serbs of being obstinate. Albright said she had gone
along reluctantly with an extension only because the Albanians were
being flexible.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs refuse to accept the 30,000 NATO ground troops that
the Contact Group says will be necessary to keep the warring
factions apart while the settlement, which gives the Albanians of
Kosovomore autonomy, is implemented. The Albanians are balking at
the lack of a guarantee of a referendum on independence after three
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Europeans merely reminded the Serbs that NATO strikes
against Serbian military targets remain an option, Albright used
more hawkish language, singling out Milosevic and warning him that
it was time to ``wake up and smell the coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters after Albright spoke, a senior US official
was even more blunt, saying that if Albanians accept a settlement
but the Serbs refuse to sign up, NATO will bomb the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   More stealth jets and other military aircraft flew Sunday into
the US base in Aviano, Italy. The military planes brought to
approximately 130 the number of NATO aircraft on the base.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, long the Serbs' only allies in the Contact Group,
have consistently said that using force against the Serbs to impose
a settlement in Kosovo is wrong. And on Saturday night, some of the
European foreign ministers publicly distanced themselves from what
they considered Albright's more one-sided comments.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuking Albright, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
it was wrong to blame the Serbs for the failure to meet Saturday's
deadline. Speaking privately, some European diplomats said they
were disappointed by Albright's saber-rattling, saying it was
unhelpful when negotiations were at such a sensitive stage.
</P>
<P>
   US officials were unapologetic about the hard line. When asked
about Russian reservations about using force, a senior US official
replied dismissively, ``The Russians are prepared to accept
whatever the Serbs ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift over how to get a settlement and what to do if the
talks collapse highlights the fundamental difference between US
foreign policy and that of the European powers. While Britain tends
to support Washington the most often and most vocally, the French,
Germans and Italians are more skeptical of US policy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine,
complained about the United States being a ``hyperpower.'' Vedrine
said US dominance in military, economic and political power has
created an imbalance as potentially destablizing as the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The French say they think the Americans are arrogant when it
comes to finding solutions as politically sensitive as Kosovo.
Vedrine's theory is gaining currency as more Europeans complain
about what they see as the American propensity to rely on gunboat
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are too ready to bomb when the real question is,
what do you do after the bombing,'' a European diplomat said when
the talks here convened two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of the diplomats interviewed insisted on being identified
only as European diplomats, not as French, British or Italian. Some
spoke only on the condition that their comments be considered
``deep background,'' and not be printed. They say they do not want
to provoke open feuding between the allies. But they also want
their American colleagues to be aware that, as one European
diplomat put it, the Contact Group is a partnership where all
partners are equal.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans agree with the Americans that Milosevic cannot be
allowed to massacre ethnic Albanians with impunity in a
scorched-earth policy aimed at drying up support for Kosovo
Liberation Army separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans appear to be more skeptical about the wisdom
of bombing Serbian targets. They fear the strikes could only boost
Milosevic, who has used Western attacks on his regime to exploit
nationalist sentiment. The Europeans also fear that such strikes
would allow the rebels in the Kosovo Liberation Army to seize even
more territory in the Serbian province and embolden them to step up
their fight for independence, which none in the Contact Group
support.
</P>
<P>
   US officials acknowledge that bombing the Serbs could
unintentionally help the rebels militarily and Milosevic
politically, but they are resolute in their belief that Milosevic
has to be punished militarily if the talks collapse because of his
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were predicting here Sunday that there would be no
breakthrough in the talks before Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going down to the wire,'' a US official said.

INDIA, PAKISTAN PREPARE TO MOVE BEYOND ENMITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ India and Pakistan, bitter neighbors who
battled three wars since 1947 and who proved their nuclear might
last year, inched toward peace Sunday, vowing to reduce the risk of
accidental war and to liberalize travel and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani leader
Nawaz Sharif hailed the three declarations signed during Vajpayee's
27-hour visit here as evidence that the longtime adversaries are
ready at last to move beyond half a century of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change your friends, but you can never change your
neighbors,'' Vajpayee said, speaking in Hindi to the two countries'
governing elite on the vast lawn of the Punjab state governor's
mansion. ``The enmity has gone on for so long. Isn't it time to
give friendship a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to move beyond symbolism,'' Sharif said.
Both leaders share ``an earnest desire to avoid an arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides pledged to give each other advance notice of
ballistic missile tests; notify of ``accidental, unauthorized or
unexplained'' use of nuclear weapons; establish a hot line to
reduce the risk of nuclear war, and develop ``confidence-building''
measures to avert conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant declaration in the history of the
two countries,'' Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad said
in an interview. He said the two sides agreed to discuss how many
and what types of warheads they have, and how they are deployed.
Analysts believe both sides have missiles that could carry nuclear
warheads across the border in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond those few specifics, the joint statements were thick
on feel-good language and thin on concrete plans. Conspicuously
absent was any resolution on the core issue dividing the two
nations, the 52-year-old fight over the disputed Himalayan
territory of Kashmir, a low-level military conflict that has
claimed as many as 25,000 lives in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss the summit as smiles and symbolism
without substance. But the very fact that old enemies are trying to
make peace just nine months after tit-for-tat nuclear tests is
extraordinary, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for foreigners to understand how deep the distrust
lies between India and Pakistan, whose bloody partition in 1947
cost 1 million lives and created millions more refugees. It is no
small risk for Vajpayee and Sharif, who both lead conservative,
religious-based parties, to compromise, especially on the
emotionally charged issue of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that
borders China and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the signed pledges to end differences represent
a meaningful step toward peace, officials on both sides insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of taking 28 years as it did for the US and USSR to
set up a nuclear risk-reduction center, or 13 years for them to set
up a hot line, look what we have done in less than 12 months,''
Rakesh Sood, India's joint secretary for disarmament and
international security affairs, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee Sunday took the symbolic step of visiting the
Minar-i-Pakistan, an Eiffel Tower-like monument that commemorates
the 1940 declaration demanding an independent homeland of Pakistan
for India's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee said some aides advised him not to go there, ``because
it would constitute a stamp of recognition. But I went anyway. I
feel Pakistan has its own stamp. This Minar reminds us we should
live together as good neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here voiced elation at the gesture, saying it showed
tremendous good will on the part of a lifelong Hindu nationalist.
``His government has faced Pakistan's legitimate right to exist,''
said Nazir Naji, chairman of the Pakistan Academy of Letters.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's trip, the first by an Indian leader in a decade, was
the maiden journey of the first bus service between the two
countries. He recalled that he at first had intended to reach the
border and turn back, but Sharif told him, ``No, how can you just
come to the door? You must enter the house.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two neighbors pledged to liberalize visa and travel
restrictions between them and resolve cases of detainees and
missing POWs. A top Indian official said a loosening of rules that
force visitors to report to police on either side will be announced
within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Indians and Pakistanis favor peace, but
fundamentalist groups on both sides have tried to thwart diplomatic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line anti-Indian Muslim activists tried to disrupt the
visit as they had on Saturday, when one officer was killed here and
at least 100 people were injured in demonstrations, according to
local news reports. Second-day protests were smaller, and police
quelled them with tear gas and batons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone can be happy about everything,'' said Miraj
Khalid, a former prime minister of Pakistan. ``But Jamaat-i-Islam
is the only group in Pakistan that has come to demonstrate against
this. And that is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   That a leader from a Hindu nationalist party and the head of a
Muslim party are taking steps to peace that their more liberal and
secular predecessors could not achieve is interesting, analysts
say. Vajpayee leads a shaky coalition that includes anti-Muslims,
and Sharif faces opposition from his military and ruling elite for
being ``soft'' on India.
</P>
<P>
   Eqbal Ahmad, a columnist for the Pakistani newspaper ``Dawn,''
compared Vajpayee and Sharif to conservative leaders in history who
achieved unexpected results: France's Charles de Gaulle dismantled
an empire in Africa, and Richard Nixon established ties with
communist China.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan agreed not to conduct further nuclear tests
``unless either side, in exercise of its national sovereignty,
decides that extraordinary events have jeopardized its supreme
interest.''

`KARIA MATTILA': A LYRIC SOPRANO SHOWS HER COLORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Finland)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some voices are cherishable because they so
completely define a particular vocal category. But others excite us
because they seem to transcend all the categories, like that of the
Finnish soprano Karita Mattila, who made her Carnegie Hall recital
debut on Friday night, with the elegant pianist Ilmo Ranta, her
frequent collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mattila began her career as a bright-toned lyric soprano.
Over the years, her voice, while retaining it lyric cast, has grown
naturally in power and resonance. At 38, she is now in her
thrilling prime. As Wagner's Elsa and Verdi's Amelia at the
Metropolitan Opera this season, she sang with an unforced, focused
radiance that many a dramatic soprano would covet, yet with no
sacrifice of lyric colors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mattila also transcends assumed national characteristics.
Her singing has a gleaming quality and a spareness of vibrato that
recall cooler Nordic voices, like Birgit Nilsson's. Yet her sound
is meltingly warm and plaintive.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a strikingly beautiful, blond diva who, for this
important occasion, indulged herself in an outfit that could steal
an Oscar telecast: over a black pants suit she wore an almost
blindingly bright gold-sequined cape. Yet she is a keenly
intelligent musician and her program was challenging.
</P>
<P>
   She began with Schubert's unusual setting of a text by the
librettist Metastasio, ``Vedi quanto adoro,'' something the
struggling composer no doubt felt compelled to write to advertise
his ability at Italian opera, then the rage in Vienna. Next came
three of Mahler's early ``Lieder und Gesaenge,'' impressive for the
spun-silk elegance with which Ms. Mattila shaped the music's
wistful phrases.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Runopolku,'' a set of six songs by the 42-year-old Finnish
composer Jouni Kaipainen on texts of Lauri Otonkoski, Ms. Mattila's
performance was boldly theatrical, complete with spotlights and
props. During the first song, she walked about the back of the
stage, then deposited her cape tellingly on a chair placed far to
the right. However, she sang the remaining songs near the piano at
a music stand, a move that rather undermined the dramatic effect
she was after.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kaipainen's songs, which ruminate on various creative and
emotional aspects of a poet's life, are rueful and skillfully
wrought, and were ideally suited to Ms. Mattila's voice.
</P>
<P>
   The second half (for which Ms. Mattila changed into a sleek
maroon dress, a fact she surely would want reported) began with
Berg's ``Sieben fruehe Lieder,'' fascinating songs that the
composer wrote when young, then revised extensively in maturity.
Ms. Mattila's performance was utterly compelling. What a Marie in
``Wozzeck'' she would be!
</P>
<P>
   The concert concluded with four Strauss songs, including the
familiar ``Cacilie,'' in which Ms. Mattila called upon the full
operatic resources of her voice.
</P>
<P>
   There were encores by Strauss and Sibelius, a Finnish folk song
and, finally, the last phrase of Bernstein's ``Tonight'' as
performed as the ultimate diva farewell. ``Sleep well, and when you
dream, dream of me,'' Ms. Mattila sang, holding the final high note
as she sauntered off stage waving. Chances are many in her audience
did just that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When LuAnne Borzych filed a sexual harassment
charge last year with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
against a shipping company in Orlando, Fla., her complaint might
have disappeared into the commission like so many others in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the commission's branch office in Miami
suggested last April that Ms. Borzych and her employer submit their
dispute to official mediation. They agreed that if they reached a
settlement, the matter would not go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before a mediator trained in discrimination law took
one day and involved no lawyers. And while the small cash
settlement she received was not all that Ms. Borzych had hoped for,
she pronounced herself satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady that took care of the case was extremely good at what
she was doing,'' Ms. Borzych, 38, said in a telephone interview.
``She made me understand it on my level, everything that was being
said. She didn't guide me or direct me. I have to say I was
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borzych's experience illustrates what has been a striking
change in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency
that has long been considered one of the most troubled and
ineffective in the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was an agency that barely got around to
investigating complaints of discrimination, let alone taking action
against companies that engaged in biased practices. The best that
people who filed charges could hope for was that after 180 days of
sitting on the complaint, the agency would grant permission to sue
the company in court _ a right the accuser already had.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the agency has more than halved its
backlog of pending cases, from a high of 111,451 in June 1995 to
slightly more than 52,000 today. In recent years it has won large
class-action discrimination cases against Mitsubishi Corp. and
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Congress increased its budget to $279 million for 1999, $37
million more than it received last year and the agency's first
increase in years. And even some critics among civil rights groups
and plaintiffs' lawyers have resumed recommending that people who
believe they are victims of bias on the job file complaints with
the agency. That is a marked change from the last years of the Bush
administration, when some of these lawyers told clients not to
bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying we are thrilled with the state of the
commission in 1999,'' said Nancy Kreiter, an official with Woman
Employed, a civil rights organization based in Chicago. ``But
relative to the totally broken agency that it was,'' said Ms.
Kreiter, who has been one of the agency's harshest critics, ``it
has been mended and put back together and is on its way to being a
fully functioning enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect, of course. The agency still takes an average
of 276 days to adjudicate a complaint, nowhere near the goal of
fewer than 120 days that its new chairwoman, Ida Castro, has set.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Castro's predecessor, Gilbert Casellas, said too many
lawyers in the agency's field offices still filed frivolous and
poorly thought-out class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got too many cowboys out there who want notches on their
belts,'' he said. ``Everybody's looking for the next Mitsubishi.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the commission's resurrection has gone to
Casellas, who presided over an overhaul beginning about five years
ago to bring down the backlog, promoted alternative ways to resolve
disputes, including mediation and arbitration, and looked to file
high-profile lawsuits against companies in order to jolt other
companies into becoming aware of the practices that often spawned
discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups were able to pressure the
Republican-controlled Congress into providing more money for the
agency by asserting that it was hypocritical for conservative
opponents of affirmative action to say that all that was needed to
help minorities and women was the strict enforcement of anti-bias
laws, and then not to increase financing for agencies like the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   And some labor experts say the thriving economy has also helped,
since accusations of bias often proliferate when companies are
laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot mediation program that handled Ms. Borzych's case was
begun two years ago during Casellas' tenure. In 1997, the program
won $10.8 million in settlements for 780 people. Last year, $17
million in settlements was awarded to 1,500 people. With a bigger
budget, the agency is planning to expand the program, with a goal
of 8,000 settlements in the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro, chairwoman of the commission since the fall, hopes
that by diverting more cases into mediation, ``we can invest our
resources to go after the really bad actors, those companies that
simply refuse to adhere to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Castro said the agency would have more time and
money for cases that will help clarify and establish precedents in
federal employment discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   That the agency is being looked on more favorably is, to some in
the field, nothing short of amazing. Begun in 1965 to handle
complaints of job discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
national origin and age (disability was added later), the agency
has always been a bureaucratic mess. Unlike other regulatory
agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, it has never had the resources
or management talent to prevent the complaints filed with it
annually from piling up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deals with real people as opposed to other regulatory
agencies that deal with industries where there are big dollars at
stake,'' said Lawrence Lorber, a lawyer who represents large
corporations in discrimination disputes. ``So there is an
institutional interest _ whether people like them or not _ to have
those agencies work well. You've never had that with the EEOC.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The backlog grew significantly when Justice Clarence Thomas of
the Supreme Court was chairman in the 1980s. Thomas believed that
each complaint, no matter how seemingly trivial, should be fully
investigated. The number grew even more in the 1990s under Evan
Kemp, whose tenure as chairman coincided with the passage of the
Americans With Disabilities Act, which expanded the agency's
responsibilities. The act made it unlawful to discriminate against
people with physical and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency drifted without leadership in the first years of the
Clinton Administration. Casellas, Clinton's first appointed
chairman, did not take over until October 1994. Five weeks later
the Republicans took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching strategy was to get the backlog down, keep the
Republicans in Congress engaged and committed and show them that I
wasn't a firebrand,'' said Casellas, who is now in private
business.
</P>
<P>
   He instituted a system of triage both for pending cases and new
complaints. Investigators would look at the complaints and urge
those filing them to submit them first to binding arbitration, and
later, when money became available for the pilot program, to
mediation. People were urged to drop those complaints that looked
like they had little or no merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it was clearing out the junk in the system, and more
carefully screening the incoming cases,'' Casellas said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also began holding seminars with businesses to
explain the intricacies of federal employment discrimination law.
The view was that if businesses were more familiar with the law,
they would take fewer actions that might result in complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the agency vigorously pursued a series of
high-profile class-action discrimination lawsuits that got the
attention of many large corporations. It negotiated a $34 million
settlement in a sexual harassment suit against Mitsubishi Motor
Corp.'s American subsidiary last year, and a $183 million
settlement in 1997 in an age discrimination complaint that had been
filed against Lockheed Martin's predecessor, Martin Marietta.

WHO'S NO. 1? IT JUST GOT TOUGHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casual as could be came parting words and a battle
joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you next week, man,'' Tiger Woods, walking out of the
scorer's tent beside Riviera Country Club's 18th green, said
breezily to Ernie Els, the new Nissan Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   And he (begin ital)will(end ital) see him next week. And the
week after that. And the week after that.
</P>
<P>
   Els, of Fancourt, South Africa, and Orlando, Fla., has indicated
he'll play his fullest PGA Tour schedule ever in 1999. And by
rallying from three strokes down Sunday to beat Woods and leave
David Duval in the swirling dust, the one-time top-ranked golfer in
the world showed he's back in the battle for that title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think of myself as No. 3 at this moment,'' the
29-year-old said after winning in his first PGA Tour event of the
season. But he was just being humble.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Nissan demonstrated that the ``Who's No. 1?''
question is going to get harder before it gets easier.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan and Riviera were hoping for a definitive duel between
Woods, officially No. 1 at the start of the week, and Duval,
officially No. 2 and recognized as the world's hottest golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Duval left his charge too late, the duel that
materialized was Woods vs. Els. Third-round leader Ted Tryba hung
tough, going to the 18th hole in a tie with Woods a stroke behind
Els, but Tryba was an extra in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   After Tryba yanked his approach shot onto an embankment,
practically killing his chance for a tying birdie, Woods pushed a
5-iron from 179 yards into the crowd to the right of the green and
watched the ball carom into a beer tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd seen Ted's and Davis' (Love III) approaches go left, so I
thought I should go for the right side of the green and be
aggressive,'' Woods said of the 5-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Woods needed to hole a blind wedge shot to force a playoff. It
stopped 20 feet from the flag. Tryba needed to chip in. He came up
short.
</P>
<P>
   Watching in the scorer's tent, Els broke into a grin, unfolded
his arms and sealed the victory by kissing his wife of two months.
</P>
<P>
   On the grass outside, a calligrapher with a huge black pen knelt
to etch Els' name on the 4-by-2-foot winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger had taken his best shots _ a booming drive into the wind
and a go-for-broke iron _ and finished with a 70. Els, playing in
the group ahead, had struggled with the wind, bogeying once early
and once late _ when bunkers got in his way _ and prevailed with
his second straight 68 on a day of hard greens, pin placements and
wind.
</P>
<P>
   They'd started the day tied with Love, two strokes behind Tryba.
And Duval, capable of anything, had loomed two strokes farther
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have players of that caliber in the field, and
they're all playing well and going for the championship, and you're
in the middle of it . . . coming out on top must be very satisfying
to say the least,'' said Els, who began the week ranked seventh in
the world and ended it with a bullet. ``This will go down in my
book as one of the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy to tab each successive PGA Tour winner as the new
_ or next _ No. 1. So hold off on crowning Ernie Els just because
his record for the year now reads 1 tournament, 1 victory and
$504,000 in earnings _ not a bad average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say Ernie is No. 1 because he won this
week, or Tiger is No. 1 because he won last week,'' Tryba said,
looking up at the situation.
</P>
<P>
   But don't leave Ernie out of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   After his second U.S. Open victory gave him a brief hold on No.
1 in 1997, Els had a down year in '98, losing most of the second
half of the season to back spasms. The former junior tennis and
cricket player didn't play a PGA Tour event after September.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped behind Woods, Duval, Love, Mark O'Meara, Lee Westwood
and Colin Montgomerie on the world list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve everything they get, those guys. They've played
their way to the top. I wasn't playing very well at the end of last
year. And that's that,'' Els said, not forcing the issue. ``Your
golf game talks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   His back is healthy now, and his game is talking loud and clear.
Els and his golf teacher Robert Baker tinkered with his swing in
December, instead of waiting until February as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm better prepared this year,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   And a prepared Ernie is a dangerous Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   They'll all see him next week. And the week after that and the
week after that. Probably at the 18th, with the tournament and the
No. 1 ranking on the line. &QL;

IT'S WOUNDED, BUT NOT DEAD  
 D-BACKS DEAL ON LIFE-SUPPORT

<P>
   TUCSON _ When the sun came up on Sunday, the Diamondbacks
thought it would be only a short time before their trade of
outfielder Bernard Gilkey and cash to Pittsburgh for
infielder-outfielder Tony Womack and outfielder Al Martin would be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the patient began to develop complications. The Pirates
were getting cold feet _ cold enough for a toe tag.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day began to fade to dusk, and the deal appeared
headed for the morgue, the Diamondbacks were like the crew on
``ER,'' feverishly attempting to administer CPR.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing still has a pulse,'' said Diamondbacks General
Manager Joe Garagiola late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Pirates GM Cam Bonifay said, ``It does not
appear that the deal is going to happen. I'm not going to
characterize the the talks as ongoing, but it's not dead, either. I
wouldn't say anything is totally dead. But unless the Diamondbacks
come up with something drastic . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Drastic would mean a better way of handling the remainder of
Gilkey's contract, which is due to pay him $5 million in each of
the next two seasons, a $1 million buyout for the 2001 season and
an annuity that would net him $1 million a year for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates don't want to be caught holding the bag for a large
part of the annuity, which came as part of the contract Gilkey
signed with the New York Mets after the 1996 season. The Mets
traded Gilkey and right-hander Nelson Figueroa to the Diamondbacks
on July 31 for right-hander Willie Blair and catcher Jorge
Fabregas.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates originally had asked for another player in the early
stages of the trade talks, either right-hander Ben Ford or one of
the Diamondbacks' other top minor-league pitchers. The Diamondbacks
said no, although speculation surfaced that Pittsburgh was again
asking for another player on Sunday. Both sides denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach that we had hoped at the start of the day would
work after the Pirates had a chance to look at it, Kevin McClatchy
(owner) in particular, didn't work for them,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alternate approach, which I think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not elaborate, although it is likely that the
Diamondbacks are attempting to restructure Gilkey's contract to
greatly reduce the length of the 25-year deferment.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor slowing the deal is the fact that Bonifay has to
run details past McClatchy, who is in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deals sometimes are difficult to put together,'' Garagiola
said. ``You keep trying combinations and find one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo remained
optimistic that the deal could be completed today after approval by
the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, again, we think we have a deal in place,
subject to McClatchy agreeing to it,'' Colangelo said. ``We think
we've addressed the deferred payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola had hoped the deal could be finalized so the players
involved wouldn't have to go through an uncomfortable period of
being with their original club for a few days and then having to
pack their belongings for a trip to their new club.
</P>
<P>
   So, that means Gilkey will report today to Tucson Electric Park
with the Diamondbacks' other position players and begin workouts on
Tuesday. Pirates players report Tuesday and begin workouts
Wednesday in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey's No. 23 hung in his cubicle Sunday, and his car was
delivered from his home in St. Louis a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few weeks ago that Gilkey began hearing his name
mentioned seriously as part of a trade. He spoke with Manager Buck
Showalter, who acknowledged the possibility, but added that he told
Gilkey that nothing might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a part of the game. There's no surprise. Players are
talked about every day,'' Showalter said. ``I'll talk to Bernard
again when he gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Gilkey played in 29 games for Arizona, starting
26 in left field, and hit .248 with one home run and five RBIs.
During the final week of the season, he elected to have corrective
laser surgery on both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Barring setbacks during the spring, if the trade doesn't go
through he is expected to be the starting right fielder, with Luis
Gonzalez taking over in left.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade happens, Womack is the likely starter in right and
would be a virtual lock to be the Diamondbacks' leadoff man. &QL;

CASH DOESN'T AFFECT DAAL'S PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, ARIZ. - The Diamondbacks player whose career has changed
the most since the club last got together for spring training is
pitcher Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Daal came to camp last spring simply scratching for a chance to
land one of the bullpen spots. When all was said and done, Daal and
Andy Benes stood out as the Diamondbacks' most consistent starters.
</P>
<P>
   The front office was so impressed with what it saw in the
left-hander that it signed Daal to a two-year contract worth $6
million. It also includes a third option year that will fill Daal's
bank account with an additional $5.5 million if he meets certain
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   All Daal has to do for that third year to automatically kick in
is start at least 23 games, the number he started last season, in
each of the first two seasons. It's quite a jump from someone who'd
never been paid more than the $575,000 he earned last year.
</P>
<P>
   Unless last season was a fluke, Daal will be a very rich man
after these next three years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most amazing aspects to the Daal saga is his
incredibly fresh attitude. This is not a player who walks around
ready to place his career on cruise control. He's very humble about
his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so appreciative of what the club has done for me and my
family,'' said Daal, whose 2.88 ERA ranked behind only Greg Maddux,
Kevin Brown, Al Leiter and Tom Glavine in the National League.
``Now I want to prove to them that they did not make a mistake. I
love the Diamondbacks. They have treated me wonderfully. Now it's
my turn to show them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of demeanor that can't help but ingratiate the
native Venezuelan to Valley baseball fans. It's also the type of
attitude that many fans wish more players took to heart. He's the
kind of player baseball should be pushing to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar is a guy you can trust with a contract,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``He's a guy you pull for. He's the same guy today
as the one who walked through the door a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal may be to the Diamondbacks what Vinny Castilla has become
to the Colorado Rockies. Castilla came out of nowhere to become an
All-Star third baseman after the Rockies took him from Atlanta's
list of unprotected players in the 1992 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   After being bypassed in the first round of the 1997 expansion
draft, Daal was snagged by the Diamondbacks in the second round,
meaning Toronto didn't even bother to pull him back as one of their
top 18 players.
</P>
<P>
   If Daal has, indeed, taken that step in his career from
journeyman to front-line starter, then expect the Blue Jays to be
kicking themselves for years.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Daal is in an unfamiliar role this spring. He has
never come to a big league camp with a job tucked away in his back
pocket. He's always been one of the low men on any club's totem
pole.
</P>
<P>
   The question that begs to be asked is how Daal will handle his
sudden comfort level. For those of you following the theme here,
the answer will not come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't change the way I approach spring training,'' Daal
said. ``Just because I have a spot in the rotation makes no
difference to me. There are a lot of pitchers behind you wanting
the same spot. You have to stay ahead of them always.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case he starts derailing from his track, Daal has a
built-in safety net. Veteran starters Benes, Randy Johnson and Todd
Stottlemyre will not allow one of their own to venture too far off.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Daal offered a glimpse of what he is capable of
doing. This season can be his coming-out party _ at least that's
what he and the Diamondbacks are counting on. &QL;

TRYBA SHOWS HE BELONGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some of the top players in the world crumbled as
Riviera Country Club finally flexed its muscles, but Ted Tryba took
its best shots and kept coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, who has just one PGA Tour victory, the 1995 Anheuser
Busch Classic, since turning pro in 1989, held his own against some
of the sport's elite and finished in a three-way tie for second
place, two shots behind winner Ernie Els in the $2.8 million Nissan
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, who set a Riviera course record on Saturday with a
brilliant, 10-under-par 61 and led by two strokes entering Sunday's
final round, had a 1-over 72 in blustery conditions. The
32-year-old, however, was far from disappointed. The prospects of
playing in Sunday's final group with Tiger Woods and Davis Love III
might have appeared intimidating to some, but Tryba said he looked
forward to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He said he needed it to prove to himself he belonged out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big for me,'' Tryba said of the group. ``I really
enjoyed being out there with those guys. They're both great guys
and true sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all tried really hard out there and we all had our chances.
We all got it going a little bit, but Ernie prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba's second-place check of $209,067 surpassed his first-place
winnings of $198,000 in the Anheuser Busch Classic. It also was his
best finish since he took second behind Hal Sutton in the 1995 Walt
Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba's name never has been mentioned among the game's best. He
even might be considered as nothing more than a journeyman, but
there was an unusual grittiness to his game on a day when good
scores were at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   He called the final round a test of not only his resolve but for
the rest of the field. He started with a birdie on the par-5,
503-yard first hole but bogeyed two of his final five holes on the
front nine and eventually lost the lead to Els at the 12th hole,
when he three-putted for bogey. Els, playing one group ahead,
birdied from five feet.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba also bogeyed three of his last seven holes, including one
on the par-4, 451-yard 18th hole when he left his approach shot
short and left of the green. He missed a 10-footer for par that
would have given him second place to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought today's round played a lot tougher than the previous
three days,'' he said. ``The pins were tucked, the greens were
firmer and the wind was blowing. I think those three factors made
it three times as difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a lot of guys make a move. Riviera was here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   And so was Tryba, whose name remained on the leaderboard all
afternoon, right next to Els, Love and Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some pretty big names up there... all the guys
played really well,'' he said. ``But the bottom line is I don't
care who's up there. If I'm going to try to win, I don't care whose
name is there. I'm going to try and beat everybody I can. If I
don't feel that way, I shouldn't even be out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I showed myself and some other people I can go out
there and play when I'm playing pretty decent with the best players
in the world. You can't say, `OK, this guy's born into stardom.'
You have to start playing with these guys and you have to start
showing them that you can play with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you have to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba said he learned some lessons Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play better than you think,'' he said. ``Coming
down the stretch, you have to do all the right things and you have
to hope it's your day. You have to hope for a good bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bounce on 16 (when his tee shot went into a greenside
bunker), that would have helped me. Those tiny, little factors all
mean winning and losing.''

MUSICAL QUARTERBACKS  
 3 NFC EAST TEAMS LIKELY TO START NEWCOMERS IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Not yet in his third season, Jake Plummer of the
Cardinals is second in seniority among NFC East starting
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Brad Johnson was acquired to be the Redskins
starter two weeks ago in a trade from the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the Eagles turned the offense over to
free-agent signee Doug Pederson of the Packers, who they signed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants also entered the game of musical
quarterbacks over the weekend, signing former New Orleans and
Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins, who was released by the
Panthers midway through last season because he told Coach Dom
Capers he didn't ``have his heart in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' move raised some eyebrows _ one assistant at the NFL
scouting combine said Sunday they ``pushed the panic button'' _ but
at least Collins led Carolina to the NFC title game his second year
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson has never started a game and has thrown only 32 passes
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he knew of Pederson, Dallas Coach Chan Gailey, a
longtime offensive assistant in the league before becoming head
coach of the Cowboys a year ago, said, ``I know nothing about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson's former coach, Mike Holmgren, who has moved on to the
Seattle Seahawks, is polite when asked about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a nice ball,'' Holmgren said. ``He knows the
(Eagles' offensive) system. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this will be all new to him. He's never been in this
situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said he would have liked to have had Pederson to
compete with Jon Kitna for Seattle's starting job. But he wouldn't
have liked to have paid Pederson for the $4.5 million over three
years, which is what the Eagles, now coached by former Green Bay
quarterbacks coach Andy Reid, are paying him.
</P>
<P>
   A Green Bay executive said if the Packers thought Pederson was
that good, they wouldn't have brought in Rick Mirer last season as
protection in case starter Brett Favre got injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Collins move is just as strange. The Giants cut last
season's starter, Danny Kanell, for a player who completed only
48.2 percent of his passes last season while playing for Carolina
and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   At Carolina, Collins had 10 interceptions and only four
touchdowns, yet that didn't keep him from getting a four-year,
$16.9 million deal, including a $5 million signing bonus, from the
Giants. The Giants maintain that former Cardinal Kent Graham will
go into training camp as the starter, but it seems highly unlikely
the team is investing that much money in a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we possibly can to go all the way,''
said Giants Coach Jim Fassel, formerly offensive coordinator of the
Cardinals. ``Sometimes you need to take calculated risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants appeared to have taken a big risk. Collins is the
same guy who angered Carolina's African-American players by using a
racial epithet. He has a history of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely confident this young man has the capability to
learn from his personal history and grow for the future,'' said Dr.
Joel Goldberg, team psychologist for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   If Collins were that good, why did the St. Louis Rams choose to
pay former Redskins quarterback Trent Green, who had thrown only
one pass before last season, $4 million a year instead of signing
him?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Oakland Raiders pick Rich Gannon over him?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Saints let him go?
</P>
<P>
   Giants officials signed Collins because they think Graham, who
was 5-1 as a starter last season, cannot take them to the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry has outstanding talent,'' Fassel said. ``He's a big guy
with a strong arm. He can make the tough throws. He's got a big
upside if handled right.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's acquisition of Johnson is the least questionable,
but it came at an expensive price. They had to make a ``Lawrence
Welk deal'' _ a one, a two, a three (first-, second and third-round
draft choices).
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it have been better to just re-sign Green?
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't complicated,'' Redskins General Manager Charley
Casserly said. ``This city demands a winner. You don't punt at the
quarterback situation in this city. There have been too many great
ones here. If you took a vote in the NFL about who is the best
quarterback available, it would have been 31-0 for Brad Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints General Manager Bill Kuharich said the deals show how
much importance some teams are putting on improving their starting
quarterback position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver has had one of the best quarterbacks of all time in
John Elway and had great results,'' Kuharich said. ``Everybody says
you have to have a great quarterback to win. You have Elway,
(Dallas' Troy) Aikman, (Miami's Dan) Marino. They're big pieces to
their team's success. But there are other ways to win, and it all
depends on the philosophy you have to build a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta made the Super Bowl with a guy who was a journeyman
quarterback (Chris Chandler) until this year. They proved you can
do it with defense, a great running back (Jamal Anderson) and a
quarterback who doesn't make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Cardinals each made the playoffs and had the two
best teams in the division because they had the two best
quarterbacks in Aikman and Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, Eagles and Giants decided their quarterbacks
weren't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo did the same thing a year ago, paying Jacksonville
backup Rob Johnson $5 million a year, but he couldn't win his job
back from Doug Flutie after an early-season injury.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to look to the college ranks and be prepared
to take some lumps while a young quarterback matures. There are
enough teams desperate for quarterbacks that Tim Couch of Kentucky,
Akili Smith of Oregon, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse and Daunte
Culpepper of Central Florida all are projected to go in the top 15
picks in this year's draft. &QL;

(Subs 8th graf to update with Kukoc Sunday scores; grafs 7, 11 for
rephrasing. Subs head.)  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; For weeks leading up to Sunday's Knicks-Bulls game,
I'd been troubled by a feeling that I couldn't place. The feeling
had actually been present ever since the owners marched their
players into camp and put them to work after the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Then I read that Tim Floyd, the Chicago Bulls' rookie head
coach, had implored Dickey Simpkins, Chicago's journeyman center,
to give his 1-7 team an inside presence Sunday against Patrick
Ewing, the Knicks' veteran center. I also read that Floyd had
implored Charles Jones, the former Long Island University star, to
give the Bulls a scoring lift. Charles Jones? Give the Bulls a
lift? He wasn't even drafted.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it clicked; that's when I recognized the gnawing
feeling inside. It was the same sinking feeling that followed me
throughout the National Football League's humorous, humiliating
``replacement player'' games in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the situations aren't the same. In the NFL strike,
teams were a hodgepodge of veteran players who crossed the picket
line and replacements. After the National Basketball Association
lockout, the real players are back, with one supreme exception. But
the basketball owners showed the players they were willing to
cancel a season, confident that fans would come back because what
they were ultimately attracted to were the teams, the league, the
logos. In other words, the NBA felt it could market anything.
</P>
<P>
   The messages from ownership were, after all, the same: the
players are expendable and interchangeable. And the result has been
the same: two fraudulent seasons, with a similar fumbling and
bumbling quality of play, a lack of cohesion. The team that
stumbles the least wins.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to salvage time and recoup money after the
lockout, NBA players have been set to run at a frantic pace.
Sunday's game at Madison Square Garden was the Knicks' fifth in
seven days; the impostor Bulls played the first of six games in
eight days. And the lockout highlighted how many players, far from
playing for the love of the game, are playing to pay for the
multiple mortgages, fleets of luxury cars, child support and other
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   - Chicago is the poster team of this sham season in which money
seems to be all that matters. Michael Jordan, the best player ever
to play the game, retired, Scottie Pippen was sent off to Houston
and Dennis Rodman was left to his own bizarre devices. Jerry
Krause, the general manager being portrayed as the wounded genius
hero, is plunging the team into obliteration and telling Bulls
fans, ``Don't worry.'' Toni Kukoc, Chicago's hope for this season,
must think he has descended into the basketball version of hell.
After riding the Jordan-Pippen-powered gravy train, Kukoc now feels
the burden of carrying dead weight. He scored 16 points in 40
minutes Sunday on 6-of-19 shooting. The Bulls are 1-8 for the first
time since 1978. Their point total in Sunday's 79-63 loss was the
lowest for a Knicks opponent since the inception of the 24-second
shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc is being counted on to do all the things he's not equipped
to do: produce fire, provide leadership, motivate demoralized
troops. ``It's tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the answer to that,'' he said, staring ahead. ``I'm
not going to comment on that.'' No comment needed. Charles Jones
took one shot and missed it, grabbed one rebound and blocked one
shot. Dickey Simpkins played 35 minutes, made 2 of 10 shots and
hauled down 11 rebounds. Ewing was 4 of 15 in 34 minutes, and
managed six rebounds and seven blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivalry is not the same; it's definitely not like the
Knicks-Bulls of old,'' Ewing said afterward. There was a time, when
the NBA was rebuilding itself and still needed faces and images,
flesh and blood, when valor, competitive integrity and winning for
the team had meaning. Then the team became the franchise, the
franchise became a multifaceted corporation, and the league became
willing to tear down its star system. In the dog-eat-dog world of
this truncated season, Chicago's woes simply mean another victory
for the Knicks. That's what it's come down to: not rivalry and not
necessarily compelling basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Michael, Scottie or Dennis, it takes some of the buzz
out of it,'' Ewing said. ``But we still have a job to do,
regardless of who is out there.'' That was a phrase we heard a lot
in 1987 from beleaguered NFL coaches, forced to coach furniture
salesmen-turned-football players and players they had cut three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there are games to play and a season to finish.
For the Knicks and the Bulls, there are two contrasting missions in
two different markets. The Knicks cut off appendages and grow
attractive new ones for fans mesmerized by the process more than
the product. The Bulls blow themselves to pieces and ask for
patience and mercy.
</P>
<P>
   What's disconcerting is how much this all feels like 1987: the
NBA's crushing capitalism has committed the players to an odd
strain of socialism. A world where everybody is Dickey Simpkins and
Charles Jones.

BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC: REDISCOVERING THE SOUNDS OF ANOTHER ERA'S
HEROISM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Friday evening at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
the Brooklyn Philharmonic under their conductor, Robert Spano,
dredged up from oblivion Shostakovich's ``Leningrad'' Symphony,
once so mighty a vessel. Within the first year or two after it came
out, in 1942, it may well have had more performances than any other
orchestral work ever.
</P>
<P>
   It surely reached a hugely larger audience than any piece
before, thanks to radio broadcasts. Among its more distinguished
listeners, Aaron Copland gained an idea of what a heroic symphony
ought to sound like, and even Stravinsky felt the tug, though
Bartok, ever the skeptic, took over a chunk of the march theme from
the first movement and subjected it to gleeful ridicule in his
Concerto for Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, though, Bartok's work was being played far
more often than Shostakovich's, and soon it was necessary to remind
people where the much-ridiculed tune had come from. The
``Leningrad'' Symphony had been great music for war. Russian
audiences, with German troops on their soil, could be inspired by
it, while to play it in the United States was to affirm solidarity
with the ally (which must be one reason why it vanished so smartly
from the repertory after 1945).
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation could be that it is simply not a very good
piece. Whatever Shostakovich may have thought at other times about
the demands of Socialist Realism _ that music be optimistic,
tuneful and public in its voice _ in the ``Leningrad'' Symphony,
which was begun in a city under siege, he saw the point.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that he possessed a far more complex
musical personality than Socialist Realism had room for, and
certainly a far more private one. So that personality would just
have to take the night off.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Leningrad'' Symphony sometimes makes a good deal of noise,
but in another sense it is very quiet, saying almost nothing of its
composer, who was normally in his music so vociferous. A lot of the
music is bland, as if it had been written by a competent but dull
Shostakovich imitator. The march in the first movement, repeated
with stepwise amplification in the manner of Ravel's ``Bolero,''
must surely be a parody, and yet one can well understand why Bartok
did not hear it so. The clues to an ironic interpretation are
missing, where Shostakovich's music generally is littered with
them. Instead the symphony has the qualities of a church hymn:
solemn, uplifting, boring, a bit embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   But a hymn can be passionately delivered, and this Brooklyn
revival of the ``Leningrad'' Symphony could hardly have been more
dynamic, sustained and even compelling. By attacking tedious music
as if it meant something, Spano made it mean something. In the
vacuous C major of the opening, he had his strings play grandly,
with strong bowing and much vibrato, and the effect was grand. As
here, so later, the success depended on ready responses from the
players. The viola section shone powerfully and unanimously when it
had its chance to sing, and the symphony's many woodwind solos were
conveyed with great prowess: bassoon, contrabassoon, E flat
clarinet, English horn and flutes were outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps above all Spano kept this expansive, 75-minute score
firmly on the move. Whatever one's doubts about the music, the
triumph of the closing pages was fully earned by those taking part.

SUNS' FORTUNE TIED TO MAVS'MISFOR TUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Dallas Mavericks have been called Suns East and
the Phoenix junior varsity. The two teams have more links than some
families have cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Suns guard George McCloud has a home in Dallas. Mavericks
forward Cedric Ceballos has one in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the Suns and Mavericks are linked by more than
just a shared past. Their respective futures also are tied to one
another in what could become an interesting tug of war between
ex-colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rivalry, all right. The stakes were created by a trade
last July, when the Suns acquired forward Pat Garrity and an
unconditional first-round draft pick for playmaker Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The key is the draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is out on Garrity. He's shown some promise, but it's
impossible to judge a rookie based on nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, a third-year guard, struggled through Dallas' first eight
games. In a loss Friday to Golden State and a victory Saturday over
the Los Angeles Clippers, he began to play with the efficiency of
last year, when he was a backup to Jason Kidd and Kevin Johnson.
Nash is still trying to adjust to a new team in an abbreviated
season after the chaotic NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I maybe didn't realize what a tough situation this
is,'' said Nash, who faces former Phoenix teammates tonight in his
first return to America West Arena since the trade. ``We had two
weeks of training camp before we saw what was going to happen in a
game, and then, it's like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminds me of my rookie year (1996-97) in Phoenix when we
started 0-13. This team has a lot more life than that team. But
it's going to be a tough season.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash struggled with a foot injury during the off-season and then
missed 40 of his first 50 attempts from the floor. He since has hit
on 14 of 22 attempts and displayed floor leadership that was a key
to the Mavericks' first two victories. It's early, but he doesn't
get the free pass given to Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, Nash's playmaking ability will determine whether
the Suns get a lottery pick (No. 1 through No. 13) or a choice late
in the first round of the next draft. If he plays better, the
Mavericks figure to win more. The more the Mavericks win, the later
the Suns will pick.
</P>
<P>
   So Nash is still an important part of the Suns' future. But this
time, the Suns will be hoping for turnovers instead of assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have the option of giving the pick from Dallas or their
own to the Chicago Bulls to complete the Luc Longley trade. They
also can wait until 2000 to give the Bulls a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage it looks as if the Bulls will have to wait. The
potential for a lottery pick has not gone unnoticed by the Suns.
Fact is, it was there long before Nash ever put on a Mavericks
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have not been in the playoffs for eight years _ a
futility streak that is the NBA's longest. There's a solid chance
it will grow to nine. The Mavericks are 2-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have adjusted their scouting strategy in the event of
pick among the first 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes a little bit,'' said Dick Van Arsdale, the Suns'
senior vice president for player personnel. ``We're not looking at
it as though we might be able to find a player who could slip to
the 25th pick. We're looking for somebody who can play now. There's
a chance we could have a top pick.''
</P>
<P>
   As the college season nears March Madness, the Suns' scouting
process is in high gear. The club already is judging players
according to how they fit the Suns' needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being more specific,'' Suns scout Al Bianchi said.
``We're zeroing in on the type of guys we might want.''
</P>
<P>
   After just nine games, the Suns have found themselves to be
without the sort of dynamic, athletic talent provided by Antonio
McDyess, who left Phoenix for Denver. There might not be a McDyess
among the current college prospects, but there are great leapers
and shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys, all seniors, are players we've pretty much put
on the back burner,'' Van Arsdale said. ``We're looking at the
first 10 to 15 players. We like the Kobe Bryants of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Arsdale was referring to Bryant's athletic talent and not
his lack of college experience. The Suns are unlikely to expend a
high pick on high school players. Their immaturity and uncertain
development make the investment too risky.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some intriguing prospects in the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Some names: Rhode Island small forward Lamar Odom, Auburn
swingman Chris Porter, Duke power forward Elton Brand, Maryland
guard Steve Francis and Connecticut guard Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a top-five pick, you'd probably get a good player, one
who could play right away,'' Bianchi said.
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, it all depends on what Dallas does.
</P>
<P>
   Or doesn't do. &QL;

   PHOENIX - The Valley wades into competition for the 2005
Goodwill Games this week when officials of the Maricopa County
Sports Commission and Turner Sports meet in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going there to say we want it, throw our name in the hat
and find out what is necessary,'' said commission Executive
Director  &UR; Mike Sculley, who will be joined by Chairman  &UR; Herman
Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games brought 1,500 athletes from 60 countries to
greater New York City last summer. It will be staged in Brisbane,
Australia, in 2001 before returning to the United States in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier brings not only his expertise as vice president of the
U.S. Olympic Committee but a friendship with  &UR; Harvey Schiller,
president of Turner Sports and former USOC executive director, and
 &UR; Mike Plant, Goodwill Games president and Turner Sports vice
president. Schiller has a home in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the now-discredited Olympic Games bidding process, the
Goodwill Games site selection is more of a straight business
agreement between Turner Broadcasting System, a Time Warner
company, and the host city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have an event you can call your own and not just
be a rights owner,'' said  &UR; Ted Turner, now Time Warner vice
chairman who founded the Goodwill Games in response to the Olympic
boycotts of 1980 and '84. The Goodwill Games debuted in Moscow in
1986 then were held in Seattle and St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker  &UR; Jeff Groscost is among those in state government
who have met with Frazier and Sculley &UR; about the funding necessary
for an international multisport event like the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also will include a meeting with USA Track &AMP; Field
officials. The commission is interesting in hosting not only a
future track and field national convention but competition at ASU's
Sun Angel Stadium, which received a $700,000 renovation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 Track Championships will be at ASU for the first time
since 1991 on May 21-22. &QL; 
Gym shakers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jason Gatson of Mesa and  &UR; Yewki Tomita of Tucson were second
and third all-around at the Winter Cup Gymnastics Challenge in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gatson had the only perfect 10 of the finals thanks to a
full-twisting double layout opening pass and full-twisting double
back finish. Tomita won pommel horse with a 9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Only  &UR; Blaine Wilson, the first man to win three consecutive
national titles since  &UR; Kurt Thomas, had a higher all-around score
than the two Arizonans, who are clearly on course for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Gatson, who also won vaulting, earned $3,000, while Tomita
picked up $2,000.

(DW) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's top advisers on
environmental and security issues have recommended that he
significantly increase the budget and staffing for the tiny
independent police force that guards New York City's upstate
reservoirs against pollution and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, private environmental groups and some city
officials have complained that the 91-year-old force run by the
City Department of Environmental Protection, which has about 50
officers, is so underpaid and understaffed that it is incapable of
effectively patrolling the 1,900 square miles of terrain that
drains into the city's 19 upstate reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, yet another critique of the watershed police force
was presented to city officials by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer
for Riverkeeper Inc., a private group that investigates and sues
polluters in the lower Hudson River Valley. The report is scheduled
to be released Monday. Copies were provided Friday to several
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the report on Friday, Joseph J. Lhota, deputy
mayor for operations, said that he and Jerome M. Hauer, director of
the Office of Emergency Management, agreed with many of the
findings. ``We need to enhance our police effort in the watershed
area,'' Lhota said. ``Our primary focus has to be protecting our
assets and the environment up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, of the Riverkeeper group, said that even though
Giuliani had acted aggressively within the city limits to thwart
terrorists and fight crime, little had been done to prevent harm to
the reservoirs and aqueducts that funnel water to nine million
people in the city and nearby suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this fortress going up around City Hall and yet
nothing has been done to protect this extraordinarily vulnerable
asset that the city has upstate,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The report harshly criticized the city for capping salaries for
its watershed police officers at $23,900 a year, while it pays word
processors in the environmental agency a starting salary of
$27,000. The result, the report said, is a high rate of turnover,
with officers typically leaving after a few years for more
lucrative positions in suburban police departments. That loss of
experienced officers could translate into serious vulnerability,
the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of watershed police officers also leaves the
system open to terrorism, said the report, which echoed previous
criticisms by Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, and Michael
Collins, who until last year was the environmental agency's
director of police operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any student of the reservoirs' infrastructure can easily
catalog dozens of unguarded sections of the system from which a
terrorist could drown watershed cities and towns and poison New
York City's water supply or shut it down for months _ even years,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   State law has long given the city the right to patrol the land
around its 19 upstate reservoirs, and in 1908, it set up the
watershed police force. At its peak during World War II, the force
had more than 450 sworn officers and 700 armed guards at gatehouses
and other vulnerable spots.
</P>
<P>
   Today, besides being hampered by its thin ranks, the force lacks
basic equipment like cameras. Some officers routinely borrow home
video gear to document evidence, the report said. The force has no
money for helicopters or boats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The force's annual wish list for equipment routinely has been
rejected by the senior Department of Environmental Protection
staff, the report said. Its request for 1998, all of which was
denied, according to the report, included money for bulletproof
vests, tape recorders and night-vision scopes to spot illegal
dumpers.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the persistent weakness of the
environmental enforcement division of the police force, which was
created in 1993 to track down polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The division has grown from one officer to five, the report
said, but two of the three detectives patrolling around the
Catskill and Delaware branches of the system, which sprawl over
1,600 square miles, were recently reassigned to spend more than
half their time doing general police work, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several current and former watershed police
officers confirmed many of the findings in the report. One officer
who left the force recently for a suburban police job said the pay
insures that people leave quickly. ``I'd still be there now if the
pay was better,'' said the officer, who spoke on the condition that
his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   He said the force was spread far too thinly. ``If you're the
only guy on at 2 a.m. and you're down in Yonkers at the Hillview
Reservoir, how do you know what's going on at the East Branch?'' he
said, referring to a city reservoir in Putnam County, 40 miles
north of Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota said he and Hauer agreed that Giuliani should increase
salaries and staff, with particular emphasis on the security
patrols. He added that he could not provide details because of
labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   Joel A. Miele Sr., the city's commissioner of environmental
protection, said he had long sought more watershed police and a
raise in their pay. Last year, he said, he got the force eight new
cars, and he is now working to charter a helicopter.

SUNS CAN'T BLAME LOCKOUT  
 JUST BASKETBALL, AINGE EXPLAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The NBA lockout has become a handy excuse for a whole
host of problems, but it can't be blamed for the Suns' inconsistent
play, Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge says.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout has nothing to do with the Suns early habit of
falling behind by double-digit margins in each of their past four
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're reading too much into it (the lockout),'' said Ainge,
whose Suns trailed the Detroit Pistons by 17 early in the second
quarter of a 101-93 loss on Friday night. ``It's just basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said his team allowed itself to grow complacent with its
victory at San Antonio Wednesday night. Meanwhile, the Pistons were
desperate to snap a five-game skid. There's motivation in
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team that has been embarrassed is scary,'' Ainge said.
``I've talked to our guys about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge added that he isn't planning an overhaul of his starting
lineup tonight against Dallas in an attempt to energize his club at
tip-off. It was suggested that  &UR; Danny  &UR; Manning and/or  &UR; Clifford
Robinson start. Both have been coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who starts,'' Ainge said. ``You could draw five
names from a hat and play better than we have at the beginning. We
simply have to play with more urgency. I don't think it has
anything to do with lineups. It's all about attitude _ about coming
to work.'' &QL; 
Free for all
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 6,000 showed up for a scrimmage Sunday at
America West Arena. Popcorn and soft drinks were free. The Suns
also gave away T-shirts, basketballs and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jason Kidd,  &UR; Joe Kleine,  &UR; Clifford  &UR; Robinson and  &UR; Luc Longley
even took off their playing shoes and tossed them into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns hoped it was a show of goodwill for fans alienated by
the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine said he feels that the players still have to work at
winning back fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheers are there, but I just get the sense the feeling
isn't as strong as it was,'' Kleine said. ``Maybe, there's a little
bit more pessimism than before. That's something I fully
understand. I don't blame them. We've created this mess. The fans
have actually been better than I expected.'' &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL; 
This was lost amid  &UR; Rex Chapman's shooting woes Friday night: He
scored his 9,000th career point.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George McCloud didn't play in Sunday's scrimmage. He's nursing
a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns win tonight, it will be the 900th loss in Mavericks
history.  &UR; Dick Motta was the coach for 409 of those defeats, the
most among the team's seven head coaches. Motta also coached Dallas
to its only Midwest Division title. &QL;

COYOTES HOPE MEETING CAN CURE THEIR BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A week ago Sunday the Phoenix Coyotes were
four-points behind the Dallas Stars and were talking loud about
catching and passing the Stars to gain the No. 1 playoff seed in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Coyotes are still talking. But only to each
other about how to halt the runaway freight train to oblivion
they've been riding.
</P>
<P>
   After four consecutive losses, during which they allowed 20
goals, and after thoroughly embarrassing themselves by being
outscored 11-3 in the state of Florida on Friday and Saturday, the
words of the day were about lost focus. When any pro team starts
talking focus, it can mean only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   A team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The players met briefly in the locker room after the 7-1 setback
to the Florida Panthers Saturday night, but Coach Jim Schoenfeld
canceled Sunday's scheduled practice for a meeting between coaches
and players, which was followed by a players-only session.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, acknowledging he has about a half-healthy team, saw
no need to punish it after learning forward Greg Adams will miss
tonight's game in Pittsburgh with a groin strain and forward Shane
Doan probably will also watch from the press box through a right
eye that resembles a ripe, mushy plum.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were already without defenseman J.J. Daigneaut,
forwards Dallas Drake, Brad Isbister and Mike Stapleton. And
forward Juha Ylonen was shipped back to the Valley to learn the
gravity of a knee injury suffered against Tampa Bay on Friday,
which perhaps means two more fresh faces could be summoned from the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get the guys focused on the tangibles,''
Schoenfeld said. ``It's so easy to get mired in a situation when
you lose four games in a row and say, `Oh, my goodness, what's
happened to our season!' You can't change what's happened, good or
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``As coaches we have to get them focused back on our system. If
they can fill their mind with hockey thoughts, then there won't be
room for all the extraneous nonsense going on around them. Start by
playing well against Pittsburgh, and then raise the bar for the
next game.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, as meetings go, Sunday's was anything but
fanatical, although one Coyote confided it had its moments. It
mostly dealt with building good habits entering the playoffs,
according to Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a focus/commitment type of meeting, but it was good,
and something we needed,'' Rick Tocchet said. ``Every team needs
something like this during a year, and we pulled this one out
now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Florida rout, Tocchet said the Coyotes have allowed
some ``stuff'' to creep into the locker room that weren't conducive
to winning, and that they've abandoned the forechecking defensive
system that served them well earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk and assistant captain Jeremy Roenick are insistent that
there's no internal finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize we have to play better,'' Roenick said.
``There's nobody that's biting at anybody's toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had injuries, we're tired and we're mentally fatigued,
but we have to find a way to get over it. Some of our guys are
struggling, like myself, Walt (Tkachuk) and Teppo (Numminen). We
have to find a way to battle out of it, and the only way you can do
it is with everybody helping out.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, Tkachuk and Tocchet represent 60 of the Coyotes' 145
goals this season, which is 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick has five goals in his past 23 games, and Tkachuk has
five in his past 16 games. Tocchet has five in his past nine and
has the Coyotes only goals (three) on this road trip.
</P>
<P>
   And Numminen, who's vital on the power play, has but two points
in his past 10 games. Scoring slumps among defensemen aren't
unusual, but he hasn't been his usual error-free defenseman;
perhaps a product of prolonged ice time early in the year taking a
toll.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely translated, it means only one of the team's top four
leaders is being productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your top players aren't playing well, you're going to
lose games,'' Tkachuk said. ``Our best three players, myself, J.R.
and Teppo, aren't playing very good right now, and it's costing us
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't excuse the other guys, but we have to assume more
responsibility and pick up our game. Tocchet is scoring, but we've
got to get him some help. We need everybody contributing like we
had earlier.''

NEW FACES ARE READY TO REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Diamondbacks pitchers and catchers won't be lonely
anymore. The rest of their brethren are due to report to camp
today, with the first full-squad workout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some faces will be familiar _ third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams,
second baseman  &UR; Jay Bell, first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee, shortstop
 &UR; Tony Batista, utility man  &UR; Andy Fox and outfielder &UR; David Dellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Others are new _ outfielders  &UR; Steve Finley and  &UR; Luis Gonzalez,
non-roster outfielder &UR; Pete Incaviglia and non-roster infielder
 &UR; Dale Sveum. &QL; 
Smooth Swindell &QL; 
Left-hander  &UR; Greg Swindell, signed to shore up the middle-relief
corps, appears to be throwing smoothly after arriving in camp
Friday, a day after the other pitchers and catchers. He received
permission to report late to be with his father, who underwent
cancer surgery in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   With his father's condition stabilized, Swindell felt free to
concentrate on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep for several nights,'' Swindell said. ``Part of
that, I'm sure, was wondering if my dad would be OK. But the other
part was excitement, anticipation to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, who moved to Paradise Valley last fall after dividing
his 1998 duty between Minnesota and Boston, was a diligent
participant in off-season workouts at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched in 81 games last season, and 100 may not be out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a statement I made, not necessarily a goal,'' he said.
``I want to get in as many games as I can, although I don't like to
be just a one-inning guy. I think things will work out.'' &QL; 
Nelson moving up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ralph Nelson, the Diamondbacks director of baseball
administration, will take a new job with the commissioner's office
beginning in March.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement is expected soon. Nelson declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's primary duty is expected to be the implementation of a
restructuring plan for umpires that he developed and presented at
general managers' meetings late in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes evaluation of performance and perhaps even
putting umpires from both leagues in the same assignment pool. It
is possible that in the initial stages of the plan, a handful of
the older umpires will be allowed to remain in their original
league. He is expected to continue to use Phoenix as his home base.
</P>
<P>
   His duties with the Diamondbacks included preparing performance,
contract and medical dossiers on prospective selections in the
expansion draft. He later became one of the club's primary contract
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   His duties are expected to be absorbed by various front-office
personnel. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ Julia Rolle, 70, stood in the visitors' line
outside the Nassau County jail, stooped against a freezing
downpour, a plastic rain bonnet wrapped tightly around her head.
She was waiting to see her son, locked up inside.
</P>
<P>
   The good Lord would protect him, Mrs. Rolle, a preacher's widow,
kept saying. But who would protect her from the storm?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a cold in 10 years,'' she said, eagerly accepting
the offer of an umbrella, ``till I had to wait out here for two
whole hours the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that much attention is being paid to conditions inside the
jail, including allegations of widespread brutality, people like
Julia Rolle say they would also like a little attention paid to
what they say they endure outside the jail: long waits in a parking
lot, often ending with an announcement that visiting hours have
been cut short; guards who strictly enforce rules that many believe
they make up on the fly; and a calendar unfriendly to the working
people who are the jail's most frequent visitors _ weekdays only,
and closings on every major holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations call for the guards to admit visitors into the
building until 7 p.m., to grant each one an hour with an inmate,
and for all visitors to be out of the building by 8 p.m. The
process of receiving a visitor and finding an inmate may take up to
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering outside the jail on Thursday, Chanda Nixon, 24, of
Syosset, said she had taken the day off from work to make sure she
would get to see her boyfriend. The evening before, Ms. Nixon said,
she had raced to make it here before 7 p.m. She got off the bus and
took her place in line outside at 6:15. ``At 10 to 7, they told us
that visiting was closed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, the order to ``go home'' came even earlier, at
6:35. The visiting room had become overcrowded, a guard said _ a
frequent explanation. Even so, the last few visitors were leaving
about an hour later, at 7:40, 20 minutes early. The next day was
the beginning of a four-day holiday weekend for county employees.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with dozens of regular visitors, all spoke of
indignities suffered or witnessed inside the jail: guards at metal
detectors ordering women to remove their underwire bras in private,
then snickering when they return; drug-sniffing dogs prodding their
noses in visitors' crotches as officers look on indifferently;
questions met with snarls; complaints met with ejections, angry
outbursts met with warnings never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat you like criminals who haven't been caught yet,''
said the wife of a recently released inmate, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission of Correction sets minimum standards for
prison visits, including how many a prisoner must be allowed each
week. The Nassau deputy undersheriff, Ernest C. Weber, who oversees
day-to-day operations at the Nassau jail, said it complied with or
exceeded state regulations. For example, although the state
requires two 30-minute visits a week, the Nassau jail permits three
one-hour visits. The jail receives several hundred visits each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby jails are far more accessible, visitors say. Suffolk
County's maximum-security jail in Riverhead _ which, like Nassau's,
has about 1,800 inmates _ allows visitors who arrive in the morning
to schedule a visit later in the day, until all the slots are
taken. Visits are allowed Tuesday through Saturday, and on
Christmas and Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Rikers Island allows visits Wednesday through
Sunday. The huge jail complex there, which has about 16,000 inmates
and receives half a million visits a year, processes them in a
central building with plenty of chairs. Under a 1992 consent decree
with the Prisoners' Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society,
visitors are assured of waiting no longer than an hour to see a
prisoner. Anyone who arrives within the scheduled hours is
guaranteed a visit, no matter how long it takes guards to find the
inmate in question, said Thomas Antenen, a city Correction
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Spencer, a lawyer for the Prisoners' Rights Project,
said her group conducted sporadic inspections at Rikers to insure
that the department was complying with the decree. Ms. Spencer said
she frequently received complaints about the Nassau jail, but her
group's activities are restricted to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Until an inmate, Thomas Pizzuto, died Jan. 13 after a severe
beating in the Nassau jail, few people in Nassau paid much
attention to how the jail treated inmates, let alone visitors.
Those who did included a few clergymen, a few civil libertarians
and a number of black and Latino leaders, who are keenly aware of
the disproportionate number of minority prisoners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One voice has been that of Robert Summerville, the president of
the NAACP's Freeport and Roosevelt chapter. In December, at a
budget hearing of the county Legislature, he appealed to officials
to authorize at least enough money for a visitors' weather shelter,
much like those at bus stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know if there's anything going to be done to make a
difference,'' Summerville said.
</P>
<P>
   To which Edward H. Ward, a Republican legislator from Seaford,
deadpanned: ``Pray for sunny weather.'' Ward said he was only
joking.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said in an interview that the Sheriff's Department had
recently asked the Legislature's capital projects committee for
about $50,000 to erect such a shelter. He said that there had been
at least one previous attempt to build one, but that he could not
recall when or why it was blocked. There was no mention of heat,
air-conditioning or benches in the latest request, jail officials
said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Weber defended many of the policies that most infuriate
visitors, saying they were necessary precautions. Visitors try to
pass makeshift weapons, drugs or other contraband to inmates all
the time, he said. Underwire bras and even baby clothes can conceal
handcuff keys or razor blades, he said. Original birth
certificates, required for children to visit, are required to
insure that adults accompanying them are really their parents or
guardians.
</P>
<P>
   But some visitors say the rules seem to keep changing, depending
on the guard and his mood. ``I've been coming for three months,''
said Chamise Smith, 29, of Freeport. ``Suddenly my ID is no good.
Every time, it's something different. They laugh at it. And they'll
tell you _ if you don't like it, go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking a reporter through the visiting area one day recently,
Weber said visitors could request printed copies of the rules to
avoid such confusion. Asked to provide a copy, he turned and asked
a security guard behind a thick glass window for one. ``I'm sorry,
sir,'' the guard replied. ``I haven't seen any of those in about
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber later provided a copy of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Gina Bartkus, 20, of Massapequa, said that it
was her sixth time to make her 20-minute drive to the jail but that
she had been admitted to see her fiance only twice so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time was when he was new in the jail, and the guards
told him he could have visitors, but when I got here they told me
he couldn't,'' she said. ``The second time, we got in for a
half-hour, and we were just asking about the procedures, and they
gave us major attitude. The third time I brought the baby, but they
said I couldn't bring the baby carriage in. The fourth time they
cut off visiting right before me, after I was on line with the baby
for 45 minutes. The fifth time was this morning, and I got in.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on her sixth try, Ms. Bartkus was fifth in line. A moment
later, a guard walked out of the jail's gatehouse. ``Visiting hours
have ended,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 6:45 p.m.

HARPER STARTS, STRUGGLING FISHER SITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Derek Fisher has a future as a starting point guard in
the NBA, but the future isn't now. After two weeks of struggling to
find his game, Fisher found himself back on the bench Sunday, and
Derek Harper was anointed the Lakers' new starter.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, the 16-year veteran, was signed in the offseason to add
depth and veteran leadership. But he also outplayed Fisher, a
third-year pro, through the first eight games, and coach Del Harris
decided to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this particular time, I think Derek Harper is playing at
such a high level, that we want him out there at the beginning of
games,'' Harris said. ``We've been struggling a little bit in first
halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it will help Derek Fisher by taking a little
pressure off him as well. That's not to insinuate the pressure has
been bothering him. It's just the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was timely, getting the 6-foot-4 Harper the start
against the Sonics' 6-foot-4 Gary Payton, but Harris said this was
not a one-time move.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, nothing is permanent,'' he said. ``On the
other hand, we're not looking at it on a two- or three-game basis
either. . . . It's not that big of a change. The two Dereks have
been sharing the point guard position for 48 minutes, and they'll
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper played 31 minutes Sunday and finished with seven points
and five assists. Fisher played 17 minutes and finished with two
points, three assists, three steals and perhaps a bruised ego,
though he wouldn't say so.
</P>
<P>
   After the trade of Nick Van Exel, this was going to be Fisher's
team to run. But Harper consistently played more minutes, and the
writing was on the wall way before Harris made it official. Fisher
had been averaging 5.2 points, 4.2 assists and 2.0 turnovers in
22.6 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No big deal,'' he said of the role change. ``I just still
gotta do my job when I get out there. . . . I felt like I did. I
made some things happen defensively and gave some guys some good
looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the switch to backup could benefit Fisher's game. No
longer will he have to guess what his role is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, it will help,'' he said. ``That way I can
just go out and play. If this is permanent, I'll accept it and just
go back to the things a backup is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday jinx redux: It's the bane of the schedule for the Lakers
_ the Sunday afternoon NBC game. It caused them fits last season,
and here they go again: 0-3 in Sunday NBC games so far, with six
more to go.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kobe Bryant, ``I told NBC, `Schedule us on Saturday.' ''

LOBBYING WAR WAGED OVER NY LAW ALLOWING SURCHARGES FOR HOSPITALS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Casting as long a shadow over New York state
government as any issue in recent years, health care could dominate
this year's legislative session, state officials say, and it is
already the subject of one of the fiercest, most complex lobbying
wars in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Several tightly interwoven questions must be answered: how to
spend New York's share of the national tobacco settlement; what to
do about the rapidly rising number of New Yorkers without health
insurance; whether to accept Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed cuts
in Medicaid spending, and how to cope with expected federal cuts in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the disputes is a state law that adds $2.6
billion a year in surcharges to hospital bills, mostly to help
hospitals pay for training young doctors and caring for the poor.
That law expires later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Employers end up paying most of those charges through higher
insurance premiums for their workers, and the Business Council of
New York State, a group of large corporations, is lobbying hard to
have the assessments eliminated or greatly reduced. That pits one
of the state's most powerful interest groups against two other
heavyweights _ hospitals and hospital workers _ who insist the
charges are essential to their economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever seen lobbying this intense, this
early in the year,'' said state Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Republican from
Garden City, a 22-year veteran of the legislature and chairman of
the health committee.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has not staked out a position on renewal of the hospital
charges, leaving a vacuum that the opposing sides have rushed to
fill. Since last fall, they have barraged lawmakers with glossy
reports, weekly faxes and requests for meetings. Throw in the
disputes over the uninsured and tobacco money, and the fight has
drawn in combatants like public health groups and the state's
fiscal monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the health-care Super Bowl,'' said Elliott A.
Shaw, Jr., director of government affairs at the Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who control the state assembly want to maintain the
hospital charges and even expand state-financed health-care
programs. The senate's Republican majority is ambivalent _ its
members are closely allied with business groups and believe that
there is a need to cut health-care costs, but they also want to
protect hospitals, which are among the biggest employers in nearly
every senator's district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Pataki proposed deep cuts in health-care spending,
a coalition led by 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, waged a fierce advertising campaign against him,
predicting hospital closings. The Governor's popularity dropped
sharply and he backed away from some of his demands. Dennis Rivera,
president of the 150,000-member union, said he was prepared for a
reprise this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be in the cards,'' he said. ``We have to defend the
health-care industry. If we don't do it, who will?''
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers say the expected fight could be more of a
fizzle. They say the issues are so complex and politically vexing
that there will be a great temptation to put them off by
maintaining the status quo for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many questions that don't have answers yet, that
I think there's a very good chance we'll just extend everything as
is,'' Hannon said. ``On the other hand, next year is an election
year, and no one is going to want to deal with this in an election
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, New York was one of a handful of states that set all
the rates that hospitals could charge, whether for an appendectomy
or the birth of a child. The hospitals had no choice about what to
charge, and insurers had no choice about what to pay. In that
atmosphere, critics say, hospitals grew inefficient, and there was
no question that hospitals had far more beds than were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at Pataki's insistence, the state stopped setting
rates, forcing hospitals to negotiate $16 billion a year in charges
with health insurers. The change gave great power to health
maintenance organizations, which could demand that hospitals lower
their rates or see patients routed to other hospitals. The
hospitals began competing for patients and advertising their
services. To cut costs, they merged, closed wings, laid off workers
and established outpatient clinics to divert patients from
expensive emergency room and inpatient care.
</P>
<P>
   But one aspect of the old system survived: the state continued
to add charges to every hospital bill, albeit about a third less
than it had before, in what amounted to a $2.6 billion-a-year
subsidy for hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of that money goes to teaching hospitals to pay
for the training of medical residents, doctors in their first few
years out of medical school. Another big piece goes toward paying
hospitals for patient bills they say they cannot collect, usually
because the patients are poor and uninsured. A third, smaller pot
goes toward retraining thousands of hospital workers as they lose
their jobs or are moved to new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The charges increase the cost of health insurance in New York by
an average of more than $400 a family. Employers complain that the
expense makes them less competitive and drives businesses to other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system was supposed to be transitional,'' Shaw of the
Business Council said. ``The hospitals have made the switch to
competition, so it's time for some of these charges to be phased
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups contend that the charges for graduate medical
education should end. Few other states subsidize it directly
through patients' bills, and none to the extent that New York does.
And New York's hospitals train a disproportionately large share of
the nation's medical residents, so New Yorkers often pay to teach
doctors who later take their skills to other states.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Worker retraining subsidies, the business lobby says, were meant
for a transition period that is now completed. And it asserts that
too much of the assessment for indigent care simply covers up the
poor job hospitals do in collecting bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and union officials counter that medical residents, who
are low-paid, are an important source of relatively inexpensive
health care, particularly in New York City, and that they play a
crucial role in a medical research industry that is an asset to the
state's economy. They argue that worker retraining must continue
because cuts in hospital staffs will continue. And they dismiss as
unfounded the argument that hospitals do not collect debts well.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate is about the financial health of the
hospitals, and there are signs that the Pataki administration is
sympathetic to the Business Council's position. Last month, the
governor's office trumpeted a report showing that the hospitals had
made record profits in 1997, the first year under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dennis P. Whalen, the state's acting health
commissioner, said: ``In the past several years, whenever they've
put that report out showing their profits increasing, they have
said it was an anomaly. The question should never be, `I'm a poor
hospital and someone should pay me more.'''
</P>
<P>
   State officials note that many hospital officials predicted doom
when the current system was put in place. ``I think the hospitals
are generally healthy,'' Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   But while hospitals in New York made more money than ever in
1997, their profit margins were still much smaller than the
national average, and have historically been at levels that would
be considered precarious in other states. Hospital officials say
that things began to turn sour in 1998 _ solid data for that year
are not available yet _ and that 1999 will be bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something doesn't happen, we're going to start imploding,''
said Daniel Sisto, president of the New York State Health Care
Association, a hospitals' lobbying group. ``We will see hospitals
failing to make payrolls, unable to pay off their loans, even
shutting down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals point to billions of dollars they have lost under cuts
Pataki made in 1995 and 1996 in Medicaid, the health insurance
program for the poor, and under cuts Congress has made to Medicare,
the program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say those blows have been amply cushioned by
$1.65 billion that the federal government sent to New York
hospitals to help them make the transition to competition, and by a
new state and federal program to cover health care for uninsured
poor children.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed budget, the governor called for about $800
million a year in Medicaid cuts, almost half of that taken from
payments to hospitals. And new Medicare cuts are expected this year
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone involved in the debate sees the tobacco
settlement as a partial answer to their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the states won a $206 billion lawsuit settlement from
tobacco companies, to be paid over 25 years, to compensate for
money spent treating tobacco-related illnesses. At first, New York
will receive $800 million a year, rising to $1.2 billion by the end
of the agreement, with the first installment expected next year.
The state plans to keep half the money and give half to local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said that at first, he wants to use three-quarters of
the state's share to reduce state debt, a move applauded by fiscal
analysts. But public health advocates insist that the state should
use the money for health care and antismoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders have suggested that the tobacco money could be
used to subsidize doctor training and indigent care, allowing the
insurance surcharges to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care industry is lobbying to use the money for a
major effort to care for the uninsured. Both Sheldon Silver, the
Democratic Assembly speaker, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican
Senate majority leader, say they favor such an initiative, but the
governor has signaled an interest in a more limited effort for the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, as the number of Americans without health
insurance has climbed, the number of New Yorkers in that category,
now estimated at 3.5 million, has grown even faster.
</P>
<P>
   The more uninsured people there are, hospital officials say, the
more dependent hospitals become on the state surcharges to pay for
their treatment. ``In the long run _ and maybe even in the short
run _ unless we do something about the uninsured, the whole system
will crumble,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New
York Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   But business groups contend that the surcharges are partly to
blame for more people being uninsured. The assessments raise the
cost of insurance, leading some employers not to offer it, and some
employees who are asked to pay part of the premiums not to accept
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who is right, everything is connected to everything
else,'' said Whalen. ``There are valid arguments on all sides. This
is not going to be easy.''

POLICE OFFICER'S LAWYER EXPECTS CHARGES IN DIALLO CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for one of the four police officers
involved in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo said Sunday the
officer would not testify before a Bronx grand jury because he had
``no doubt'' that the officers would be indicted on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, who was retained by the officer,
Sean Carroll, over the weekend, said it would be pointless for his
client to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that these police officers are
going to be indicted, given the political pressure that is being
put on the district attorney's office,'' Kornberg said, reiterating
comments first reported Sunday in The New York Post. ``In view of
that fact, what have these cops got to gain by testifying? It's
pointless for them to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, 35, is one of four plainclothes officers who opened
fire on Diallo, 22, in the vestibule of Diallo's apartment on Feb.
4, the police said. The officers fired a total of 41 shots, hitting
Diallo, who was unarmed, 19 times. Carroll emptied his 9-millimeter
service pistol, firing 16 bullets, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over Diallo's death continued Sunday with rallies at
police headquarters in lower Manhattan and in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other officers _ Edward McMellon, 26, Kenneth
Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 _ initially said they expected
their clients to cooperate with the grand jury, but have since said
they were undecided about whether they would testify. Some of the
officers' lawyers have voiced reservations that federal prosecutors
may take the case over from the office of the Bronx district
attorney, Robert T. Johnson, which is leading the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg's entrance into the highly charged case signaled the
first hints of division among the defense lawyers representing the
four police officers in the case. Until Kornberg was retained last
Saturday, all four officers were represented by lawyers who were
paid for by the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Kornberg _ who is known for high-profile cases, and who also
represents Justin A. Volpe, one of the officers accused of
torturing Abner Louima in 1997 _ said that Carroll had decided to
retain him privately.
</P>
<P>
   He then accused the union of not doing enough to defend the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I am privately retained is because of the
dissatisfaction with the PBA,'' he said. ``Don't you think it might
be incumbent on the PBA to call public attention to Officers Steven
McDonald, Kevin Gillespie and Eddie Byrne _ all of whom suffered
injuries or death as a result of not using their weapons?''
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, the acting president of the PBA, said that the
union had worked hard to provide the best legal representation for
the officers while trying to defend them in the court of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on every network, we were on television shows, I
believe I was quoted in every major daily,'' Savage said.
