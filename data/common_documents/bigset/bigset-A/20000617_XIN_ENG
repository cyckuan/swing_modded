<P>
BRUSSLES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- France beat the Czech Republic 2-
1 in a Group D match Friday to secure a spot in the quarterfinals
while the Czechs' chances of qualifying for the next stage of Euro
2000 went smaller.
</P>
<P>
"The Czechs are one of the toughest sides in the tournament,
they don't deserve to go out," said French forward Thierry Henry.
</P>
<P>
Czechs would now have to beat Denmark by a large margin in
their last group match and hope the Dutch lose both of their
remaining games, the late Friday one to the Danes and their last
one to France.
</P>
<P>
"Had we converted all our scoring chances, thing would have
looked differently," said Czech coach Jozef Chovanec.
</P>
<P>
After beating Denmark 3-0 in their opening match, the French
went ahead early through Thierry Henry who latched on to an
embarrasingly bad back pass from Petr Gabriel after seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I lost control and was lucky to score," Henry commented on
his goal. "I still have to work a lot in training."
</P>
<P>
Karel Poborsky leveled from the penalty spot in the 35th after
a Didier Deschamps foul on Pavel Nedved although there was doubt
whether it was inside the area.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Youri Djorkaeff decided the match in the 60th
minute, starting and finishing the move after taking an assist
from Henry.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, knowing that a second loss would put them out,
went close to leveling again when Nedved planted a free kick onto
the head of the 2.02m Jan Koller whose looping, long range header
hit the crossbar and bounced clear.
</P>
<P>
It was Koller's second crossbar and the Czech republic's third
woodwork in two games.
</P>
<P>
"The Czech's ariel attacks were almost impossible to defend
against," said France coach Roger Lemerre. "Tactically, the match
was difficult to control because the ball was in the air a lot,
but our defense was very correct."

<HEADLINE> French Marches to Quarterfinals after Beating Czech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Thierry Henry scored his second
goal of the championship to help world champion France beat the
Czech Republic 2-1 Friday, only one step up to the quarterfinals
in Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Henry, who scored in the team's opening 3-0 defeat of Denmark
last weekend, showed composure to give France the lead seven
minute into the game after a bad error by defender Petr Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs equalised with a 35th minute penalty from Karel
Poborsky before the Arsenal forward crossed the ball from the left
for second-half substitute Youri Djorkaeff to score a crucial
second, 15 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
With six points from two games in the Group D, the French is
now almost certain of a place in the last eight while the Czechs,
beaten finalists at Euro 96, have only a slim chance of avoiding
going home after the first round group stage.
</P>
<P>
France, who were beaten by the Czechs in the semifinals four
years ago after a penalty shootout, were stopped from playing the
same kind of fluent football which they displayed against the
Danes.
</P>
<P>
For a while at the start of the second half, the Czechs looked
capable of handing the French their first defeat for a year.
</P>
<P>
The first goal for France had some luck when Gabriel gave the
ball away to Henry 20 meters from goal and he took his chance,
sprinting into the right of the box and slotting the ball into the
far left-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs tried to play most of their football from too deep
and, upset by the French pressing, they kept losing the ball
before they got within striking distance although Poborsky was
very busy in midfield and a constant danger.
</P>
<P>
In the 35th minute the Euro 96 finalists got some luck when
captain Didier Deschamps brought down Czech midfielder Pavel
Nedved. Before the penalty, the Czechs had had few real chances
apart from a Nedved shot in the second minute which French 'keeper
Fabien Barthez could only punch away.
</P>
<P>
After the goal they lifted their game. Poborsky went close
just before the break and at the start of the second half, Nedved
forced Barthez to make another good save.
</P>
<P>
But Djorkaeff's goal was a killer blow.
</P>
<P>
French defender Laurent Blanc should have added a third for
France 11 minutes from the end when he climbed unchallenged to a
right wing free kick from Djorkaeff only to direct his header wide.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands cruised into the
quarterfinals on Friday in the European Championship after they
finally trounced Denmark 3-0 in group D.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Kluivert scored the first goal in the 58th minute at a
time when the Dutch showed signs of nerves. Substitute Ronald de
Boer added the second in the 66th soon after entering the game and
Boudewijn Zenden made it a hat-trick for Barcelona by adding the
third with 12 minutes left in 50,000 Feyenoord's De Kuip Stadium
in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
All the goals came as the Dutch upped the tempo after the
break following a first half when honours were largely even.
</P>
<P>
"It's good for our fans," Kluivert said. "We are a team and we
want to work for the coach. We proved that today.
</P>
<P>
"The intention was to win. We were satisfied with 1-0 but 3-0
is really fantastic. But after that we could possibly have scored
even more."
</P>
<P>
The first goal came from a break-away. Bergkamp had his shot
parried, but Kluivert was on hand to thump in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
With the Danes still in shock, the Dutch pounced nine minutes
later, a low Boudewijn Zenden cross from the left feeding Ronald
de Boer at the back post for the simplest of goals.
</P>
<P>
Zenden compounded Danish misery with a third goal for the
Dutch in the 77th minute after Michael Reiziger's impressive run
from the deep and a cross from the right.
</P>
<P>
Danish captain Michael Schonberg had the chance to pull one
back in the 80th minute after Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar
had brought down Ebbe Sand, but put his spot kick went just right
of the post.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch and France, who are also in the last eight after
beating the Czech Republic 2-1 earlier in the evening, will now
play for group D superiority in Amsterdam on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams have six points, but since the French have scored
more goals, the Dutch will need a victory to win the group and
ensure they retain home advantage for the knock-out stage.
</P>
<P>
For the Danes, who suffered the same defeat in their opening
match against France, summer holidays begin next week, although
they first have the chance to win back some honour in the group's
wooden spoon contest with the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Danes looked marginally more threatening early on with
Jesper Gronkjaer on the left and Morten Bisgaard on the right
doing good work.

<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed and nine
others injured in Egypt on Saturday in two traffic accidents,
including a hit-and-run collision of a truck into a funeral
procession, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The truck driver sped off after running into the funeral party
and killing three people in the town of Akhmim in southern Egypt,
said a statement issued by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The driver then hit three cars before his vehicle overturned and
he was arrested, the country's Middle East News Agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another seven people died and nine were injured when a truck
collided head-on with a bus on the road linking Cairo and the
eastern town of Suez. The truck driver was trying to overtake a car
when he smashed into the bus, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt due to reckless driving
and violations of regulations. The Interior Ministry has reported
that an average of 3,000 people are killed in road accidents each
year.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian Oil Exports Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Profits from Ecuadorian oil exports
in the first four months of this year grew 168.6 percent compared
to the same period of 1999, said Saturday the Ecuadorian Central
Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
ECB statistics show that the income from crude exports between
January and April amounted to 668.9 million U.S. dollars, against
249.03 million dollars in the same 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
January's exports revenue, 182.4 million dollars, was the
highest not only of the first four months of this year, but also
of the monthly value of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Oil leads, with the increase of exports revenue, all the
products of this country sold abroad and surpasses by more than
100 percent banana exports, which are second in the list with 328.
5 million dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
Petroleos del Ecuador (PETROECUADOR), the state oil company,
informed that the oil exports increase is mainly due to the price
of the barrel of crude in the international market, now quoted at
26.3 dollars.

The "Major General Ignacio Agramonte" plaza was the site for
the open forum for young people and students, which was attended,
as customarily, by first Cuban Vice President Raul Castro and
commanders of the Revolution Juan Almeida, Ramiro Valdez, and
Guillermo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
Once again dozens of speakers joined their voices to condemn

The island authorities blame that legislation for the situation

This juridical norm grants benefits, such as residence and

either arriving by sea on precarious boats or conducted by

The mass event convoked to demand Elian's return was made after

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Intensify Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday warned that his government and the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) will intensify a
fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally for the ruling party for the next
week's parliamentary elections in Harare, Mugabe said action
would be taken against all those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the ruling party will continue to fight and
expose corruption at all levels, both in government, and in civic
society including city councils," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also accused some white Zimbabweans of failing to
embrace his government's policy of reconciliation, conspiring and
aligning themselves with the opposition and other enemies of the
state.
</P>
<P>
He said by acquiring land the government was completing the
revolution to the end and ideals of bringing total control of land
and the economy to blacks.
</P>
<P>
He said the government supported war veterans on farm invasions
adding that nothing would happen to them.
</P>
<P>
"No blackman can be president in the United States to this
date," he said. "Racism will always be there in Britain and the
United States yet they continue to point their fingers at us."
</P>
<P>
"A racial future will never be acceptable in Zimbabwe, but
racial harmony will continue provided whites accept and agree to
live with and among the blacks," he said, adding "they will
always be free to follow their own culture and religion."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Drums up Arab Support on Verification of Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Saturday sought support from Arab countries in the United Nations
in handling verification of Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon,
Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss called Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
Saturday and briefed him of the result of the border inspection
carried out jointly by teams of Lebanese and U.N. experts.
</P>
<P>
During his telephone conversation with Meguid, Hoss said Israel
still occupies Lebanese territory at some parts of the border and
several pieces of Lebanese lands are still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Meguid promised to urge Arab countries'
representatives in the United Nations to show support to Lebanon,
LNNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hoss said his country is determined to cooperate with
the U.N. but will not abandon any territory.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also met American and French ambassadors in Beirut and
asked them to deliver Lebanon's position on the border issue to
their countries.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier Friday at U.N.
headquarters that the United Nations has confirmed the Israeli
withdrawal is complete.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to discuss a draft
statement endorsing Annan's confirmation of Israel's May 24
withdrawal from south Lebanon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Hezbollah guerrillas said in a statement that
Annan's statement is not right and realistic but hasty and the
former anti-Israeli guerrilla group is "disappointed that the U.N.
covers Israel's continuous occupation of Lebanese land."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also stressed that it will "carry out all steps and
wait for a last result."
</P>
<P>
It warned that resistance is the best choice when "the
liberation is not completed and our land still under Israeli
control."

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
leader Yasser Arafat described his recent meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton as " very important and fundamental,"
expressing hope it can lead to a trilateral Palestinian, U.S. and
Israeli summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks after his return home from Egypt here
Saturday afternoon, expressing thanks to the U.S. side for the
efforts they made to revitalize the peace process on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright
will come to the region once again next week in a fresh effort to
push forward the sluggish peace talks between the Palestinians and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA's Minister of Planning and International Co-
operation Nabil Shaath stressed on Saturday that Arafat assured the
U.S. officials of the Palestinians' commitment to the interim
agreements signed with the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks with Israel will gain a fresh impetus over the
coming three weeks with arrival in the region of Albright and U.S.
Special Envoy to the Middle East Denis Ross, Shaath added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat discussed with Clinton the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process on the Palestinian track in view of the
resumed Palestinian-Israeli talks in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he called for an effective U.S. role
through exerting pressure on the Israeli side specially with regard
to Israeli troops withdrawal from West Bank and release of another
batch of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.

<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Due to the growing domestic and foreign demands, Iran
will produce 85 million square meters of tiles and ceramics in the
current Iranian calendar year (started on March 20), the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran will be able to produce 115 million square meters of tiles
and ceramics per annum by the end of the third economic development
plan (March 2000-March 2005), said Mohammad Din Mohammadi,
managing-director of a tiles factory in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad said that his factory exported 2.5 million U.S. dollars
worth of tiles last year and it is expected to export the same
amount this year to Italy, Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asian
republics and other countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Two Turkish construction companies, Akfen and Summa,
have completed renovation of the airport in Chisinau, capital of
Moldavia, reported Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Moldavian President Petru Lucinschi inaugurated the
renovated airport, which will serve as a convenient gateway to the
country for foreign businessmen and tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Akfen and Summa consortium, which won the tender for
the project, had the 12,000-square-metre terminal totally
renovated. New facilities include offices, VIP lounges, cafeterias-

the costs of Algerian travellers to Morocco and to the Algerian
capital via Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, 15,700 Algerians visited
Morocco last year, while 61,356 Moroccans visited Algeria.

SANAA -- Saudi and Yemeni businessmen have launched projects to
establish joint ventures designed for marketing Saudi industrial
products, cultivating vegetables and fruits in Yemen, with a view
to covering the needs of the two countries for these products.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi company Alnemir is currently operating in Yemen's oil
sector, producing some 3,000 barrels of crude oil per day in oil
fields located in Shabwa province. The company is also conducting
surveys in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The International Yemeni Company for Investments, which is
mostly owned by the Saudi Mahfouz Group, is another company
carrying out a major project in the Aden-based free trade zone. The
company spent 250 million U.S. dollars at least on the first phase
of the project.

industrial projects and the expansion of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The loans will cover seven industrial projects, including a
project for electricity distribution, the establishment of compact
power transfer plants, the electric power cutters for medium-sized
industries and the electric conductors in collaboration with the U.
S. General Electric company.

CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian writer who has been
accused of insulting the Islamic holy book of Koran and the Prophet
Mohammed stood trial on Saturday before a state security court.
</P>
<P>
Salaheddin Mohsen, 43, is the author of four books describing
the Koran as the "holy book of Bedouin ignorance" and blaming Islam
for Arab countries' underdevelopment. He also called for the
creation of an Egyptian atheists' league.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen has been charged with offending divine religions and
threatening social peace, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
said. If convicted, he may be sentenced to jail terms between six
months and five years and a fine of up to 300 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen was arrested in March at his home in the Sixth of October
town near Cairo after he published his book "The Shivering of the
Lights" through a private press at his own expense, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Police also found several banned publications at his home.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Offers Full Cooperation with Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Saturday praised the new Majlis (Parliament) of the country as a
symbol of democracy and pledged his government will implement the
legislation passed by it.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the presiding board of the reformist-dominated
sixth parliament, President Khatami said the parliament comprises
of young members who know well the hardships of the people.
</P>
<P>
He hoped parliament members will succeed in passing the
legislation needed to address the difficulties facing the people,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has fostered the country's reform campaign
since he took office in 1997, also called for the respect of
people's legitimate rights and freedom as enshrined in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The sixth parliament, inaugurated on May 27 after tough
struggles with the powerful conservatives, elected its nine-member
presiding board last Sunday. Mehdi Karrubi, secretary-general of
the Assembly of Combatant Clergy and a close ally of President
Khatami, was elected speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The presiding board also includes two vice speakers and six
secretaries, all from the reformist camp.
</P>
<P>
Reformers allied to Khatami won a landslide victory in the
parliamentary election in February, ending the long-time control
over the legislative body by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, who served as parliament speaker from 1989 to 1992, has
vowed to cooperate with President Khatami's government to promote
social and cultural reforms.

JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki on Saturday met his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni in
Pretoria for discussions of peace efforts in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The discussion is part of an ongoing dialog on the peace
process in the DRC," South African presidential aide Tasneem

</P>
<P>
However, no further details about the contents of the talks are

United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan earlier this
week called on the Security Council to insist that troops from
Rwanda and Uganda leave the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Should they refuse to do so, sanctions should be considered,
suggested Annan.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda backed rival rebel factions in the DRC but
have turned their guns against each other and battled for six days
last week in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 civilians have been killed and 1,000 wounded in
the clashes, which threaten to delay UN peacekeeping operations in
the DRC.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Actively Support Crusade Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has called on the people of Uganda to join hands with the
government of National Resistance Movement (NRM) in the crusade
against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when addressing a public rally in
Mbale District, according to a press release from the President's
Office available Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what some people are alleging, poverty is not on
the rise in Uganda, but the people of Uganda today aspire to
higher standards of living for which they need more money,"
Museveni was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 44 percent of population in Uganda are still living under
the poverty line, and over 80 percent of the Ugandans are
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the people to move away from traditional ways of
farming and adopt modern methods of carrying on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The NRM government has initiated the programme of posting
agriculture, forestry and veterinary experts at every sub-county
level to advise farmers on the proper use of fertilizers,
irrigation and improved seeds to ensure better returns for every
household, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's poverty eradication strategy, the
 percentage of population under the absolute poverty will be
reduced to 10 percent in the next two decades, if the economic
growth remains at around 7 percent.

JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Health ministers from
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries said on
Saturday that they were prepared to discuss the offer by five
multinational pharmaceutical companies to supply cheaper HIV/Aids
drugs.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries wanted to enter into discussions with these
companies on the issue, South African Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
"As a critical test however, any agreement entered into must be
 sustainable," Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
She was briefing reporters in Pretoria after chairing a meeting
of health ministers from SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was prompted when the companies suggested they
might be willing to HIV/AIDS related drugs more cheaply to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang said the ministers noted with concern the
manner in which the company's proposed offer was announced.
</P>
<P>
This could lead to alienation of government by their people as
the impression has been created that anti-retroviral drugs were
immediately available at cut prices, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 138 prisoners of war
held by belligerents in the war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) were released from Rwanda, the DRC and Zimbabwe,
Zimbabwean army spokesperson Chancellor Diye said Saturday in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Diye was speaking to reporters on the release of 43 Rwandan
prisoners of war who had been held at the Field Airforce for the
past 19 months.
</P>
<P>
He said on June 16, 49 Rwandan prisoners of war were
repatriated from Kinshasa to Kigali, 35 Zimbabweans from Kigali
to Kinshasa, 11 Namibians from Kigali to Kinshasa and to
Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
The 43 ex-prisoners were seen off at the Harare International
Airport at about 3:00 p.m. by Red Cross and army officials of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The release of the prisoners of war follows last week's
agreement between parties to the war in the DRC to exchange
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Diye said the arrival of the 35 Zimbabwean soldiers who were
being held as prisoners of war by Rwanda was delayed because of
technical hitches in Kinshasa. They are expected to reach here at
17:30 today, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean soldiers, together with those from Angola and
Namibia, have been in the DRC since August 1998 assisting the

Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> New Rocket Technology Could Shorten Mars Travel Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A new rocket technology which
could cut in half time required to reach Mars has been under
development at NASA's laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Called the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket(
VASIMR), the technology is being developed by Advanced Space
Propulsion Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas in collaboration with MSE Technology Applications Inc. in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
NASA says in a news release this week that the technology could
reduce astronauts' total exposure to space radiation and lessen
time spent in weightlessness, perhaps minimizing bone and muscle
mass loss and circulatory changes.
</P>
<P>
The VASIMR engine consists of three linked magnetic cells.
Natural gas, typically hydrogen, is injected at the forward cell
and ionized. The resulting plasma is electromagnetically energized
in the central cell by ion cyclotron resonance heating. In this
process radio waves give their energy to plasma, heating it in a
manner similar to the way a microwave oven works.
</P>
<P>
After heating, the plasma is magnetically exhausted at the aft
cell to provide modulated thrust. The aft cell is a magnetic
nozzle, which converts the energy of the plasma into velocity of
the jet exhaust, while protecting any nearby structure and
ensuring efficient plasma detachment from the magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
A key to the technology is the capability to vary, or modulate,
the plasma exhaust to maintain optima propulsive efficiency. This
feature is like an automobile's transmission which best uses the
power of the engine, either for speed when driving on a level
highway, or for torque over hilly terrain.
</P>
<P>
On a mission to Mars, such a rocket would continuously
accelerate through the first half of its voyage, then reverse its
attitude and slow down during the second half. The flight could
take slightly over three months, while a conventional chemical
mission would take seven to eight months and involve long periods
of unpowered drift en route.

<HEADLINE> Acrid Smoke From Raging Wildfires Hazardous to Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Acrid smoke from raging
wildfires is hazardous to those with lung, heart diseases and
other chronic health problems, a national Jewish physician says.
</P>
<P>
"People closest to the fires are most at risk. That's why
individuals living and working in Los Alamos and local Colorado
communities near Bailey were evacuated," explains Lisa Maier, a
physician in the Division of Environmental and Occupational Health
Sciences at National Jewish Medical and Research Center.
</P>
<P>
But even those miles from a fire can suffer from health
problems after inhaling particulates including microscopic pieces
of ash or burned wood found in wildfire smoke.
</P>
<P>
"The smaller particulates are going to be carried downwind,"
she says. "Breathing the smoke will cause respiratory irritation,
similar to that caused by air pollution."
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of smoke inhalation, which can be present minutes
after exposure, include irritation or a burning sensation and
redness of the eyes, nose and throat.
</P>
<P>
Inhaling smoke can trigger extreme physical reactions, such as
headaches, dizziness, and burns, both internal and external.
</P>
<P>
Long-term exposure to smoke may result in an asthma-like
disease, Maier says.
</P>
<P>
Preventing or limiting exposure to smoke is the best protection.
If at all possible, people with respiratory and heart diseases
should stay indoors with windows closed, and take medications
prescribed by physicians to control the disease.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Somalia Well Under Way to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Djibouti peace conference
for Somali is well under its way to establish a new government for
the war-torn country as the delegates participating the meeting
have solved the most difficult tasks of reconciliation among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Opening th last face of the meeting on Saturday, Djibouti
President Ismail Omar Ghelleh said the heaviest task of
reconciling the Somali tribes is now over and recognition for the
would-be-born government is already in hand.
</P>
<P>
Ghelleh praised delegates to the meeting, which began on May 2,
for their tireless efforts to reach a consensus over the sharing
of the delegates to represent each clan in the political face of
the meeting which began last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Each main tribe was given 160 delegates to choose among its
ambitious leaders for the decision making of how the forthcoming
government, parliament, president and prime minister would be
like.
</P>
<P>
The results have been hailed by the Somalis and the
international community as a whole, Ghelleh said, noting that
unlike earlier times, the international community is now united in
supporting the peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about those armed faction leaders who did not attend
the meeting, Ghelleh said, as a sponsor of the meeting on behalf
of the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development, he has
sent invitations both orally and in written form to them.
</P>
<P>
They have been given enough time and now the tolerance is over
and they can no longer hold Somalia's destiny hijacked for them
any more, the Djibouti president said.
</P>
<P>
It seems that these politicians don't have confidence in
themselves to stand before the people because they know what they
have done to the public, Ghelleh said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghelleh was careful enough not to mention any of the
names of such faction leaders as Mohamed Hajji Ibrahim Egal of
Somaliland, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah,
Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed and Osman Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
The general public of Somalia has expressed strong support for
the Djibouti conference, eagerly looking forward to seeing a
government for their country once and for all after ten ruthless
and chaotic years.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts observed that the forthcoming government has
formidable obstacles before it in terms of the economy and the
general infrastructure in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed faction leaders opposing to it are also trying to
sabotage its implementation using all possible means they can
afford including armed confrontations, they said.
</P>
<P>
The current meeting, the 13th effort during the past ten years
for the research of a government for Somalia, was attended by over
900 delegates including 100 women representing the various
communities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Politicians in Somalia had held 12 meetings trying to reach an
agreement in this aspect but all of the attempts failed and some
even ended in catastrophic armed confrontations.

<HEADLINE> China Attracts More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- By the end of last month, China had
used a total of 320.6 billion U.S dollars, a senior official from
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said at a
seminar here recently.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of the ministry said that
foreign investors from over 180 countries and regions have
established some 349,500 joint ventures or their solely owned
enterprises in China by the end of last month. Contractual volume
of investment amounted to 632.3 billion U.S dollars and a total of
320.6 billion U.S. dollars had arrived.
</P>
<P>
China ranks first in using overseas capital among developing
countries for seven years in a row. In 1999, it drew 40.4 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas investment, ranking third in the world.
Taxes paid by overseas-funded businesses increased by 33.78
percent, accounting for 16 percent of the total industrial and
commercial taxes in China.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
warned on Saturday the environmental problems have deteriorated to
threaten the future of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Sezer issued the warning in a message on the occasion of the
United Nations "Combat Against Desertification Day," which falls on
June 17 every year, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sezer noted it is getting more imperative to maintain
sustainable development, tackle the environmental problems so as to
hand over a clean world to the forthcoming generations.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the countries to embrace and implement the
principle of sustainable development and prevent squandering of
resources.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey supports the international initiatives and programs
regarding the solution of environmental problems," he said,
referring to the Turkish parliament's adoption of the United
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification which Ankara signed in
1994 and ratified in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sezer said priority should be given to activities aimed at
enhancing the environmental consciousness in the society.
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivity we show to environment will contribute to
significant solutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey promulgated a National Afforestation and Erosion Control
Mobilization Law in 1995 with the objective of increasing the
number of trees in the state forests and on land owned by juristic
persons and protecting environmental assets.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Disabled Persons Receive HK Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A prolific writer and a village
teacher in China's hinterland areas have been granted a Hong Kong
award for their tremendous courage and achievements in dealing
with disability and misfortune.
</P>
<P>
Rotary Club of Admiralty in Hong Kong presented its Outstanding
Disabled Persons Award 2000 to writer Liu Shui and teacher Wei
Yingjiang today. They both received a trophy, a certificate of
merit and a cash prize of 10,000 HK dollars (about 1,300 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Born in a poor family in northwest China's Gansu Province, Liu
Shui was left paralyzed after an illness when he was about two. He
began to write fiction in the 1980s. The 35-year-old writer has
published a good number of stories, poetry, and essays since 1983.
He is a member of the China Writers' Association and one of Ten
Outstanding Disabled Writers in China.
</P>
<P>
"It is the love of literature that has helped me deal with my
condition," said the writer who is confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yingjiang, who suffers from polio, was determined to launch
a school for his neighborhood in a remote mountainous village in
southwest China's Guizhou Province. In order to purchase textbooks
and stationery for poor students, he donated 1,000 yuan (about 120
U.S. dollars) which he had saved for his wedding.
</P>
<P>
"The award winners have demonstrated outstanding ability in
their personal endeavors and their commitment to the community,"
said Cheng Kai from the Chinese Disabled Persons' Federation.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth year in which the Award has been held in
Hong Kong and China's inland areas, which aims to "provide an
incentive to all disabled people who seek further advancement in
areas of personal achievement and public service." Ten disabled
Chinese have been given awards so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
here on Saturday that the Palestinian people have been frustrated
by the lack of progress in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a meeting
that Israel is not moving in the final-status talks and fails to
make serious proposals on solving the thorniest issues of which
nothing has changed, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr said after the
meeting.

Jewish settlements and the fate of Palestinian refugees, Moussa

<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo late Friday from Geneva to brief Mubarak
on his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Thursday. He often visits Egypt to consult with Mubarak on the
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Clinton, Arafat called on the United
States to pressure Israel into budging the peace process. Clinton,
however, turned down the demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross reportedly would visit
Israel early next week, followed by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright later June, to assess if conditions are ripe for
a meeting of Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed summit, Arafat said there are many
difficulties and obstacles in its convocation. He added that
preparations have to be made to create suitable climate for it.
</P>
<P>
The summit is intended to seek breakthroughs in the Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations for a final peace treaty by September 13. The
two sides have made little progress in the so-called final-status
talks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Urges to Combat Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
Saturday called for continued efforts in reinforcing partnership
with various agencies, community organizations and even
individuals worldwide to fight the menace of desertification.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification is the first
international treaty to focus on combating poverty and
environmental degradation in the rural areas in Africa, said
Executive Director Klaus Toepfe of the U.N. Environment Program.
</P>
<P>
In his message marking "World Day to Combat Desertification and
Drought", Toepfe said land degradation has affected some 1,900
million hectares of land worldwide and an estimated 500 million
hectares in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The loss of potential productivity due to soil erosion
worldwide is estimated to be equivalent to some 20 million tons of
grain per year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that there are close linkages between
desertification and poverty, saying no long-term strategy of
poverty eradication can succeed in the face of environmental
forces that promote persistent erosion of the physical resources
upon which poor people depend.
</P>
<P>
He said human and natural causes together lead to the worsening
of desertification, citing that this should be quite clear now in
Kenya given the present drought affecting the country.
</P>
<P>
Prevention and control of desertification requires much more
than money, he said, stressing that science and technology are
fundamental to improve the management of drylands.
</P>
<P>
According to Toepfe, the challenge before the global community
is to design mechanisms to increase people's participation in
working out dryland management schemes.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Chinese Association Calls for Racial Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Chinese
Association(MCA) Saturday called on the government to take stern
action against any party out to destroy the racial harmony in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in one of the 17 resolutions passed by
the MCA'S 47th annual general assembly here, covering party
affairs,politics, economy, education, religion and social matters.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also included a call to all Malaysians to give
their undivided support to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in his
efforts to counter all negative elements which could threaten
national unity and the development of a Malaysian identity.
</P>
<P>
The assembly called for stricter monitoring of privatized
projects by ensuring that these projects serve the interests of
the people."Otherwise, it will tarnish the image of good
governance and dilute the people's confidence in the Barisan
Nasional (BN) (National Front) government," the MCA said in a
statement at the end of the one-day assembly.
</P>
<P>
The party also wanted a more effective mechanism to monitor the
tendering and offering of contracts by government agencies so that
the process is just, transparent and efficiently carried out.
</P>
<P>
The largest Chinese-based party called on the Education
Ministry to take immediate steps to overcome the shortage of
teachers in Chinese primary schools and speed up the construction
of Chinese primary schools as well as the relocation of Chinese
schools to Chinese-populated areas.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the youth from being influenced by social ills and
other negative elements, the party urged the authorities to check
unhealthy activities such as drug addiction and gangsterism or
even set up a task force to coordinate all efforts to counter
violence and pornographic activities among the youth.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the current tendency toward religious
fanaticism that could create fear and disunity among the
multiracial and multireligious populace in the country, the party
thus welcomed the move to allow non-Muslims to utilize reserve
land for religious purposes in non-Muslim majority housing areas.
</P>
<P>
The general assembly of the MCA, the second largest political
party in Malaysia and a component of the ruling 14-party BN, was
opened by Mahathir who is the BN chairman.

<HEADLINE> Manila Welcomes Abu Sayyaf's Acceptance of Hostage Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government welcomed
the Abu Sayyaf's decision Saturday accepting Robert Aventajado
anew as the chief of a government team negotiating for the release
of 21 hostages held by the extremist group.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Ricardo Puno expressed optimism over
this development, saying this would hopefully get "back on track"
the negotiations for the release of the mostly foreign hostages
held captive on the Jolo island in the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"We view this as a welcome development and we hope that this
would pave the way for the resumption of serious negotiations
focusing on the urgent matter at hand, which is the speedy release
of all the hostages," said Puno, who is also the presidential
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, in a handwritten statement dated June 17,
announced that it was accepting Aventajado as the chief government
negotiator tasked to obtain the release of the hostages kidnapped
by the rebel group from a diving resort in neighboring Malaysia on
April 23, according to a press release from the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf leaders Mujib Susukan and Commander Robot said in
the statement that the group was ready to welcome Aventajado after
receiving the assurance that he would be "the last person to favor
military action" in resolving the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group demanded last Saturday the replacement of
Aventajado as chief negotiator because he hinted to reporters at
the possibility of a military rescue operation if the rebels
became unreasonable in their demands.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, however, clarified that his statements were taken
out of context by the media as he stressed that he would be the
last person to favor military action for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last Sunday to take three to four days
as a"cooling off" period to examine the Abu Sayyaf's demands,
which include the setting up of an independent Muslim state in the
south and the formation of a commission between the Philippines
and Malaysia to address the alleged maltreatment of Filipino
Muslims in the Malaysian state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The group has also reportedly demanded a total ban on
commercial fishing in the Sulu Sea and a ransom ranging from 15
million to 21 million U.S. dollars for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The government negotiating panel had one formal meeting with
the Abu Sayyaf on May 27. A second round of formal negotiations,
which was to have been held last Saturday, was scuttled by the
group's rejection of Aventajado.

<HEADLINE> 5 Filipino Children Hostages Released: TV Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Five school children taken hostage
by the extremist Abu Sayyaf group were released Saturday morning
to government officials in the southern Philippines, a report of
the ABS-CBN television said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the hostages are heading toward a
still unidentified destination aboard two military choppers.
</P>
<P>
The five children were among some 50 people seized by the Abu
Sayyaf from two elementary schools in Basilan Province in March.
</P>
<P>
Some of the captives were released earlier by the extremist
group in exchange for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
After the failure of peaceful efforts to secure the release of
the remaining hostages, which included teachers and a Catholic
priest, the military launched an assault on the Abu Sayyaf's
jungle hideout in Mount Puno Mohadje in April.
</P>
<P>
The clashes left dozens of soldiers and Abu Sayyaf gunmen dead.
Six hostages were also killed by the Abu Sayyaf although
government troops succeeded in rescuing several hostages.
</P>
<P>
The TV report said there are still three hostages remaining in
the hands of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Another group of the Abu Sayyaf is now holding 21 mostly
foreign hostages in Sulu Province in the southern Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Heavily armed gunmen shot dead
34 members of the Yadav community, including women and children,
in a village in Aurangabad district in East India's Bihar state
Friday night, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second major massacre in Bihar state. Last weekend,
12 villagers were killed in Nawada district.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 10 activists of the outlawed Ranvir Sena,
a private army of upper caste landlords, armed with self-loading
rifles and sharp-edged weapons, swooped on the hamlet of Miapur
and rained bullets on inmates after storming their houses as they
were prepared to go to sleep at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
All the 34 people were killed on the spot while 10 injured
persons have been admitted to the government hospital nearby for
treatment, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The killing appeared to be in retaliation to the massacre of 12
upper caste villagers in the neighboring Nawada district on the
intervening night of June 11-12.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52 people have been killed in three successive
massacres in Nawada and Aurangabad since this month.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Takers Accept Government Hostage Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government confirmed
Saturday that the extremist Abu Sayyaf which is holding 21
hostages has accepted Secretary Robert Aventajado as chief
government negotiator for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a press release that it hopes
negotiations to resume smoothly with this development.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Abu Sayyaf said in a handwritten statement
that it was ready to accept Aventajado anew as the chief
negotiator after receiving the assurance that he would be "the
last person to favor military action" in resolving the hostage
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the statement was signed by Abu
Sayyaf leaders Mujib Susukan and Commander Robot. It was hand-
carried by the group's emissaries to Manila and was personally
handed over to Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, chairman of the presidential flagships projects
committee, has been designated by President Joseph Estrada to lead
a government panel negotiating for the release of the mostly
foreign hostages kidnapped from Malaysia and brought to Sulu on
April 23.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf announced last week that it was rejecting
Aventajado as chief negotiator, pointing out that he was quoted by
the media as saying he would support a commando-type operation to
secure the hostages' freedom.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, however, clarified that his statements were taken
out of context as he stressed that he would be the last person to
favor military action for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said earlier that Aventajado will stay on as
chief negotiator and reiterated that the government's paramount
concern remains the safety and welfare of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced a three- to four-day cooling-off
period to review the Abu Sayyaf's conditions for the hostages'
release, which include the creation of an independent Islamic
state in Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that there is no plan by Malaysia or any foreign
government to pay ransom for the safe release of 21 hostages kept
by Abu Sayyaf extremists in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora dismissed as hearsay news
reports that Malaysia had offered to pay 2.7 million U.S.dollars
for nine of the hostages, who are Malaysian nationals.
</P>
<P>
"That's not true, and the danger is that we are now reacting to
speculations instead of what is really happening," Zamora said in
a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, President Joseph Estrada received an
assurance from Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Serisyed Hamid
Alvar during their meeting at the Presidential Palace Thursday
that Malaysia would not pay ransom.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian official also assured the president that
there are no separate negotiations going on for the hostages'
release,as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
"We talked to the Malaysian foreign minister two days ago. He
denied any separate negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fresh from a cooling-off period, government negotiators hope to
resume negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf this weekend for the
release of the hostages, said Zamora.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, including three Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos,
were kidnapped from an island resort off Sabah, Malaysia, on April
23 and taken to the Philippine island of Jolo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Refutes Seizure Of Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said his government has no intention to seize foreign owned mines
but only wants to pursue its police of indigenity, the daily
Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his party's supporters in Kadoma in central
Zimbabwe, Mugabe accused the international media of misquoting him
as saying that the government would seize foreign owned mines.
</P>
<P>
"I was misquoted by the international press. I did not say we
were going to take the gold mines. I never said so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I said we shall pursue the policy of empowerment and
indigenization with vigour," he said, adding "that means we want
to see more of our people entering manufacturing, mining and
commerce."
</P>
<P>
There won't be any seizure of gold mines, he said, stressing
that "what we would pursue is the policy of empowerment and
getting our multi-national companies to open up to some of the
black entrepreneurs."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government would pursue with vigour the
policy of indigenity to speed up the economic empowerment of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
Independent, a british newspaper, reported this week that
President Mugabe said in an interview that after the land issue
was settled, the government would shift its attention to mines.
</P>
<P>
The story was widely quoted by other foreign media and
international news agencies.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Meets EU Fish Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has met all the European
Community requirements for lifting their ban on fish exports
imposed on the East African country in early 1999, the New Vision
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fish, water and sediment samples had been sent to the Food and
Research Institute of the Netherlands for laboratory analysis and
the results were good so far, State Minister for Agriculture and
fisheries Fred Mukisa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said talks were going on between the European Union (EU)
fish importing countries and the Uganda government to work out
modalities to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries has done its
best to address all the requirements needed by the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a new Fisheries Bill to address all
weaknesses and loopholes in the existing law was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries sector is one of Uganda's major export earners. The
ban imposed by the EU on imports of fish from Uganda has resulted
in a loss of more than 30 million U.S. dollars for the country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Children Conditions Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The livelihood of Tanzanian
children has been improved but more needed to be done in this
regard, said Tanzanian Vice President Omar Ali Juma on Friday
while celebrating the African Child Day.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at a gathering here, Juma said that the
infant death rate in Tanzania has reduced from 115 out of every
1000 children in 1990 to 91 last year.
</P>
<P>
Following a nationwide vaccination campaign, the death rate of
600 children below five years old out of every 100,000 children
born alive in 1978 was reduced to 42 last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the death rate of pregnant women was
still as high as 52.9 percent due to poverty and poor
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
According to Juma, children's enrollment for primary education
has been increased from 72 percent in 1993 to 82 percent last year
but the number of those who completed the education was still low.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the communities in the country to observe the
rights of the children and try to alleviate poverty which has
stripped them of basic social services.
</P>
<P>
The vice president hailed the United Nations Children Fund
(UNICEF), Plan International and other non-governmental
organizations for their efforts in improving the livelihood of
Tanzanian children over the past years.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Mwantunu Malale, Permanent Secretary of
the Ministry of Community Development, Women Affairs and Children,
said that children are the "seed bank" of the country and they
should be taken good care of to become future leaders and good
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Malale urged parents and guardians to regard their children not
only as decorations of their families but also as human beings
whose rights ought to be met.
</P>
<P>
The African Child Day is celebrated on June 16 every year
across the continent to commemorate the death of 15,000 children
killed on the same day in 1976 in Soweto town , South Africa when
they were protesting against the then apartheid regime.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import 600,000 Tons of Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Following the suspension of duty
of imported maize by the government, millers in Kenya will import
600,000 tons of the product from South Africa in the forthcoming
months, local media reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the maize from South Africa will see a drop in
the prices of maize and its flour by up to 15 percent, said Tahir
Sheikh Said, a leading miller in the country, on Friday in the
Indian Ocean port city Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
He explained that starting from August the price of a
90-kilogram bag of maize might drop to as low as 1,000 shillings
(about 13 U.S. dollars) and a 2-kilogram packet of maize flour to
about 46 shillings (about 60 U.S. cents) .
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Said, the first consignment of the imported
maize is expected to arrive in Mombasa on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Due to prolonged drought, millions of Kenyans are under the
threat of famine. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced on
June 14 to waiver duty on imported maize to encourage millers to
import more of the product and build up the depleted food reserve.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks on Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
Saturday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They were expected
to discuss the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks and Arafat's recent meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
After a tete-a-tete session of talks, Mubarak and Arafat were
joined by their senior aides, including Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa and Arafat's deputy, Secretary General of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Mahmoud Abass.
</P>
<P>
Details of the talks were not immediately available. But it was
expected that Arafat would brief the Egyptian leader on his meeting
with Clinton last Thursday at the White House and the ongoing
negotiations with Israel in the Washington area for a final peace
agreement scheduled for September 13 on thorny issues including
border, Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Clinton, Arafat called on the U.S. to
pressure Israel into budging the peace process. Clinton, however,
turned down the demand. Meanwhile, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
reportedly would visit Israel early next week, followed by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright later June, to assess if
conditions are right for a meeting of Clinton, Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here late Friday. He frequently visits Cairo to
consult on the peace process with Mubarak and seek advice from him.
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
plays a key role in mediating the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's external debt is
estimated to have risen to 25.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
June 2000, the newspaper Business Recorder reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the annual external debt service payments have
recorded a substantial increase, thereby squeezing the net inflow
of foreign resources. The estimated foreign debt makes 39.4
percent of GDP and about 306 percent of the export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rescheduling of debt, service payments during 1999-
2000 are expected to decline by 8.5 percent to 1.4 billion dollars
or 2.2 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects Fish Self-Sufficiency This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it has finished various fishery projects all over
the country to boost fish production and help achieve fish self-
sufficiency this year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said his department is
accelerating fishery projects nationwide such as fish ports, ice
plants, cold storage facilities and fish port processing centers
to ensure a steady and affordable fish supply.
</P>
<P>
"The fishery sector's performance this year will likely be a
record-breaking feat with volume likely to reach 3.1 million
metric tons, up by 8.3 percent from the 2.86 million tons recorded
in 1999,"he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the construction of these fishery projects
amounting to 350 million pesos (8.75 million U.S. dollars) would
increase fish production and reduce fish wastage.
</P>
<P>
With higher production, the country may become self-sufficient
in fish this year, enabling millions of low-income Filiinos to
avail themselves of this affordable source of protein in their
diet, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If production growth trends are maintained, we may even become
a surplus producer and fish exporter before President Joseph
Estrada's term ends in 2004," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
Angara made the projection after the completion of some 35
major fisheries projects, which will directly address the problem
of wastage estimated at 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's fishery production grew by 3.7 percent last year.
The rise was one of the biggest recorded for the sector in the
1990s considering the fact that the 1998 growth rate barely stood
at 0.71 percent and the country even suffered a production decline
of 0.09 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Indian Rupee Continues to Fall? by Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee, which lost 2.7
percent of its value during the 1999-2000 fiscal year, has
continued to fall and slid by nearly 2.5 percent since early May
due to a widening trade gap and shrinking foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
The rupee exchange rates, which dropped from 43.68 rupees per U.
S. dollar on May 9 to 44.06 rupees the next day, further plunged
to a record low of 44.95 rupees per dollar on June 8, but
recovered to close at 44.7 per dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
A study undertaken by the Association Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of India recently predicted that the rupee will come
under further pressure to stabilize at between 46.5 and 47 rupees
toward the end of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the most important sign of the pressure on the
rupee comes from the trade front. In the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
which ended on March 31, the country was able to hold down the
trade deficit at 8.6 billion dollars despite a 65-percent increase
in the oil bill.
</P>
<P>
But they said the stable level of trade deficit was mainly due
to the fact that the non-oil imports rose by only 1.7 percent
although exports went up by 11.7 percent in the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest figures indicate that this advantage is
unlikely to persist in the current fiscal year. The trade deficit
in April, the first month of fiscal 2000-2001, doubled to 1.1
billion dollars as against 500 million dollars in the same period
last year. This was because the import bill surged to 43.6 percent
though exports went up by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the non-oil imports were also gaining momentum for
the first time in two years and suddenly recovered by 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As against an estimated 11 billion dollars, the actual bill of
oil imports is expected to range between 13 billion and 16 billion
dollars in the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the consequence of both these factors would be a
sharp increase in trade deficit in this fiscal year and further
downward pressure on the rupee.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC, Indian Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha said, "I am not worried as such about what is happening in
the foreign exchange market on a temporary basis. What worries me
is the long-term trend."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he expected the current pressure on the rupee
to ease. "There must be an inflow of fresh funds and from whatever
information I have, I have reasons to hope that the flow of funds
will improve and therefore the pressure that we are seeing on the
rupee should go away," he added.

LUSAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Foot and mouth disease has
reportedly broken out in some areas in Western Province in Zambia,
the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Saturday.

<P>
Council secretary Martin Mutale disclosed that the disease was

The report quoted a peasant farmer in the Sesheke district as

PYONGYANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Red Cross

<HEADLINE> Record-Breaking Heatwave Takes Toll of Nine in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Pletz, director of Emergency Medical Services for San
Mateo County just south of San Francisco, said the victims were
all elderly and that they were apparently succumbed to
complications from the record-breaking heat that scorched the area
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two people died at a local nursing home which did not have air
conditioning, while others died after attempting yard work in
temperatures that went as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this and I've been in this job
12 years," Pletz said Friday. "It is very clear to us that we had
a very, very severe problem."
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, which likes to boast that it has "natural air
conditioning" thanks to its usually cool and foggy coastal climate,
sweltered through an unusual heatwave Wednesday as temperatures
smashed records across northern California.
</P>
<P>
In downtown San Francisco, the temperature broke an all-time
record for the date of 103 degrees Fahrenheit -- tying the record
for the hottest day ever since the city began keeping records in
1871.
</P>
<P>
Officials and emergency medical technicians around the area
said the record-breaking heat was definitely a factor in a region
which usually enjoys famously cool summers. Many expected the
final toll to rise as more deaths are reported.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said the heatwave, which began on Tuesday and
spiked on Wednesday, was due to a high pressure ridge that stalled
over the region, shutting down sea breezes which normally blow
cooling fog over the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
That fog began rolling back Thursday, pushing coastal
temperatures down some 40 degrees to relatively normal levels in
the mid-60s.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said temperatures in the area were
expected to remain normal throughout the weekend, although next
week could see the heat turned up again.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's external debt is estimated to have
risen to 25.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of June 2000, the
newspaper Business Recorder reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the annual external debt service payments have
recorded a substantial increase, thereby squeezing the net inflow
of foreign resources. The estimated foreign debt makes 39.4
percent of GDP and about 306 percent of the export earnings. Due
to the rescheduling of debt, service payments during 1999-2000 are
expected to decline by 8.5 percent to 1.4 billion dollars or 2.2
percent of GDP. (Pakistan-External Debts)

ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Export Promotion
Bureau(EPB) has set an export target of 14 billion U.S. dollars to
be achieved by 2003, a local newspaper quoted EPB Chairman Tarique
Ikram as saying.
</P>
<P>
A six-point strategy, which is based on an evaluation of world
demand of goods and services, has been evolved for the new target.
This will help achieve the desired quantum jump in exports, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the new strategy, the EPB will focus on increase in
exports in areas such as fisheries, software, fruit and vegetable,
engineering goods, auto parts, gems, diamonds, jewelry, marble,
granite and tourism, said the EPB chairman, adding that through
the new strategy, additional export target of 500 million U.S.
dollars would be achieved in less explored areas like China, South
America, Africa, Australia and Eastern Europe.

WARSAW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, upon a suggestion by Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
during a cabinet shakeup, appointed Ronislaw Komorowski as the new
defense minister Friday to replace Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
President Kwasniewski thanked former Defense Minister
Onyszkiewicz for his efforts to work for Poland's entry into NATO,
but he criticized sharply the recent work of the Defense Ministry,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said the top priority for the new defense minister
is to strengthen the position of Poland in NATO, to modernize the
army by finding more capital and to carry on internal reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reports said President Kwasniewski on the same day also
appointed Jerzy Kropiwnicki as the minister of regional
development and housing, who retains the post as the head of the

<P>
The five ministers included Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
and Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz.

it was finally accepted by President Kwasniewski on June 6, when
he appointed Economy Minister Janusz Steinhoff as deputy prime
minister and three other AWS officials as new ministers.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Stay Alive With Win In NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 16 (Xinhua) -- For the sixth time in nine
playoff elimination games this season, the Los Angeles Lakers came
up short, losing to the Indiana Pacers 120-87 Friday night in Game
5 of the NBA Finals, trimming their lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who lost two games to the Sacramento Kings, another
to the Phoenix Suns and two more to the Portland Trail Blazers
once they got within one game of winning those series, seemed a
step slow on this night, especially on defense.
</P>
<P>
Before Game 5, Lakers coach Phil Jackson admitted that with a 3-
1 lead, it was difficult to keep his team from being overconfident,
especially considering the Lakers haven't lost three straight
games since the 1999 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Following developments confirmed exactly what he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Lakers, as a team, obviously didn't play with
all their strength and let the Pacers stay alive for the time
being, partly because this way they can clinch the NBA
championship during one of the final two games at home, according
to a source close to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers fan in Los Angeles, with the Monday ticket for Game
6, are so nutty over dramatic endings at Staples Center in Los
Angeles. Preparation for a grand celebration is underway.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it was sure that, led by Jalen Rose, the
Pacers put on a fantastic shooting display that helped to keep the
Lakers' championship plans on hold.
</P>
<P>
Starting 6-for-6 on 3-pointers and shooting 75 percent in the
first quarter, the Pacers manhandled the Lakers by as much as 33
points Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to see the Lakers celebrate on our court," said
Rose, "We're a team that plays better when our backs are against
the wall, and 3-1 was a big wall."
</P>
<P>
"We have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,"
said his teammate Raggie Miller. "Everybody expects us to lose
anyway, let's let it hang out and have fun."
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal scored 35 for the Lakers but Kobe Bryant,
overtime hero of Game 4 despite a sprained ankle, got only eight
points Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Miller refused to take credit for Bryant's poor showing. "I
think Kobe Bryant held himself to eight points. He had a lot of
good looks," said Miller.
</P>
<P>
Game 6 will be Monday night at Los Angeles and Game 7, if
necessary, will be Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals,
but the Pacers look to be a strong candidate to be the first if
they can shoot as well as they did Friday night.

<HEADLINE> A Non-Malay Can Become Malaysia's Prime Minister: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian prime minister
need not come from the Malays alone, non-Malay bumiputeras (
aboriginals) may also become the prime minister of Malaysia one
day when Malaysians of Chinese or Indian descent are accepted by
all the races, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The process towards this end has started. Believe me, if we
are all sensitive to the tastes of Malaysians, the issue of race
and origin will no longer obstruct any Malaysian from holding any
post," he said when opening the 47th general assembly of the
Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), the second largest political
party in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperate in the political, economic and social fields and we
will all eradicate racialism and accept just any Malaysian to
become prime minister and fill any post," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) component parties,
including the MCA which is the largest Chinese-based party, should
work towards this end with the approach that is unique to Malaysia,
Mahathir, chairman of the ruling 14-party BN, said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians are mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Indians.
In the Malaysian history of its independence, the prime
ministership has always been held by Malays.

OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
reached new agreements on defense and satellite operations Friday
in Washington, according to the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright exchanged notes on the extension of the
North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD) Agreement for another
five years from its current expiry date of May 12, 2001, said the
government announcement.
</P>
<P>
In his own statement, Axworthy said "NORAD has been the
foundation of Canada-U.S. defense cooperation since 1958" and the
extension" reflects the special relationship we enjoy with the
United States and is a natural complement to the extensive
political, economic and social ties that link our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Axworthy and Albright also signed an agreement on the operation
of commercial remote sensing satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released here Friday, the two countries
said that the agreement is aimed at fostering "broad private uses
of commercial remote sensing satellite systems, while protecting
common national security and foreign policy interests."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement essentially applies to high-performance earth
observation satellites used for such purposes as cartography, land-
use and, natural resource and environment management. It does not
apply to meteorological, navigation or communications satellites,"
said the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
One of the key operations under the agreement is that of
RADARSAT-2, a Canadian synthetic aperture radar satellite system
to be launched by a U.S. commercial space launch vehicle in 2003,
according to the Canadian government.

<P>
Juma said that following a nationwide vaccination campaign, the
death rate of 600 children below five years of age out of every
100,000 children born alive in 1978 was reduced to 42 last year.
However, he noted that the death rate of pregnant women was still
as high as 529 for every 100,000 children born alive due to
poverty and poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said children's enrollment for primary education has been
increased from 72 percent in 1993 to 82 percent last year but the
number of those who completed the education was still low.
</P>
<P>
The Vice President hailed the United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF), Plan International and other Non-Governmental
Organizations for their services of improving children's
livelihood over the past years.
</P>
<P>
At the same gathering, a senior Tanzanian official said that
children below 18 years of age were 50 percent of the population
in the country at present.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Community Development,
Women Affairs and Children Mwantunu Malale said that children were
the seedbank and needed good care to ensure they develop
profoundly to become future leaders and citizens.
</P>
<P>
Malale said urged parents and guardians to regard their
children not only as decorations of their families but rather as
human beings whose rights ought to be met.  The African
Children's Day is celebrated on June 16 every year across the
continent to commemorate the death of 15,000 children killed on
the same date in 1976 at Soweto town in South Africa when they
were protesting against the then apartheid regime.

<HEADLINE> More Dumped NATO Bombs in Adriatic Found, Fishermen Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Angry Italian fishermen with the
Fishermen's Union of Venice on Friday lodged a protest with the
government over the discovery of more NATO bombs dumped in the
Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of protest, the Fishermen's Union urged a prompt
action from the government to thoroughly clear the area they rely
on heavily for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
New bombs were found only 14 sea miles offshore Venice, and
they were of the same type with those that exploded and injured
innocent Italian fishermen last year.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen also demanded the Italian government pay for
their losses due to the suspension of daily fishing activities
over safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
Alarm has been growing in the fishing sector over the impact of
last year's war in Kosovo. Reports said that some NATO pilots
dumped their bombs in the Adriatic on their way back to Italian
bases from missions in Yugoslavia. Several Venetian fishermen had
been injured when the bombs exploded in their fishing nets.

<HEADLINE> Putin Ends His Visit to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian President Vadimir
Putin ended his visit to Germany on Friday and left for Moldava.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit Putin had talks with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, President Johannes Rau, the former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and leaders of German business.
</P>
<P>
The visit opened a new chapter in the bilateral relations.
Russia and Germany are both big European countries and the
bilateral relations play a very important role in their foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
"We want a comprehensive new start to German-Russian relations,
" said Schroeder at a joint news briefing after his talks with
Putin.
</P>
<P>
And Putin said : "Germany remains our leading partner in
Europe and the world."
</P>
<P>
Although Putin had stressed before his visit that he would not
develop private friendship, he invited Schroeder to make a private
visit to Moscow with family over Christmas. Schroeder accepted
Putin's invitation and two families will gather in Moscow at
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
About the question of the proposed U.S. National Defense
Missile system Schroeder said he and Putin had agreed firmly the
current arms control accord needed to be observed and to prevent a
new arms race.
</P>
<P>
The proposed National Defense Missile system of the United
States will install radar sites and 100 interceptors based in
Alaska which could shoot down missiles fired at the U.S. by so-
called rogue states. Both Russia and Germany are opposed to the
plan and they expressed this would harm the 1972 signed Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty by the former Soviet Union and the
United States. The treaty strictly limited such systems. Putin and
Schroeder fear it could set off a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
Russia called for a system of more limited Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) system which would guard only against shorter-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Putin warned Europe in his speech to be opposed to the U.S.
NMD and reaffirmed Russia's opposition to any further NATO
enlargement. Because three states of the former Warsaw Pacts, the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland had been received as the new
members of the NATO last spring and the NATO will still enlarge
eastwards and is prepared to receive more Eastern and Southeastern
European states into the organization in the future years. Russia
is firmly against the eastwards enlargement of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has also expressed his big concern over the U.S. NMD
proposal. He had stated his attitude to Bill Clinton while Clinton
visited Berlin earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
About Putin's proposal Schroeder said : "We found the
recommendation made by President Putin are really worthy of
consideration." But Schroeder stressed that it should not harm the
friendly relations between Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations are another main issue of the
bilateral talks. The Russian natural gas giant Gazprom had signed
a memorandums of understanding with several German companies at in
the presence of Putin and Schroeder earlier.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest creditor of Russia. Russia owes German
banks 75 billion marks (37 billion dollars). According to German
officials there was no agreement on rescheduling of Russian debt
and the resumption of German state "Hermes" export guarantees.
But it was said earlier that it could come to an agreement on the
Russian debt.
</P>
<P>
About the return of the German cultural and art treasures
there was no progress. "We are prepared to continue this dialogue,
" said Putin and added :"We must move toward each other."
</P>
<P>
Russia and Germany agreed to set up a commission to discuss
this question further this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Schroeder has agreed they will meet again next April
in St. Petersburg.

<HEADLINE> EU Needs Reforms to Welcome Newcomers: French FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said here on Friday that the European Union (EU)
needs reforms to clear the way for its eastern expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Czech Foreign Ministry, Vedrine said that
before substantial talks on the EU's eastern expansion, the EU
must complete its internal reforms first.
</P>
<P>
While setting the deadline for EU reforms by the end of this
year, Vedrine refused to give a timetable for the EU to accept new
members.
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate to set such a timetable for the EU,"
Vedrine stressed. He also indicated at a meeting with Czech Prime
Minister Milos Zeman that the EU will not be able to accept new
members until January 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister arrived in Prague Thursday for a 3-
day visit before his upcoming inauguration on July 1 as the new EU
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's visit came when applicants for EU membership are
growing more and more impatient with the EU's eastward expansion.
Such applicant countries as the Czech Republic insist that the EU
stick to its promise to accept new members at the beginning of
2003 and complete accession negotiations with those applied first
by the end of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique House Projects for Flood Victims Awaits Promised Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Houses will be built within six
months in Kongolote, a suburb of the southern Mozambican city of
Matola, for more than 5,000 victims of February's floods, when
promised funding from Western donors is made available, said
Silvano Langa, director of the National Disasters Management
Institute (INGC).
</P>
<P>
He said that it would be ideal to have houses built by October
before the next rainy season starts.
</P>
<P>
Almost all victims to be resettled used to live in flimsy
houses in the outer suburbs of Matola which were flooded out in
the February deluge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the visit of U.S. Treasury secretary Lawrence
Summers, who arrived in Maputo on Friday, Langa said that if the
next rainy season starts before the houses are built, these people
will be rendered homeless again because the tents, which house
three to four families each, will be damaged by that time.
</P>
<P>
Langa said that the situation in Kongolote is similar to that
of other accommodation centers in the flooded areas in the
southern and central regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Langa expressed optimism about a swift disbursing of
the funds pledged by donors at the Rome conference in May, saying
that Summers' visit "is as good sign."
</P>
<P>
The United States is the biggest donor, pledging to provide 131
million out of the promised 452.9 million U.S. dollars for
resettlement and infrastructures reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the displaced in Kongolote, Summers said that he was
well aware of the full drama they had experienced, through the
images of the floods he had seen on television.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Maputo, Summers is also to meet
with President Joaquim Chissano.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue With Its Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
continue with its privatization program despite the present
sluggish market, Deputy to State Minister of Investment and State
Enterprises Development I Nyoman Tjager said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to move on, there will be no delay," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization of 10 state firms would proceed as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Nyoman was responding to growing concerns that privatization
would fail to meet the revenue target, as the market had
deteriorated due to prevailing political uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to raise some 6.5 trillion rupiah (764
million U.S. dollars) from the privatization of 10 state firms
during the April-December 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But in the past two months, the Jakarta Stock Exchange's index
has dropped to an average of 450 from over 500.
</P>
<P>
"The market can't be bad all the time, we hope it will soon
improve," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government had expected to meet the target through sales of
only eight firms: general mining company PT Aneka Tambang, airport
operator PT Angkasa Pura II, coal mining company PT Bukit Asam,
plantation companies PT Perkebunan Nusantara III and IV,
fertilizer producer PT Pupuk Kaltim and pharmaceutical
manufacturers PT Indo Farma and PT Kimia Farma.
</P>
<P>
However, early this month it added surveyor firm PT Sucofindo
and trading company PT Kerta Niaga to the list.
</P>
<P>
Nyoman said the additional two companies would make up only a
minor percentage of the overall proceeds from the privatization of
10 companies.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Orders All Foreign Troops Leave DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday unanimously adopted a resolution which demands all foreign
troops, especially the Rwandan and Ugandan forces, withdraw from
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted at the end of the two-day talks
between Security Council members and all the conflicting parties,
with the presence of foreign ministers or senior government
officials from six African countries involved in the 22-month-long
DRC fighting.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that Rwanda and Uganda pull out all
their troops "without further delay," but it said that each phase
of the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces should be
reciprocated by other armies in the central African country,
according to the timetable set forth in the Lusaka Cease-fire
Agreement, signed in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda backed rebels in fighting against the DRC
Government of President Laurent Kabila, who were supported by
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also said that Rwanda and Uganda should make
reparations for the "loss of life and property damage they had
inflicted on civilians" in Kisangani of northeastern DRC, which is
known as the nation's diamond trade center.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council expressed "its readiness to
consider possible measures which could be imposed" to enforce
compliance with its demand, said the resolution. However, it did
not specify what the possible measures are despite the statement
the Council was acting under Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter stipulates punitive and
mandatory measures, including economic and diplomatic sanctions
and other military options if sanctions are not enough.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called on the DRC Government to allow full
participation of all political factions in a national dialogue as
called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The DRC Government should cooperate with former Botswana
President Ketumile Masire, the facilitator for the talks who were
appointed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea agreed to sell striker Chris Sutton to Middlesbrough for
six million pounds (9.07 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed a six million pounds deal with Middlesbrough,"
Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson told ClubCall on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Chris obviously knows that through his agent and really it's
whether he can agree the deal with Middlesbrough and whether he
wants to go to Middlesbrough," a Reuters report quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough now have permission to talk to the former
Blackburn forward, who cost fellow premier league club Chelsea a
then club record 10 million pounds a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Sutton had a disappointing first year at Chelsea, managing just
three goals for the Stamford Bridge club.
</P>
<P>
He did not even make the substitutes' bench for Chelsea's FA
Cup final victory over Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink from Atletico
Madrid for a British record-equalling 15 million pounds earlier
this month raised further doubts about Sutton's future.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Starts Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kicking off his scheduled cabinet
reshuffle, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on Saturday appointed
Minister of Post, Telephone and Telegraph (PTT) Mohammad Reza Aref
as vice president and chairman of the newly-formed State Management
and Planning Organization (SMPO).
</P>
<P>
The SMPO is a merger of the Planning and Budget Organization
(PBO) and the Civil Administration and Recruitment Organization
(CARO), the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The SMPO will be responsible for drafting policies on national
economic and employment affairs, major issues facing Khatami's
government and the new parliament dominated by his reformist
allies.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also appointed PTT deputy minister Nasrollah Jahangard
as the caretaker, former PBO Chairman Mohammad Ali Najafi and
former CARO Secretary-General Mohammad Baqerian as presidential
advisors.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the reformists won a landslide victory over the
conservatives in the February parliamentary election, President
Khatami was urged to make a big change to his cabinet by removing
those who are not fully coordinated with the reformists.
</P>
<P>
The reformist Iran Daily newspaper said on Tuesday that Khatami
will change at least eight ministers and several vice presidents
following the formation of the reformist parliament on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the reshuffle will touch first vice president,
vice president for executive affairs, minister of PTT, defense,
culture and Islamic guidance, interior, education as well as
economic and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's current cabinet, formed in August 1997, is a coalition
of the reformist party of Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF),
the centralist Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) and
the leftist Assembly of Combatant Clergy (ACC) headed by the new
Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karrubi.
</P>
<P>
However, relations between the IIPF and the PCEI soured before
the February parliamentary elections as the IIPF strongly opposed
the participation of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani in the
polling while the PCEI supported Rafsanjani to run for a seat.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, current chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, quitted his seat in the Majlis (Parliament)
though the Guardians Council, the top election watchdog, promoted
his position to 20th from 30th at the list of 30 winners in Tehran
constituency.

<HEADLINE> Saudi-Yemeni Border Treaty to Forge Closer Ties: Saudi Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A recently-signed border treaty
between Saudi Arabia and Yemen will contribute to closer ties
between the two neighbors on the Arabian Peninsula, said Saudi
Interior Minister Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty for land and sea borders between Saudi Arabia and
Yemen has been signed thanks to the resolve and strong will of the
leaderships of the two countries, Aziz said at a press conference
held in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the two countries from now on will be
linked by stronger ties other than borders or pieces of land here
and there, the Saudi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen Monday signed a final land and sea
border agreement, following persistent bilateral efforts aimed to
solve their long-running border dispute.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that resolving standing issues with a view to
maintaining stability will serve the interests of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will in no doubt promote security coordination
between the two countries, especially on border areas, said the
minister, adding security is one of the issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the signing of the treaty will open different
areas for bilateral cooperation and Saudi investors will hopefully
be allured to explore Yemeni markets. And there will also be Saudi-
Yemeni joint ventures in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that bilateral cooperation was in place even before
the signing of the treaty, and the border disputes have in no way
affected amity, understanding and cooperation between the two
brotherly countries.
</P>
<P>
He also denied allegations that his country solved its border
problems with neighboring countries without fairness, saying that "
We did not take one single meter out of any country."

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Not to Boost Border Surveillance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Guatemala City,
Belizean Prime Minister Said Musa asked British military,
political, financial, and technological support until the
territorial conflict with Guatemala is settled.
</P>
<P>
Britain guaranteed Musa the presence in Belize of a defense
unit known as "Batsub," said the Belizean Government press office.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Vice President Francisco Reyes commented in answer
to this report that his country is not aggressive and considers
unnecessary the British support to its former colony.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that his country will continue seeking a solution to
the controversy the peaceful way, at a national as well as at an
international level.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Juan de Dios Estrada also said that no additional
troops will be deployed to guarantee the security in the border
with Belize, because "it is unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Vice Minister Ramiro Ordonez said that the
announcement of military support to Belize is "a pretext" to avoid
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan diplomacy considers the Belize request to Britain as
a tactical maneuver to continue propagating internationally the
image of Guatemala as a warring country that will attack Belize at
some moment.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a member of the so-called Belize Council,
Alberto Herrarte, said that the presence of British ships and
troops in the country could be considered in the country as "an
act of intimidation" that must not cause concern to Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
Belize obtained unilaterally its independence from Britain on
September 21, 1981, and Guatemala acknowledged the fact 10 years
later by establishing diplomatic relations, but without renouncing
to its claim of the 12,000 square kilometers it has in that
territory.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Guatemalan and Belizean foreign ministers is
scheduled for July at the Organization of American States (OAS),
which acts as a mediator in the controversy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting's goal is to agree on a summit of the chiefs of
state of the two countries to look for a solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> "La Nina" Weather Phenomenon to Last Until End of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Peruvian scientist, national coordinator for the "El Nino"
phenomenon Biological Impact Monitoring Network, made up of
Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Panama, alerted about the
sequels of this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Tarazona explained that "La Nina" will cool the sea temperature
below normal limits and will cause serious climate disturbances in
Peruvian soil.
</P>
<P>
Another of the effects will be the apparition of opaline waters
in the Pacific Ocean, defective in oxygen, that will diminish the
presence of schools of fish and will reduce the productivity of
fishing activities, said Tarazona.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian authorities have also warned that this meteorological
phenomenon has produced high tides along the Peruvian coast with
floods and paralyzed fishing with traditional means.
</P>
<P>
Some experts disagree about the duration of the phenomenon.
Some said that it is in a waning cycle, but others warned that it
will last until the first months of next year.
</P>
<P>
The biological indexes show that La Nina will intensify with
the arrival of winter and will continue until the last days of the
year, said Tarazona.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has also caused natural disasters in Chile,
where there have been recently torrential rains with floods and
material damages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Neurologist on Impact of Genetic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Advances in genetic research,
such as the sequencing of the human genome, open the door for new
approaches to the discovery and development of drugs and the
practice of medicine, said a renowned American neurologist.
</P>
<P>
In a review supplement published in the latest issue of Nature
magazine, Allen Roses, a member of the prestigious (U.S.)
Institute of Medicine, put into context what the information
yielded from the human genome means for identifying drug targets
and using those targets to discover new medicines.
</P>
<P>
Roses predicted that pharmacogenetics, the study of how
individual genetic differences influence the variability in
patients' responses to drugs, will improve the prescribing process
by enabling physicians to select, at the time of diagnosis, the
medicine most likely to be safe and effective for the individual
patient.
</P>
<P>
"There is still much work to be done to convert information
from the human genome into better medicine," Roses said in the
review. "Once we have found a gene which predisposes individuals
to a certain disease, it could take 10-15 years before a medicine
results."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the ability to use information from patients'
DNA to more accurately prescribe medicines that are more likely to
be beneficial and less likely to cause serious side effects, will
occur sooner than many think.
</P>
<P>
In three to five years, he said, new techniques in
pharmacogenetics will enable a physician to compare a small part
of an individual's genetic profile to a "medicine response profile
" to predict whether the patient is likely to benefit from a given
medicine or is likely to experience side effects.
</P>
<P>
Roses also explained a concept of how it may be possible to use
DNA technology to establish an enhanced drug surveillance system.
The current system documents adverse events reported during the
use of a medicine in clinical practice but often there is little
no predictive information to help patients who are subsequently
prescribed the medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said that blood samples for DNA analysis could be taken from
patients who receive a new medicine. In the event of a rare but
serious side effect, the DNA samples of those who experience the
side effect can be compared with samples of those who did not.
This will enable differences in DNA that are associated with the
side effect to be identified and incorporated into a medicine
response profile. DNA from subsequent patients can then be used to
identify those who are susceptible to the side effect before the
medicine is prescribed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressional Investigators Question Missile Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report circulated in Congress that has yet to be made
public, the General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that it will
be difficult to know whether the missile shield will function
properly during an attack because of strict limitations on the
Pentagon's ability to test the system of powerful targeting radars,
interceptor missiles and high-speed computers, the newspaper said
in Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the technological uncertainties of the
system greatly increase the prospects for delays, with each month
of delay increasing costs by 124 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report by GAO, Congress' investigative arm, also said the
intelligence community is uncertain about what countermeasures a "
rogue nations" like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) or Iran would employ in attempting to defeat a missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
next spring to start building a powerful radar station in Alaska
State in the first phase of an NMD shield to be operational by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Police Thwarts Robbery of Archaeological Jewels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Attorney General Office (PGR) said Saturday that
the jewels were being transported in a passenger bus of the "
Estrellas del Pacifico" line from Iguala, in Mexico's southern
state of Guerrero, to the northern border city of Tijuana with
United States.
</P>
<P>
The PGR press release said that the cargo was made up of three
jade masks from the pre-Christian era, and a figure depicting a
coyote dating from 500 or 700 years of the Christian era.
</P>
<P>
It said that the jewels were traveling in the package section
of the bus, but the PGR did not offer more details to avoid
interfering with the investigations.
</P>
<P>
National Institute of Anthropology and History director Hector
Torres said that the archeological pieces, that could have been
pilfered from some museum in the southeast of the country, were
being analyzed by the personnel of the institute.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that the masks of jade were covered with mud, and
that they are of Olmeca origin, so they probably originated in the
states of Tabasco, Guerrero, Oaxaca, or Veracruz.

Antigua and Barbuda tobacco is as good as Cuba's in the opinion
of the Cuban experts, said Antigua and Barbuda Agriculture
Minister Rupert Sterling, as reported from Saint John, the capital

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Flies Aboard Osprey Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jones took the flight as a gesture of confidence in the hybrid
aircraft that hovers like a helicopter and flies like a plane.
</P>
<P>
The Osprey has been under heavy scrutiny since April 8 when one
of the five then in operation crashed while trying to land at an
airfield near Tucson, Arizona State. Nineteen Marines were killed
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Commandant made the flight at the Naval Air Weapons Station
in China Lake, California State.
</P>
<P>
On June 5, the Ospreys resumed "operational evaluation" flights
to determine their readiness to join the Marine Corps' active air
fleet, but have not been carrying passengers. Evaluation flights
were halted while the crash was investigated.
</P>
<P>
The Marines last month ruled out mechanical failure as a cause
of the crash, although the investigation is continuing. It was the
deadliest air disaster for the Marines since 22 died in a
helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were skeptical that Saturday's flight would prove much
if anything about the safety of the Osprey.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's ELN Invites FARC to National Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antonio Garcia, ELN second commander said Saturday that he has
no idea of the way this meeting will be held, but that he expects
the FARC to present its political plans.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the ELN, the second in importance guerrilla
force in the country after the FARC, said that the convention will
be held in the encounter zone, that includes the municipalities of
Cantagallo and San Pablo, in the northern department of Bolivar,
and El Yondo, in the neighboring department of Antioquia, an area
of 4,800 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the problems between the ELN and the FARC, Garcia
said that "it is like a family with brothers and sisters who
despite having the same parents and the same background, have
problems and difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The El Espectador daily commented that the ELN is acknowledging
with its invitation to the FARC a real fact, which is the
historical permanence of the FARC in the El Yondo zone, which
would result in a linking of the two processes of peace
negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
"The most important part of all this is that the participation
of the FARC could generate a coordination of the positions of the
different guerrillas in the peace process, which would be ideal
for a constituting process, to which the negotiations are
pretended to be directed," commented the El Espectador newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Andres Pastrana government started peace talks in January
of 1999 with the FARC, and also started some weeks ago direct
talks with the ELN.
</P>
<P>
 The FARC, which controls about 40 percent of Colombia and is
Latin America's largest and oldest surviving leftist rebel force,
is engaged in a slow-moving peace talks with the government. But
no cease-fire deal has been agreed on as part of the peace process,
which is aimed at ending a conflict that has taken 35,000 lives
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
 The FARC has some 1,5000 members, while the ELN has 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Computer Failure Causes Flight Chaos in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) - Air passengers across Britain still
face long delays late Saturday after a problem with a National Air
Traffic Services (NATS)computer.
</P>
<P>
British Airways has canceled several flights to Europe, and the
British Airports Authority (BAA) has advised all passengers to
check with their airlines before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
BBA's Ann Brophy said: "There are going to be delays. What we
don't want is lots of people coming to the airport only to be told
to come back tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Gatwick and Heathrow have been worst hit
but Mancheste, Belfast and Glasgow have also been affected.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for NATS said the computer problem had caused a "
nightmare" for holidaymakers. He advised tourists to keep in touch
with their tour operator or airline to find out what delays they
faced.
</P>
<P>
Observers said many of the hundreds of people delayed at the UK
's busiest airport, Heathrow, were incredulous that a single
technical failure could cause problems on such a scale.
</P>
<P>
NATS has promised a "thorough investigation" into the computer
breakdown, the second time the system has failed in a week.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Hails Rio Group Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
said Saturday that "a Bolivian and revolutionary current" pervaded
Rio Group's 14th Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia from June 15
to 16.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said in statements made at his arrival in Caracas back
from the Colombian port in the Caribbean resort city that this
current arrived to the Rio Group and the ideology of liberator
Simon Bolivar floated in all the region.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president said that the outstanding topics
during the Latin American chiefs of state summit were the defense
of sovereignty and the need of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the development of the Cartagena summit and its
results are compared to those of other previous meetings, great
differences can be seen about the goal of integration
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who was one of the presidents most chased by the press
in Cartagena because of his irreverent and frank speech on
international issues , said he was satisfied with the results of
the meeting of the 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president proposed during the Latin American
conclave, in which for the first time participated as full
members the Central American countries, the creation of a Latin
American Monetary Fund (LAMF) as an instrument against the
assailing of the international financial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Cartagena signed by 15 heads of state and
four presidential delegates proposed the creation of a new
international financial architecture and defined the area's
position toward the Summit of the Millennium convoked by the
United Nations for September.
