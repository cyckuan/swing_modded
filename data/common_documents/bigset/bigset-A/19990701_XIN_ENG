<HEADLINE> Becker out, Sampras through at Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker of Germany, the
youngest men's champion in Wimbledon history, said goodbye to
centre court on Wednesday after a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 fourth-round
defeat by second seed Patrick Rafter of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old veteran was too slow to match big-serving
Rafter's quick game.
</P>
<P>
Rafter plays eighth seed Todd Martin who eased past last year's
finalist Goran Ivanisevic 7-6 6-3 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Pete Sampras of the United States continued his cruise
towards a sixth final in seven years when he beat Daniel Nestor of
Canada 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Sampras meets seventh seed Mark
Philippoussis of Australia who beat another Briton Greg Rusedski 2-
6, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Tim Henman delighted home fans when he saved three
match points on the way to beating former world number one Jim
Courier of the United States 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
Henman's next opponent is France's Cedric Pioline, who beat
Karol Kucera of Slovakia, the 13th seed, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, second seed Steffi Graf of Germany
finished off Belgium's teenage qualifier Kim Clijsters in eight
minutes to win their rain-delayed match 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Graf plays sixth seed Venus Williams in the quarter-finals
following the powerful American's 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian
Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
A woman qualifier will reach the semifinals at Wimbledon for
the first time after American Alexandra Stevenson came from a set
and a matchpoint down to beat compatriot Lisa Raymond 2-6, 7-6, 6-
1.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old now plays Jelena Dokic, the 16-year-old
Australian who beat top seed Martina Hingis in the first round.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls International Conference on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan convened an international conference Wednesday to accelerate
the deployment of troops and U.N. personnel in the war-torn
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan said a day earlier that he would call on the 18 nations
and three international organizations attending the meeting to
offer personnel and resources in order that the U.N. civilian
operations in Kosovo work efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters early Wednesday,
Annan told reporters, "As you know, we do have a major
responsibility in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to bring the ministers together to
discuss what our needs are, to try and accelerate the deployment,
particularly of the troops, and the money we need to get the job
done, and also to bring them up to date as to what the situation
is on the ground and how things are going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the four-hour meeting are the foreign ministers of
Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and the United States, which are
described as "friends of the Secretary-General for Kosovo." The
other seven nations represented are Austria, Canada, China,
Denmark, Japan, Russia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent representative to the
United Nations, attended the meeting as the senior representative
of Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the European Union, which is charged with the
reconstruction of Kosovo, and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, responsible for institution building, as
well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference have also been
invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's most pressing need at the moment is an international
police force which can tackle the rising crime in the region with
the withdrawal of Serbian police and military forces and the
return of more than 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees. So far, only
a small U.N. contingent has arrived from the international mission
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Police seconded to the United Nations are in shorter supply
than soldiers, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday. "There
are no police barracks on our front lawn."
</P>
<P>
So far some 18 countries have promised to send 900 police
forces, who are expected to begin moving into Kosovo next month in
contingents of 150-200, Eckhard said. They come from Austria,
Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Italy, Kenya,
Lithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Romania, Tanzania, Turkey,
Britain, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to announce who will be his special
representative or chief administrator for the entire operation,
now run temporarily by Sergio de Mello, the Brazilian U.N.
undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. He has said he
would nominate a European for the position.
</P>
<P>
Another portfolio has also been added to the existing list: a
deputy special representative for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
known as UNMIK. "The deputy is to coordinate the four pillars of
the U.N. mission," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are vying for the post and some U.N.
officials prefer Martti Ahtisaari, whose tenure of office as the
Finnish president has another six months to finish.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been getting
tents and supplies to returning Kosovo refugees, says it has only
2.4 million U.S. dollars left for July. It estimated that up to 45,
000 houses in Kosovo need to be repaired or rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard noted that the U.N. mission will carry out its mandate
without undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as stipulated by the June 10
Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Non-Confidence Motion on Kenyan Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti survived the non-confidence motion initiated by a
parliament member of the opposition party in the National Assembly
here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The motion was introduced by Otieno Kajwang, claiming to be a
move to root out corrupt individuals in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling party dominates the parliament, the motion was
seen by local analysts just as an attack on Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the motion aroused debate among the
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti was appointed vice-president in 1989 and the position
was left vacant following the 1997 general election and was
re-appointed by President Daniel arap Moi earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He was Finance Minister from 1983 to 1992 when nearly 100
million U.S. dollars was drained from the treasury as the
government gave the Goldberg International tax and duty breaks and
allowed the company sole rights to export gold and diamond. It is
known as the Goldberg scandal.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kenya's economy is sluggish with each passing
year. The economic growth rate in 1998 registered only 1.8
percent as against 2.3 percent in 1997 and 4.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown economy in the country is attributed to many
reasons such as natural disasters, poor governance and
infrastructures, reduced foreign investment and graft among
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund suspended a 205-million-U.S.
dollar loan to Kenya in July 1997 allegedly because of the
country's poor governance and corruption, which had worsened
Kenya's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Goldberg case is now still under court proceedings. The
conclusion of this case is one of the conditions the IMF has
imposed on the Kenyan government before it resumes the talks on
aid.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Lashes at U.S. Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi is warning of challenges raised by a protectionist U.S.
Congress and a shift of economic power to the south and west of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"You have a very protectionist, inward-looking Congress," the
minister said Tuesday, emerging from the middle of a two-day
cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out a "very dangerous attitude for congressmen to
take...a very harmful position for the international community."
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that economic power has been shifting
within the United States from the north and northeast to the south
and southwest, away from the Canadian border and long-standing
Canadian commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
"What that means is we've got to get to know a whole part of
the United States," the minister declared, adding "we have to take
a look at a whole new north-south axis from the one that we've
been traditionally used to."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's cabinet session was described by the local media as "
concentrated on Canada-U.S. issues," especially recurring disputes
over Canadian softwood lumber and agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien expressed an idea of a hemisphere-
wide Free Trade Agreement of the Americas at the beginning of the
cabinet session. Despite a warm relationship between Chretien and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the pan-America free trade idea has
met a lukewarm reception in Washington, according to reports of
the Canadian media.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Editorial on Chinese Communist Party Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily newspaper has
called for the building up of the Party's power and greatness, in
an editorial to be published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the speech made by Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee General Secretary and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at a forum on June 28 marking the 78th
anniversary of the founding of the CPC is a guideline for thus
building up the Party in these new, exciting and interesting times.
</P>
<P>
It says that Jiang's speech is highly instructive for both
improving the Party and pushing forward the reform, opening up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized in his speech that an extensive education
drive in theoretical study, political awareness and expecting good
conduct among government officials above the county level is a
prevailing priority of the Party at present.
</P>
<P>
The editorial sums up in one dynamic sentence the long and
glorious, if somewhat tortuous, history of the CPC as it drove
forward the revolutionary and construction course of the country:
"The key lies in the Party." It insists that without the CPC,
there would never have been a new China, the growth of socialism,
the great achievements of the reform, opening up and modernization
drive, or the bright prospects now facing the country and the
people.

<P>
The editorial goes on to emphasize that political awareness is
at the core of the education drive.
</P>
<P>
"The politics that we are talking about is concrete and pure,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to elaborate that political awareness refers to "
reinforcing the correct ideals and beliefs," "for party members to
be good at correctly recognizing and assessing situations in terms
of politics," "to be able to maintain a cool mind and a firm and
basic political line on wide-ranging issues, guidelines and
policies," "consciously able to adhere to the Party's principle of
democratic centralism," and "whole-heartedly serve the interests
of the people."
</P>
<P>
"Above all, every party member and cadre, and especially the
leaders, should raise their political awareness, no matter in
which field and on which front he or she works," it says.
</P>
<P>
It calls for party members to learn modern sciences, because "
communists are outstanding individuals who are armed with the most
advanced achievements of human civilization."
</P>
<P>
Noting that today's international competition means there will
be constant tests for the leadership of all countries in terms of
governmental skills and capabilities, the editorial says that
China's Communist Party members have a duty to work harder to make
the Party and the country stronger and more powerful.

<HEADLINE> Strengthening Work on Ethnic Affairs : Party Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Party's work on ethnic affairs should only be strengthened,
not weakened," said Wei here today at a forum marking the
publication of the "Selected Works of Ulanhu" with an inscription
of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly held by the United Front Work Department
of the CPC and the regional CPC committee of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To do a good job in ethnic affairs, Wei said, we should first
correctly handle the relationship between the central authorities
and the autonomous regions. "On the other hand, measures should
also be taken to accelerate both social and economic development
of areas mainly populated by minority Chinese," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei also pointed to the importance of safeguarding unity among
all ethnic groups in China and urged officials in the autonomous
regions to creatively implement the policy of the Party on the
work of ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He praised Ulanhu for his creativity in solving problems
related to China's minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Ulanhu (1906-1988), formerly the Vice-president of the People's
Republic of China, was a native of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. He joined the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) in
December 1923 and became a member of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) in September 1925.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's forum were Ulanhu's son, Buhe, vice-
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, Wang Zhaoguo vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, and
other senior CPC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The "Selected Works of Ulanhu" include articles, notes,
speeches, and talks written or made between 1945 and 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial notes that some members of the Party and a number
of government officials are "in a unsatisfactory state of mind in
terms of following the path of socialism," "falling down in their
political qualifications and beliefs," and "unable or partially
unable to adapt to the new situation to meet the demands of the
tasks ahead."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it says, "Some of these officials have actually even
failed the new tests on their beliefs and dogma."
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that in the new international
situation and scenario, the Party has to create various conditions
for future progress. It must also make painstaking efforts to
overcome many difficulties in order to lead the 1.2 billion
Chinese people positively forward in the ongoing reform and
opening up so as to realize and achieve the country's strategic
targets of national development.
</P>
<P>
It says that the most imperative thing to do at present is to
carry out and reinforce the existing results of the education
drive in theoretical study, political awareness and good conduct
and comprehensively strengthen the ideological, political and
organizational building of the Party. As a result, therefore, the
overall quality of the leadership and leaders at all levels will
be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Those government institutes that have already implemented and
carried out the education drive have proved that the CPC Central
Committee's decision on launching such a campaign is of great
strategic significance. It is an innovative process for enhancing
party building and an important measure in strengthening the
leadership, improving the quality of officials and resolving
outstanding problems in the spirit and style of work of the Party.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the education drive plays an
important role in increasing the cohesive force and capacity of
the CPC organizations at all levels and improving the political
awareness and the abilities and skills of the leaders.

The editorial points out that the CPC has overcome many
difficulties and paid certain prices for every step forward it has
made in the past 78 years. Its future depends on the quality and
standards it imposes and on its insight and mastering of the
situation both in China and in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The 78 years of history have proved that our Party is the only
Party that insists on combining the basic principles of Marxism
with China's real conditions and characteristics while
continuously pushing forward historic progress and acting as a
trail blazer," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It praises the CPC for faithfully serving the Chinese people
and bringing about big and beneficial changes in the country; for
withstanding setbacks and severe tests of its courage and
fortitude while also maintaining vitality by being at the
forefront of historical trends.
</P>
<P>
These new times, new situations and tasks have imposed higher
and more stringent requirements on the Party in terms of the arts
of leadership and government, along with the quality and
capability of its leadership at all levels, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
On the present situation, it points out that the reform and
opening up course of action has encountered some deep-rooted
problems, about which we know little of the rules on how to tackle
them, as yet.
</P>
<P>
The polarization of world politics and globalization of the
world economy pose both opportunities and grim challenges for a
China that is rapidly, with big strides, closing up on the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The hegemony and power politics adopted by certain Western
powers make China fully aware that the world is not yet a peaceful
one and that hostile forces in the West will not give up attempts
to try and bring about China's fall, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for More Efforts on Population, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Wednesday that progress has been made in recent
years in meeting the challenge of population and development, but
there is a lot of jobs to do.
</P>
<P>
Opening a special session of the General Assembly on the follow
up to the Cairo conference on population and development in 1994,
Annan gave some examples of how things have changed since the
first population conference 25 years ago:
</P>
<P>
-- Women in developing countries have fewer than three children
instead of an average of five then,
</P>
<P>
-- Sixty percent of couples use family planning and the vast
majority of governments support it, in contrast to the fact that
only thirty percent of couples used it then,
</P>
<P>
-- In many countries fewer women die in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
-- Growth of world population has slowed from 2-% to 1.3%.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the international community should do more, as
</P>
<P>
-- In too many countries, girls still do not have the same
chance to be educated as boys,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many women still cannot choose when or whether to become
pregnant,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many women are victims of sexual violence especially
during conflict,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many people are exposed to sexually transmitted diseases
and AIDS,
</P>
<P>
-- People in developing countries still die too young.
</P>
<P>
Annan said since the Cairo conference, developing countries
have proved their commitment, but they are "cruelly limited in
what they can achieve without outside help".
</P>
<P>
"They are entitled to expect more sympathy, and better
treatment, from countries which are more fortunate," he added.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Many Drugs Donated to Albania Useless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Vast amounts of drugs donated in
humanitarian aid to Albania in May are useless, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO report, 400,000 tablets and 1,200 large-
volume intravenous fluids have passed their expiry date and 2
million tablets, 8,500 vials for injection and 16,000 tubes of
cream for external use will become useless by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way they can be distributed and used before the
end of the year," said Indro Mattei, a member of the Swiss
Disaster Relief Unit under the WHO Humanitarian Assistance Project
Office in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that 50 percent of the drugs coming into Albania
donated by non-medical organizations are inappropriate or useless
and will have to be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that some pharmaceutical companies are
using this humanitarian crisis to get rid of unwanted stockpiles,"
Mattei added.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of import permit documents submitted to the
Albanian Ministry of Health by humanitarian agencies in May showed
that 65 percent of the drugs presented an inadequate expiry date,
32 percent were declared with brand names that are unfamiliar to
Albanian health professionals, and almost 10 percent of medical
donations were not accompanied by any detailed packing list at all,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that the situation in June had not improved.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, the Albanian health authorities softened import
controls to speed up the entry of badly-needed drugs to meet the
demands of the 460,000 Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
WHO also stressed that good coordination of drug donations will
be crucial to avoid duplication, waste and the arrival of
unnecessary and inappropriate drugs. The U.N. agency urged strict
adherence to international guidelines for drug donations worked
out by WHO with major humanitarian agencies.

is on the ground and how things are going," he said.
</P>
<P>
In turn the ministers are expected to ask why the U.N.
political presence in Kosovo is barely visible, although experts
on such missions say other organisations would do worse.
</P>
<P>
The most pressing need is for an international police force to
tackle crime that has flourished with the exit of Serbian police
and military forces and the return of more than 300,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees. Only a small U.N. contingent has arrived from
the international mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Police seconded to the United Nations are in shorter supply
than soldiers, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday. "There
are no police barracks on our front lawn."
</P>
<P>
So far some 18 countries have said they would send 900 police,
which should begin pouring into Kosovo every five days next month
at 150-200 in each contingent, Eckhard said. They come from
Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Italy,
Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Romania, Tanzania,
Turkey, Britain, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to announce who will be his special
representative or chief administrator for the entire operation,
now run temporarily by Sergio de Mello, the Brazilian U.N.
undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. He has said he
would choose a European, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
But a one more portfolio is added to the existing list: a
deputy special representative for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
known as UNMIK. "The deputy is to coordinate the four pillars of
the U.N. mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are vying for the post and some U.N.
officials prefer Martti Ahtisaari, who however does not finish his
term as president of Finland for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been getting
tents and supplies to returning Kosovo refugees, says it has only
$2.4 million left for the month of July. It estimated up to 45,000
houses are now uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will carry out its mandate without undermining
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, as stipulated by the June 10 Security Council
resolution, the senior official added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Resolutions Clarify Parameters on Cyprus: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council's two
resolutions on Cyprus, approved on Tuesday, have clarified the
parameters in which the search for a Cyprus settlement will be
conducted, Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the resolutions (1250/1999) is on Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's good offices mission (1250/1999) and another
(1251/1999) on the extension for a further six month period of
the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
While passing the resolutions, the Security Council called for
unconditional talks for a settlement in Cyprus by putting all
issues on the table. Meanwhile, it endorsed a statement by the G-8
(seven most industrialized nations plus Russia).
</P>
<P>
The security council also reiterated that a settlement on the
island must provide for the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told the press that the two sides of Cyprus should
exhibit good will to create necessary preconditions and wait for
the Secretary-General's invitation for talks.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also said he was disappointed that no mention was
made in resolution 1251 on the missing persons issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has accused the Turkish side of failing
to implement an agreement between the two sides, which provides
for the exchange of information about locations of graves and
return of remains of people killed during the 1974 war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored agreement was signed on July 31, 1997 by
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks (including five
U.S. citizens), were listed by the Cyprus government as missing
persons in the 1974 war.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Voices Concern over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
parties Wednesday expressed concern over the government's decision
to send troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as
peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
While generally acknowledging that South Africa has a role to
play in maintaining peace in the continent, the parties warned
that it should not send troops until there is a clear peace
agreement accepted by all parties.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki told parliament earlier
Wednesday that South African troops would be sent to the DRC as
peace-keepers once a cease-fire is in place.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), South Africa's biggest opposition
party, said that it neither condemned nor supported the decision
to send peace-keepers to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
But it said the government had to be certain there is a peace
agreement accepted by all parties before sending in its troops.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from countries involved in the DRC conflict have been
meeting in Zambian capital Lusaka in the past few days to try to
put an end to the 11-month war.
</P>
<P>
The talks have given hopes for a possible cease-fire in the
vast central African country. But the ministers from various
countries concerned have so far not been able to reach agreement
to the draft cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front (FF) leader Constand Viljoen, a former head of
the South African defense force, said he is opposed to the
decision, because the South African troops are not well trained or
disciplined enough for such kind of mission.
</P>
<P>
"Discipline is of absolute importance, as the troops have to be
 completely neutral," Viljoen said.
</P>
<P>
He also questioned who would pay for the peace-keeping
operation, noting that the burden would likely fall on South
African tax payers.
</P>
<P>
However, the New National Party (NNP) and the United Democratic
 Movement (UDM) supported the decision, saying South Africa could
not escape its peace-keeping responsibilities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said sending in peace-keepers would
be in line with a decision by the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"It is felt that we should participate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said that a U.N. approval was essential for
any peace-keeping force to be sent to the DRC, especially when
considering the huge cost of such an exercise.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Institute for Security Studies Jakki Cilliers
said it is vital for South Africa and Africa as a whole that any
peace-keeping force be properly mandated by U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Cilliers said that the United States -- U.N.'s biggest debtor
-- appears keen that those who participate should pay the costs,
and it is unlikely that the United States would participate in the
DRC mission.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the U.N. was planning to provide a
peace-keeping force of no more than 30,000 people for the DRC,
Cilliers said.
</P>
<P>
Although this is large by international standards, it is
hopelessly inadequate for the DRC -- a country the size of a
quarter of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Department said Wednesday that it could
take considerable time to finalize details for the deployment of
South African troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Patrick Lekota said South African troops would
be part of a "non-combative" monitoring mission, the size of which
would be decided by the OAU.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Threaten to Boycott Lusaka Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels have threatened
to withdraw from the Lusaka peace negotiations if ousted leader
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba is given a seat as a rebel representative,
the Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD),
Moise Nyarugabo, was quoted as saying that the CRD has formed a
common front with another rebel group, the Congolese Liberation
Movement led by Jean Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for ousted Wamba," Nyarugabo said. "We cannot
 accept to be imposed representatives in the Lusaka talks."
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel leader, the talks in Zambian capital
Lusaka hit a snag Tuesday with Zimbabwe and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) insisted in integrating Wamba in the rebel
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable that (Zimbabwean President) Robert Mugabe
 and (DRC President) Laurent Kabila appoint our representative to
the talks,'' Nyarugabo said.
</P>
<P>
"We will pull out of talks if this situation prevails with
Kabila and allies making every thing they can to cripple progress
in the talks," the rebel leader added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks Malaysia's Support To End Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday expressed
the hope that Malaysia will use its influence on India to halt
military action and resolve the Kashmir border dispute amicably.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister's Special Envoy Mian Abdul Waheed
said his country believed Malaysia would urge India to exercise
restraint and seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Malaysia can use its influence on India so that it
will enter into dialogue with Pakistan to address this issue," he
told a press conference at the Pakistani High Commission here.
</P>
<P>
"We want a third party intervention. There are no prospects for
bilateral talks with India to end the dispute. Pakistan's repeated
initiatives for a dialogue through bilateral means have not
received positive signs from India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mian, who arrived here two days ago on a mission to garner
world support to help end the dispute, said he believed India
would eventually stop all military mobilization if the world
voiced its concern over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mian said he would hand over a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif to his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad before
leaving for Tokyo later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, India's lukewarm response to the holding of
talks to end the dispute had resulted in the Pakistani government
sending special envoys to European Union countries, Africa, Latin
America and Asia to seek their support to help end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan wants peace and we want a dialogue to end the
dispute," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict has cost many Kashmiris their lives and many
others had to seek refuge in Pakistan territory," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tough Road to Negotiation Table in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- There is a rough road to go before
the two rival sides in Cyprus sit again on the negotiation talbe
though the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday urged them to resume
talks in autumn on reuniting Cyprus, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots have already rejected a talks resumption
call proposed recently by the seven most industrialized nations
and Russia, or G-8, and echoed in a report by Annan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of G-8 urged the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any pre-conditions
and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday passed two resolutions,
which clarified the parameters for a Cyprus settlement, and called
on the two sides to hold unconditional talks by putting all issues
on the table.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots have been entrenched in a position that
they will return to the negotiation table only as their
self-declared state in the northern third of the island is
recognized and the negotiation is for a confederation.
</P>
<P>
They said that bi-communal talks, which have dragged on for
decades, do not reflect realities on the island and any future
negotiations must be on a state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the peace talks were
stalled in 1997 after Turkish Cypriots decided to stay out of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side in 1998 conditioned the resumption of
the talks on the establishment of a confederation on the island
and the incoming talks should be held between two equal states.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said he would not attend
any talks at which President Glafcos Clerides represented the
Cyprus government. Denktash argued that Clerides represents only
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
"They say the talks should be without preconditions. But you
put the precondition that a government of Cyprus exists, which is
why there has been no settlement in Cyprus," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Backing Denktash, Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish president, has
also reiterated that "the existence of two sovereign states must
be accepted," warning that a forced solution in Cyprus will create
a clash between Turkey and Greece, the ally of the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots have said they are willing to engage in
talks without preconditions, but have flatly rejected the
confederation solution for the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he will refuse to discuss confederation if the
issue is brought up at negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
There are obvious concerns among Greek Cypriot politicians
that the phraseology in U.N. resolutions - "put all issues on the
table" - may open the door for the Turkish side to table demands
for confederation and recognition of two states.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Cairo Program of Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made the
population issue a strategic one and integrated it into the
overall program for socio-economic development, its representative
told a special session of U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the Cairo Conference on population and development in
1994, China has given high priority to the implementation of the
Program of Action, said Wang Zhongyu, State Councillor and
Secretary-General of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
China, the most populous developing country in the world,
formulated the National Family Planning Program and set long-term
goals for its population and family planning work, he said.
</P>
<P>
While opposed to the use of coercive measures, China's
population program puts more emphasis on the integrated approach
of carrying out publicity and education campaigns, providing
quality services in reproductive health and family planning and
bringing into play the role of the civil society and NGOs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Special attention has been given to combining the family
planning program in the rural areas with economic development,
poverty-alleviation, universal education programs and improvement
of women's status, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
He said China's family planning program has not only stabilized
its population and promoted its social-economic development, but
also greatly contributed to the stabilization of the world
population.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China is still faced with grave challenges in
the field of population and development.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of about 12 million people to its
population exerts a great pressure upon its social-economic
development, resource utilization, environmental protection,
education, medical care and creates many new problems.
</P>
<P>
Turning to international cooperation for meeting the challenge
of population and development, Wang said China would call on the
developed nations to honor their commitment and provide financial
assistance to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops to Transit Through Greek Ports for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia is expected to begin
transiting its troops and heavy equipment through Greek ports for
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo next week.
</P>
<P>
Russia had approached Greece to allow troops to transit through
the Greek ports as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Kosovo and talks between the two countries over the matter were
nearing an end, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted
a Greek military source as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the only issue still to be tackled was
whether Thessaloniki, Litohoro or Volos would be used as their
transit points.
</P>
<P>
There was a possibility that all the three ports would be used
and Russian military officials might be in the northern Greek port
of Thessaloniki as early as Thursday to prepare for the
transports, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, Thessaloniki has been
a major transit point for NATO troops heading for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 14,000 soldiers and 7,000 vehicles have
passed through the port.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Rebounds in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading economic
indicators rose 0.3 percent in May, more than reversing the 0.1
percent decline in April, the Conference Board, a prominent
research group, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said with the increase of 0.3 percent in May, the
leading index stands at 107.4. During the six-month span through
May, the leading index rose 1.1 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The leading indicators show the resilience and robustness of
this expansion, which is poised to become the longest ever in
early 2000," said Michael Boldin, Director of Business Cycle
Research at the Conference Board. The index of Leading Economic
Indicators spots economic growth trends for the coming three to
six months.
</P>
<P>
The report said nine of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in May. The most significant increases are
vendor performance, interest rate spread, and money supply in 1992
dollars, it said.

<HEADLINE> China: Kosovo Is Not U.N. Trustee Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China said here Wednesday
that "Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY),
and it is not the United Nations trustee territory," calling upon
the international community to respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an
international conference on Kosovo as the senior representative of
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10,
stipulates that all nations respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the FRY, Shen said, "This should be
carried out in action, rather than simply expressed by words."
</P>
<P>
The international community, when rendering humanitarian relief
and the post-war reconstruction in Kosovo, should fully solicit
viewpoints from the FRY Government and the FRY should be involved
in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China always maintains that all ethnic groups are equal in any
multi-ethnic country, they should live in harmony and work for
common development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not favor discrimination or persecution against any
ethnic group, nor do we favor any ethnic cleansing," he said, "At
the same time, we also oppose any attempt to use the ethnic
problem to split a country."
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic problems in a country should be properly solved
through correct policies by the government and people of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the international peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, known as
KFOR, Shen said, the multi-national forces have made some progress
in carrying out the Security Council resolution since they entered
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"However, there exists many problems in this regard," he said.
"After FRY's full military withdrawal from Kosovo in accordance
with relevant agreement, the multi-national forces should have an
unshirkable duty to safeguard peace and security in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"But the situation in Kosovo is continuing to be worsened," he
said, "For example, non-Albanian residents in Kosovo are still
being driven away, intimidated or even killed."
</P>
<P>
"In some areas in Kosovo, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has
taken nearly all public facilities and organs under its control,"
he said, "Such a grave violation of the Security Council
Resolution 1244 can be no longer tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"The multi-national forces should take a quick action to fully
disarm the KLA and other armed groups so as to create a peaceful
environment, restore the normal social order and ensure the
safety, security and dignity of all ethnic groups in Kosovo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the post-war reconstruction, Shen said, the relevant program
should be well-balanced, rather than discriminative.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's 79-day wanton bombing of Yugoslavia has caused a huge
loss and serious humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and other regions
of Yugoslavia, including the destruction of the system to supply
water and power," he said, "This gravely affected the normal life
of the Yugoslav people."
</P>
<P>
The international should not put Serbia, a Yugoslav republic,
outside its relief operation program, "this is unfair and
inhumane," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or senior representatives of 18 countries and
the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Conference took part in
the four-hour meeting, during which they discussed how to
accelerate the deployment of troops in the war-torn Yugoslav
province.

<HEADLINE> Barak Clinches Coalition Deal With Key Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak signed a coalition agreement Wednesday with the
powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party, moving significantly closer to
his goal of forming a broad-base government.
</P>
<P>
"Shas signed the coalition agreement. This brings us to 69
seats in parliament so far, giving him a wide government," said
Barak's spokeswoman Merav Parsi-Tzadok.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 17 seats in the 120-member parliament, Shas' support
is instrumental for Barak's effort to revive the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party (NRP) and the left-wing Meretz
have also signed an agreement respectively with One Israel to join
the coalition government led by Barak.
</P>
<P>
The next few days will be crucial for Barak in his coalition
forming effort as he has to submit the cabinet list to the
acting Knesset (parliament) one week before July 9, the deadline
for his government formulation stipulated by the election law.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who won the May 17 prime ministerial election, has to
rally support from other smaller parties to form a broad-based
coalition government because his One Israel alliance got only 26
seats in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Stocks Rose With Failure of Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The stock values of three major
French private banks, the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the
Societe Generale (SG) and Paribas, rose on Wednesday at the Paris
stock exchange after an government intervention to arrange an
agreement between them failed.
</P>
<P>
The three banks have been engaged in a merger battle since the
BNP tried to buy up SG and Paribas in a hostile takeover bid
announced in March.
</P>
<P>
SG and Paribas, which had by then agreed to merge, rejected the
bid by BNP, which was the largest ever take-over bid in France's
financial history and the first of its kind in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank, Banque de France, and the government
arranged talks over the past week between the BNP as one side, and
SG-Paribas the other, to seek a consensus solution and avoid a
greater battle at the stock market.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of failure of the talks, BNP's share
rose by 2.68 percent to 80.60 euros (77 U.S. dollars), SG by 4.10
percent to 175.50 euros (168 U.S. dollars) and Paribas by 1.68
percent to 108.90 euros (104 U.S. dollars) by mid-day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dealers at stock market apparently welcomed the collapse of
the government intervention, after they sold off many stocks of
the three banks over the past week, causing an estimated 6.5
billion euro (6.1 billion U.S. dollars) loss for the banks.

PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
will pay an official visit to Russia from Thursday to Friday this
week, his second visit to Moscow in two years, announced the
French government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will preside with his Russian counterpart Serguey
Stepashine the fifth session of Franco-Russian mixed commission of
government ministers.
</P>
<P>
He will focus his talks with Russian leaders on Russia's
economic problems, the country's economic reform, and the
establishment of fiscal and other regulations by Russia to draw
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Jospin and Russian leaders will also discuss bilateral trade
and cooperation in the fields of airspace, telecommunications,
energy, agriculture and food, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume between France and Russia dropped by 25
percent in 1998 as is compared with 1997, mainly because of the
financial and economic crises in Russia.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Says Duty-free Benefit For Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELES June 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) is formally
to abolish duty-free shops in its 15 member states at midnight
Wednesday, saying it is good news for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Duty-free sales to travellers will come to an end at midnight
on June 30 in accordance with the unanimous decision of the EU
Council of Finance Ministers adopted in 1991, European Commission
said today in a statement. "This is excellent news for EU
taxpayers," said Mario Monti, European Commissioner for EU
internal market.
</P>
<P>
"It ends the curious situation under which massive subsidies,
worth over two billion euros every year, were paid to air and see
travel within the EU," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
Monti also said that many duty-free sales operators have
announced that they will maintain not only retail sales to
travellers but also "their prices on the majority of goods sold by
absorbing from their profit margins the value-added taxes that
will be applicable from tomorrow".
</P>
<P>
"It is a compliment to democracy in the EU that the interests
of a narrow-interest lobby group with seemingly unlimited
financial resources proved unable to overturn a unanimous decision
of EU member states," the EU commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"Just in case some travellers may have been misinformed or are
unaware, I would like to reemphasize that people's rights
concerning cross-border shopping are not affected by the abolition
of duty free sales within the EU," Monti said, adding people will
still be able to buy goods for their own personal use without
limit in other member states and will not have to pay any
additional taxes or excises when they return home.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Reconciliation in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Wednesday
called on Somali factions to honor signed agreements in a bid to
seek national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with David Steven, U.N.
chief's representative for the Somali affairs, AL Assistant
Secretary General Ahmed Bin Helly urged the Somali factions to
cooperate with the world community in attaining the goal.
</P>
<P>
The Somali warring factions signed an agreement last year on
establishing a broad-based central government, a move viewed as a
major breakthrough in the war-devastated country. But deep rifts
among the factions have blocked the implementation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The concerned parties, especially the Arab League and the U.N.,
have been exerting efforts to help the country in the Horn of
Africa end division caused by the civil war since 1991 and realize
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Bin Helly said the 22-nation pan-Arab forum has been working
with all parties to help Somalia form a national authority that
will restore the country's position in the Arab world, Africa and
international community. Somalia's AL membership has been frozen
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He called on AL members to offer technical, financial and
humanitarian aids to the Somali factions that take serious steps
towards national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the league's readiness to host a reconciliation
conference grouping all the Somali factions.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP to Grow by 1.2 Percent This Year, Studies Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Italy's gross domestic
product (GDP) this year is not likely to exceed 1.2% to fit the
country into the bottom slot in Europe but Italy will rise to
equal French and German GDP growth by 2002, a Italian economic
study center said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In other forecasts, the economists in Prometeria, an economic
think tank in Italian central city of Bologna, said greater labor
market flexibility could lead to the creation of 121,000 new jobs
of which 91,000 will be wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
Increasing oil prices will begin having an impact on domestic
prices in the coming months to help take inflation, now hovering
at 1.4 percent annually, to an average of 1.6 percent for the full
year.
</P>
<P>
Prometeria said that beginning in 2000, Italy should begin
reaping the benefits of financial stability in the form of
increasing domestic demand and economic activities more in line
with the norm in the euro area and showing greater potential over
the medium term.
</P>
<P>
According to the study center, domestic demand is likely to
increase at below last year's rate, about 1.6 percent compared to
2.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In their outlook taking them to the year 2002, these
forecasters said domestic demand will be the engine of growth in
the coming year to lead fixed capital investments made by
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Business and industry could draw benefit from a brighter
profitability picture, low interest rates and fiscal breaks so,
the report reasoned, demand and investments should both show
growth similar to the trends in Italy's European Union partner
countries.
</P>
<P>
The cycle of expansion in the Italian economy could be
associated with a long and substantial expansion in jobs with the
tertiary sector showing the way up.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of troubles originating outside the country,
inflation will remain low because of the lack of tension on the
import side and at home.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the two-year period, the gap between Italy and
France and Germany on the other side will be fully closed,
Prometeia said.

<HEADLINE> Conservation, Development Urged in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Wednesday called upon people of all walks of life and
investors at home and abroad to take an active part in the
conservation, recovery and development of the Mozambique Island.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call in capital Maputo at the
opening of an international conference on the comprehensive
conservation and human and economic sustainable development for
the island.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi asked the participants to make the meeting an impetus
for the overall development of the island and a driving force to
accelerate the development of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique Island lies in northern coast and belongs to the
province of Nampula. The three-square-km island is one of the most
ancient cities in the southern African country. It had been the
capital of Mozambique for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
With many cultural and historic relics, the island was
identified as a human heritage site in 1991 by the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The island, with a population of 18,000, is facing various
difficulties in the conservation of the relics and the improvement
of people's living because of its worn-out infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The recovery and development plan for the island includes some
50 projects covering road, water supply, transport,
communications, tourism, fishery and power supply. These projects
will need a total amount of 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) country representative in
Maputo, Emmanuel de Casterle, said at the opening that the UNDP
will respond positively to any reasonable requests made by the
Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
However, he saide that the support and participation of the
civil society, the private sector in particular, is crucial to the
success of the plan.
</P>
<P>
President of the City Council of the Mozambique Island, Abacar
Haimo, said at a fund raising meeting that the residents on the
island cherish great hope for the comprehensive conservation and
sustainable development of their land.
</P>
<P>
Haimo hoped that the meeting will do something for poverty
reduction, job creation, and improved conditions in education,
environment and health care.
</P>
<P>
It was told that a number of countries have expressed their
interest in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are 140 representatives from the
Mozambican government, U.N. branches, some non-governmental
organizations, as well as such countries as Portugal, Germany,
Canada, Brazil, Egypt and France.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The maternal mortality rate in
Angola is 2, 800 per 100,000 pregnant women, the highest in the
world, the U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA technical counsel Joao Bosco Feres revealed this at a
function to mark the World Population Day which falls on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official attributed the high mortality to infections
caused by inappropriate birth methods and care.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Feres pointed out that teenage mothers also
attributed to the high mortality, saying that many young women
aged 16 or 17 years have given more than two births.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official noted his fund will exert its effort to
reduce maternal mortality and improve the living conditions of
women, especially the mothers.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Angolan government to play its part in this
regard.

<P>
HARARE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Major differences in the draft
cease-fire agreement for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) had been ironed out, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge and Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said in Zambian capital
Lusaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to recent press reports that progress was slow and
that hopes of concluding the document were dim, Mudenge and
Mahachi said the atmosphere at the talks was positive and that all
the ministers attending were committed to ending the 11-month war
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have gone well so far, we have reduced the areas of
contention, they are only a few items left in the document," the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Mudenge as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is our objective to complete today, but they are certain
areas centered around definitions which we will look at later," he
said. "There is steady progress and we remain hopeful."
</P>
<P>
"The disagreement is not on the question of peace," Mahachi
said. "People here are concerned that there should be peace in the
DRC. We have agreed in principle that there should be peace."
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting started Tuesday and it ended around
2:00 a.m. local time. The talks resumed Wednesday and by 4:00 p.m.
the ministers were continuing with the talks.
</P>
<P>
Defense and Foreign Ministers from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states plus Kenya, Uganda and
Rwanda are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regional heads of state have been kept on stand-by for a summit
in Lusaka to sign the cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
Both Mahachi and Mudenge could not specify when the summit
might be held.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on the paragraphing, wording and emphasis and
also on the modalities of implementing the cease-fire agreement
and timetable of implementation," said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
On the rebel insistence that all foreign forces withdraw
simultaneously, Mahachi and Mudenge said they were currently
working out a timetable for withdrawing the SADC allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of an integrated national army, Mahachi
said the Congolese had not indicated any problems regarding that.
</P>
<P>
He said the DRC government and rebels would work out how the
armies should be integrated.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the division within the rebel movement would not
derail the talks.

figures could mean lower retail sales over the summer and throw
doubt on the strength of the retail recovery.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America said: "The data is soft
enough to raise a few doubts about the strength of the recovery in
retail sales and we continue to expect another cut in the base
rate over the next few months."
</P>
<P>
But some of economists said the underlying trend remained
strong and pointed to figures showing that mortgage borrowing was
still robust.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage lending rose 2.7bn pounds in May, a slightly smaller
increase than April's 3.1bn and March's 3.2bn. The number of new
approvals was almost unchanged at 96,000, compared with 100,000 in
April.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Against Breakaway of Montenegro from FRY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- France warned on Wednesday against a
possible breakaway of Montenegro from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY), which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
``France holds to warn against the risks of regional
destabilization which such an attempt could bring about,'' said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic has never
expressed his intention to secede the republic from FRY.
</P>
<P>
But the spokeswoman also said that France has supported for
years Djukanovic's efforts at ``democratization of institutions
and political life'' of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
``These efforts, which we continue to support, are carried out
in the framework of FRY,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France is due to provide Montenegro
with 5.5 million francs (848,000 U.S. dollars) worth of
humanitarian aid to Montenegro, including food and other
agricultural materials.

<HEADLINE> Italy Swears to Save Life of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will exert
"every possible form of pressure" to save the life of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, condemned to death by a Turkish
court Tuesday, Deputy Premier Sergio Mattarella told parliament
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said Italy had moved at the bilateral and
multilateral level over the last few weeks to warn Turkey that a
death sentence would represent "a serious obstacle" to Turkey's
ambitions to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will now impress on Turkish authorities
the need for the Turkish parliament to be fully aware of the
"inevitable" consequences of its ratification of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to Mattarella, if the parliament votes against the
death penalty, the vote "would have a great value and would not
fail to ease the progress of that country towards EU membership.''
</P>
<P>
Italy will exert similar pressure on the Turkish head of state,
who has the last word on the matter if parliament fails to block
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Mattarella noted that the European Union Tuesday called for the
death penalty to be commuted in Ocalan's case, saying his
execution would be prejudicial for Turkey's hopes of joining the
EU.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Charges His Team on National Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
 Wednesday swore in 45 of the 47 ministers cleared by the
country's senate and charged them to help plug the loopholes
through which national resources have been pilfered over the
years.
</P>
<P>
"You have a responsibility to plug the loopholes for the
bending of rules and pilfering of state resources," he told the
ministers, a day after the last set of five nominees were cleared
by the 109-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, repeatedly pledging to focus on anti-corruption since
he took over from military regime in May 29, urged the ministers
to join him in the process of national restoration through the
revival of the country's national institutions, battered by years
of military mis-rule.
</P>
<P>
"The great challenge that face the country calls for attention
on the battered economy, the consequences of past mismanagement,"
the president said a week after submitting an anti-corruption
bill to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the consequences of years of mismanagement included the
" widening of the poverty gap, the prevalence of hunger and
disease, the deterioration of public service, low capacity
utilization, low agricultural productivity and outmoded
communication."
</P>
<P>
Demanding them to reflect the best "ideals of democratic
governance" in their performance, Obasanjo said that should not
allow the return of the " dark days of deprivation and misery".
</P>
<P>
He urged them to be prepared for public scrutiny and criticism,
saying they should demonstrate a tolerant spirit.
</P>
<P>
As have been speculated, former chief of army staff, Gen.
Theophilus Danjuma was named in charge of the defense portfolio
while Adamu Ciroma, former central bank governor and minister of
Agriculture was named in charge of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The surprise portfolio was that of Sule Lamido, secretary of
the defunct social democratic party, who was named the new
Foreign Minister while Tony Anenih, former chairman of the same
party was named for the Works Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The only absentee at the swearing-in was Senator Udo Udoma,
minister of state for the environment, who was rumored to have
rejected the position.

<HEADLINE> France Hopes to Build New High Speed Railway With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- France has proposed to build a new
high speed railway between the Mediterranean city of Marseille and
the western German city of Mannheim.
</P>
<P>
The French delegate minister in charge of European affairs
Pierre Moscovici said that the project, called
``TGV-Rhine-Rhone'', should be among the projects to be
implemented with priority by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He told the French Parliament Tuesday evening that such a
railway will help strengthen the railway transportation links of
all European countries.
</P>
<P>
France is also planning to build high speed railways between
Paris and Strasbourg, eastern France, and that between Lyon and
the Italian city of Turin, plus a west-east high speed railway in
the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
But all these railway projects are expected to meet with
financial difficulties because of lack of interests by private
investors.
</P>
<P>
France's railway industry is 100 percent owned by the state
railway company SNCF.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Kosovo Mission Faces Big Challenges, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday said that the U.N. Interim Civilian Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) is facing a task which "is enormous in scope and
complex in execution."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement as he opened an international
conference here on Kosovo, described as "the Friends of the
Secretary-General for Kosovo," which involved foreign minister or
senior representatives from 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
"The mission faces a number of immediate challenges," Annan
said, "The first is coping with the massive daily flow of
returning refugees and internally displaced persons -- at a rate
that exceeds any on record."
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian agencies, led by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), "are performing heroically under exceedingly
difficult conditions; they deserve our commendation and support."
</P>
<P>
"The next challenge concerns the establishment of a regime of
law and order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only KFOR (the international peacekeepers in Kosovo) has the
capacity to establish a secure environment in Kosovo," he said.
"The demilitarization of armed Kosovar groups is a critical step,
and we are pleased to note that the KLA (the Kosovo Liberation
Army) has complied with the first key deadline set in its
agreement with KFOR."
</P>
<P>
"A third immediate challenge is political in nature," Annan
said, "The UNMIK team in Kosovo, again with KFOR at its side, has
begun to engage the various political groupings in Kosovo, in a
process of rehabilitation and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"The long-term success of our mission is defined in terms of
enabling all Kosovars to participate fully and effectively in the
public life of their province: creating viable legislative and
judicial bodies, delivering public services, and establishing a
robust civil society," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once that is achieved, UNMIK can be drawn down and phased out,
and its activities turned over to indigenous institutions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As an interim measure, we have established a United Nations
Trust Fund to finance salaries of local administrators, equipment
to support their work, and quick-hit projects that will
immediately improve the daily lives of Kosovars," he said. "I
urge you to contribute to the fund."
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution, adopted on June 10,
the U.N. dispatched a civilian mission to Kosovo in parallel
with KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"This civilian presence is intended to provide an interim
administration under which the people of Kosovo are able to enjoy
substantial autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who chaired the four-hour meeting, was asking attending
countries for money and personnel to run the war-torn Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
The pressing issue is the deployment of troops and the short
supply of police in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon indicated on
Wednesday that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
appears to be making preparations for a new missile launch.
</P>
<P>
Washington is certain to use this as a pretext for strengthening
its military presence in the Asian and Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair to say that we have seen some
preparations... some indications of a potential launch in the
future," Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Kurt Campbell told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said if a new missile test is performed the DPRK would be
viewed in Washington as "a very serious act with very real
consequences for U.S. policy toward" Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Campbell declined to offer any details, including the type of
missile being prepared for launch or a possible time schedule.
</P>
<P>
He refused to discus details what U.S. intelligence, including
satellites, might have gathered. But he said South Korea's
President Kim Dae-jung, who will hold talks with President Bill
Clinton in Washington on Friday, had spoken sternly against such a
step.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have enough indications yet to know what kind of
system is potentially being contemplated for launch now," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects U.N. Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash Wednesday rejected a U.N. call for the resumption of the
Cyprus talks in the autumn of this year with no preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that "if U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
invites me for exchange of views, I am ready to talk with
him. But there is no ground for talks between me and (Cyprus
President Glafcos) Klerides," according to a report of Anatolia
News Agency reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously approved resolution Tuesday, the U.N.
Security Council urged Annan to invite the Turkish and Greek
Cypriot sides to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the talks should start with no
preconditions, all aspects of the conflict be on the table and the
negotiations last until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on the other points of the resolution
because we categorically reject it. If they continue to recognize
Greek Cyprus as the government of the whole Cyprus and stick to
its positions despite all our objections, then nothing they say is
binding for us, " Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution followed a similar appeal by the G-8
countries, grouping the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the G-8 urged Annan "to invite the leaders of
the two parties on Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of 1999."
</P>
<P>
With Turkey's strong support behind him, Denktash has ruled out
any possibilites of talks not on a state-to-state basis, demanding
an international acknowledgment for the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a solution on Cyprus can be reached only with
the recognition of two states, two peoples and two sovereignties.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Denktash declared the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which is now recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Peace in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday urged all political parties in Northern Ireland to "give
peace a chance" as they worked against a midnight deadline to save
the Good Friday peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago, Clinton said
he stands ready to become personally involved in the deadlocked
talks in Belfast, if he is needed.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators including British and Irish prime ministers in
Belfast were trying to resolve an impasse over creation of a
power-sharing body made up of Protestants and Catholics and
disarming the Irish Republic Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
"I will do whatever I can to be helpful. We're moving forward
and I'm hoping for the best," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked the parties not to let the pact fall apart before
it even has a chance to succeed or fail.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody fails to fulfil any condition, including the
decommissioning, at any time in the future by the appropriate
deadline it can always be taken down, but it shouldn't be taken
down in the absence of a failure to fulfil the conditions."

<HEADLINE> EU Accuses FIA of Violating Competition Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said here
Wednesday that it considers the Federation of International
Automobile (FIA) to be abusing its dominant position and
restricting competition.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive body said it has concluded a
thorough investigation, prompted by a number of complaints, into
the way international motor sports is organized and commercially
exploited.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission formally accused the FIA, the body in
charge of international motor racing, of violating the EU
competition law while sending the same statement of objections to
two companies: Formula One Administration Ltd (FOA), which sells
the television rights to the Formula One cchampionship, and
International Sportsworld Communicators (ISC), which markets the
broadcasting rights to a number of major international motor
sports events.
</P>
<P>
A statement of objections is a preliminary procedural document
and not the commission's final verdict on the case. Under the
statement, one of the EU executive body's most significant
conclusions is that many of the contracts concerning the
commercial exploitation of international motor sports,
particularly those involving broadcasters, were viewed on the
basis of a situation unlawful under European Union competition
law.
</P>
<P>
"These contracts would therefore have to be renegotiated if the
commission's initial view is ultimately confirmed," said the EU
executive branch, which is responsible for proposing and enforcing
regulations of the European Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building
up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough
negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian
fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs
and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty was signed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas
R. Pickering and Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chtien at the U.S.
State Department's Treaty Room.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both
countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border
scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the U.S. to spend 140 million U.S. dollars to
restore salmon habitat and other measures to rebuild stocks.
</P>
<P>
The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen
only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and
growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of
chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho,
while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that
have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Receive 3.7 Billion Dollars in Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Wednesday that they
have agreed that Mozambique has met the requirements for receiving
close to 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in debt relief from its external
creditors under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The total debt relief package is worth 1.7 billion dollars in
today's values. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative is expressed
in net present value terms -- today's values -- which discounts
future debt service payments to the current year's values, using
current discount (interest) rates and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest debt relief operation organized by the
international community under the HIPC Initiative so far, and
raises the total relief granted under the HIPC Initiative to 5.5
billion dollars, or 2.7 billion dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the fourth country to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative, along with Uganda, Bolivia and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative debt relief will reduce Mozambique's
external public debt by almost two-thirds from about 2.7 billion
dollars to 1 billion dollars in today's values, on top of debt
relief provided under traditional mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's external debt-service obligations will fall to an
annual average of 73 million dollars in 1999-2005, compared with
an average of 169 million dollars that would have been due in the
absence of HIPC Initiative relief, and the 104 million dollars
actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, debt service due would fall to 8 percent of exports
and 10 percent of government revenues, compared with 19 percent of
exports and 23 percent of revenues actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique remains one of the world's poorest countries, with
about 70 percent of its population living in poverty. Debt relief
is expected to help deepen the social benefits of good economic
management and will enable the government to sustain increases in
spending for social development, the World Bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative entails coordinated action by the
international financial community, including multilateral
institutions, to reduce to sustainable levels the external debt
burden of heavily indebted poor countries that pursue IMF and
World Bank-supported adjustment and reform program, but for whom
traditional debt relief mechanisms are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)
will provide debt service relief to Mozambique equivalent to 975
million dollars, or 381 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
This debt reduction will be delivered mainly through the
purchase and cancellation by the HIPC Trust Fund of IDA credits,
resulting in debt service savings of 327 million dollars in
today's values. In addition, an IDA grant has been made to support
improved economic management which will provide debt service
savings of 54 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
The IMF assistance under the HIPC Initiative will take the form
of a grant deposited into an escrow account to be used to cover
part of the debt service falling due to the IMF. This assistance,
to be delivered over the life of outstanding obligations to the
IMF, will amount to about 125 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique also is expected to benefit form the changes
proposed by the recent G-7 Cologne Summit to strengthen the HIPC
Initiative. Once agreement is reached on an enhanced HIPC
Initiative, additional HIPC Initiative assistance will be
considered for Mozambique, the World Bank said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Committee Approves U.N. Envoy Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Wednesday approved the long-delayed nomination
of Richard Holbrooke to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was approved by a voice vote. Chairman Jesse
Helms of the Committee said it was "the quickest vote" in the
history of the panel.
</P>
<P>
The vote sends the nomination to the Senate floor. Holbrooke
supporters hoped the Senate could vote on the nomination by week's
end so the long-vacant top U.S. job at the United Nations could be
filled.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former assistant
secretary of state and ambassador to Germany. He has also served
as Clinton's special envoy on the Balkans, and was the "architect"
of the peace accord that ended the civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Holbrooke
in June 1998, but the nomination was held up for nine months while
the Justice and State Departments investigated ethics allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Relations Committee then conducted its own
investigation into the allegations, and held three separate
confirmation hearings on Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
The allegations focused on private-sector contacts Holbrooke
had and speaking fees he received after leaving the State
Department for the private sector in 1996. Holbrooke admitted no
wrong-doing.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) - By sealing a deal with the
powerful ultra-religious party Shas, Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has secured broad-based support for his strategic goals
of reviving the peace process and achieving internal unity.
</P>
<P>
Joined by Shas, Barak's emerging coalition has already enjoyed
a majority of 69 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament). The
expected joining of two additional parties will finally give Barak
a majority of 77 seats, the widest parliamentary majority in
Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
The broad support is exactly what Barak needs in the light of
the enormous tasks he faces: reach a permanent peace with the
Palestinians, resume negotiations with Syria, pull Israeli troops
out of south Lebanon, and heal the internal rifts deepened in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant ex-army chief won a landslide in the prime
ministerial election on May 17, but the One Israel alliance led
by his Labor Party seized only 26 seats in the new Knesset, which
has a record number of 15 factions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Barak has had to struggle in the last six
weeks to court various factions with diversified demands in
order to put together a workable coalition.
</P>
<P>
While he could have formed a narrow government of left
and center parties, Barak has tried to include the right-wing
Likud and the Shas, the second and the third largest parties
in the Knesset, in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the coalition talks, Barak preferred the
Likud to Shas in his government. Most of the secular voters,
a majority of them supporting Barak in the election, did not
want to see Shas, a party they accuse of disrespecting the
rule of law, to sit together with their parties.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the secular Likud would help Barak to carry
out internal reforms he promised: restrict the religious-coercion
in individual and public life, draft religious students who enjoy
military exemption for the last 50 decades, and adopt an
institution to guide the relationship between religious affairs
and politics.
</P>
<P>
But it soon turned out that the right-wing Likud was not an
ideal partner for peace. It disputed with Barak's guidelines in
almost every significant field.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to halt increasing Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, and make necessary territorial concession over
the Golan Heights, the Syria territory seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war, in order to reach a comprehensive peace
deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud wanted the Jewish settlement activities to
continue and opposed any compromise on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, after suffering a humiliating defeat in the
election, the Likud was thrown into shambles. While the internal
struggle for its leadership intensified, the internal gaps over
whether it should join the coalition also became unbridgeable.
</P>
<P>
So, when Barak appeared to abandon the Likud and turned
to Shas, many people said he has changed his priority, putting
the peace process ahead of internal reform.
</P>
<P>
Although a pillar of Netanyahu's right-wing government, Shas
is relatively moderate on the peace process. And, since its
spiritual leader makes the final say, Barak would get a
unanimous support of the party.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Barak wheeled and dealed patiently, insisting that
the convicted Shas leader Aryeh Deri have to resign, persuading
the left-wing Meretz party to retreat from its objection to
sitting in the government with Shas, and resisting criticisms
from the impatient media and members inside his One Israel who
called on him to quickly form a narrow but "workable" government.
</P>
<P>
While he almost used up the time allocated the law,
Barak's labors finally bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true in saying that by choosing Shas rather
than the Likud, Barak has put the peace process on top of his
agenda, it is also true that it will be easier for him to achieve
his goal of unity by including Shas in his government.
</P>
<P>
Shas represents low-income Middle East Jews, who feel they
are discriminated in this country established by the "elite
class." It scored a stunning victory in the parliamentary
election, jumping from 10 seats to 17, just because its
supporters regarded the conviction of Deri as an oppression of
their whole class.
</P>
<P>
If Shas remains outside the government, which means its
schools and welfare networks will face financial difficulty, the
rift between its supporters and the country will only be
deepened.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, by including Shas in his government, Barak
will achieve, rather than delay or abandon, his goal of
internal unity. Many Israelis call the incoming government a
"coalition of peace," but observers say, actually, it is a
"coalition of peace and unity."

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches War Against Malaria in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO), in conjunction with interested parties, has launched a
campaign against malaria in a bid to cut down the death rate and
boost the economy of Africa, an official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director for Africa Ebrahim Samba made these
remarks during a meeting dubbed Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in the
Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
Samba said there was guaranteed success of combating malaria
due to vastly improved knowledge and the availability of better
drugs for its control.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike previous anti-malaria efforts, RBM is an all embracing
 initiative which seeks to mobilize and coordinate a global
coalition including leaders from malaria-endemic countries, WHO,
United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations,
scientific communities and private and public sector
organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Roll Back Malaria partnership would pool resources
to eliminate costly overlaps.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting would review implementation of Roll Back
Malaria in Africa and how the partnership would work to support
the project.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Africans are estimated to be killed by
malaria each year.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses which are attributed to the disease in 1998
reached two billion U.S. dollars and were projected to reach three
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 participants from various countries including
Tanzania, Cote D'Ivoire, Mali, Sudan, Senegal and Ireland are
attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Investigates Togolese Copters Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Ministry of the Interior
is investigating last Monday's incident in which two Togolese
military helicopters landed unauthorized at Wli-Afegame, in the
Volta region southeast of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
 James Victor Gbeho, Ghanaian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that his Ministry was awaiting
the report from the Interior Ministry in order to assess the
situation and take the necessary actions.
</P>
<P>
 "It'll take a day or two for us to do a proper assessment,"
Gbeho said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Two Togolese air force helicopters Monday made unauthorized
landing at WLI-Afegame in the Hohoe district of the Volta region.
 One of them landed at the local Roman Catholic primary school
park, while the second one landed near the WLI Waterfalls,
creating fears and panic among the villagers.
</P>
<P>
 WLI-Afegame shares a common border with Togo and has the
biggest waterfall in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
 Ghanaian and Togolese officials in Accra have confirmed that
the Togolese authorities have been in touch with their Ghanaian
counterparts over the incident since the news broke out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 Nankoum Dzankla, ministerial counsellor at the Togo Embassy,
said , Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffigoh made contact
with his Ghanaian counterpart Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
 "They are still talking and will soon get to the root of the
matter," said Dzankla.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Road to Peace in DRC Long, Bumpy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Crucial talks to end the
11-month-long war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are
still busy giving final touches to a draft ceasefire agreement in
Lusaka, Zambia, however, a quick breakthrough is still not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started on Monday, are attended by defense and
foreign ministers from 14 members of Southern African Development
Community, as well as Rwanda, Uganda and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The highly-expected meeting ushers in a glimmering of hope for
the restoration of peace in the vast central African country, but
the postponement of the summit reminds people that the road to
peace in the DRC is long and bumpy.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from countries in the region are expected to
sign a ceasefire agreement at the ensuing summit and to map out
modalities for the withdrawal of foreign troops. However, their
wishes can be easily crushed by the grave differences among the
players in the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war in the former Zaire, the third largest country in the
continent, has drawn in at least six African countries and
threatens to engulf the continent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have provided military support to
DRC President Laurent Kabila at the latter's invitation.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda and Rwanda are supporting the rebels and
maintaining military presence in eastern part of the DRC in the
excuse of defending their borders.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister Amama Mbabazi has warned that Kampala
would not sign the documents if its security concerns were not
adequately addressed at the forthcoming summit. If Uganda did not
honor the ceasefire and refused to withdraw its troops there, it
would constitute a major obstacle to the restoration of real peace
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which regards Libya as its leading enemy in
Africa, would not tolerate Libya for deploying a large
peacekeeping force abroad and play a major role in the DRC peace
process. Libya initiated a ceasefire agreement of the DRC civil
war in Sirte of Libya on April 18.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials has accused Libya of attempting to use its
peacekeeping forces in the DRC to back the Ugandan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the United States would use its
power and influence to block the participation of Libya in the
multinational peacekeeping forces to be deployed in the DRC and
would not easily accept any peacekeeping program in which Libya
plays a leading role.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of peacekeeping forces should have the nod from
the Organization of African Unity and the U.N. Security Council.
It is expected that the U.S would not give its nod when the matter
seeks approval from the world body.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Tutsi rebels who have been trying to topple
the Kabila administration have now split into two major factions,
with one based in Goma in the east and the other in Kisangani,
northern DRC, due to what is said as nearly insurmountable
strategic and tactic differences. The Congolese Liberation
Movement which is fighting government troops in the northern part
of the country is now another rebel force.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from all these three rebel groups are now in
Lusaka and they all demand to sign the pact on behalf of the rebel
forces. Analysts here predict that an inevitable rebel clash would
precede the signing of the accord. The disparities among the
different rebel groups would add to the difficulty in the
realization of peace in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Although Kabila has agreed to talk directly with the rebels,
this has never been a reality up to now. The rebel forces have
warned more than once that they would not sign the pact if Kabila
refused to hold direct talks with them.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are still bargaining over the details of the
accord and trying to iron out their differences, but how to solve
all the problems mentioned above would matter much to the peace
process. The torch of hope is flickering there and is real, but it
looks somewhat distant.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Discuss Ratification of International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Southern African government
officials will meet in Pretoria next week to discuss ratification
of a statute providing for the creation of an international
criminal court, the South African Justice Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statute, adopted by a United Nations diplomatic conference
in Rome last year, needs to be ratified by 60 countries before
such a court can be set up.
</P>
<P>
So far only one country, Senegal, has ratified the document.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 14 Southern African Development Community (SADC)
member states, including South Africa, have signed the statute,
which amounts to an approval of its text.
</P>
<P>
"While SADC states are favorably disposed to ratification at
the earliest opportunity, a number lack the legal expertise,
experience and resources to identify and draft the national
legislation necessary for compliance with the statute, with the
resultant delay in their early ratification," the department said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the regional workshop, from Sunday to Friday next week,
would aim to familiarize government officials with the provisions
of the statute, and to discuss its implications for national
legislation.
</P>
<P>
It would also seek a coordinated approach to ratification, and
an agreement on a common negotiating strategy.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice and Constitutional Development Minister
Penuell Maduna will open the workshop Monday.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earnings Turnaround for Consolidated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Consolidated African Mines
(CAM) reported Wednesday a huge surge in earnings which took it
from a loss of 178.6 million rand (29.7 million U.S. dollars) for
the past nine months ending March 1998 to an attributable profit
of 132.5 million rand (22 million dollars) for the past financial
year.
</P>
<P>
CAM chief executive Brett Kebble said here in a statement that
the company's turnaround was the result of a vigorous clean-up of
its portfolio of interests since last year's unbundling of two
major gold mines -- Saflife and JCI Limited.
</P>
<P>
CAM and its major investment, JCI Gold, also announced they
were selling their non-gold assets to New Mining Corporation in a
273.4- million-rand (45.5 million dollars) deal designed to set
the scene for a proposed restructuring of their gold interests
involving Western Areas, Randfontein Estates, Randgold and
Exploration and Randgold Resources.
</P>
<P>
Kebble said the sale of the non-gold assets was a further step
in a process designed ultimately to lead to the creation of a new
world-class gold business.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of the non-gold assets of CAM and JCI Gold was
sure to transform New Mining Corporation, a fledgling empowerment
group, and to significantly enhance its asset base and make it a
substantial player in the global diamond industry, the corporation
said.
</P>
<P>
New Mining Chairman Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said the
acquisition of the assets would provide the company with
income-producing assets, a source of cash flow and substantial
mineral interests which could be developed either by New Mining
itself or through mergers and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"They will add critical mass to New Mining and provide it with
a solid platform for implementing its strategy of becoming a
substantial and diversified resources company," Nkuhlu said.

minister said while officiating a leadership dinner.
</P>
<P>
This partly explains the backwardness of the continent, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
The incorrect decisions made by such leaders add to people's
untold suffering and rampant corruption among senior government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for leaders of the continent to pay more
attention to the integrity of leaders at various levels, saying
this is the only way out for Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Independent Counsel Ends Whitewater Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. independent counsel
Kenneth Starr Wednesday ended the investigation of President
Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton into their financial dealings
in Arkansas with two fresh guilty pleas from key Whitewater figure
Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
"After five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,"
Hubbell said outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one
year of probation.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell pleaded guilty to misleading federal regulators to
cover up legal work he performed with Mrs. Clinton on a failed
Arkansas land development called Castle Grande.
</P>
<P>
He also pleaded guilty to a less serious misdemeanor violation
of failing to pay part of more than 890,000 dollars in owned taxes
and penalties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Robertson accepted Hubbell's guilty
pleas and agreed to a request from Starr's prosecutors not to
sentence the 51-year-old Hubbell to any more time in prison.
Robertson placed Hubbell on one year probation.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, a longtime friend and associate of the Clintons,
previously served a 16-month prison sentence for bilking his law
firm and his clients.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell said President Clinton and first lady Hillary did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I told the office of independent counsel, as I told them
five years ago, that I had no knowledge of any wrongdoing on the
part of Mrs. Clinton or the president," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Starr said Hubbell's plea brought to an
end the Arkansas phase of his investigation. For five years, he
has been investigating the Clinton's investment in the failed
Whitewater real estate venture in the 1980s in Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell's plea deal prevented Mrs. Clinton from potentially
testifying as a prosecution witness at Hubbell's trial next month
as she prepares a possible campaign for a Senate seat from New
York.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key U.S. Interest Rates by 0.25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
announced Wednesday that it was increasing its target for the
federal funds rate, at which banks charge each other on overnight
loans, by a quarter-point to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which had been widely expected, was announced at
the end of the second day of deliberations by the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), the group of Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's decision marked the first time the central bank had
raised interest rates since a quarter-point increase in the funds
rate March 25, 1997, a move also taken as a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
</P>
<P>
While the Fed raised the funds rate by a quarter point, central
bank policy-makers said they were switching their policy
directive, which serves as an indication of future moves, back to
neutral.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of
conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has
chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about
near-term policy action," the Fed said in a short statement.
</P>
<P>
Before the current rate increase, the Fed had switched in the
direction of leaning toward an increase in rates, a signal the
markets took that a boost was likely soon. By switching back to
neutral, the central bank signaled it may not feel the need to
follow up today's rate action with an additional increase when Fed
officials next meet in August.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Fed cut the funds rate three times over a period
of seven weeks as concern mounted that world financial turmoil
could seriously harm the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
But today, the Fed said "since then much of the financial
strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic
activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace."
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless," the Fed added, it "recognize that in the current
dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence,
or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the Fed will be able to accomplish a "soft
landing" in which growth slows enough to keep inflation in check
without the economy toppling into a recession.
</P>
<P>
U.S. unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels in three
decades, currently at 4.2 percent. While inflationary wage
pressures have not yet become evident, Fed policy-makers are
concerned that many of the factors that contributed to low
inflation last year -- falling oil prices and weak global demand
-- are beginning to reverse, setting the stage for a potential
inflationary surge, especially with U.S. consumer demand remaining
so strong.

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises 35.5 Million Dollars For Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican front-runner
George W. Bush broke presidential fund-raising records with a
collection of 35.5 million dollars in the first six months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The fund Bush raised is nearly 10 times as much as his closest
Republican rival and millions more than Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who only has one Democratic rival and has the power of the
White House behind him, raised 17 million dollars less than Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a news conference today in Los Angeles, said his
campaign was still counting donations and termed the figure a
"minimum number" .
</P>
<P>
"I am, as you can imagine, amazed at the outpouring of
support." he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who released his totals Tuesday, collected 18.2 million
dollars to 18.5 million dollars in the first six months of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
His only rival, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, will
report slightly more than 11.5 million dollars in overall
contributions, according to his spokesman Eric Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Calls for Increased Anti-Flood Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's flood control emergency
services have been put on full alert as the country enters the
summer flood season and governments at various levels should be
fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from Vice Premier Wen Jiabao who said that
since the start of last month exceedingly heavy rainfalls have
caused flooding in east China's Taihu Lake region and some areas
along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
He made remarks when addressing the second plenary meeting of
the State Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief (
SHFCDR) this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the SHFCDR told those present that as of
14:00 pm (Beijing Time) today, the water level of the Taihu Lake
had risen to 4.82 meters, 0.03 meters higher than its previous
recorded high.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parts of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei and Fujian
provinces have also been severely affected by floods, according to
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by local officials and people, losses from
the flooding were reduced to as small as possible. Meteorological
reports indicate that the rainfalls will basically stop by
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged officials at various levels to be prepared for
possible disasters, shoulder responsibility for flood prevention
and take concrete measures so as to reduce losses of both lives
and properties.
</P>
<P>
"The key task now is to increase flood prevention efforts in
the southern region and local governments in the Taihu Lake area
should strive to ensure the safety of major dykes and cities," Wen
said.
</P>
<P>
"Flood control departments should have emergency programs
already in place, make full use of flood control facilities and
efficiently arrange anti-flood work," Wen added.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also called for those departments involved to
increase coordination and cooperation, and earnestly exercise
their respective duties for the final success of the anti-flood
work.

<HEADLINE> Feature: PLA Open Barracks Day Impresses HK Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The display of military skills
and weapons of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) repeatedly won warm
applause from visitors to their barracks on the Open Barracks Day
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The formation drill and martial arts performance by the PLA
soldiers are quite wonderful and their morale and discipline
greatly impressed me," said Miss Miao, a bank clerk.
</P>
<P>
Miao, who came to visit the PLA barracks for the second time,
said the Open Barracks Day helps increase her understanding of the
People's Liberation Army and she now has more confidence in the
army.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Hong Kong garrison opened three barracks of the ground,
navy and air forces in Stanley, Stonecutter Island and Shek Kong
Thursday on the occasion of the second anniversary of the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local residents, old and young, went to visit the
barracks despite the scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
Besides demonstrating their military skills and weapons, the
PLA soldiers showed the visitors around their libraries,
recreation centers and dormitories. Singing and dancing
performances were also staged for the visitors, who were also
invited to join the soldiers in singing karaoke and playing chess.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops first came to the Hong Kong SAR when China
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over the region on July 1,
1997. And many Hong Kong residents are curious about their work
and life here.
</P>
<P>
On the Open Barracks Day, people get a chance to see with their
own eyes the life of the soldiers and even get to learn of some of
their "privacies," Terry Tam, a high-school student said at the
PLA ground troops base in Stanley.
</P>
<P>
"The clean and tidy barracks and dormitory rooms of soldiers
reflect their spirit," said Tam, adding humorously that he is
happy now that he knows the secret of how PLA soldiers shape their
quilts like bean-cakes.
</P>
<P>
Feng Wei, a PLA spokesman, said the open barracks program,
which is the third since the PLA began to be stationed in Hong
Kong, serves as a main channel for the local residents to get to
know the army.
</P>
<P>
Local people have offered much support to the PLA troops in the
past two years and the PLA garrison often receives telephone calls
from local people inquiring about the troops' life and activities
here, he added.
</P>
<P>
Feng said visitors talk more freely to soldiers on this open
barracks day and the ties between the army and local people have
become closer.
</P>
<P>
At a calligraphy and painting exhibition room, a PLA soldier
gave his calligraphy work with the words "army and civilians are
the same family" to a lady, who visited the barracks together with
her children.
</P>
<P>
The lady, a Ms Li, said she would keep the calligraphy work as
a souvenir for her children and ask them to learn from the PLA its
devotion to the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Crack Down on Cutting of Coconut Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
create an inter-agency task force that would apprehend those for
illegal felling of coconut trees, an official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) Administrator Eduardo
Escueta told reporters that the task force will comprise the
Philippine National Police and Coast Guards.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for the government to stop illegal cutting of
coconut trees, estimated at 1.5 million trees per year, to improve
the nation's coconut production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Escueta said last year's El Nino drought resulted in a 40
percent drop in coconut production in the Philippines and the
country should crack down on any illegal cutting of coconut trees
now.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 3 million hectares of coconut trees
sprawling in 67 of the country's 77 provinces, with 240 million
trees bearing an annual average of 7 billion nuts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coconut earns the country about 800 million U.S. dollars
annually from exports of coconut products and by-products.
</P>
<P>
About 20 million Filipinos, or nearly one-third of the
country's population, are working in the coconut industry.

KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- King Birendra told parliament
Thursday that Nepal shall make efforts to make the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) more action- and
result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's policies and programs for the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting mid-July, King Birendra called for
full cooperation from all countrymen to make a success the 11th
SAARC summit to be held in November in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and
social development in the region through cooperation among its
seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Nepal's unflinching faith in the principles
enshrined in the United Nations Charter, King Birendra said his
country will continue to follow the non-aligned foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nepali government will continue its diplomatic
efforts to solve peacefully the Bhutanese refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in camps in
eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress government was formed on May 31. It is the
first majority government in the Himalayan kingdom in four and a
half years.

KIEV, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Professional Football
League (UPFL) has decided to reduce the number of teams in the
premier division from 16 to 14 in next season.
</P>
<P>
League secretary Dmitro Reznik said on Thursday the reduction
was necessitated by the large increase in the number of games for
top clubs like Dynamo Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The new season begins on July 12, just 16 days after the end of

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks Joint Ventures Law Anniversary (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high profile symposium was held
here today to mark the 20th anniversary of the promulgation of the
Law on Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures.
</P>
<P>
 Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (
NPC) Standing Committee, and State Councilor Wu Yi attended the
symposium, which was jointly hosted by the NPC and the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
 On this day 20 years ago, the NPC, China's top legislative
body, approved and promulgated the law, the first of its kind to
focus on China's use of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
 The implementation of the law represented the formal launch
of China's national policy of opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
 Following that, China drew up a series of laws and
regulations on the utilization of foreign capital. Now, a basic
legal system with Chinese characteristics has come into shape,
which has greatly boosted foreign investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
 Since the first Sino-foreign joint venture was set up in
China in 1980, a total of 324,700 such ventures have been approved
in the country, involving actual investment of 267.45 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
 Official statistics showed that since 1993, China has ranked
first among developing countries in attracting foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics also showed that in 1998, China's industrial
enterprises with overseas investments turned out of 1,416.25
billion yuan (about 170 billion U.S. dollars) worth of goods,
which accounted for 24 percent of the country's total industrial
output.

<TEXT>
<P>
The EU's June 1 announcement urged member nations to adopt
immediate measures to implement new inspection standards for
packaging using wooden crates or materials for exports from China
after June 10.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hucheng, MOFTEC assistant minister, met with the European
Union Ambassador to China Endymion Wilkinson on June 11 to lodge a
serious complaint about the EU's decision, saying that China
reserves the right to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
But, MOFTEC officials told Xinhua on June 18 that Chinese
export companies have been told to improve the quality and
standard when using wooden boxes for packing their export products
in a special notice issued by MOFTEC and several other Chinese
ministerial departments.
</P>
<P>
Export companies have been warned to carefully select wooden
boxes, crates and pallets according to the new required standards.
Below standard wood must be specially treated before being used as
packaging for exports.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the EU side will, in accordance with the spirit
of bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation, enhance
negotiations and avoid unilateral trade restriction measures that
will affect adversely the normal growth of bilateral trade," Hu
said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that China also hopes that the EU and its
member nations would reduce arbitrary actions in carrying out
relevant regulations so as to maintain normal development of
bilateral trade relations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Looks for Buyers of State Telecom Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is looking for
potential buyers worldwide of the state-owned Tanzania
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL), local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Privatization with new investment capital, technology and
management will enable the TTCL to provide its customers with
better telephone services, a senior official was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We expect considerable interest from investors," said John
Rubambe, Executive Chairman of the Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC).
</P>
<P>
"There is superb potential for a private telecom company in
Tanzania and TTCL will become that company."
</P>
<P>
The TTCL currently has only 127,000 lines connecting its
customers countrywide that can offer telephone services to about
two percent of Tanzanian families.
</P>
<P>
Rubambe said that advertisements for prospective buyers have
been placed in local, regional and international publications for
bidders.
</P>
<P>
Up to 14 percent of shares will be sold to international
financial organizations, 10 percent to Tanzania financial
organizations and five percent to TTCL employees, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The winning bidder will receive 35 per cent of TTCL shares and
has management control of the company under government
regulations," Rubambe said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TTCL received Wednesday a license from the Tanzania
Communications Commission (TCC) to provide its mobile cellular
phone service.
</P>
<P>
Operated under a subsidiary company called Celnet Mobile (TZ)
Ltd, the service will be digital with a countrywide coverage
backed by TTCL's own modern network.
</P>
<P>
TTCL expects the service will be of very high quality and be
offered at easy, affordable tariffs.

YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt Wednesday called for efforts to build Yangon, the
capital city, into a modern city of international standard and
improve the living standard, welfare and socioeconomic life of the
city's residents.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with officials of the Yangon City Development Committee
here Wednesday, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council, recalled that Yangon city was full
of wards, squatter quarters and slums when the government took
power in 1988, saying Yangon was neither beautiful nor hygienic
and the living standard was also very low.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the city has developed due to the
establishment of new towns, the hut-to-apartment scheme and the
improvement of the standard of living, construction of modern
housing projects and low-cost ones for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the city's tax revenue increased from 1.343
billion kyats (4.47 million U.S. dollars) in 1991-92 to 8.379
billion kyats (27.9 million dollars) in 1998-99 and is to further
rise to 9 billion kyats (30 million dollars) for the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials to boost revenues while ensuring that tax
collection would not pose a burden to the public.

<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Thursday
decided to issue South Korean won-denominated bonds worth up to
five trillion won (some 4.17 billion U.S. Dollars) to stabilize
local currency market.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a ministerial meeting Thursday to
check the won's recent appreciation against the greenback produced
by the current-account surplus and inflows of stock funds from
abroad and a reduction in export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy said the move
will contribute greatly to stabilizing foreign exchange rates once
the treasury bonds with maturity less than 10 years are issued.
</P>
<P>
The stabilization bonds will result in a rise in won-based
debts as well as in foreign exchange holdings, the two effects
offsetting each other with adverse effects minimized, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the South Korean won was traded at 1,158.50 U.S.
dollar at the foreign exchange market here.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Soars on U.S. Fed Rate Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shot higher
Thursday, gaining almost one U.S. cent following strength in
commodity prices and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lift
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency's momentum pushed it to a peak of 67.1
U.S. cents after it recouped more than half a U.S. cent overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 66.86 U.S. cents from 66.01
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar had a very good day today in a
continuation from last night's move up on the back of the U.S.
rate hike and with the Fed back on hold," Michael Sarpi, head of
foreign exchange sales at Commonwealth Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its funds rate by 25 basis
points to 5 percent in a widely-anticipated move Wednesday night
but, more importantly for future trends, moved its monetary policy
bias back to neutral.
</P>
<P>
Sarpi said it was also a commodity price story for the
Australian dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of the health of
commodity prices internationally, was up 2.17 points to 191.54
Wednesday night on strong rises in oil and copper prices.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian dollar was trading at 64.46
euro cents from 63.86 and 80.78 Japanese yen from 79.78.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Makes Agriculture Number One Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President OLusegun Obasanjo
has said that his government would give top priority to
agriculture, The Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the president as saying on Wednesday that
"agriculture is our number one priority because of many reasons."
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo pointed out that the issue of agriculture
had transcended beyond family lines, "it is now a matter of
national security."
</P>
<P>
In keeping the tempo of agriculture at the level of sustainable
 development, the president promised to subsidize fertilizer.
Such subsidy would be cautiously pursued, a departure from the
indiscriminate manner of the previous governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will make sure that the subsidy benefits get to the
farmers," President Obasanjo assured.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on Tuesday in capital Abuja, Nasarawa State
Governor Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu said the Nigerian government had
decided to subsize the price of fertilizer by 25 percent as part
of efforts to revitalize the agriculture sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was part of the resolutions of the
inaugural meeting of the Council of State presided over by
President Obasajo on Tuesday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that arrangements had also bee made to
ensure that fertilizer get to farmers as soon possible.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on EU's New Decision on China's Wooden Crates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's new decision
to delay the date to implement its new quarantine standard imposed
on Chinese wooden crates, boxes and pallets used for exporting
goods until July 10 will help reduce the losses of the Chinese
side, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Hu Chusheng said that China has noted the EU's new
decision, which extends the grace period by a month, and considers
it will reduce the expected losses for owners of the wooden crated
goods waiting for shipment at Chinese ports.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade companies, meanwhile, are making vigorous
efforts to pack their goods according to the new quarantine
standard of the EU side, Hu said, aiming to cut the negative
impact of the EU's decision on China's exports to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
China strongly resented the EU's decision targeting wood-crates
used for Chinese exports to Europe, because it could "adversely
affect Chinese exports valued at some seven billion U.S. dollars,"
Hu announced earlier last month after the EU's decision was
announced on June 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China and Cambodia should reinforce bilateral
cooperation in various fields to bring traditional Sino-Cambodian
friendship up to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The Premier made the statement during a meeting here this
afternoon with Hor Nam Hong, Cambodia's senior minister and
minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China and Cambodia, both developing countries,
have no problems left over from history nor current conflicts in
their interests, and it is the common aspiration of the two sides
to intensify bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China values its economic and trade ties with Cambodia on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit and it is willing to provide
support and help to the economic reconstruction in Cambodia within
China's ability, Zhu told Hor Nam Hong.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China is pleased to see that the
Cambodia's new government, under the leadership of King Sihanouk,
has scored fresh progress in its internal and foreign affairs. "We
believe that the new government of Cambodia will grasp the
historic opportunity to put forward the process of national
reconciliation and make even greater achievements in national
construction", Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong said that Cambodia-China relations have witnessed
a good momentum of development since Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen's successful visit to China last February. He told Zhu that
the related government departments of Cambodia are working to
implement the common ground reached by the leaders of the two
countries to promote bilateral cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Military Scientists Urged to Make More Contributions to National Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has
urged military scientists to solve a range of major technological
problems in the field of national defense in order to catch up
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a letter to the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, as well as a number
of military supply industrial groups, on June 28.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Jiang welcomed the restructuring of the
sector from five core groups into ten, more efficient and
independently controlled corporations serving national defense.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the move was an important part of the
country's overall modernization program which was also aimed at
boosting national defense.
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in military work are urged to stick to the
spirit of "self-reliance, hard struggle and selflessness devotion"
and make coordinated efforts in their scientific research in the
field of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary called on them to work closely together
much like their predecessors had done when developing the atomic
and hydrogen bombs and satellites decades ago.
</P>
<P>
During the overall push to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics, China must continuously promote the economic
growth and power of national defense, Jiang said. He also called
on party committees, governments at various levels and all
branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to actively support
the national defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The newly established military industrial groups are also asked
to introduce administrative and management reforms to meet the
demands of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Technical innovation of the national defense industry is also
urged by Jiang Zemin.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks to Resume At Noon Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's peace talks,
adjourned until later in the day on the deadlock of guerrilla
disarmament, will resume at noon, with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to remain on hand.
</P>
<P>
The talks were called off after nearly 18 hours of non-stop
negotiations and four hours after a Wednesday midnight deadline
originally set by Blair for an agreement that would keep last year
's Good Friday peace accord alive.
</P>
<P>
Rivaling politicians from the British province's majority
Protestant and minority Roman Catholic communities were deadlocked
over how and when guerrillas will turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock is blocking formation of a power-sharing
provincial administration, a cornerstone of the Good Friday accord.
Unionists refuse to sit in a cabinet with Sinn Fein until the IRA
sheds its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political wing Sinn Fein made
a new offer after the midnight deadline expired to try to achieve
disarmament by May 2000, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Details of the new Sinn Fein offer were not known but sources
said it amounted to a commitment that IRA disarmament would begin
by October, on condition that the Unionists accept the immediate
admission of Sinn Fein into a coalition executive.
</P>
<P>
Unionists, however, were demanding that disarmament should be
simultaneous with the formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
Lights burned through the early hours at the sprawling, red-
brick Castle Buildings complex where Blair and his co-broker,
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, tried to get an agreement,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton joined the efforts, phoning the
negotiators in an effort to help secure a deal, according to
earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> HK Disney Park Negotiations Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations concerning the
construction of a Disney Theme Park in Hong Kong have produced "
significant progress" but no agreement has been reached yet and
talks were extended by four months.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip told a
press conference Thursday that "significant progress" has been
made over the past four months in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in his Budget Speech
on March 3 that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government and the Walt Disney Company had agreed to engage in
intensive negotiations with a view to determining, by June 30,
whether a Disney project could be brought to fruition in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ip said the Disney project is highly complex and requires a
thorough analysis of the economic costs and benefits and careful
evaluation of the technical and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "we need a further period of serious
discussions to make sure that the terms of any agreement on a
Disney project are mutually acceptable and can be reached in
sufficient detail for both sides to be comfortable."
</P>
<P>
What is important is that "we have made significant progress"
in the past four months and "we are continuing our negotiations
with a view of reaching an agreement by the end of October," Ip
said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the press conference, Commissioner for Tourism
Mike Rowse said both sides in the negotiations are satisfied with
the "considerable progress" made and there is not anything "
holding it up" but some technical details involving such aspects
as transport and reclamation remain and require further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the Disney project is a "useful asset" for
Hong Kong's tourism sector, so the SAR side does not want to "lose
momentum" in the negotiations.

<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One day before their quarterfinals
against Brazil, the Nigerian team have already aimed at taking
revenge to the American team.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian team suffered a 7-1 loss to the American team in
group competitions, but they still managed to qualify for the
quarterfinals with a 2-1 win over DPR Korea and 2-0 over Denmark.
</P>
<P>
On making the quarterfinals, Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo said:"I
am highly delighted to have done not only Nigeria but the continent
of Africa proud."
</P>
<P>
Mabo didn't give up hopes of making the final:"With God on our
side, we shall qualify for the finals and play against the United
States and also take our revenge."
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerians' next opponents will be the Brazilians and
Mabo said he knew the Brazilian soccer style well:"In my playing
days, I played under a Brazilian coach in Nigeria. I know the style
of Brazil and I am going to present a very good strategy that will
counter the smooth play of Brazil."
</P>
<P>
"We will win the match against Brazil on Thursday. After our
next match against Brazil, I will start to think about the U.S.
team." said Mabo.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian forward Mercy Akide said:"I know victory shall be ours.
 And after that I will start thinking about the American team."
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Wilson De Oliveira Rica also set his aim on
playing the American team in the semifinals, but he said he would
not underestimate any one of their opponents:"We will respect every
single one of our opponents. There is no preference to play any
team. We will prepare like we always prepare."
</P>
<P>
Rica said:"Inevitably we will have to face the U.S. team and
down the road is much better because teams will have sharpened up
their skills."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Foil Alleged Hamas Kidnaping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military police have
foiled what they suspected of an attempt by the Islamic militant
group Hamas to kidnap Israeli soldiers, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon, three policewomen patrolling at a
hitchhiking station near a military base south of Tel Aviv found a
silver Subaru suspicious when they overheard the conversation
between the driver and a soldier who asked for a lift, the Haaretz
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who wore a skullcap popular among Jewish males,
pronounced the Jewish name "Jabotinsky" with a heavy Arabic accent
and he and two back-seat passengers all wore uniforms of the
Israeli Air Force, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
After the policewomen prevented the soldier from getting in,
the car sped away. A police chopper was sent to comb the area, but
found no sign of the car.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army believed that the three men were members of a
Hamas cell that was trying to kidnap Israeli soldiers, The
Jerusalem Post daily quoted a military police official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
has staged bombing attacks against Israel, has warned of its
intention to kidnap Israeli soldiers to use as bargaining chips
to trade for the release of Hamas members jailed in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Banks Urged to Aid Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Lebanon were urged to
extend soft loans to small businesses in a bid to stimulate
investments and create more jobs, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven that banks extending modest loans to small
investors will have a good turnover," said Youssef Khalil, head of
the financial operating department at the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar Wednesday on the mechanism to create
liquidity in the local market, Khalil said that recent statistics
show that small businesses usually settle their commitments to the
banks faster than big borrowers.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanese farmers get 1.5 percent of the total bank
loans, while industries receive under 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, many small farmers are forced to go to loan
sharks to get loans with staggering interest rates that sometimes
reaches more than 200 percent."
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank's statistics, less than 1
percent of borrowers receive 49 percent of the total bank loans,
while 47 percent of borrowers account for only 2.3 percent of
the money lent.
</P>
<P>
Banks have extended loans worth some 12 billion U.S. dollars to
the private sector since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Fahim Mo'dad, vice governor of the Central Bank, said that
Lebanon did not have a cash flow problem.
</P>
<P>
"Banks are liquid and can help activate the economy with their
loan programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Central Bank may consider amending the
existing money and credit law to allow Islamic banks to operate
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, the Central Bank was also called on to allow
Islamic banks to operate in Lebanon because they have huge liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Mo'dad said the Central Bank, in collaboration with the
Association of Banks in Lebanon, would soon create a loan
guarantee fund to extend soft loans to small-and-medium-size
businesses which would benefit about 13,000 small institutions.
</P>
<P>
"This program will create 56,000 job opportunities and also
increase the economy growth by 2 to 3 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mo'dad estimated that 3 billion dollars in commercial banks
were not being properly used to stimulate investments.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Ship Weighs Anchor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai: The Snow Dragon, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first
scientific expedition to the North Pole kicked off today as the "
Snow Dragon", an ultra-modern icebreaker carrying 124 scientists
and journalists, weighed anchor from a dock in Shanghai this
morning and turned her head towards the Yellow Sea ready to sail
to the polar wastelands.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will take two months, and the scientists are
expected to return to Shanghai on September 1st.
</P>
<P>
Several days of heavy rain in Shanghai ended this morning and
Zhang Dengyi, the director of the State Oceanic Administration,
along with more than 200 officials, students and Shanghai citizens
were at the dock to bid farewell to the expedition team.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the expedition from Shanghai Wenying Primary
School, the kids warned the scientists and journalists to watch
out for polar bears.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, the expedition's chief scientist, said before the
ship left that his team will study the effect of the North Pole on
the global climate, especially on China, the ecological system in
Arctic waters, and the atmosphere, geology, fishing, and marine
environment of the area.
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to the South Pole, the North Pole exerts an
influence on China, as it is located in the northern hemisphere.
As a result of this trip Chinese scientists should be able to
increase their knowledge of the climate and environment in the
Arctic region," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He added that China intends to actively take part in extensive
scientific research of the polar region while at the same time
protecting yet peacefully exploiting the natural resources there.
</P>
<P>
According to the expedition plan, the ship will pass through
the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, and on into the Canada Basin.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned giant Kenya Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) ceases to exist
Thursday as a milestone of the privatization process began in
1995, Kenya Transport and Communications Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The three new corporate bodies born from the former KPTC are
Telkom Kenya Limited, the Postal Corporation of Kenya and the

been operational for some time.
</P>
<P>
Telkom Kenya Limited, which took over telecommunications
business of the KPTC, has begun its work, the company's managing
director office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Telkom Wednesday received its 25-year license and
instruments of mandate from the CCK, the office said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear who will buy the Telkom or buy the shares of
the company, " the office also said.
</P>
<P>
"Some 18,000 employees out of the KPTC's work force of 24,000
go to the Telkom, the rest will continue work for the other two
units", the office said, adding that the split of the KPTC is not
expected to cause job losses.
</P>
<P>
Genesius Kithinji, head of the posts and telecommunications
department at the ministry said Wednesday that there will be no
delays in the privatization of the communication sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nine-member transitional management committee has
been formed to help wind up the KPTC, dealing with its
liabilities and disputes, according to a recent special issue of
the Kenya Gazette. The committee comprised of high-ranking
officials will remain in office until the completion, the Kenya
Gazette said.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Russian team lost to China 2-0
in the quarterfinals and were eliminated from the 3rd women's World
Cup soccer tournament on Wednesday, but the Russian team coach said
the result was just acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ury Bistritsky, head coach of the Russian team, said his team's
overall objective was to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympic
Games:"So the important thing for us is not to concede too many
goals because the goal of going to Sydney Olympics is at stake."
</P>
<P>
Bistritsky said:"We didn't play as strong as China tonight. We
realized that China would attack us and pile up pressure and we had
to face off to stand up to all the pressure. In the long run, we
don't feel that this is a bad result."
</P>
<P>
Bistritsky complaint that his team lacked prepration for the
World Cup:"Our team had no opportunity or any chance to prepare for
a tournament like this in the way China or the American team can.
We only had five or six days of training before we began competing
in the tournament and that's not the way of doing it properly."
</P>
<P>
Russian goal-keeper Svetlana Petko said the result was
reasonable:"Being realists, we realized China would be the stronger
side. We proceeded from this assumption when preparing for the game
and building up the plan."
</P>
<P>
"If we try to attack early in the game, the result would have
been quite different, not just 0-2. This was the determining factor
in selecting our tactics." said the goal-keeper.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Confident of Rice Self-Sufficiency by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has vowed to help modernize the agricultural sector so that the
nation could be self-sufficient in rice, corn and sugar by the
year 2001, a presidential news release said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a regular TV program, Estrada said governors
nationwide have pledged to help his administration attain this
goal.
</P>
<P>
He said food security and agricultural modernization are the
potent tools that would aid his administration in wiping out
poverty in the country and providing adequate food for each
Filipino.
</P>
<P>
The president also voiced his confidence in this sector, citing
a 31-percent growth in rice production and a 62-percent growth in
corn harvest during the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a study, however, the barriers to the development
of agriculture in the nation include the lack of irrigation
systems, post-harvest facilities and other infrastructure in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that at present the annual average rice
import of the country is 600,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Cycling Squad to Head Early to Brunei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian cycling squad for
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games are likely to depart to
Brunei earlier in order that they can have enough time to
familiarize themselves with the track.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the idea because what they do is for our benefit,
" Chairman of the Indonesian Sports Council (KONI) Wismoyo
Arismunandar was quoted by The Indonesian Observer Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo duly ordered Secretary General Rudolf S. Warrow to deal
with their departure date.
</P>
<P>
Apart from nine trainees in Bandung, West Java, for the
mountain bicycle class, Indonesia is preparing eight men's
cyclists -- preparing in Yogyakarta in Central Java -- for the
Individual Time Trial, Criterium and Road Race events.
</P>
<P>
The eight are Tonton Susanto, Henry Setiawan, Wawan Setiobudi,
Goang Sulistyono, Herry Janto Setiawan, Hengky Setiawan, Mohammad
Basri and Suwandra.
</P>
<P>
Hengky Setiawan was first to raise the idea of preceding the
other squad members. He proposed they go a week before August 7,
the official opening of the games, in a bid to "get accustomed to
the arena."
</P>
<P>
Cycling bagged 13 out of 16 golds, nine silvers and four
bronzes in the 19th SEA Games held here two years ago. The
association has set a target of winning three of seven golds at
stake in this year's biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to win a gold and improve my time at the
upcoming SEA Games," said Tonton Susanto.
</P>
<P>
Herry Janto Setiawan said: "I want to win in SEA Games. In a
tryout in Johor, we proved to be better than Malaysia. But we
should not let ourselves let up in Brunei."

<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Norway Advance into Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Norway beat
Sweden 3-1 to set up a semifinal clash with China in the 3rd women's
World Cup soccer tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions met a stiff resistence from the Swedish
team in the first half. Though they dominated the pace of the match
with their long ball tactics, they could not find the right way to
tear off the Swedish team's defence line.
</P>
<P>
After the goalless first half, Norway enjoyed greater advantage
both physically and tactically. At the 51st minute, they were
awarded a free-kick and Ann Kristin Aarones headed home the
perfectly positioned cross to give her team a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish team became more nervous after conceding the goal.
Seven minutes later, Marianne Pettersen, who was named the best player
of the match, broke down the right flank and volleyed a cross over the
head of the Swedish goal-keeper Ulrika Karlsson straight into the net.
</P>
<P>
Norway's third goal came at the 71th minute when Karlsson
brought down Pettersen in the area. Hege Riise converted the
penalty kick to put Norway 3-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions played relaxed and as the game headed
into the injury time they lost their concentration for a while.
That was enough for the Swedish team to score a consolation goal at
the first minute of the injury time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a match between China and Russia, the Chinese team
proved they are deserved the status of being one of the favorites of the
tournament by scoring a comfortable 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
By entering the semifinals, China and Norway qualify for the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Australia earn an automatic ticket to
the Olympics as the host team. While Russia and Sweden still have
their chances of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
According to the qualifying regulations set by FIFA, only the team
from the four losing quarterfinals which has the worst group
competition results will miss the Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Training Director Back to Coaching Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) official in charge of athletes' development M.F.
Siregar denied rumors which said national training director
Christian Hadinata would resign from his post.
</P>
<P>
"It's not true. Christian will just focus his attention on
coaching the men's doubles because it's the only event we have a
chance to win a gold in the 2000 Olympics," Siregar was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Christian would resign due to disappointment
over PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, who often used his veto
rights to disapprove of Christian's training programs.
</P>
<P>
But Christian himself said he wanted to only focus on the men's
doubles training.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Christian would be replaced either by himself or
deputy Hadi Nasri until the Olympics 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine if we fail to win a gold in the Olympics," he
said, referring to Indonesia's shameful failure in the Sudirman
Cup and World Championships in Copenhagen where none of the
national shuttlers reached the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Christian, a former doubles specialist, had contributed a great
deal to the 1996 Olympics gold when his athletes Ricky Subagja and
Rexy Mainaky beat Malaysians Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock in a
thrilling deciding game final.
</P>
<P>
He also teamed up with Candra Wijaya and Sigit Budiarto who
beat the same Malaysian pairs of Cheah and Yap in the 1997 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Christian said his position as training director made it
difficult to make a decision on the men's doubles because other
coaches from other events would consider him subjective.
</P>
<P>
But Herry Imam Pierngadi and Sigit Pamungkas have been coaching
the men's doubles since Christian was appointed director in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said PBSI could not rely on Herry due to his lack of
experience.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have Atiek (Djauhari) who was also experienced to
help Christian. But Herry was too young to prepare athletes for
the biggest event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Atiek resigned from PBSI last year and moved to Malmo, Sweden,
where he is responsible for the Swedish national team.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Christian had to make his priorities on which
doubles team to concentrate on to qualify for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the 1999 All England champion Candra Wijaya
and Tony Gunawan and new partnerships of Flandy Limpele and Eng
Hian. But we are still looking for the third pair. We have the
1996 Olympics Ricky and Rexy and old hands Antonius and Denny
Kantono," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another pair preparing to qualify for the Olympics is Sigit
Budiarto and new partner Halim Heryanto.

<HEADLINE> China's Wang Picked by Dallas Mavericks in NBA Draft ( Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese center Wang Zhizhi has
been picked 36th in the second round of the National Basketball
Association draft by Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday to become the
first Asian basketball player in history ever to be drafted by an
NBA team.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is 2.12 meters tall and weighs 115 kilograms,
averaged 11.1 points and 5.6 rebounds for China at the Atlanta
Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who turns 22 on July 8, plays for China's five-time
national champion Bayi Rockets.
</P>
<P>
He led China's CBA league by blocking last season and was third
in scoring.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Dallas Mavericks, I'm so glad that we will
have the chance to work with Wang Zhizhi because he's a young
basketball player with great talent," said Donn Nelson, head coach
of the Dallas Mavericks, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"His draft story will remind basketball fans of Toni Kukoc,
Dino Radja, Drazen Petrovic, Cedric Cegallos P.J. Brown,. and even
Dennis Rodman, all of whom succeeded after being drafted at the
same position as Wang," Nelson added.
</P>
<P>
As the first NBA coach ever visited China, Nelson spent nine
days in Beijing and Shanghai last summer and had basketball
clinics for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) coaches, Junior
Team, Pro team, and young kids.
</P>
<P>
"Two things made me fall in love with this country, great
people and the love Chinese people give to the game," Nelson said.
"I found that the potential of basketball in China is huge; the
CBA has done a great job of making this game popular in China. The
game will become much more popular sport in the country with the
drafting of Wang into NBA."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to see that China has produced the first Asian
basketball player to make the NBA," Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
But Nelson said the Mavericks will respect CBA's decision if
they do not allow Wang to play in NBA very soon.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I know it might be difficult for Wang to come out and
play in the NBA very soon since the Army Club might need him to
stay and carry the team for a couple of more years. The Mavericks
will respect the special situation of China basketball and Army
basketball."
</P>
<P>
Nelson added: "But the reason we drafted him is that Wang
deserves this pick because of his basketball skills and potential,
and I hope this young person will have the chance to make his hoop
dream come true soon.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to make the same mistake that the Golden State
Warriors made in 1990 when they passed up the opportunity to
choose Toni Kukoc, and the Chicago Bulls went on to draft him in
the second round," he said.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China outplayed their Russian
opponents for a 2-0 victory to advance into the semifinals of the
Women's World Cup soccer tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team enjoyed a good start in the match, but failed
to grasp any of the scoring chances in the first 30 minutes though
they totally dominated their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team, which qualified to the quarterfinals as
runners-up of Group C, were no match to their Chinese counterparts.
They adopted a defensive tactics in the first half, playing one
forward in the front and had only one shot in the first 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team nearly scored at the 24th minute but Jin Yan's
shot was just blocked by the Russian goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, Liu Ailing released a 35-meter shot, only to
see the ball flying over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The Russian goal-keeper also denied an attempt from Chinese
captain Sun Wen at the 35th minute.
</P>

But two minutes later, after a Chinese attack caused a mess in
front of the Russian goal, the Russian defenders failed to clear the
ball and Pu Wei collected the loose ball and sent home a 35-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
After lagging 1-0 behind, the Russian team tried to play more
aggressively in the second half, but still could not find a way of
penetrating the Chinese defense line.
</P>
<P>
Russian captain Irina Grigorieva, who was voted best player in
two of Russian team's group matches, found it impossible for her to
organise her team's attacking.
</P>
<P>
For most time of the match, Grigorieva had to do a defensive
work as her team were out-shot by their Chinese counterparts 24-2 in
the match.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yan put China 2-0 ahead at the 56th minute when she tapped
in a rebound after Sun Wen's free-kick hit the post.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wen, who has scored 5 goals in the tournament and has a shot at
the best scorer of the tournament, failed to score a goal by herself
in the match, yet she was still named the best player of the match.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production value
in the first six months of this year rose 10.3 percent on a
year-on-year basis, the local press Thursday quoted a report of
Vietnam's General Statistics Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase was low compared with the 12.6 percent
registered in the first half of last year and 13.6 percent in the
first half of 1997, due to poor performance of the domestic
sector, including both state-owned and non-state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested sector maintained a high growth rate
thanks to the operation of more projects. The sector posted a
22.6-percent increase in the reviewed period as compared with 23.3
percent of last year's first half.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, enterprises under Vietnam's Ministry of Industry
boosted their production by only 4.4 percent in the first six
months of 1999 while the corresponding figure of last year was
10.1 percent. In the country's two industrial hubs of Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City, centrally-run enterprises achieved 6.8 and 4.1
percent increases respectively in production value.
</P>
<P>
The rise was 6.6 percent for the non-state sector, just more
than half of the 11.5-percent growth in the same period of last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice-Chairman Sobbie Mulindi of Kenya's National AIDS Committee
said the council would be the highest body in dealing with
HIV/AIDS activities, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi said the council would involve multi-sectors including
 ministries, professionals, non-governmental organizations,
private sector, religious organizations and donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the formation of the council is a necessity by
the reality that the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is no
longer a Ministry of Health affair but is affecting all sectors
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
To assist the council, he said, the government has come up with
a sessional paper on AIDS and will see to it that it is fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to Mulindi, a massive multi-sectoral campaign would
be launched at the grassroots level to sensitize local
communities on HIV/AIDS and effect a change of attitude.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS has been a grave social problem in Kenya and has
seriously affected the country's economic development. It is said
that AIDS orphans in Kenya is expected to reach 580,000 next year
and almost one million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
A latest report prepared by the National AIDS Control Program
says that the cumulative number of AIDS deaths would increase
from the current 100, 000 to one million by 2000 and 2.1 million
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Health Permanent Secretary Philemon Mwaisaka said in
mid-June that more than 200,000 Kenyans would die from AIDS
before the end of this year.

Ma Yuanan said after his team's victory over Russia:"I am very
pleased with our performance today. This is a game of life and
death. So if we don't want to pack our luggage for Beijing earlier
in the tournament, we should fight to the last minute."
</P>
<P>
"This game is about our techniques, strategies and mental
toughness. The game is cruel. Any team that loses can't play the
next game. The Chinese players are quite stable today." Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his players were not nervous at the beginning of the
match:"I think we did pretty good from the beginning. We missed
some chances. We shall improve on that in the future."
</P>
<P>
Ma said it made no difference to him if China play Sweden or
defending champions Norway:"No matter which team win, it's not a
problem to us. In 1998, we played against Norway three times and we
won twice and lost one game. Since 1995 we have not lost to Sweden.
To me, the important thing is we have to play our best."
</P>
<P>
Norway beat Sweden 3-1 in another quarterfinal match later on
Wednesday. China and Norway will vie for a berth in the final at
Boston on July 4.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Postpones Local Government Polls to 2000 a 070101 Malawi Postpones Local Govt. Polls to 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The electoral commission in Malawi
has postponed local government polls originally scheduled in
September till 2000, a report reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local government preparatory meeting Wednesday,
the commission chair, Justice James Kalaile, said the commission
has decided to shift the local elections in order to iron out
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
"Our technical advisers have told us that we need the whole
country redemarcated as most parts of the country are not on the
national map," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalaile added that work on the local elections is already
underway. Most of the 160,000 U.S. dollars needed for the
demarcation exercise and another 300,000 dollars required for
registration of voters had already been secured from donors.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission would like to avoid the mistakes which
threatened to derail the June 15 general elections. The commission
plans to computerize the registration exercise to make it
difficult to tamper with.
</P>
<P>
In order to conduct hitch-free polls, the commission needed
enough time despite earlier arrangements that the local polls be
held three months after the general elections, Kalaile added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the local polls cannot be held during the rain
season, which starts in October, because many parts of the country
will be inaccessible. This will mean the polls not being held
before April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has had no local authorities since 1994 when the ruling
United Democratic Front dissolved all previous local authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The latest research on ice cores
from the South Pole suggests that the global climate is entering a
period of transition from warm to cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Colder weather is likely to follow years of global warming,
according to doctor Kang Jiancheng, director of the polar region
office under the Chinese Polar Region Institute.
</P>
<P>
Kang, a member of the research team, recently urged the nation'
s cities, both coastal and inland, to fully consider the influence
global climate changes will have on the construction of
infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ice cores from the South Pole are believed to offer an accurate
record of atmospheric conditions over tens of thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Record of global climate changes over the past 400,000 years
indicate that the world characteristically passes through cool and
warm cycles.
</P>
<P>
The North and South poles and the glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau in southwest China, the world's so-called "third pole,"
are generally considered to be the best areas for obtaining
ancient meteorological information and for conducting
environmental and climatic research.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The first fishing moratorium in
the South China Sea, an initial effort to protect fish resources,
has proceeded smoothly over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Trawling and all forms of net fishing have been banned in area
north of 12 degrees latitude, including the Beibu Gulf between
June 1-July 31.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of over 10,300 trawlers and fishing boats in
Guangdong Province, which has been most affected by the fishing
ban, have remained berthed and fishing licenses have been handed
in to the provincial fisheries administration.
</P>
<P>
The province's 1999 output for aquatic products will drop by
estimated 200,000 tons, or approximately 12 percent of the normal
annual total, as a result of the two-month fishing ban.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Yiping, the senior official in charge of fishing,
said that over 60 million shrimp and 3.55 million fry fish, valued
10 million yuan, will be released into the South Sea during the

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Economy to Thrive Again: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said here Thursday
that the worst is over and Hong Kong's economy will thrive again
after a period of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony for the unveiling of the Monument in
Commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to China Thursday morning,
Tung said: "With the total support of our country, we have fully
and faithfully implemented 'one country, two systems' in
accordance with the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
For the very first time, he said: "Hong Kong is charting its
own future and our long term development plans with great
expectations."
</P>
<P>
"In the new millennium, we are committed to building Hong Kong
as a modern, civil and knowledge-based society, the metropolis of
the East which embraces innovation and technology and a bridge
linking China with the rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As masters of our own destiny, we will meet every challenge,"
he said. "Amidst the Asian financial turmoil, we defended the Hong
Kong financial system with decisive action. During the economic
downturn, we adopted strategies to ride out the storm together
with the people of Hong Kong and invested heavily in
infrastructural developments and education to lay a solid
foundation for our future."
</P>
<P>
"The worst is over. After a period of consolidation, our
economy will thrive again," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Noting the two major celebrations in 1999 -- the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and
Macao's return to China, Tung said: "An exquisite picture which
depicts the historical rejuvenation of a nation is unfolding
before the world. I deeply realize that we are an active player in
this historical picture, and not a mere bystander."
</P>
<P>
"The country has entrusted the future and destiny of Hong Kong
to all of us in Hong Kong with the hope that we will be able to
realize a broad vision and work towards a bright future with our
own efforts and wisdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely confident that this vision will become a
reality because the vast majority of Hong Kong people have this
conviction: the people of Hong Kong are capable of administering
Hong Kong well," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"With this conviction, we will strive to overcome any
difficulty and make progress in furthering the cause of the
Chinese nation," he said.

BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About 6,000 jobs for permanent
government officials and 4,000 state employees in Thailand have
been eliminated as a result of the country's bureaucratic reform,
a seminar said here Thursday.
</P>

improving the budgetary system and boosting efficiency in
personnel administration, Abhisit said.
</P>
<P>
New regulations and performance evaluation were being drafted
to screen out unproductive employees, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Newspaper Urges More Interchanges With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The official newspaper New Light of
Myanmar Thursday said that the peoples of Myanmar and China will
enjoy fruits of interchanges through the promotion of economic
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial titled "Enhancing Bilateral Economic
Cooperation", the newspaper quoted Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council
(SPDC), as saying that he had "successful" discussions with
Chinese leaders during his recent visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who visited China from June 7 to 11 at the
invitation of Chinese State Councilor Luo Gan, said the
discussions were held "with a constructive approach and
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, accompanied by a deputy prime minister and eight
other ministers, said his visit is aimed at strengthening the
existing friendship and further promoting the mutually beneficial
economic cooperation between the two countries, and studying the
advances made by China in national development endeavors.
</P>
<P>
At the recent third coordination meeting of Myanmar's Leading
Committee for the Promotion of Economic Cooperation Between
Myanmar and China, Khin Nyunt also said that he had cordial
discussions with the Chinese leaders on the implementation of
tasks under the bilateral economic cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed after Senior General Than Shwe,
Myanmar SPDC chairman, paid a state visit to China in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
Since a long time ago, there have been cordial and friendly
relations between Myanmar and China with frequent exchange of
visits by their leaders. Over the past 10 years, the two countries
have also enhanced relations in the economic field.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives to Remove Leprosy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar health
official has called for removal of leprosy from the public health
problems in the country, while striving to reduce the number of
leprosy infected persons.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein said at a seminar
here Wednesday on leprosy education that there are now only over
10,000 leprosy patients in Myanmar, down from over 200,000 in
1987.
</P>
<P>
The authorities were exposing and giving treatment from 6,000
to 10,000 leprosy patients annually in the past, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts are underway to wipe out leprosy disease
from the nation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is giving priority in the health sector to combat the
disease as a public health problem. Pilot trials were initiated in
epidemic areas and anti-leprosy campaigns were started in 1951
which covered the whole country by the end of 1968.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1977, there registered 270,000 leprosy cases in
Myanmar, the highest number of the cases at one period in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1988, 33,875 of cases were reported discharged as cured.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of Multi Drug Treatment by the World
Health Organization in 1989, 120,057 patients were also
reportedly cured up to the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Later, Myanmar worked out a two-phase National Leprosy
Elimination Project (1993-96 and 1996-2001).

dollars) in 1993-94, started losing heavily in subsequent years.
It has a projected loss of 1,674 million taka (34.52 million
dollars) during the just-ended 1998-99 fiscal year.

<P>
Early this year, the Bangladeshi government decided to
privatize 51 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under the BTMC, the
BJMC, the BSFIC, the BSEC and the BCIC respectively, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with a total value of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China had granted import-export
trade rights to 142 private enterprises since the beginning of
this year, when the work began.
</P>
<P>
A varying number of private firms in most of the nation's
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have gained such
trade rights.
</P>
<P>
A private firm in southwest China's Guizhou Province was
granted with the import-export trade right early last month,
according to an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). It is the first to obtain such a
right in the province.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that northwest China's Qinghai Province
is awaiting approval of its first firm to get the right.
</P>
<P>
The total 1998 export volume for the aforementioned 142 firms
hit 450 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The firms come from the sectors of industries, including
animal feed, wood and mineral processing, foodstuffs, chemicals,
agriculture, construction materials, textile, electronics and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Applicants are required to have registered capital of at least
8.50 million yuan (some one million US dollars) and an annual

<HEADLINE> Italians in Favor But Ignorant of Euro: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Italians are all in favor of Europe's
new single currency, the euro, but not very clear about it, said a
recent poll published Wednesday by the Italian government's Euro
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,000 people, designed to gauge the knowledge
and feelings of the Italians about the euro, shows that 93.3
percent of the people questioned are comfortable with the name '
euro', while only 1.5 percent still take it as the ECU (European
Currency Unit).
</P>
<P>
Problems arose when the question turned to the currency's value.
Only 13.9 percent correctly answered that it is worth 1.936.27
lire, 15.1 percent came very close to 1.936 lire, 34.5 percent
erred in excess of 100 lire, 10 percent were way off the mark and
26.2 percent didn't know how to respond at all.
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the level of support for the common currency, which
came into being on January 1, 1999, remains very high at 79.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of those interviewed said that they have got
their information about the euro from television and radio, and 66.
2 percent said they have seen new awareness campaigns on the
currency in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 percent said they have noticed the double pricing of
products in both lire and the euro in store windows.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 22.4 percent of Italian businesses
have completed the information program linked to the arrival of
the euro, 34.3 percent are on the way, and 33.8 percent were yet
to start.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Praise Self-Study Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Wang, a 35-year-old farmer
from Zhouchan Village in east China's Zhejiang Province, recently
reached a personal milestone by completing a self-study program
and earning a three-year college equivalency certificate.
</P>
<P>
Zhou had long dreamed of becoming a university graduate, but
was ineligible for the college entrance examination, which is
limited to individuals under the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 Zhouchan villagers followed Zhou's lead and have since
participated in the self-study program, which provides a large
number of rural residents to attain higher levels of education.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the self-study exam system in 1981. The system
is free of restrictions related to place of birth, sex, age,
nationality and level of education. Chinese citizens have praised
the education system which was introduced in rural areas beginning
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China's colleges and universities had a total enrollment of 1.3
million students in 1998, with an 11 million people, mostly rural,
completing self-study examinations during the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province has established examination centers in 552,
or 30 percent, of its total villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 Zhejiang residents completed the self-study exam
in 1998 alone, with the number of rural residents participating in
the program soaring from only four percent in 1991 to over 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of rural residents in Zhejiang have earned
college equivalency certificates. The vast majority of program
graduates have remained in their hometowns and have developed into
the backbone force for local production and management.
</P>
<P>
Modern agricultural production relies heavily on technological
expertise and the program provides farmers with an avenue for self-
improvement, according to fruit grower Cheng Handing. Cheng said
the self-study program has provided rich returns and enabled him
to apply knowledge gained from related studies to his orchard
operations.
</P>
<P>
A four-year college education currently costs an estimated 40,
000 yuan for a student, while the total cost for a self-study
student stands at only 1,700 yuan, of which 1,500 yuan paid by
participants in the self-study program.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Import Tariff Cuts to Boost Purchasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand is
considering cutting import tariffs on luxury goods to help promote
Thailand as a regional shopping center for tourists, the Bangkok
Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With millions of tourists visiting Thailand every year, the
measure is expected to help boost tourism revenues, the biggest
source of foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
New rates for luxury imports would be part of a broader
restructuring plan for the current tariff system, expected to be
considered by the cabinet next month.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministry officials are considering cutting tariffs on
goods such as pens and watches to help bring local prices in line
with those quoted in Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some tariffs now are over 50 percent, raised over the past two
years by the government to help curb overconsumption and imports.
</P>
<P>
Wary of the potential impact on the current account and
imports, any new tariff adjustment would likely be to just a
limited group of goods not available or produced locally,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Finance Ministry also plans to announce
new tax waivers for raw material purchases used by producers for
export goods.
</P>
<P>
Producers would also gain similar tax benefits if goods were
sold to tourists, expected to help reduce retail prices and
promote Thailand as a regional shopping destination.
</P>
<P>
Basic raw materials would be taxed at one percent, intermediate
goods seven percent and finished goods at 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Attends Monument Unveiling Ceremony in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand ceremony for the
unveiling of the Monument in Commemoration of the Return of Hong
Kong to China was held here Thursday morning to mark the second
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao extended warm congratulations
on the occasion on behalf of the central government and the people
of various nationalities of the country. He also extended festival
regards and greetings to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government, Hong Kong compatriots and personages of
various walks of life.
</P>
<P>
At 08:40, Vice-President Hu Jintao and HKSAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa pulled the colored strings to unveil the 20-meter-
high, 1.6-meter-wide dark colored granite monument at the seafront
of the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Center Extension.
</P>
<P>
The monument bears the seven golden Chinese characters in the
hand-writing of President Jiang Zemin, meaning Monument in
Commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to the Motherland.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Hu Jintao said that two years
ago, President Jiang Zemin solemnly declared here the resumption
by the Chinese government of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and the formal establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The
hoisting of the bright five-star red flag and the Hong Kong SAR
flag plunged the entire country into jubilation and attracted
world-wide attention.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has since turned over to a new chapter in its annals,
" he said. "To build a monument in commemoration of this event
will help our future generations to remember this history-making
event and forever carry forward the great patriotic spirit. This
is the shared inspiration of all our compatriots in Hong Kong and
indeed of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
He said that this monument keeps a historical record of the
struggles waged by sons and daughters of the Chinese nation for
national reunification and territorial integrity; it is a monument
in praise of the great practice of "one country, two systems";
this monument marks the beginning of Hong Kong people acting as
masters of their own and erecting a new milestone in building up
Hong Kong; it is a monument to the important contribution by the
Chinese people to the cause of peace and progress of mankind; and
it is an immortal monument that will stand in the heart of every
Chinese people. It will forever serve as a comfort to the dead, an
encouragement to the people today and an inspiration to the future
generations.

<P>
Over this period, he added, the Hong Kong compatriots have
shared the common fate with the motherland, making significant
contributions to the development of the mainland. With the
constant advancement of China's modernization drive, there will be
closer and more extensive economic links between Hong Kong and the
mainland. Hong Kong will surely continue to play an irreplaceable
critical role in turning China into a strong and prosperous
country. On the other hand, the sustained and steady economic
growth of the mainland will provide a stronger support for Hong
Kong's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the central people's government is determined
to implement in full the policy of "one country, two systems", "
Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and a high degree of
autonomy as well as the Basic Law. It will never waver in
supporting the SAR government led by Tung Chee Hwa in governing
Hong Kong in accordance with law. "No matter what happens, the
great socialist country will be a strong backing for the continued
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that with the correct guidance of
the policy of "one country, two systems", with the industry and
wisdom of the over six million Hong Kong compatriots, with the
effective work of the SAR government led by Tung Chee Hwa and with
the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups and the
central people's government, Hong Kong will overcome all
difficulties on its way ahead, march into the new century with a
fresh new look and bring about new glory.

<HEADLINE> UNCHR Envoy Calls for Halt to Attacks Against Minorities in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- UNCHR Special Envoy Dennis McNamara
Wednesday called on the returned refugees in Kosovo to stop
attacking the Serb and Gypsy population in Kosovo, the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency (ATA) reported.
</P>
<P>
ATA quoted the UNCHR (U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees)
office in Tirana as saying that McNamara indicated that there were
"reports of threats and violent attacks against the Serb and Gypsy
minorities in Kosovo" during the past two weeks and the envoy
requested these actions should end.
</P>
<P>
McNamara also urged the international peace keeping forces in
Kosovo to take security measures to protect the minority
population in Kosovo according to the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1244, ATA said.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said many returned Albanian refugees wantonly
plundered the property of the Serb and other minorities in Kosovo
and burned their houses as soon as they came back. As the disarmed
Kosovo Liberation Army backs them up, the ethnic Albanians have
nothing more to fear and hundreds of thousands of Serbs have fled
Kosovo for fear of revenge by ethnic Albanians, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Factions Sign Declaration on Common Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Rival factions of East Timor ended
their second-round dialogue here on Wednesday night, signing a
declaration on common principles, including a call on UNAMET (U.N.
Mission in East Timor) to be neutral.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was signed by 30 representatives of the
pro-integration camp and 30 others of pro-independence camp, as
well as by Dili Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, Baucau Bishop
Basilio do Nascimento and U.N. representative Tamrat Samuel.
</P>
<P>
The 16-point declaration dealt with four major matters:
politics, security, reconciliation and the popular consultation on
wide-ranging autonomy status scheduled to be held by the end of
August this year.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the Indonesian Police Force was the only
authority responsible for security and public order during the
entire popular consultation process, in accordance with the
agreement on May 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The May 5 agreement was reached in the tripartite meeting
between Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N.
Secretary General in New York. It called for the holding of a
direct ballot as the final solution to the East Timor problem,
while the Indonesian Police would take the responsibility of
maintaining security and order.
</P>
<P>
The ballot would allow about 800,000 East Timorese people to
determine their own future by choosing whether they accept the
wide-ranging autonomy status as offered by Jakarta, or to be
separated from Indonesia to become an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration agreed to respect the bilateral agreement
signed here on June 18 on disarming the two factions. The
declaration also said both factions agreed to respect the outcome
of the U.N. administered popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the conference participants urged the
Indonesian Armed Forces to be neutral throughout the process of
the popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
The rival factions also urged the UNAMET to maintain its
neutrality throughout the process of the popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET has been criticized by several sides, especially by the
pro-integration camp, that it takes sides in carrying out its
duties in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Jailed rebel leader Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao said that
during the three-day meeting, its 60 participants did their best
to produce a compromise between the East Timorese people and the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
The positive contribution the two rival camps had made to the
church-organized conference was an assurance that they were aware
of their responsibility and that they respected the rights of East
Timorese, Gusmao was quoted by Antara News Agency Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador-at-Large Lopez da Cruz, who headed the
pro-integration camp during the meeting, said it was a beginning
of a long-term reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that before, during and after the August
direct ballot, the situation in East Timor would remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Tamrat Samuel said the meeting was the first real gathering of
leaders of the two conflicting factions. They had shown their
commitment to reconciliation despite the fact that none of the
conference participants were expecting reconciliation to be
achieved overnight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman for the talks Father Domingos Sequeira
said despite a good atmosphere around the negotiating table, deep
divisions remain between the rival factions.
</P>
<P>
"On the last day of talks, delegates from pro-integration and
pro-independence groups refined a statement of the basic ideas
they can agree on, but could find little common ground on
(establishing) a joint committee for the implementation of these
ideas," he was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the most significant achievement of the conference was
an agreement in principle to respect the June 18 agreement on the
disarmament of rival factions.

<P>
The second-round meeting was a continuation of a successful
church-sponsored conference held in Dare village, west of Dili,
capital of East Timor, in September last year.
</P>
<P>
In the talks last year, the rival factions agreed to recognize
their differing views and refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor had been under Portuguese colonial rule for more
than 400 years. It was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations, which still considers
Portugal as the administering power of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Farmers End Protest After Agreement With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The farmers in Croatia ended their
five-day protest on Wednesday after the government agreed to
protect the farmers' interests, local TV reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between the two sides, the
Croatian government and the farmers union will design a formula to
protect the domestic agricultural production in keeping with the
principles of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also establish a mixed committee to oversee
the issue of state debts owed to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The price of the wheat will be more rational and will be more
than one kuna per kilogram this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was reached, the farmers' union announced
that the farmers will stop their protest and all the road blocks
will be removed within eight hours.
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,000-15,000 farmers, who started their protests
last Saturday, blocked the roads with tractors and trucks in seven
of 21 prefectures to press for a dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the government ban the import of
agricultural products until surplus domestic products are
purchased. Besides they demanded that government pay back the
money owned to them and raise the wheat price from 1.1 kuna to 1.
32 kuna per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the farmers' union held a talk with the government,
but the two sides failed to reach an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Zones Play Important Role in Vietnamese Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial zones (IZs) and
export processing zones (EPZs) produced goods worth a total of 1.2
billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 20 percent of the nation's industrial
output, English daily Vietnam News Thursday quoted Vietnam's
national management board for IZs and EPZs as saying.
</P>
<P>
These zones achieved a combined export value of 800 million
U.S. dollars, 16 percent of the national total export value.
</P>
<P>
There are 66 IZs, EPZs and high technology zones in 27
Vietnamese provinces and cities, of which 13 are in the north
Vietnam, 13 in the central region and the remainder in the south
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 76 projects capitalized at a
total of more than 300 million U.S. dollars have been licensed to
operate in these zones. Of these, 36 are foreign-invested with
capital totaling 236 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the total number of operational projects in
Vietnam's IZs and EPZs to 732 with a combined investment of 6.8
billion U.S. dollars. More than 40 percent of these projects'
registered capital has been disbursed.

QUITO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar said here Wednesday that he had called on the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) President Michel Camdessus to
help Ecuador settle its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held with his Ecuadorian

as the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
should help Ecuador tide over the crisis.
</P>

He said that during the June 28-29 Rio Summit, the leaders of
all the participating countries expressed support to the
Ecuadorian program.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the European Union financial ministers
agreed in Cologne, Germany, in early June to cancel 30 percent of
the foreign debt of the countries which are in most critical
situations.
</P>
<P>
Aznar and Mahuad signed a series of agreements ahead of the
press conference, under which Spain will provide more help to the
Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's foreign debt reached to 16 billion U.S. dollars due

<HEADLINE> Banks' Bad Loans Hit New High in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Data from the Philippine Central
Bank showed that commercial banks' nonperforming loan ratio
climbed to 14.48 percent as of April this year, 1.1 percent higher
than the previous month, the Business World reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The April ratio was the highest since the outbreak of the Asian
contagion in 1997. The ratio is computed by dividing the volume of
bad loans by total loans.
</P>
<P>
Despite government efforts to stimulate it, bank lending
remained sluggish, with total loans granted as of April pegged at
1.65 trillion pesos (43.42 billion U.S. dollars), 1.28 percent
less than the 1.484 trillion pesos (39.06 billion dollars) as of
March.
</P>
<P>
"Total loans have been contracting since February. Banks are
still not lending," a banking analyst said.
</P>
<P>
And as the volume of loans contracted, bad loans rose by 8.44
percent to 212.138 billion pesos (5.58 billion dollars) in April,
the highest so far, from 195.635 billion pesos (5.15 billion
dollars) the month before.
</P>
<P>
Restructured loans in April amounted to 52.568 billion pesos
(1.38 billion dollars), 1.24 percent more than the 51.923 billion
pesos (1.37 billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Loan loss provisions, meanwhile, summed up to 70.458 billion
pesos (1.85 billion dollars) and 67.740 billion pesos (1.78
dollars) in April and March respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last December, commercial banks' bad loans tapered off slightly
to 10.37 percent of total loans, from 11.78 percent a month ago.
It has since steadily been rising beginning January this year.

<HEADLINE> Factfile on Boris Becker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are facts and figures on
Boris Becker who played his last match at Wimbledon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Born - November 22 1967 in Leimen, Germany
</P>
<P>
Height 1.90 m, weight 85 kg
</P>
<P>
Righthanded player
</P>
<P>
Current singles ATP ranking: 89
</P>
<P>
Best career ranking: 1 (January 1991)
</P>
<P>
Becker has made more than 24 million U.S. dollars in a 16-year
career.
</P>
<P>
He has 49 singles titles and 15 doubles titles.
</P>
<P>
Grand Slam record: Six singles titles. Australian Open 1991 and
1996. Wimbledon 1985, 1986 and 1989. U.S. Open 1989. Wimbledon
runner-up 1988, 1990, 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Becker was the youngest Wimbledon men's champion in 1985 at the
age of 17 years seven months. He is also the only unseeded player
to win and was the first German champion.
</P>
<P>
He won his last Grand Slam tournament in Australia in 1996 but
at Wimbledon later in the year he ruptured a tendon in his wrist
and has had problems on and off with injury ever since.
</P>
<P>
At the 1997 Wimbledon he lost in four sets to Pete Sampras in
the quarter-finals and announced his retirement from major
tournaments. He lost finals to Sampras in 1995, to Michael Stich
in 1991 and Stefan Edberg in 1988 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
After missing the 1998 tournament he returned for a final
farewell this year and was knocked out by second seed Pat Rafter
of Australia in the fourth round. He plans to retire from the game
in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He has a classic serve and volley game suited to grass and fast
surfaces and was never happy on clay. His best result at the
French Open was reaching the semifinals twice.
</P>
<P>
He was nicknamed Boom Boom for his big serve and loved by
crowds for his acrobatics on court, leaping to reach volleys and
rolling on the court.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulls Select Elton Brand in NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls decided to
keep their No. 1 draft pick tonight and selected Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
Brand, a forward from Duke after his sophomore season, was
chosen after the Bulls took a serious last look at Lamar Odom,
bringing him into Chicago for a workout on the eve of the draft.
</P>
<P>
Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as an
underclassman. He averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in his
final season at Duke, leading the Blue Devils into the NCAA
championship game.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Tab Francis with Second Pick in NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies
selected Steve Francis with the second pick in the NBA draft here
tonight, opting for a guard instead of a more-needed frontcourt
player.
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies appeared set at point guard after selecting Mike
Bibby second overall last year. Nevertheless they tabbed Francis,
who can play both guard positions, rather than Lamar Odom, a multi-
talented forward.
</P>
<P>
The Francis left Maryland after his junior season, when he
averaged 17.0 points, 4.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds and the Terps
to the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
Lightning-quick and an explosive leaper, Francis played
exclusively at shooting guard last season but does have the
ability to play both backcourt positions. He played point guard in
high school and junior college.
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies won just eight games this season and entertained
offers for the pick, finding nothing overwhelming. The Miami Heat
wanted the pick to select Odom but offered only forward P.J. Brown
and the 25th overall pick.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Have to Take a Grueling Travel Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Russian teams
have been complaining about a grueling travel shedule, claiming
the scheduling of the tournament favored the United States.
</P>
<P>
If China makes it to the final, the team will have traveled 12,
673 miles and weathered four cross-country trips.
</P>
<P>
"It is the cruelest schedule we have ever experienced, " said
Ma Yuanan, Chinese head coach. "It is very, very tough. The first
two cross-country trips have cost us a lot and our players are
feeling very tired."
</P>
<P>
China is in Group D with Sweden, and faces Russia in the
quarterfinal tonight in San Jose. If China go through to the
semifinal, they'll have to fly back to Boston tomorrow for the
game on June 4.
</P>
<P>
If they make it through the final, another cross-country trip
will be required. The final is being held in the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, California
</P>
<P>
Russia started in Foxboro, Mass., then traveled to Portland,
Ore. From there it was on to Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and
Wednesday the Russians were in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Norway, another favorite, will have to cover 9,471 miles and
make three cross-country trips.
</P>
<P>
The United States, by comparison, will only need to travel 5,
498 miles and made only one cross-country trip. That is for the
final on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee president Marla Messing said the Women's
World Cup had met FIFA demands about the travel requirements "to
the extent feasible."
</P>
<P>
"I think on the whole, in the context of the event taking place
in the United States, the travel schedule is fair," she said.

<HEADLINE> North Ireland Peace Talks Continue Despite Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's peace talks are
continuing despite the passing of the Wednesday midnight "absolute
" deadline set by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, without any
sign of a breakthrough on the issue of guerrilla disarmament which
has paralyzed the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
North Ireland's main Protestant leader David Trimble, head of
the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), charged the Irish Republican Army
's political wing Sinn Fein had not offered anything to break the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any concrete proposals," the Reuters news
agency quoted Trimble as telling reporters an hour before the
deadline expired.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made an eleventh hour
impassioned plea to look to the future but insisted there would be
no immediate handover of guerrilla arms. He warned that the peace
talks could collapse unless agreement was reached between the pro-
Irish Sinn Fein and the pro-British Unionists over guerrilla arms
and the setting up of a power-sharing executive for the province.
</P>
<P>
"Prior decommissioning is not achievable," Adams said, "It is
whether we move forward, based on jumping together into the future
or go lurching back into the past."
</P>
<P>
Throughout Wednesday, Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, his co-broker at the talks, put pressure on Sinn Fein and
the Unionists to shift ground so they could reach a compromise,
sources close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
Unionists want Sinn Fein to give a clear guarantee that IRA
arms will be handed over and refuse to share power with the
republicans until this happens, but Sinn Fein says it has no
authority to make pledges on behalf of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Failure to break the deadlock was widely considered to fuel a
political vacuum at time of tension across the province as the
climax nears of the traditionally volatile Protestant "marching
season" to celebrate historic battlefield victories over Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Select Lamor Odom with Fourth Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Clippers would
let Lamar Odom drop no further, taking the multi-talented forward
fourth overall in the 1999 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
Odom has skills that fit four positions but hurt his stock with
a series of inexplicable moves, including failing to show up for
his physical examination and trying to re-enter Rhode Island after
hiring and firing an agent. He could have been the top pick in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
Odom declared for the NBA draft on the last possible day,
forgoing his final two years of eligibility. He is a rare talent,
a player with size who can play on the wing.
</P>
<P>
Odom averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists in his
only collegiate season, leading the Rams to the NCAA Tournament.
He shot 48.2 percent from the field but only 33 percent from 3-
point range and committed nearly as many turnovers as assists.
</P>
<P>
As an NBA player, his flexibility can be used at either
shooting guard or small forward will be his biggest asset.

<HEADLINE> Monument Symbolizes China's National Reunification: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Thursday that the Monument in Commemoration of Hong
Kong's Return to China is a symbol of the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the unveiling ceremony of the monument here Thursday
morning, Hu said that the monument "keeps a historical record of
the struggles waged by sons and daughters of the Chinese nation
for national reunification and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's
great concept of "one country, two systems," achieved a peaceful
solution to the question of Hong Kong and has thus redeemed the
100-year-long national humiliation and realized the historical
aspiration of the Chinese people for the recovery of Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a monument in praise of the great practice of 'one
country, two systems," said the vice-president, adding that it
also "marks the beginning of Hong Kong people acting as masters of
their own and erecting a new milestone in building up Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Also, the monument marks the "important contribution by the
Chinese people to the cause of peace and progress of mankind"
since Hong Kong's return to China stands as a successful example
for the international community in solving historical problems and
disputes between states through peaceful means, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an immortal monument that will stand in the heart of
every Chinese people," he said. "It will forever serve as a
comfort to the dead, an encouragement to the people today and an
inspiration to the future generations."
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people were present at the unveiling ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson: We Did not Want Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua)-- Sir Alex Ferguson claims Manchester
United have ditched the FA Cup because they do not want to be
blamed if England's 2006 World Cup bid fails.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford boss realises that United's participation in
the inaugural FIFA World Team Championship is vital to England's
hopes of staging the tournament and that is why they have taken up
the Football Association's offer to opt out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
The United boss feels this is clearly the lesser of two evils
and he does not want the club to bear the wrath of the nation if
they refused to go to Brazil and England's bid failed. United
announced their withdrawal from the FA Cup after much soul
searching and Sir Alex said: "We had to think about the situation
regarding England hosting the World Cup, that was paramount."
</P>
<P>
He added: "No-one wants to see them not getting it and the
criticism we would have received if they had not got it and we had
refused to go to Brazil would have been unthinkable - and that's a
Scotsman talking!
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view we couldn't win and we're getting
criticised anyway because all of a sudden everyone is putting the
FA Cup above everything else.
</P>
<P>
"We know that and we understand that, but we've been brave
enough to make this decision."
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex claimed he was disappointed to be robbed of the chance
of defending the Treble before the season has even started. He
sympathised with the fans, who are naturally upset by their
decision, but he claimed the club had no option because they
cannot compete in the eight-team tournament in Brazil in January
on top of their existing heavy commitments.
</P>
<P>
The silver lining to this grey cloud, though, for Sir Alex was
the chance to be crowned the first club champions of the world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed and the FA Cup is very special to me because
it's the first trophy I ever won, but we have no option," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go for them all and we can't play in Brazil and go
for the FA Cup. But now we have the opportunity to be, without
question, the world champion club team," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Implement "One Country, Two Systems" Policy: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Thursday that the Chinese government is determined to
implement in full the policy of "one country, two systems," "Hong
Kong people administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of
autonomy as well as the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a ceremony for the unveiling of the
Monument in Commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to China, Hu said
that the central government "will never waver in supporting the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government led by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa in governing Hong Kong in accordance with
law."
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, the great socialist country will be a
strong backing for the continued prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong," said Hu, who arrived here Tuesday for the unveiling
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president commented that the policy of "one country,
two systems" and the Basic Law have been implemented in full over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The previous social and economic systems as well as the way of
life in Hong Kong remain unchanged, he said. Hong Kong maintains
its status as a free port and a hub of international finance,
trade and navigation, and keeps its extensive ties with foreign
countries, other regions, and relevant international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents "enjoy all kinds of rights and freedoms
fully," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have eloquently proved that the policy of 'one country,
two systems' and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR not only
conform to the fundamental interests of Hong Kong, but also serve
the interests of investors from all countries. They are the
fundamental guarantee for the long-term prosperity and stability
of Hong Kong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his conviction that Hong Kong will overcome all
difficulties on its way ahead "with the correct guidance of the
policy of "one country, two systems," with the industry and wisdom
of the over six million Hong Kong compatriots, with the effective
work of the SAR government and with the strong support of the
people of all ethnic groups and the central people's government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
Thursday praised the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for successfully handling Hong Kong
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to unveil the Monument in Commemoration
of Hong Kong's Return to China, Hu said that Hong Kong compatriots
have, with an unprecedented sense of being the masters of their
own affairs, actively participated in the management of Hong Kong
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR government, headed by Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa, has handled Hong Kong affairs cautiously, but steadily
and firmly, and responded to various challenges calmly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has "succeeded in fencing off the strong
impact of the Asian financial crisis on Hong Kong and in
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The firm steps forward our Hong Kong compatriots have taken
under the leadership of the SAR government in overcoming
difficulties and warding off risks have shown to the world that
the SAR government led by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa has the wisdom and
capability to handle complicated situation and the people of Hong
Kong are undoubtedly capable of administering Hong Kong well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China 50 years
ago, Hu noted, the Hong Kong compatriots have "shared the common
fate with the motherland."
</P>
<P>
With the constant advancement of China's modernization drive,
he said, there will be closer and more extensive economic links
between Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will surely continue to play an irreplaceable
critical role in turning China into a strong and prosperous
country," he said. "The sustained and steady economic growth of
the mainland will provide a strong support for Hong Kong's
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Hu came to Hong Kong from Shenzhen Tuesday for the unveiling of
the monument.

<HEADLINE> Man United Pulls out of FA Cup (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United have confirmed
they will accept the Football Association's offer of missing next
season's FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford giants have defied opposition from supporters
by agreeing to skip the competition so they can take part in the
inaugural World Team Championship in Brazil next January.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards said on Wednesday the club had "
no alternative" but to accept the offer for one year only.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision had been made "in the national
interest".
</P>
<P>
The FA wants United to play in the new tournament -- because
they believe it could aid England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
The Treble winners were concerned that the inaugural tournament
would add to their already hectic fixture schedule, which led to
the FA's proposal to ditch the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The FA's interim executive director, David Davies thanked
United for what he agreed had been an "agonising decision".
</P>
<P>
Supporters and influential figures within the game have
criticised the move, arguing that it devalues the oldest cup
competition in world football.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Edwards said: "We realise that many of our
supporters will be as disappointed as we are with our decision not
to compete in the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United see this as an opportunity to compete for
the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions."
</P>
<P>
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been a long-time critic of
the fixture congestion in English football and he was concerned
his team would be unable to challenge for yet another trophy.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go for them all," he said. "We can't play in the FA
Cup and in Brazil. That would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a no-win situation here. The criticism we would have
received if we hadn't gone (to Brazil) would have been unthinkable
-and that's a Scotsman speaking."
</P>
<P>
The FA has proposed reducing the number of teams in the
Premiership from 20 to 18 in an attempt to address next season's
growing fixture chaos.
</P>
<P>
The issue, brought into focus by United's exit from the FA Cup,
is a growing problem with some clubs now facing up to 70 matches
in a season.
</P>
<P>
David Davies said: "We are very concerned about the amount of
football that our players are playing.
</P>
<P>
"We can't just reach a solution in England. FIFA are working on
a world football calendar and we have to be part of that."
</P>
<P>
But Davies also acknowledged the lack of support among
Premiership clubs for a reduction - and was left in even less
doubt as a clutch of clubs again spoke out in defiance.
</P>
<P>
West Ham secretary Graham Mackrell led the rebuttal, saying: "
When you see the amount of money being generated in the
Premiership you can't realistically expect to see clubs voting to
fall on their swords."
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale added: "I feel very strongly that
domestic football is the foundation of our game, and if you
undermine that the rest is likely to collapse."

<HEADLINE> More People Watching Women's World Cup Than NHL League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Women's World Cup is
getting more and more popular in the United States and its
television ratings are already better than the NHL's.
</P>
<P>
ESPN has a .82 cable rating in five World Cup games so far
compared with a .59 mark on its NHL regular-season games this past
season.
</P>
<P>
The cable network also has broadcast 17 Women's World Cup games
on ESPN2, with a .51 mark.
</P>
<P>
ESPN's game last Thursday between the United States and Nigeria
drew a 1.85 rating and was seen in 1.4 million homes.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the United States played Colombia in the first round
of the men's World Cup. The game on ESPN drew a 4.3 rating and was
seen in 2.7 million homes.
</P>
<P>
ESPN's average for 41 men's games in 1994, when the tournament
was also held in the United States, was 1.8. The 1998 men's World
Cup was in France, where many games fell in a poor time slot for
Americans. ESPN had a .9 rating for 27 games.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's United States-DPR Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96
rating and was seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the highest
rating for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth most-watched
event on the network.
</P>
<P>
Each cable point of the rating represents 766,000 homes on ESPN
and 644,000 on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Becker Ends Wimbledon Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris
Becker of Germany ended his career on the All England Club lawn
tennis courts when he lost to second seed Patrick Rafter of
Australia 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 31 but still the youngest men's champion in Wimbledon
history, was outplayed by the Australian on Wednesday as the serve
that struck a thousand aces on the grass of the All-England Club
lost its bite.
</P>
<P>
The German, champion in 1985, 1986 and 1989, bowed out with a
wave and a smile, and the fans cheered him to the roof tops.
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice way to say good-bye," said Becker, smiling. "
This place was always special to me, it made me who I am today.
It gave me all the possibilities, all the freedom to do what I
want to do with my life from now one and I'm very thankful."
</P>
<P>
"I have so many memories, so many things have happened. I'm
thankful I had the chance to come back and play some decent tennis.
"
</P>
<P>
Rafter had no time for sentiment, saying he hadn't felt bad
about beating the Wimbledon legend. "He's obviously a presence
here but his game wasn't firing today."
</P>
<P>
The Australian plays eighth seed Todd Martin who eased past
last year's finalist Goran Ivanisevic 7-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, a three-time finalist here but never a winner, was
devastated by his loss.
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty slow and didn't return well. Every volley I was
panicking when I tried to hit it. I just had a bad day and when
you have a bad day, it's bad luck," said the 10th seed.
</P>
<P>
France's Cedric Pioline, losing finalist in 1997, beat Karol
Kucera of Slovakia, the 13th seed, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 and
will play Henman.
</P>
<P>
American Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who have
both won the French Open, meet in the other quarter-final after
finding enough time amid the showers to win on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Pete Sampras, yet to drop his serve or a set,
continued his cruise towards a sixth final in seven years when he
beat Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I had four days off since I last played, and it definitely
affects your rhythm," the defending champion said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's play was washed out and Sampras's match was a victim
of the early finish on Monday, caused by showers.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Tim Henman delighted home fans when he saved three
match points on the way to beating former world number one Jim
Courier 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7, 9-7 in a match lasting four hours 30
minutes and spread over three days.
</P>
<P>
Sampras meets seventh seed Mark Philippoussis of Australia who
beat another Briton Greg Rusedski 2-6, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski was in control until the second set tiebreak when the
huge Australian's feared serve finally began to click and he won
it 7-6, the first set he had ever taken off the ninth seed.
</P>
<P>
From then on the Briton lost heart and by the fourth set
Philippoussis was breaking the fastest serve in men's tennis with
embarrassing ease.
</P>
<P>
Second women's seed Steffi Graf showed no mercy when she
finished off Belgium's teenage qualifier Kim Clijsters in eight
minutes to win their rain-delayed match 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Graf plays sixth seed Venus Williams in the quarter-finals
following the powerful American's 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian
Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
A woman qualifier will reach the semifinals at Wimbledon for
the first time after American Alexandra Stevenson came from a set
and a matchpoint down to beat Lisa Raymond 2-6, 7-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old now plays Jelena Dokic, the 16-year-old
Australian who beat top seed Martina Hingis in the first round.
The last qualifier to reach the Wimbledon semifinals was John
McEnroe in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, at the centre of a row over racism after reported
comments by her mother, read a statement at her press conference
saying her mother had been misquoted by British newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But she confirmed she had been called a "nigger" during the pre-
Wimbledon Roehampton tournament in 1998. She said she was
delighted that she and Williams were both in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"It means a great deal to me. I represent both African-American
and Caucasian - without race or anything I think it's great
because we're both friends," said Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
Williams won just four points in the first four games as
Kournikova streaked into a 4-0 lead. But the American began to
find her length in the second set and eventually won with ease.
</P>
<P>
Mirjana Lucic, the unseeded Croatian who knocked out fourth
seed Monica Seles in the previous round, ground down Thailand's
Tamarine Tanasugarn 7-5 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Lucic, 17, now meets last year's losing finalist Nathalie
Tauziat of France, the eighth seed, who beat the 15th seed
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Davenport of the U.S., the second seed, will play
defending champion Jana Novotna in the other women's quarter-final
after they both won on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Approves Four-year Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Wednesday evening
approved the four-year economic plan, entailing a lighter budget for
next year than originally expected with no mention of highly
controversial pension cuts.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 budget was put at 15 trillion lire (8 billion U.S.
dollars), comprising 11.5 trillion lire in cuts, with the ax falling
heavily on the public employment sector and regional health spending,
and 3.5 trillion lire in spending designed to boost growth.
</P>
<P>
The 2001 budget was also put at 15 trillion lire, with 7.5 trillion
lire going towards boosting growth, while the budgets for the
following two years were put at 11.5 trillion lire.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said at a press conference
later that the government did not intend to reduce welfare spending
but rather reform the system to iron out imbalances, stressing that
this would be done through negotiations with unions and management.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema put the emphasis on job creation and growth Wednesday
night, saying that the money set aside for investment should create
thousands of jobs and complaining that attention had focused over the
last week on "issues of secondary importance."
</P>
<P>
"The plan's primary objective is to establish the economic
foundations for encouraging growth and employment, this represents the
great challenge," he said, adding that talks with unions and
management on the details of these policies would follow.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to allay concerns that the lighter line of the 2000
budget risked compromising Italy's ability to meet its euro-zone
commitments as laid down in the Stability Pact, D'Alema said that
"Italy is not at the bottom of the class when it comes to its public
accounts."
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury ministry undersecretary Piero Giarda said that the
11.5 trillion lire in cuts were designed to ensure that Italy hit a
deficit-to-GDP ratio of 1.5 percent next year, as required by the
Stability Pact.
</P>
<P>
Amato is due to go through the contents of the plan with European
Union finance ministers on July 12.
</P>
<P>
The plan forecasts growth of 1.3 percent in 1999 and 2.2 percent in
2000, putting it at the bottom end of the EU economic table, although
a small sign of encouragement was given by better-than- expected first
quarter growth figures released this morning.
</P>
<P>
The plan also aims to make public debt to fall to 99.6 percent of
GDP by 2003, while the inflation rate is expected to drop to 1.2
percent next year, 1.1 percent in 2001, remaining stable at 1 percent
for the following two years.
</P>
<P>
On fiscal issues, the plan confirmed the goal of cutting income tax
from 27 percent to 26 percent as well as tax breaks for poor families
and an increase in petrol tax to boost revenue.

However, he told a meeting of 18 countries that it was the
job of NATO-led peacekeepers, only half of which had been
deployed, to keep order until U.N. police could be put in place.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this is entirely in the hands of Member
States," Annan told a press conference, "because as a Secretariat,
we have no police, and we cannot deploy and distribute what we do
not have."
</P>
<P>
Annan said the meeting with the Group of Friends of Kosovo is
"very, very useful," and consensus understanding had been reached
on several issues, including the collective objective of a
multi-ethnic Kosovo, in which all people could live their lives in
peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was also agreement that the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, known as UNMIK, should
acquire the capacity to take over responsibility for public
security from the international peacekeepers, also called KFOR, as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of new major commitments for police, he
said. The United States had pledged some 450 police plus 100
police trainers. Germany offered 200 police. Italy, Turkey and
Canada also announced increases in offers they had already made.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the United Nations had 1,423 civilian police
pledged, out of a required 1,800, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also required 1,125 special police, and had
offers of 440 of those, he said, adding that 75 border police had
been promised out of a required 205. A total of 1938 police had
been pledged, out of 3,110 required.
</P>
<P>
"I have appealed to the Member States to work with us and
move to the theater as urgently as possible the men they have
offered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police units include regular police officers, border
police, special units and trainers for a new Kosovo police.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is in charge of civilian administration in
Kosovo that runs in parallel to the military operation to resettle
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees, whose massive
exodus came in the wake of the 79-day air strikes by NATO, which
began on March 24.

<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Formula One Management Ltd, the
company which runs the motor race, said on Wednesday that it
needed more time to study a document from the European Commission
starting legal proceedings against it and the FIA world motor
racing body on grounds of anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon for the company to have assimilated the
contents of the document, however, the company welcomes that the
EU has at last stated its position," Formula One Management Ltd
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Formula One Management, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, sells
broadcasting rights for Grand Prix races.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission earlier said it had started the
proceedings against the FIA and Formula One on suspicion that they
breached EU competition rules.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission has now formally told the Federation
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)...that it considers the FIA
to be abusing its dominant position and restricting competition,"
the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Formula One said it had told the Commission "on a number of
occasions" that concerns previously expressed about certain
restrictions in the promoters' and broadcasters' contracts had
been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
It also said it was "gravely concerned" that a journalist had
an advance copy of the confidential Commission document before
itself.
</P>
<P>
"The company is considering the implications of this," it said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asian Crisis Hits Bottom, Recovery Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two years after a financial crisis
threw Asia into an economic turmoil, economies in the region are
now showing more and more signs of recovering from a deep
recession.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, 1997, the decision by the Bank of Thailand to float
the baht triggered a financial storm, which soon spread onto the
rest of the region. Currencies in Southeast Asian nations and
South Korea depreciated by 15 to 80 percent in the course of the
upheaval; stock markets in most part of Asia nose-dived by over 50
percent; foreign exchange reserves of the crisis-hit nations were
depleted to the lowest level in a decade...
</P>
<P>
With the deterioration of the crisis, dozens of banks
collapsed, thousands of companies closed, millions of people lost
their jobs and lived below the poverty line in the region. Asia,
once the fast growing region in the world, saw many countries
falling into a severe recession in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the crisis caused social unrest in Thailand, South
Korea and Indonesia and forced leadership shakeups in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
But now, on the second anniversary of the crisis, the financial
fires are out, the smoke over Asia is clearing. Asia's economic
picture has improved greatly, and the region is growing again.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe that the (Asian) countries
will successfully overcome the crisis and that a year from now we
will have a full-fledged recover," said Hubert Neiss, IMF
(International Monetary Fund) Asia-Pacific Director, at a recent
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Neiss' assessment is identical with that of many economists,
who believe that the two-year old crisis has hit the bottom and
Asia has embarked on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The most convincing sign of the recovery has come from the
financial market, whose turmoil was considered one of the direct
causes of the economic meltdown in the region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Asia's financial market has
remained relatively stable despite the launch of the euro,
Brazil's financial crisis and the unstable exchange rate of the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
However, a new round of financial storms did not break out as
many people had expected. On the contrary, Asian currencies have
appreciated steadily in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, which depreciated to 14,750 to the U.S.
dollar in June 1998 from 2,390 in February 1997, has rebounded to
around 7,000 now. The Thai baht has rose to around 37 against the
greenback from 57 during the worst part of the crisis in the first
half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Asian countries have recovered by 30 to 50 percent,
near the pre-crisis levels, and continued their upturns.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in the crisis-hit countries are confident
that the rising foreign exchange reserves and current account
surplus could prevent a new around of a financial turmoil even if
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With the stabilization of the financial market, economic
reforms and measures to stimulate the growth by Asian countries
have pushed the region's economy to the stage of recovery.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by 4.6 percent in South Korea, 1.2 percent in the Philippines
and Singapore, compared to contractions in 1998. Malaysia's GDP
also increased by 1.4 percent in February and March, although it
declined in January.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank predicted that the economy in the
developing Asia could increase 4.4 percent this year, and 5.1
percent next year, from 2.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"I think the recovery is sustainable. Exports are picking up.
Inflation is contained. Interest rates are the lowest in two
decades. Foreign reserves have been increasing steadily. The
current account has been in surplus consecutively for over a year.
Foreign investment is coming back. International confidence is
improving," said Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan at the
annual corporate conference of the Far East Economic Review last
month.
</P>
<P>
All these factors mentioned by the Thai official have paved the
way for a full-fledged recovery in Asia and could help the
stabilization of political situation in the crisis-affected
nations.
</P>
<P>
Except Indonesia, most Asian countries have become quiet as far
as the internal situation is concerned. This, in turn, has
provided favorable social environment for an economic surge.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's economic recovery is just at the initial
stage. Without further reforms in the banking sector and the
corporate sector, Asia will need much longer time to regain its
economic strength, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
Asia, in the aftermath of the crisis, still has a long way to
go toward a full recovery. This is the general consensus of
opinions by almost all economists.

<HEADLINE> Hill Set for Silverstone Swansong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Englishman Damon Hill stunned the
motor racing world by revealing he will race for the final time at
the British Grand Prix on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion guaranteed himself an emotional and
lucrative send-off in front of 100,000 fans by completing an
astonishing U-turn when all in Formula One expected him to quit
now.
</P>
<P>
Hill made his decision after three days of discussions with his
family and friends at his Spanish villa. The 38-year-old will be
at Silverstone on Thursday for a two-day test in his Jordan car
ahead of the race at the Northamptonshire circuit.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to give Damon this opportunity in front of the
sponsors and fans who have supported his great career," said team
chief Eddie Jordan. "I hope everyone will join us in making this a
triumphant send-off."
</P>
<P>
The Dublin-based driver had flown in from Spain for a head-to-
head with Jordan to apparently thrash out the final severance
details of his contract. But after a day of increasing speculation
the team announced that Hill had told them he would drive his last
grand prix at Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of both Hill and his team would have been keen to
have their main drawing card present for the most important race
the calendar.
</P>
<P>
The British Grand Prix is also a huge pay-day for Hill whose
merchandise sales at the track are greater than the rest of the
drivers combined.
</P>
<P>
Hill's 5 million pound salary with the Silverstone-based outfit
is also understood to have been a sticking point. Half of that
salary has already been paid with next week's race marking the mid-
way point of the season.
</P>
<P>
Hill would then have been due the next installment for the
remainder of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Briton has given no reason for his decision, which is a
massive change of heart given his emotional state after he was
forced to retire from last week's French Grand Prix in Magny-Cours.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar said here Wednesday that he had called on the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) President Michel Camdessus to
help Ecuador settle its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held with his Ecuadorian
counterpart Jamil Mahuad, Aznar said that world organizations such
as the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
should help Ecuador tide over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the June 28-29 Rio Summit, the leaders of
all the participating countries expressed support to the
Ecuadorian program.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the European Union financial ministers
agreed in Cologne, Germany, in early June to cancel 30 percent of
the foreign debt of the countries which are in most critical
situations.
</P>
<P>
Aznar and Mahuad signed a series of agreements ahead of the
press conference, under which Spain will provide more help to the
Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's foreign debt reached to 16 billion U.S. dollars due
to financial crisis and the bad weather caused by El Nino.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Bad Loans Hit New High in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Data from the Philippine Central
Bank showed that commercial banks' nonperforming loan ratio
climbed to 14.48 percent as of April this year, 1.1 percent higher
than the previous month, the Business World reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The April ratio was the highest since the outbreak of the Asian
contagion in 1997. The ratio is computed by dividing the volume of
bad loans by total loans.
</P>
<P>
Despite government efforts to stimulate it, bank lending
remained sluggish, with total loans granted as of April pegged at
1.65 trillion pesos (43.42 billion U.S. dollars), 1.28 percent
less than the 1.484 trillion pesos (39.06 billion dollars) as of
March.
</P>
<P>
"Total loans have been contracting since February. Banks are
still not lending," a banking analyst said.
</P>
<P>
And as the volume of loans contracted, bad loans rose by 8.44
percent to 212.138 billion pesos (5.58 billion dollars) in April,
the highest so far, from 195.635 billion pesos (5.15 billion
dollars) the month before.
</P>
<P>
Restructured loans in April amounted to 52.568 billion pesos
(1.38 billion dollars), 1.24 percent more than the 51.923 billion
pesos (1.37 billion dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
Loan loss provisions, meanwhile, summed up to 70.458 billion
pesos (1.85 billion dollars) and 67.740 billion pesos (1.78
dollars) in April and March respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last December, commercial banks' bad loans tapered off slightly
to 10.37 percent of total loans, from 11.78 percent a month ago.
It has since steadily been rising beginning January this year.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Gain Foreign Trade Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China had granted import-export
trade rights to 142 private enterprises since the beginning of
this year, when the work began.
</P>
<P>
A varying number of private firms in most of the nation's
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have gained such
trade rights.
</P>
<P>
A private firm in southwest China's Guizhou Province was
granted with the import-export trade right early last month,
according to an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). It is the first to obtain such a
right in the province.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that northwest China's Qinghai Province
is awaiting approval of its first firm to get the right.
</P>
<P>
The total 1998 export volume for the aforementioned 142 firms
hit 450 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The firms come from the sectors of industries, including
animal feed, wood and mineral processing, foodstuffs, chemicals,
agriculture, construction materials, textile, electronics and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
Applicants are required to have registered capital of at least
8.50 million yuan (some one million US dollars) and an annual
turnover of 50 million yuan. Electronic companies must have an
annual turnover of at least 30 million yuan, with the figure for
machinery standing at 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A large number of private firms are anxiously awaiting a
relaxation of requirements for import-export trade rights.

<HEADLINE> Italians in Favor But Ignorant of Euro: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Italians are all in favor of Europe's
new single currency, the euro, but not very clear about it, said a
recent poll published Wednesday by the Italian government's Euro
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,000 people, designed to gauge the knowledge
and feelings of the Italians about the euro, shows that 93.3
percent of the people questioned are comfortable with the name '
euro', while only 1.5 percent still take it as the ECU (European
Currency Unit).
</P>
<P>
Problems arose when the question turned to the currency's value.
Only 13.9 percent correctly answered that it is worth 1.936.27
lire, 15.1 percent came very close to 1.936 lire, 34.5 percent
erred in excess of 100 lire, 10 percent were way off the mark and
26.2 percent didn't know how to respond at all.
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the level of support for the common currency, which
came into being on January 1, 1999, remains very high at 79.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of those interviewed said that they have got
their information about the euro from television and radio, and 66.
2 percent said they have seen new awareness campaigns on the
currency in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Some 77 percent said they have noticed the double pricing of
products in both lire and the euro in store windows.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 22.4 percent of Italian businesses
have completed the information program linked to the arrival of
the euro, 34.3 percent are on the way, and 33.8 percent were yet
to start.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Praise Self-Study Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Wang, a 35-year-old farmer
from Zhouchan Village in east China's Zhejiang Province, recently
reached a personal milestone by completing a self-study program
and earning a three-year college equivalency certificate.
</P>
<P>
Zhou had long dreamed of becoming a university graduate, but
was ineligible for the college entrance examination, which is
limited to individuals under the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 Zhouchan villagers followed Zhou's lead and have since
participated in the self-study program, which provides a large
number of rural residents to attain higher levels of education.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the self-study exam system in 1981. The system
is free of restrictions related to place of birth, sex, age,
nationality and level of education. Chinese citizens have praised
the education system which was introduced in rural areas beginning
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China's colleges and universities had a total enrollment of 1.3
million students in 1998, with an 11 million people, mostly rural,
completing self-study examinations during the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province has established examination centers in 552,
or 30 percent, of its total villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 Zhejiang residents completed the self-study exam
in 1998 alone, with the number of rural residents participating in
the program soaring from only four percent in 1991 to over 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of rural residents in Zhejiang have earned
college equivalency certificates. The vast majority of program
graduates have remained in their hometowns and have developed into
the backbone force for local production and management.
</P>
<P>
Modern agricultural production relies heavily on technological
expertise and the program provides farmers with an avenue for self-
improvement, according to fruit grower Cheng Handing. Cheng said
the self-study program has provided rich returns and enabled him
to apply knowledge gained from related studies to his orchard
operations.
</P>
<P>
A four-year college education currently costs an estimated 40,
000 yuan for a student, while the total cost for a self-study
student stands at only 1,700 yuan, of which 1,500 yuan paid by
participants in the self-study program.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Import Tariff Cuts to Boost Purchasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand is
considering cutting import tariffs on luxury goods to help promote
Thailand as a regional shopping center for tourists, the Bangkok
Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With millions of tourists visiting Thailand every year, the
measure is expected to help boost tourism revenues, the biggest
source of foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
New rates for luxury imports would be part of a broader
restructuring plan for the current tariff system, expected to be
considered by the cabinet next month.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministry officials are considering cutting tariffs on
goods such as pens and watches to help bring local prices in line
with those quoted in Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some tariffs now are over 50 percent, raised over the past two
years by the government to help curb overconsumption and imports.
</P>
<P>
Wary of the potential impact on the current account and
imports, any new tariff adjustment would likely be to just a
limited group of goods not available or produced locally,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Finance Ministry also plans to announce
new tax waivers for raw material purchases used by producers for
export goods.
</P>
<P>
Producers would also gain similar tax benefits if goods were
sold to tourists, expected to help reduce retail prices and
promote Thailand as a regional shopping destination.
</P>
<P>
Basic raw materials would be taxed at one percent, intermediate
goods seven percent and finished goods at 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Attends Monument Unveiling Ceremony in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand ceremony for the
unveiling of the Monument in Commemoration of the Return of Hong
Kong to China was held here Thursday morning to mark the second
anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao extended warm congratulations
on the occasion on behalf of the central government and the people
of various nationalities of the country. He also extended festival
regards and greetings to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government, Hong Kong compatriots and personages of
various walks of life.
</P>
<P>
At 08:40, Vice-President Hu Jintao and HKSAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa pulled the colored strings to unveil the 20-meter-
high, 1.6-meter-wide dark colored granite monument at the seafront
of the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Center Extension.
</P>
<P>
The monument bears the seven golden Chinese characters in the
hand-writing of President Jiang Zemin, meaning Monument in
Commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to the Motherland.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Hu Jintao said that two years
ago, President Jiang Zemin solemnly declared here the resumption
by the Chinese government of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and the formal establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The
hoisting of the bright five-star red flag and the Hong Kong SAR
flag plunged the entire country into jubilation and attracted
world-wide attention.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has since turned over to a new chapter in its annals,
" he said. "To build a monument in commemoration of this event
will help our future generations to remember this history-making
event and forever carry forward the great patriotic spirit. This
is the shared inspiration of all our compatriots in Hong Kong and
indeed of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
He said that this monument keeps a historical record of the
struggles waged by sons and daughters of the Chinese nation for
national reunification and territorial integrity; it is a monument
in praise of the great practice of "one country, two systems";
this monument marks the beginning of Hong Kong people acting as
masters of their own and erecting a new milestone in building up
Hong Kong; it is a monument to the important contribution by the
Chinese people to the cause of peace and progress of mankind; and
it is an immortal monument that will stand in the heart of every
Chinese people. It will forever serve as a comfort to the dead, an
encouragement to the people today and an inspiration to the future
generations.

Over this period, he added, the Hong Kong compatriots have
shared the common fate with the motherland, making significant
contributions to the development of the mainland. With the
constant advancement of China's modernization drive, there will be
closer and more extensive economic links between Hong Kong and the
mainland. Hong Kong will surely continue to play an irreplaceable
critical role in turning China into a strong and prosperous
country. On the other hand, the sustained and steady economic
growth of the mainland will provide a stronger support for Hong
Kong's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the central people's government is determined
to implement in full the policy of "one country, two systems", "
Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and a high degree of
autonomy as well as the Basic Law. It will never waver in
supporting the SAR government led by Tung Chee Hwa in governing
Hong Kong in accordance with law. "No matter what happens, the
great socialist country will be a strong backing for the continued
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that with the correct guidance of
the policy of "one country, two systems", with the industry and
wisdom of the over six million Hong Kong compatriots, with the
effective work of the SAR government led by Tung Chee Hwa and with
the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups and the
central people's government, Hong Kong will overcome all
difficulties on its way ahead, march into the new century with a
fresh new look and bring about new glory.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About 6,000 jobs for permanent
government officials and 4,000 state employees in Thailand have
been eliminated as a result of the country's bureaucratic reform,
a seminar said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Attended by 300 senior government officials, the seminar, began

</P>
<P>
Abhisit Vejajiva, minister of Prime Minister's Office and also
vice-chairman of the bureaucratic system reform committee, told
the seminar, which aims to examine the progress of the reform,
that the Public Organization Bill, which reforms the system of
public administration, had also been promulgated.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Newspaper Urges More Interchanges With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The official newspaper New Light of
Myanmar Thursday said that the peoples of Myanmar and China will
enjoy fruits of interchanges through the promotion of economic
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial titled "Enhancing Bilateral Economic
Cooperation", the newspaper quoted Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council
(SPDC), as saying that he had "successful" discussions with
Chinese leaders during his recent visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who visited China from June 7 to 11 at the
invitation of Chinese State Councilor Luo Gan, said the
discussions were held "with a constructive approach and
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, accompanied by a deputy prime minister and eight
other ministers, said his visit is aimed at strengthening the
existing friendship and further promoting the mutually beneficial
economic cooperation between the two countries, and studying the
advances made by China in national development endeavors.
</P>
<P>
At the recent third coordination meeting of Myanmar's Leading
Committee for the Promotion of Economic Cooperation Between
Myanmar and China, Khin Nyunt also said that he had cordial
discussions with the Chinese leaders on the implementation of
tasks under the bilateral economic cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed after Senior General Than Shwe,
Myanmar SPDC chairman, paid a state visit to China in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
Since a long time ago, there have been cordial and friendly
relations between Myanmar and China with frequent exchange of
visits by their leaders. Over the past 10 years, the two countries
have also enhanced relations in the economic field.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives to Remove Leprosy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar health
official has called for removal of leprosy from the public health
problems in the country, while striving to reduce the number of
leprosy infected persons.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein said at a seminar
here Wednesday on leprosy education that there are now only over
10,000 leprosy patients in Myanmar, down from over 200,000 in
1987.
</P>
<P>
The authorities were exposing and giving treatment from 6,000
to 10,000 leprosy patients annually in the past, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts are underway to wipe out leprosy disease
from the nation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is giving priority in the health sector to combat the
disease as a public health problem. Pilot trials were initiated in
epidemic areas and anti-leprosy campaigns were started in 1951
which covered the whole country by the end of 1968.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1977, there registered 270,000 leprosy cases in
Myanmar, the highest number of the cases at one period in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1988, 33,875 of cases were reported discharged as cured.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of Multi Drug Treatment by the World
Health Organization in 1989, 120,057 patients were also
reportedly cured up to the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Later, Myanmar worked out a two-phase National Leprosy
Elimination Project (1993-96 and 1996-2001).

Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation (BSFIC), the
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Bangladesh
Forest Industries Development Corporation and the Bangladesh Jute
Mils Corporation (BJMC).

million taka (1.26 million dollars) and 6,767 million taka (139.53
million dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the six corporations, the BJMC has an accumulated loss of
15,494.4 million taka (319.47 million dollars), followed by the
BTMC of 8,946.2 million taka (184.46 million dollars). The three

Early this year, the Bangladeshi government decided to
privatize 51 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under the BTMC, the
BJMC, the BSFIC, the BSEC and the BCIC respectively, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs in the country, with a total value of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Predicts Colder Global Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The latest research on ice cores
from the South Pole suggests that the global climate is entering a
period of transition from warm to cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Colder weather is likely to follow years of global warming,
according to doctor Kang Jiancheng, director of the polar region
office under the Chinese Polar Region Institute.
</P>
<P>
Kang, a member of the research team, recently urged the nation'
s cities, both coastal and inland, to fully consider the influence
global climate changes will have on the construction of
infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ice cores from the South Pole are believed to offer an accurate
record of atmospheric conditions over tens of thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Record of global climate changes over the past 400,000 years
indicate that the world characteristically passes through cool and
warm cycles.
</P>
<P>
The North and South poles and the glacier on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau in southwest China, the world's so-called "third pole,"
are generally considered to be the best areas for obtaining
ancient meteorological information and for conducting
environmental and climatic research.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Fishing Moratorium Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The first fishing moratorium in
the South China Sea, an initial effort to protect fish resources,
has proceeded smoothly over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Trawling and all forms of net fishing have been banned in area
north of 12 degrees latitude, including the Beibu Gulf between
June 1-July 31.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of over 10,300 trawlers and fishing boats in
Guangdong Province, which has been most affected by the fishing
ban, have remained berthed and fishing licenses have been handed
in to the provincial fisheries administration.
</P>
<P>
The province's 1999 output for aquatic products will drop by
estimated 200,000 tons, or approximately 12 percent of the normal
annual total, as a result of the two-month fishing ban.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Yiping, the senior official in charge of fishing,
said that over 60 million shrimp and 3.55 million fry fish, valued
10 million yuan, will be released into the South Sea during the
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable source with the marine aquatics department has
reported an ample supply of related products on the market. Price

<HEADLINE> China's Wang Picked by Dallas Mavericks in NBA Draft ( Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese center Wang Zhizhi has
been picked 36th in the second round of the National Basketball
Association draft by Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday to become the
first Asian basketball player in history ever to be drafted by an
NBA team.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is 2.12 meters tall and weighs 115 kilograms,
averaged 11.1 points and 5.6 rebounds for China at the Atlanta
Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who turns 22 on July 8, plays for China's five-time
national champion Bayi Rockets.
</P>
<P>
He led China's CBA league by blocking last season and was third
in scoring.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Dallas Mavericks, I'm so glad that we will
have the chance to work with Wang Zhizhi because he's a young
basketball player with great talent," said Donn Nelson, head coach
of the Dallas Mavericks, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"His draft story will remind basketball fans of Toni Kukoc,
Dino Radja, Drazen Petrovic, Cedric Cegallos P.J. Brown,. and even
Dennis Rodman, all of whom succeeded after being drafted at the
same position as Wang," Nelson added.
</P>
<P>
As the first NBA coach ever visited China, Nelson spent nine
days in Beijing and Shanghai last summer and had basketball
clinics for Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) coaches, Junior
Team, Pro team, and young kids.
</P>
<P>
"Two things made me fall in love with this country, great
people and the love Chinese people give to the game," Nelson said.
"I found that the potential of basketball in China is huge; the
CBA has done a great job of making this game popular in China. The
game will become much more popular sport in the country with the
drafting of Wang into NBA."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to see that China has produced the first Asian
basketball player to make the NBA," Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
But Nelson said the Mavericks will respect CBA's decision if
they do not allow Wang to play in NBA very soon.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I know it might be difficult for Wang to come out and
play in the NBA very soon since the Army Club might need him to
stay and carry the team for a couple of more years. The Mavericks
will respect the special situation of China basketball and Army
basketball."
</P>
<P>
Nelson added: "But the reason we drafted him is that Wang
deserves this pick because of his basketball skills and potential,
and I hope this young person will have the chance to make his hoop
dream come true soon.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to make the same mistake that the Golden State
Warriors made in 1990 when they passed up the opportunity to
choose Toni Kukoc, and the Chicago Bulls went on to draft him in
the second round," he said.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China outplayed their Russian
opponents for a 2-0 victory to advance into the semifinals of the
Women's World Cup soccer tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team enjoyed a good start in the match, but failed
to grasp any of the scoring chances in the first 30 minutes though
they totally dominated their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team, which qualified to the quarterfinals as
runners-up of Group C, were no match to their Chinese counterparts.
They adopted a defensive tactics in the first half, playing one
forward in the front and had only one shot in the first 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team nearly scored at the 24th minute but Jin Yan's
shot was just blocked by the Russian goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, Liu Ailing released a 35-meter shot, only to
see the ball flying over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The Russian goal-keeper also denied an attempt from Chinese
captain Sun Wen at the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
But two minutes later, after a Chinese attack caused a mess in
front of the Russian goal, the Russian defenders failed to clear the
ball and Pu Wei collected the loose ball and sent home a 35-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
After lagging 1-0 behind, the Russian team tried to play more
aggressively in the second half, but still could not find a way of
penetrating the Chinese defense line.
</P>
<P>
Russian captain Irina Grigorieva, who was voted best player in
two of Russian team's group matches, found it impossible for her to
organise her team's attacking.
</P>
<P>
For most time of the match, Grigorieva had to do a defensive
work as her team were out-shot by their Chinese counterparts 24-2 in
the match.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yan put China 2-0 ahead at the 56th minute when she tapped
in a rebound after Sun Wen's free-kick hit the post.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wen, who has scored 5 goals in the tournament and has a shot at
the best scorer of the tournament, failed to score a goal by herself
in the match, yet she was still named the best player of the match.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will play Norway in the semifinals at Boston on
July 4. Norway beat Sweden 3-1 in another quarterfinal match here

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industrial Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production value
in the first six months of this year rose 10.3 percent on a
year-on-year basis, the local press Thursday quoted a report of
Vietnam's General Statistics Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase was low compared with the 12.6 percent
registered in the first half of last year and 13.6 percent in the
first half of 1997, due to poor performance of the domestic
sector, including both state-owned and non-state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested sector maintained a high growth rate
thanks to the operation of more projects. The sector posted a
22.6-percent increase in the reviewed period as compared with 23.3
percent of last year's first half.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, enterprises under Vietnam's Ministry of Industry
boosted their production by only 4.4 percent in the first six
months of 1999 while the corresponding figure of last year was
10.1 percent. In the country's two industrial hubs of Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City, centrally-run enterprises achieved 6.8 and 4.1
percent increases respectively in production value.
</P>
<P>
The rise was 6.6 percent for the non-state sector, just more
than half of the 11.5-percent growth in the same period of last
year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Form National AIDS Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice-Chairman Sobbie Mulindi of Kenya's National AIDS Committee
said the council would be the highest body in dealing with
HIV/AIDS activities, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi said the council would involve multi-sectors including
 ministries, professionals, non-governmental organizations,
private sector, religious organizations and donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the formation of the council is a necessity by
the reality that the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is no
longer a Ministry of Health affair but is affecting all sectors
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
To assist the council, he said, the government has come up with
a sessional paper on AIDS and will see to it that it is fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to Mulindi, a massive multi-sectoral campaign would
be launched at the grassroots level to sensitize local
communities on HIV/AIDS and effect a change of attitude.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS has been a grave social problem in Kenya and has
seriously affected the country's economic development. It is said
that AIDS orphans in Kenya is expected to reach 580,000 next year
and almost one million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
A latest report prepared by the National AIDS Control Program
says that the cumulative number of AIDS deaths would increase
from the current 100, 000 to one million by 2000 and 2.1 million
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Health Permanent Secretary Philemon Mwaisaka said in
mid-June that more than 200,000 Kenyans would die from AIDS
before the end of this year.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coach Ma Yuanan was quite
satisfied with his team's performance in the quarterfinal match
against Russia and vowed to fight to the end of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team dominated the match and beat Russia 2-0 to book
a berth in the semifinals slated for July 4 at Boston.
</P>
<P>
The result equalled the Chinese team's best record in the World
Cup tournaments. They finished fifth in the inaugural World Cup
held in China in 1991 and placed fourth in Sweden four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuanan said after his team's victory over Russia:"I am very
pleased with our performance today. This is a game of life and
death. So if we don't want to pack our luggage for Beijing earlier
in the tournament, we should fight to the last minute."
</P>
<P>
"This game is about our techniques, strategies and mental
toughness. The game is cruel. Any team that loses can't play the
next game. The Chinese players are quite stable today." Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his players were not nervous at the beginning of the
match:"I think we did pretty good from the beginning. We missed
some chances. We shall improve on that in the future."
</P>
<P>
Ma said it made no difference to him if China play Sweden or
defending champions Norway:"No matter which team win, it's not a
problem to us. In 1998, we played against Norway three times and we
won twice and lost one game. Since 1995 we have not lost to Sweden.
To me, the important thing is we have to play our best."
</P>
<P>
Norway beat Sweden 3-1 in another quarterfinal match later on
Wednesday. China and Norway will vie for a berth in the final at
Boston on July 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The electoral commission in Malawi
has postponed local government polls originally scheduled in
September till 2000, a report reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local government preparatory meeting Wednesday,
the commission chair, Justice James Kalaile, said the commission
has decided to shift the local elections in order to iron out
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
"Our technical advisers have told us that we need the whole
country redemarcated as most parts of the country are not on the
national map," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalaile added that work on the local elections is already
underway. Most of the 160,000 U.S. dollars needed for the
demarcation exercise and another 300,000 dollars required for
registration of voters had already been secured from donors.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission would like to avoid the mistakes which
threatened to derail the June 15 general elections. The commission
plans to computerize the registration exercise to make it
difficult to tamper with.
</P>
<P>
In order to conduct hitch-free polls, the commission needed
enough time despite earlier arrangements that the local polls be
held three months after the general elections, Kalaile added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the local polls cannot be held during the rain
season, which starts in October, because many parts of the country
will be inaccessible. This will mean the polls not being held
before April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Malawi has had no local authorities since 1994 when the ruling
United Democratic Front dissolved all previous local authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military police have
foiled what they suspected of an attempt by the Islamic militant
group Hamas to kidnap Israeli soldiers, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon, three policewomen patrolling at a
hitchhiking station near a military base south of Tel Aviv found a
silver Subaru suspicious when they overheard the conversation
between the driver and a soldier who asked for a lift, the Haaretz
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who wore a skullcap popular among Jewish males,
pronounced the Jewish name "Jabotinsky" with a heavy Arabic accent
and he and two back-seat passengers all wore uniforms of the
Israeli Air Force, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
After the policewomen prevented the soldier from getting in,
the car sped away. A police chopper was sent to comb the area, but
found no sign of the car.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army believed that the three men were members of a
Hamas cell that was trying to kidnap Israeli soldiers, The
Jerusalem Post daily quoted a military police official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
has staged bombing attacks against Israel, has warned of its
intention to kidnap Israeli soldiers to use as bargaining chips
to trade for the release of Hamas members jailed in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Banks Urged to Aid Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Lebanon were urged to
extend soft loans to small businesses in a bid to stimulate
investments and create more jobs, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven that banks extending modest loans to small
investors will have a good turnover," said Youssef Khalil, head of
the financial operating department at the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar Wednesday on the mechanism to create
liquidity in the local market, Khalil said that recent statistics
show that small businesses usually settle their commitments to the
banks faster than big borrowers.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanese farmers get 1.5 percent of the total bank
loans, while industries receive under 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, many small farmers are forced to go to loan
sharks to get loans with staggering interest rates that sometimes
reaches more than 200 percent."
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank's statistics, less than 1
percent of borrowers receive 49 percent of the total bank loans,
while 47 percent of borrowers account for only 2.3 percent of
the money lent.
</P>
<P>
Banks have extended loans worth some 12 billion U.S. dollars to
the private sector since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Fahim Mo'dad, vice governor of the Central Bank, said that
Lebanon did not have a cash flow problem.
</P>
<P>
"Banks are liquid and can help activate the economy with their
loan programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Central Bank may consider amending the
existing money and credit law to allow Islamic banks to operate
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, the Central Bank was also called on to allow
Islamic banks to operate in Lebanon because they have huge liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Mo'dad said the Central Bank, in collaboration with the
Association of Banks in Lebanon, would soon create a loan
guarantee fund to extend soft loans to small-and-medium-size
businesses which would benefit about 13,000 small institutions.
</P>
<P>
"This program will create 56,000 job opportunities and also
increase the economy growth by 2 to 3 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mo'dad estimated that 3 billion dollars in commercial banks
were not being properly used to stimulate investments.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Ship Weighs Anchor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai: The Snow Dragon, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first
scientific expedition to the North Pole kicked off today as the "
Snow Dragon", an ultra-modern icebreaker carrying 124 scientists
and journalists, weighed anchor from a dock in Shanghai this
morning and turned her head towards the Yellow Sea ready to sail
to the polar wastelands.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will take two months, and the scientists are
expected to return to Shanghai on September 1st.
</P>
<P>
Several days of heavy rain in Shanghai ended this morning and
Zhang Dengyi, the director of the State Oceanic Administration,
along with more than 200 officials, students and Shanghai citizens
were at the dock to bid farewell to the expedition team.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the expedition from Shanghai Wenying Primary
School, the kids warned the scientists and journalists to watch
out for polar bears.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, the expedition's chief scientist, said before the
ship left that his team will study the effect of the North Pole on
the global climate, especially on China, the ecological system in
Arctic waters, and the atmosphere, geology, fishing, and marine
environment of the area.
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to the South Pole, the North Pole exerts an
influence on China, as it is located in the northern hemisphere.
As a result of this trip Chinese scientists should be able to
increase their knowledge of the climate and environment in the
Arctic region," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He added that China intends to actively take part in extensive
scientific research of the polar region while at the same time
protecting yet peacefully exploiting the natural resources there.
</P>
<P>
According to the expedition plan, the ship will pass through
the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, and on into the Canada Basin.

NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned giant Kenya Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) ceases to exist
Thursday as a milestone of the privatization process began in
1995, Kenya Transport and Communications Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The three new corporate bodies born from the former KPTC are

</P>
<P>
Telkom Kenya Limited, which took over telecommunications
business of the KPTC, has begun its work, the company's managing
director office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Telkom Wednesday received its 25-year license and
instruments of mandate from the CCK, the office said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear who will buy the Telkom or buy the shares of
the company, " the office also said.
</P>
<P>
"Some 18,000 employees out of the KPTC's work force of 24,000
go to the Telkom, the rest will continue work for the other two
units", the office said, adding that the split of the KPTC is not
expected to cause job losses.
</P>
<P>
Genesius Kithinji, head of the posts and telecommunications
department at the ministry said Wednesday that there will be no
delays in the privatization of the communication sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a nine-member transitional management committee has
been formed to help wind up the KPTC, dealing with its
liabilities and disputes, according to a recent special issue of
the Kenya Gazette. The committee comprised of high-ranking
officials will remain in office until the completion, the Kenya
Gazette said.

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Russian team lost to China 2-0
in the quarterfinals and were eliminated from the 3rd women's World
Cup soccer tournament on Wednesday, but the Russian team coach said
the result was just acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ury Bistritsky, head coach of the Russian team, said his team's
overall objective was to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympic
Games:"So the important thing for us is not to concede too many
goals because the goal of going to Sydney Olympics is at stake."
</P>
<P>
Bistritsky said:"We didn't play as strong as China tonight. We
realized that China would attack us and pile up pressure and we had
to face off to stand up to all the pressure. In the long run, we
don't feel that this is a bad result."
</P>
<P>
Bistritsky complaint that his team lacked prepration for the
World Cup:"Our team had no opportunity or any chance to prepare for
a tournament like this in the way China or the American team can.
We only had five or six days of training before we began competing
in the tournament and that's not the way of doing it properly."
</P>
<P>
Russian goal-keeper Svetlana Petko said the result was
reasonable:"Being realists, we realized China would be the stronger
side. We proceeded from this assumption when preparing for the game
and building up the plan."
</P>
<P>
"If we try to attack early in the game, the result would have
been quite different, not just 0-2. This was the determining factor
in selecting our tactics." said the goal-keeper.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Confident of Rice Self-Sufficiency by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has vowed to help modernize the agricultural sector so that the
nation could be self-sufficient in rice, corn and sugar by the
year 2001, a presidential news release said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a regular TV program, Estrada said governors
nationwide have pledged to help his administration attain this
goal.
</P>
<P>
He said food security and agricultural modernization are the
potent tools that would aid his administration in wiping out
poverty in the country and providing adequate food for each
Filipino.
</P>
<P>
The president also voiced his confidence in this sector, citing
a 31-percent growth in rice production and a 62-percent growth in
corn harvest during the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a study, however, the barriers to the development
of agriculture in the nation include the lack of irrigation
systems, post-harvest facilities and other infrastructure in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that at present the annual average rice
import of the country is 600,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Cycling Squad to Head Early to Brunei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian cycling squad for
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games are likely to depart to
Brunei earlier in order that they can have enough time to
familiarize themselves with the track.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the idea because what they do is for our benefit,
" Chairman of the Indonesian Sports Council (KONI) Wismoyo
Arismunandar was quoted by The Indonesian Observer Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo duly ordered Secretary General Rudolf S. Warrow to deal
with their departure date.
</P>
<P>
Apart from nine trainees in Bandung, West Java, for the
mountain bicycle class, Indonesia is preparing eight men's
cyclists -- preparing in Yogyakarta in Central Java -- for the
Individual Time Trial, Criterium and Road Race events.
</P>
<P>
The eight are Tonton Susanto, Henry Setiawan, Wawan Setiobudi,
Goang Sulistyono, Herry Janto Setiawan, Hengky Setiawan, Mohammad
Basri and Suwandra.
</P>
<P>
Hengky Setiawan was first to raise the idea of preceding the
other squad members. He proposed they go a week before August 7,
the official opening of the games, in a bid to "get accustomed to
the arena."
</P>
<P>
Cycling bagged 13 out of 16 golds, nine silvers and four
bronzes in the 19th SEA Games held here two years ago. The
association has set a target of winning three of seven golds at
stake in this year's biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to win a gold and improve my time at the
upcoming SEA Games," said Tonton Susanto.
</P>
<P>
Herry Janto Setiawan said: "I want to win in SEA Games. In a
tryout in Johor, we proved to be better than Malaysia. But we
should not let ourselves let up in Brunei."

<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Norway Advance into Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Norway beat
Sweden 3-1 to set up a semifinal clash with China in the 3rd women's
World Cup soccer tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions met a stiff resistence from the Swedish
team in the first half. Though they dominated the pace of the match
with their long ball tactics, they could not find the right way to
tear off the Swedish team's defence line.
</P>
<P>
After the goalless first half, Norway enjoyed greater advantage
both physically and tactically. At the 51st minute, they were
awarded a free-kick and Ann Kristin Aarones headed home the
perfectly positioned cross to give her team a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish team became more nervous after conceding the goal.
Seven minutes later, Marianne Pettersen, who was named the best player
of the match, broke down the right flank and volleyed a cross over the
head of the Swedish goal-keeper Ulrika Karlsson straight into the net.
</P>
<P>
Norway's third goal came at the 71th minute when Karlsson
brought down Pettersen in the area. Hege Riise converted the
penalty kick to put Norway 3-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions played relaxed and as the game headed
into the injury time they lost their concentration for a while.
That was enough for the Swedish team to score a consolation goal at
the first minute of the injury time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a match between China and Russia, the Chinese team
proved they are deserved the status of being one of the favorites of the
tournament by scoring a comfortable 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
By entering the semifinals, China and Norway qualify for the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Australia earn an automatic ticket to
the Olympics as the host team. While Russia and Sweden still have
their chances of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
According to the qualifying regulations set by FIFA, only the team
from the four losing quarterfinals which has the worst group
competition results will miss the Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Training Director Back to Coaching Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) official in charge of athletes' development M.F.
Siregar denied rumors which said national training director
Christian Hadinata would resign from his post.
</P>
<P>
"It's not true. Christian will just focus his attention on
coaching the men's doubles because it's the only event we have a
chance to win a gold in the 2000 Olympics," Siregar was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Christian would resign due to disappointment
over PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, who often used his veto
rights to disapprove of Christian's training programs.
</P>
<P>
But Christian himself said he wanted to only focus on the men's
doubles training.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Christian would be replaced either by himself or
deputy Hadi Nasri until the Olympics 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine if we fail to win a gold in the Olympics," he
said, referring to Indonesia's shameful failure in the Sudirman
Cup and World Championships in Copenhagen where none of the
national shuttlers reached the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Christian, a former doubles specialist, had contributed a great
deal to the 1996 Olympics gold when his athletes Ricky Subagja and
Rexy Mainaky beat Malaysians Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock in a
thrilling deciding game final.
</P>
<P>
He also teamed up with Candra Wijaya and Sigit Budiarto who
beat the same Malaysian pairs of Cheah and Yap in the 1997 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Christian said his position as training director made it
difficult to make a decision on the men's doubles because other
coaches from other events would consider him subjective.
</P>
<P>
But Herry Imam Pierngadi and Sigit Pamungkas have been coaching
the men's doubles since Christian was appointed director in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said PBSI could not rely on Herry due to his lack of
experience.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have Atiek (Djauhari) who was also experienced to
help Christian. But Herry was too young to prepare athletes for
the biggest event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Atiek resigned from PBSI last year and moved to Malmo, Sweden,
where he is responsible for the Swedish national team.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Christian had to make his priorities on which
doubles team to concentrate on to qualify for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the 1999 All England champion Candra Wijaya
and Tony Gunawan and new partnerships of Flandy Limpele and Eng
Hian. But we are still looking for the third pair. We have the
1996 Olympics Ricky and Rexy and old hands Antonius and Denny
Kantono," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another pair preparing to qualify for the Olympics is Sigit
Budiarto and new partner Halim Heryanto.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks to Resume At Noon Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's peace talks,
adjourned until later in the day on the deadlock of guerrilla
disarmament, will resume at noon, with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to remain on hand.
</P>
<P>
The talks were called off after nearly 18 hours of non-stop
negotiations and four hours after a Wednesday midnight deadline
originally set by Blair for an agreement that would keep last year
's Good Friday peace accord alive.
</P>
<P>
Rivaling politicians from the British province's majority
Protestant and minority Roman Catholic communities were deadlocked
over how and when guerrillas will turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock is blocking formation of a power-sharing
provincial administration, a cornerstone of the Good Friday accord.
Unionists refuse to sit in a cabinet with Sinn Fein until the IRA
sheds its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political wing Sinn Fein made
a new offer after the midnight deadline expired to try to achieve
disarmament by May 2000, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Details of the new Sinn Fein offer were not known but sources
said it amounted to a commitment that IRA disarmament would begin
by October, on condition that the Unionists accept the immediate
admission of Sinn Fein into a coalition executive.
</P>
<P>
Unionists, however, were demanding that disarmament should be
simultaneous with the formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
Lights burned through the early hours at the sprawling, red-
brick Castle Buildings complex where Blair and his co-broker,
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, tried to get an agreement,
Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton joined the efforts, phoning the
negotiators in an effort to help secure a deal, according to
earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> HK Disney Park Negotiations Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations concerning the
construction of a Disney Theme Park in Hong Kong have produced "
significant progress" but no agreement has been reached yet and
talks were extended by four months.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip told a
press conference Thursday that "significant progress" has been
made over the past four months in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced in his Budget Speech
on March 3 that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government and the Walt Disney Company had agreed to engage in
intensive negotiations with a view to determining, by June 30,
whether a Disney project could be brought to fruition in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ip said the Disney project is highly complex and requires a
thorough analysis of the economic costs and benefits and careful
evaluation of the technical and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "we need a further period of serious
discussions to make sure that the terms of any agreement on a
Disney project are mutually acceptable and can be reached in
sufficient detail for both sides to be comfortable."
</P>
<P>
What is important is that "we have made significant progress"
in the past four months and "we are continuing our negotiations
with a view of reaching an agreement by the end of October," Ip
said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the press conference, Commissioner for Tourism
Mike Rowse said both sides in the negotiations are satisfied with
the "considerable progress" made and there is not anything "
holding it up" but some technical details involving such aspects
as transport and reclamation remain and require further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the Disney project is a "useful asset" for
Hong Kong's tourism sector, so the SAR side does not want to "lose
momentum" in the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Aim at Taking Revenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One day before their quarterfinals
against Brazil, the Nigerian team have already aimed at taking
revenge to the American team.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian team suffered a 7-1 loss to the American team in
group competitions, but they still managed to qualify for the
quarterfinals with a 2-1 win over DPR Korea and 2-0 over Denmark.
</P>
<P>
On making the quarterfinals, Nigerian coach Ismaila Mabo said:"I
am highly delighted to have done not only Nigeria but the continent
of Africa proud."
</P>
<P>
Mabo didn't give up hopes of making the final:"With God on our
side, we shall qualify for the finals and play against the United
States and also take our revenge."
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerians' next opponents will be the Brazilians and
Mabo said he knew the Brazilian soccer style well:"In my playing
days, I played under a Brazilian coach in Nigeria. I know the style
of Brazil and I am going to present a very good strategy that will
counter the smooth play of Brazil."
</P>
<P>
"We will win the match against Brazil on Thursday. After our
next match against Brazil, I will start to think about the U.S.
team." said Mabo.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian forward Mercy Akide said:"I know victory shall be ours.
 And after that I will start thinking about the American team."
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Wilson De Oliveira Rica also set his aim on
playing the American team in the semifinals, but he said he would
not underestimate any one of their opponents:"We will respect every
single one of our opponents. There is no preference to play any
team. We will prepare like we always prepare."
</P>
<P>
Rica said:"Inevitably we will have to face the U.S. team and
down the road is much better because teams will have sharpened up
their skills."

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Issue Bonds to Stabilize Local Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Thursday
decided to issue South Korean won-denominated bonds worth up to
five trillion won (some 4.17 billion U.S. Dollars) to stabilize
local currency market.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a ministerial meeting Thursday to
check the won's recent appreciation against the greenback produced
by the current-account surplus and inflows of stock funds from
abroad and a reduction in export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy said the move
will contribute greatly to stabilizing foreign exchange rates once
the treasury bonds with maturity less than 10 years are issued.
</P>
<P>
The stabilization bonds will result in a rise in won-based
debts as well as in foreign exchange holdings, the two effects
offsetting each other with adverse effects minimized, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the South Korean won was traded at 1,158.50 U.S.
dollar at the foreign exchange market here.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Soars on U.S. Fed Rate Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shot higher
Thursday, gaining almost one U.S. cent following strength in
commodity prices and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lift
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency's momentum pushed it to a peak of 67.1
U.S. cents after it recouped more than half a U.S. cent overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 66.86 U.S. cents from 66.01
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar had a very good day today in a
continuation from last night's move up on the back of the U.S.
rate hike and with the Fed back on hold," Michael Sarpi, head of
foreign exchange sales at Commonwealth Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its funds rate by 25 basis
points to 5 percent in a widely-anticipated move Wednesday night
but, more importantly for future trends, moved its monetary policy
bias back to neutral.
</P>
<P>
Sarpi said it was also a commodity price story for the
Australian dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of the health of
commodity prices internationally, was up 2.17 points to 191.54
Wednesday night on strong rises in oil and copper prices.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian dollar was trading at 64.46
euro cents from 63.86 and 80.78 Japanese yen from 79.78.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Makes Agriculture Number One Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President OLusegun Obasanjo
has said that his government would give top priority to
agriculture, The Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the president as saying on Wednesday that
"agriculture is our number one priority because of many reasons."
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo pointed out that the issue of agriculture
had transcended beyond family lines, "it is now a matter of
national security."
</P>
<P>
In keeping the tempo of agriculture at the level of sustainable
 development, the president promised to subsidize fertilizer.
Such subsidy would be cautiously pursued, a departure from the
indiscriminate manner of the previous governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will make sure that the subsidy benefits get to the
farmers," President Obasanjo assured.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on Tuesday in capital Abuja, Nasarawa State
Governor Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu said the Nigerian government had
decided to subsize the price of fertilizer by 25 percent as part
of efforts to revitalize the agriculture sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was part of the resolutions of the
inaugural meeting of the Council of State presided over by
President Obasajo on Tuesday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that arrangements had also bee made to
ensure that fertilizer get to farmers as soon possible.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on EU's New Decision on China's Wooden Crates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's new decision
to delay the date to implement its new quarantine standard imposed
on Chinese wooden crates, boxes and pallets used for exporting
goods until July 10 will help reduce the losses of the Chinese
side, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Hu Chusheng said that China has noted the EU's new
decision, which extends the grace period by a month, and considers
it will reduce the expected losses for owners of the wooden crated
goods waiting for shipment at Chinese ports.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade companies, meanwhile, are making vigorous
efforts to pack their goods according to the new quarantine
standard of the EU side, Hu said, aiming to cut the negative
impact of the EU's decision on China's exports to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
China strongly resented the EU's decision targeting wood-crates
used for Chinese exports to Europe, because it could "adversely
affect Chinese exports valued at some seven billion U.S. dollars,"
Hu announced earlier last month after the EU's decision was
announced on June 1.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Cambodian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China and Cambodia should reinforce bilateral
cooperation in various fields to bring traditional Sino-Cambodian
friendship up to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The Premier made the statement during a meeting here this
afternoon with Hor Nam Hong, Cambodia's senior minister and
minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China and Cambodia, both developing countries,
have no problems left over from history nor current conflicts in
their interests, and it is the common aspiration of the two sides
to intensify bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China values its economic and trade ties with Cambodia on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit and it is willing to provide
support and help to the economic reconstruction in Cambodia within
China's ability, Zhu told Hor Nam Hong.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China is pleased to see that the
Cambodia's new government, under the leadership of King Sihanouk,
has scored fresh progress in its internal and foreign affairs. "We
believe that the new government of Cambodia will grasp the
historic opportunity to put forward the process of national
reconciliation and make even greater achievements in national
construction", Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong said that Cambodia-China relations have witnessed
a good momentum of development since Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen's successful visit to China last February. He told Zhu that
the related government departments of Cambodia are working to
implement the common ground reached by the leaders of the two
countries to promote bilateral cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong also briefed Zhu on the domestic situation in
Cambodia and voiced the hope that more Chinese enterprises would
invest in his country.

<HEADLINE> Military Scientists Urged to Make More Contributions to National Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has
urged military scientists to solve a range of major technological
problems in the field of national defense in order to catch up
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a letter to the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, as well as a number
of military supply industrial groups, on June 28.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Jiang welcomed the restructuring of the
sector from five core groups into ten, more efficient and
independently controlled corporations serving national defense.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the move was an important part of the
country's overall modernization program which was also aimed at
boosting national defense.
</P>
<P>
Scientists involved in military work are urged to stick to the
spirit of "self-reliance, hard struggle and selflessness devotion"
and make coordinated efforts in their scientific research in the
field of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary called on them to work closely together
much like their predecessors had done when developing the atomic
and hydrogen bombs and satellites decades ago.
</P>
<P>
During the overall push to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics, China must continuously promote the economic
growth and power of national defense, Jiang said. He also called
on party committees, governments at various levels and all
branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to actively support
the national defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The newly established military industrial groups are also asked
to introduce administrative and management reforms to meet the
demands of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Technical innovation of the national defense industry is also
urged by Jiang Zemin.

<TEXT>
<P>
The EU's June 1 announcement urged member nations to adopt
immediate measures to implement new inspection standards for
packaging using wooden crates or materials for exports from China
after June 10.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hucheng, MOFTEC assistant minister, met with the European
Union Ambassador to China Endymion Wilkinson on June 11 to lodge a
serious complaint about the EU's decision, saying that China
reserves the right to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
But, MOFTEC officials told Xinhua on June 18 that Chinese
export companies have been told to improve the quality and
standard when using wooden boxes for packing their export products
in a special notice issued by MOFTEC and several other Chinese
ministerial departments.
</P>
<P>
Export companies have been warned to carefully select wooden
boxes, crates and pallets according to the new required standards.
Below standard wood must be specially treated before being used as
packaging for exports.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the EU side will, in accordance with the spirit
of bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation, enhance
negotiations and avoid unilateral trade restriction measures that
will affect adversely the normal growth of bilateral trade," Hu
said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that China also hopes that the EU and its
member nations would reduce arbitrary actions in carrying out
relevant regulations so as to maintain normal development of
bilateral trade relations.

potential buyers worldwide of the state-owned Tanzania
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL), local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Privatization with new investment capital, technology and
management will enable the TTCL to provide its customers with
better telephone services, a senior official was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We expect considerable interest from investors," said John
Rubambe, Executive Chairman of the Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission (PSRC).
</P>
<P>
"There is superb potential for a private telecom company in
Tanzania and TTCL will become that company."
</P>
<P>
The TTCL currently has only 127,000 lines connecting its
customers countrywide that can offer telephone services to about
two percent of Tanzanian families.
</P>
<P>
Rubambe said that advertisements for prospective buyers have
been placed in local, regional and international publications for
bidders.
</P>
<P>
Up to 14 percent of shares will be sold to international
financial organizations, 10 percent to Tanzania financial
organizations and five percent to TTCL employees, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The winning bidder will receive 35 per cent of TTCL shares and
has management control of the company under government
regulations," Rubambe said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TTCL received Wednesday a license from the Tanzania
Communications Commission (TCC) to provide its mobile cellular
phone service.
</P>
<P>
Operated under a subsidiary company called Celnet Mobile (TZ)
Ltd, the service will be digital with a countrywide coverage
backed by TTCL's own modern network.
</P>
<P>
TTCL expects the service will be of very high quality and be
offered at easy, affordable tariffs.

YANGON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt Wednesday called for efforts to build Yangon, the
capital city, into a modern city of international standard and
improve the living standard, welfare and socioeconomic life of the
city's residents.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with officials of the Yangon City Development Committee
here Wednesday, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council, recalled that Yangon city was full
of wards, squatter quarters and slums when the government took
power in 1988, saying Yangon was neither beautiful nor hygienic
and the living standard was also very low.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the city has developed due to the
establishment of new towns, the hut-to-apartment scheme and the
improvement of the standard of living, construction of modern
housing projects and low-cost ones for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the city's tax revenue increased from 1.343
billion kyats (4.47 million U.S. dollars) in 1991-92 to 8.379
billion kyats (27.9 million dollars) in 1998-99 and is to further
rise to 9 billion kyats (30 million dollars) for the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials to boost revenues while ensuring that tax
collection would not pose a burden to the public.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Calls for Increased Anti-Flood Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's flood control emergency
services have been put on full alert as the country enters the
summer flood season and governments at various levels should be
fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from Vice Premier Wen Jiabao who said that
since the start of last month exceedingly heavy rainfalls have
caused flooding in east China's Taihu Lake region and some areas
along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
He made remarks when addressing the second plenary meeting of
the State Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief (
SHFCDR) this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the SHFCDR told those present that as of
14:00 pm (Beijing Time) today, the water level of the Taihu Lake
had risen to 4.82 meters, 0.03 meters higher than its previous
recorded high.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parts of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei and Fujian
provinces have also been severely affected by floods, according to
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by local officials and people, losses from
the flooding were reduced to as small as possible. Meteorological
reports indicate that the rainfalls will basically stop by
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged officials at various levels to be prepared for
possible disasters, shoulder responsibility for flood prevention
and take concrete measures so as to reduce losses of both lives
and properties.
</P>
<P>
"The key task now is to increase flood prevention efforts in
the southern region and local governments in the Taihu Lake area
should strive to ensure the safety of major dykes and cities," Wen
said.
</P>
<P>
"Flood control departments should have emergency programs
already in place, make full use of flood control facilities and
efficiently arrange anti-flood work," Wen added.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also called for those departments involved to
increase coordination and cooperation, and earnestly exercise
their respective duties for the final success of the anti-flood
work.

<HEADLINE> Feature: PLA Open Barracks Day Impresses HK Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The display of military skills
and weapons of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) repeatedly won warm
applause from visitors to their barracks on the Open Barracks Day
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The formation drill and martial arts performance by the PLA
soldiers are quite wonderful and their morale and discipline
greatly impressed me," said Miss Miao, a bank clerk.
</P>
<P>
Miao, who came to visit the PLA barracks for the second time,
said the Open Barracks Day helps increase her understanding of the
People's Liberation Army and she now has more confidence in the
army.
</P>
<P>
The PLA Hong Kong garrison opened three barracks of the ground,
navy and air forces in Stanley, Stonecutter Island and Shek Kong
Thursday on the occasion of the second anniversary of the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local residents, old and young, went to visit the
barracks despite the scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
Besides demonstrating their military skills and weapons, the
PLA soldiers showed the visitors around their libraries,
recreation centers and dormitories. Singing and dancing
performances were also staged for the visitors, who were also
invited to join the soldiers in singing karaoke and playing chess.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops first came to the Hong Kong SAR when China
resumed the exercise of sovereignty over the region on July 1,
1997. And many Hong Kong residents are curious about their work
and life here.
</P>
<P>
On the Open Barracks Day, people get a chance to see with their
own eyes the life of the soldiers and even get to learn of some of
their "privacies," Terry Tam, a high-school student said at the
PLA ground troops base in Stanley.
</P>
<P>
"The clean and tidy barracks and dormitory rooms of soldiers
reflect their spirit," said Tam, adding humorously that he is
happy now that he knows the secret of how PLA soldiers shape their
quilts like bean-cakes.
</P>
<P>
Feng Wei, a PLA spokesman, said the open barracks program,
which is the third since the PLA began to be stationed in Hong
Kong, serves as a main channel for the local residents to get to
know the army.
</P>
<P>
Local people have offered much support to the PLA troops in the
past two years and the PLA garrison often receives telephone calls
from local people inquiring about the troops' life and activities
here, he added.
</P>
<P>
Feng said visitors talk more freely to soldiers on this open
barracks day and the ties between the army and local people have
become closer.
</P>
<P>
At a calligraphy and painting exhibition room, a PLA soldier
gave his calligraphy work with the words "army and civilians are
the same family" to a lady, who visited the barracks together with
her children.
</P>
<P>
The lady, a Ms Li, said she would keep the calligraphy work as
a souvenir for her children and ask them to learn from the PLA its
devotion to the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Crack Down on Cutting of Coconut Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
create an inter-agency task force that would apprehend those for
illegal felling of coconut trees, an official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) Administrator Eduardo
Escueta told reporters that the task force will comprise the
Philippine National Police and Coast Guards.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for the government to stop illegal cutting of
coconut trees, estimated at 1.5 million trees per year, to improve
the nation's coconut production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Escueta said last year's El Nino drought resulted in a 40
percent drop in coconut production in the Philippines and the
country should crack down on any illegal cutting of coconut trees
now.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- King Birendra told parliament
Thursday that Nepal shall make efforts to make the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) more action- and
result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's policies and programs for the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting mid-July, King Birendra called for
full cooperation from all countrymen to make a success the 11th
SAARC summit to be held in November in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote economic and
social development in the region through cooperation among its
seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Nepal's unflinching faith in the principles
enshrined in the United Nations Charter, King Birendra said his
country will continue to follow the non-aligned foreign policy.

He said the Nepali government will continue its diplomatic
efforts to solve peacefully the Bhutanese refugee problem.

<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in camps in
eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress government was formed on May 31. It is the
first majority government in the Himalayan kingdom in four and a
half years.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks Joint Ventures Law Anniversary (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high profile symposium was held
here today to mark the 20th anniversary of the promulgation of the
Law on Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures.
</P>
<P>
 Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (
NPC) Standing Committee, and State Councilor Wu Yi attended the
symposium, which was jointly hosted by the NPC and the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
 On this day 20 years ago, the NPC, China's top legislative
body, approved and promulgated the law, the first of its kind to
focus on China's use of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
 The implementation of the law represented the formal launch
of China's national policy of opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
 Following that, China drew up a series of laws and
regulations on the utilization of foreign capital. Now, a basic
legal system with Chinese characteristics has come into shape,
which has greatly boosted foreign investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
 Since the first Sino-foreign joint venture was set up in
China in 1980, a total of 324,700 such ventures have been approved
in the country, involving actual investment of 267.45 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
 Official statistics showed that since 1993, China has ranked
first among developing countries in attracting foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics also showed that in 1998, China's industrial
enterprises with overseas investments turned out of 1,416.25
billion yuan (about 170 billion U.S. dollars) worth of goods,
which accounted for 24 percent of the country's total industrial
output.

Enterprises with foreign investment imported and exported 157.
6 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods, which was 48.68 percent of
China's total foreign trade in that year.
</P>
<P>
Sino-foreign joint ventures have become a major part of
China's national economy, and play an important role in China's
opening to the outside and its economic development.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the symposium, Wu Yi said that the past 20
years have proved that the foreign capital utilization theory,
initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, is right, and accords with
China's situation and world economic trends.
</P>
<P>
"With the development of hi-tech and the speeding up of
economic globalization, China has come to a new juncture in its
foreign capital utilization," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a major task: how to grasp the historic
opportunity, promote China's readjustment of economic structures
and upgrade its status in world economies," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the government makes relevant studies
and find the right answers, the state councilor stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted a 0.34 percent
deflation or negative inflation in June, the country's fourth
month of deflation in a row, according to the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The negative monthly inflation rate was primarily caused by a
decline in the prices of most basic food commodities, Chief of the
BPS Sugito Suwito told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said a 0.02 percent drop in the prices of processed foods,
beverages, cigarettes and tobacco and a 1.24 percent drop in the
prices of clothing had contributed to the deflation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation of 0.18 percent in March, 0.68
percent in April and 0.28 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected an inflation target of 17
percent for the current fiscal year ending March next year, but
recently revised it to 10 percent following positive development
in the country's macroeconomic picture.

<HEADLINE> ADB's Project Boosts Philippines' Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) - The Philippine government's thrust of
reducing poverty gets a further boost with the implementation of a
6.2-billion-peso (160-million-U.S. Dollar) project of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine News Agency, the seven-year project is
designed for agrarian reform communities (ARC) in the country
which comprise about 10 percent of the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
These communities remain without much needed infrastructure
such as farm-to-market roads, potable water and communal
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 households in 140 ARCs will directly benefit from
investments in agriculture and rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The incremental increase in farm income is estimated at 36
percent. Some 17,000 person-years of incremental employment will
be generated.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-funded project has four components: rural
infrastructure, land survey for about 100,000 hectares of public
land, development of support services and project management.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of subprojects will be the responsibility of
the local government. Three area project offices will be
established for technical support.

<HEADLINE> World Health Organization Worried About Polio in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has expressed its concern over the polio situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Luis Sambo, WHO regional chief for Africa, said in Luanda that
Angola is one of the five countries with great difficulty in
making children nationwide to have access to the anti-polio
vaccination.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has set a target to eliminate the
disease by the year of 2000 and Angola would be unable to achieve
the target, the Journal of Angola Thursday quoted Sambo as saying
here.
</P>
<P>
Sambo, who arrived in Luanda Wednesday on a five-day working
visit, attributed the failure in Angola's anti-polio campaign
largely to the prolonged civil war in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the Angolan government has been working
hard with the international organizations and it launched three
nationwide anti-polio drives since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official pointed out that the renewed civil war has not
only negatively affected the immunization campaign, but also
created the chance for the recurrence of the disease in Angola.
This obviously referred to the quickly increased polio cases in
Angola in late March this year.
</P>
<P>
Sambo who is an Angolan, said that during his stay in Angola,
he will discuss with the Angolan health authorities about the
cooperative programs between the WHO and Angola in the coming two
years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that due to the influx of refugees with
unidentified virus from remote areas, some 1,000 children had so
far been inflicted with some kind of polio caused by the virus and
most of them had become paralyzed for life while more than 100
died.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Publishes White Book on NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Thursday published a
white book on the human life losses and material damages caused by
the 78 days of NATO bombing against the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The 417-page book, entitled NATO Crimes in Yugoslavia and
published by the Yugoslav foreign ministry, uses 400 pictures,
lots of tables and charts as well as quotes from eyewitnesses to
document the deaths of civilian people and the damages to civilian
facilities in the country during the first month of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Zoran Novakovic said at the
launching ceremony that by publishing the white book the country
hoped that the war crimes committed against peace will never
happen again; the crimes against humanity and civilians will not
be forgotten, and those responsible for the crimes will not be
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
The book starts with the NATO bombing against a civilian convoy
of ethnic Albanians inside the Yugoslav province of Kosovo on
April 14. The record of evidence of NATO bombing against
civilians and civilian facilities continued place by place, from
Cacak, Vranje, Aleksinac, Pristina, Cuprija, Subotica, Batajnica
and Nis to Djakovica, and scores of villages in Kosovo and in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The documentary evidence from March 24 to April 24 also
includes details of human life losses and material damages from
NATO bombing against such civilian facilities as medical
institutions and educational facilities, cultural monuments,
bridges, telecommunications facilities, television transmitters
and relay facilities and oil and oil refinery facilities.
</P>
<P>
Rodoljub Etiwski, a legal advisor from the foreign ministry,
told the press that another white book would soon be published to
give evidence to the NATO bombing between April 24 and June 9.
</P>
<P>
He said that unfortunately not all war crimes committed against
the Balkan country had been documented in the first book. But
later editions of the white book will add more evidence to fully
document the human life losses and material damages inflicted by
the NATO bombing.

<HEADLINE> Body Calls for Aid Suspension to Somali Gedo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Somalia Aid Coordination Body
Thursday recommended the suspension of all kinds of aid to Gedo
region in southern Somalia due to the murder of an Italian aid
worker in January this year.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, Dr. Singh Bohgal, a veterinarian who was working
with Terra Nuova, an Italian non-governmental organization, was
murdered in Gedo region, and punishment has been delayed to impose
on the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
In a release issued here, the Somali Aid Coordination Body, an
agency comprising donors, U.N. agencies and international
non-governmental organizations, said the murder was "an outrageous
crime and a provocative act totally contrary to the Code of
Conduct for International Relief and Development Assistance to
Somalia."
</P>
<P>
The coordination body requested that local authorities must
apprehend and punish the perpetrators of this crime and recover
the money and equipment stolen from the organization and return to
the Terra Nuova.
</P>
<P>
In March, representatives of the Executive Committee of the
coordination body visited the area and met with local authorities,
and agreed upon a given period of eight weeks for local
authorities to punish the perpetrators and to retrieve the stolen
equipment and money.
</P>
<P>
The coordination body noted that to date, "twelve weeks have
passed and no action has been taken" by local authorities, and
thus it recommended the immediate suspension of all rehabilitation
and development assistance to the region.
</P>
<P>
The body held local Somali authorities and communities
responsible for guaranteeing that secure conditions prevail for
aid agencies and their staff.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Photos Competition on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) has announced its third International Photographic
Competition on the Environment, aiming at raising global
environmental awareness at the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is difficult for some people to write about the
environmental issues, but it is easy for many to take a picture to
express their views," UNEP spokesman Tore Brevik told the press
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Entrants are encouraged to document the state of the world's
environment through their photographs showing their hopes and
fears for the planet and human struggle for sustainable
development, according to Brevik, who is based here in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Photographs can either focus on the beauty and wonder of our
natural environment, or depict the fragility and damage wrought by
the unbridled development of mankind, said Brevik.
</P>
<P>
"On our difficult journey toward sustainable development, we
need a common language, a language that can instantly touch the
hearts and minds," said Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of the
UNEP.
</P>
<P>
There are two categories for the competition - Adult and Junior
 Divisions. Gold, Silver and Bronze prizes and Honorary Mention
will be awarded for each division in the U.N. Millenium Conference
to be held in New York in September 2000, said Steve Jackson,
Audio Visual Officer of the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
There will also be special prizes from the UNEP and Canon
company, the sponsor of the competition, a scholarship from the
International Photographic Council as well as a digital camera
special prize, Jackson added.
</P>
<P>
Gold Prize winners in the Adult and Junior Divisions will
receive 20,000 U.S. dollars and 2,000 U.S. dollars respectively,
said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The first UNEP photographic competition, timed to coincided
with the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, attracted over
30,000 entries from 144 countries.
</P>
<P>
The second competition was held in 1994-1995 to commemorate the
50th Anniversary of the United Nations and received more than
44,000 entries from 153 countries.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Begin Freeze on CFCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- With the completion of the grace
period granted by an international convention, developing
countries are set to begin a freeze on production and consumption
of CFCs with an aim to phase out the substance globally by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the continued participation of the developing
countries as we step up our efforts to heal the ozone layer,"
Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our task is a challenging one, but is is made more manageable
with the total commitment of all parties to the Montreal
Protocol," Toepfer said. "The success of the protocol underscores
the necessity for mutual cooperation in attaining a common goal."
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer was adopted in September 1987.
</P>
<P>
It allowed developing countries a grace period to phase out
their consumption and production of ozone-depleting substances
such as CFCs and halons, in recognition of the fact that they
needed time to obtain funds and introduce alternative
technologies.
</P>
<P>
To ensure compliance with the protocol, a multilateral fund was
set up to help developing countries pay the costs incurred and to
promote the transfer of alternative substances and technologies,
said Gilbert Bankobeza, legal officer in the Ozone Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries provided financing for the fund which
has so far disbursed about 900 million U.S. dollars to more than
110 developing countries to enable them to phase out more than
half of their consumption of ozone-depleting substances, Bankobeza
added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Election Com. Allowed to Begin National Vote Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- After a heated debate among its
members, Indonesia's General Elections Commission (KPU) at its
plenary meeting here Thursday decided to allow the Indonesian
Election Committee (PPI) to begin the national vote count.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made through voting after the KPU members
failed to reach a consensus on the exact date for the national
vote count by the PPI.
</P>
<P>
"The chief of the plenary session has tried to persuade the KPU
members to make the decision through consensus but there was no
agreement among them. That is why we resorted to voting. We must
abide by the rules of game if we want to uphold democracy," KPU
deputy chief Adnan Buyung Nasution said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the vote began, 11 KPU members walked out of the
session room in protest of the KPU chief's decision. They wanted
all election violations and discrepancies to be resolved before
the votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 57 KPU members attending, 54 favored the KPU's decision
to begin the national vote count, 2 opposed it and one abstained.
</P>
<P>
The KPU had originally scheduled the national vote count on
June 21. KPU Chairman Rudini meanwhile said the final vote count
could only begin after all tabulations and other substantial data
are reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
KPU is expected to conclude its final vote count before July 8.
</P>
<P>
The number of votes collected by the KPU as of Thursday
afternoon has reached 64.8 million. The data showed that the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leads with 23.25
million votes, followed by Golkar Party with 12.3 million votes,
National Awakening Party (PKB) with 11.1 million votes, United
Development Party (PPP) with 6.4 million votes and National
Mandate Party (PAN) with 4.4 million votes.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results collected by the official
Antara News Agency from the provincial chapters of PPI, until
Thursday afternoon, PDI-P remained in the lead with 34.2 million
votes, Golkar 22.38 million votes, PKB 13.1 million votes, PPP
10.56 million votes and PAN 6.9 million votes.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials stressed that the results of the election will be
determined by the official data issued by the KPU, and other data
are unofficial.

<HEADLINE> S. African Leaders Pay Tribute to Zimbabwe's Nkomo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki and his predecessor Nelson Mandela paid tribute to
Zimbabwean Vice-President Joshua Nkomo (83) who died of prostate
cancer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Mbeki said Nkomo had been an outstanding figure in the
country's liberation struggle and a "leader of Africa".
</P>
<P>
The South African president said he had learned of Nkomo's
death earlier in the day with a deep sense of sadness.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government and people of South Africa, Mbeki
extended heartfelt condolences to the government and people of
Zimbabwe, and Nkomo's family.
</P>
<P>
"Many among us may not be aware that you, Comrade President,
and Comrade Nkomo bequeathed a legacy of patriotic unity and
cooperation, which has served as an inspiring example to South
Africans.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this legacy is even more relevant to our
continent today," Mbeki said through his office.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela also sent condolences to the family of Nkomo,
South African Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the news during a visit to Mount Ayliff in the
Eastern Cape, Mandela said: "Well, that is regrettable because he
was one of those freedom fighters who stood up for justice at the
most difficult time in the course of our struggle."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he knew Nkomo while the late Zimbabwean
vice-president was studying as a social worker in Johannesburg.
"Even then he showed great interest in the living conditions of
our people," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Together with Zimbabwean President Mugabe, Nkomo not only
liberated Zimbabwe from the white minority government of Ian
Smith, but also united the country's two main liberation movements
-- the Zimbabwe African People's Union and the Zimbabwe African
National Union.
</P>
<P>
"We sent our deepest condolences to the family and the country
as a whole," said Mandela at a fund-raising function.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Develop Key Sectors for Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra said
Thursday that in order to meet the principal objective of poverty
alleviation, the government will strive to expand economic
activities in such fields as agriculture, water resources,
tourism, physical infrastructure, industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's policies and programs for the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting mid-July, King Birendra said that
various policies and programs will be implemented to increase the
people's earning, raise employment, eliminate discrimination and
inequality prevailing in the economic and social life of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that as a large majority of the people
depend on agriculture for livelihood, the government will adopt
policies to commercialize agriculture, establish agro-based
industries, develop rural infrastructures and promote tourism and
small and cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
He said time-bound programs will be implemented to solve the
problems of the landless people and bonded labor prevailing in the
country, one of the poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The king said policies will also be adopted to expand such
infrastructures as education, health care, communications,
transportation and electricity for a balanced development of the
country with special priority given to the mountainous and
backward districts.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by the motto of 'development of water resources: key to
national prosperity,' my government will formulate a national
strategy for the overall development of this sector based on
national consensus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal boasts a hydropower potential of 83,000 MW but only 257
MW have been exploited.
</P>
<P>
"A bill will be presented before the parliament for timely
improvements in the existing policies and laws so as to attract
internal as well as external private investment for the
development of hydro-power projects," King Birendra said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will make the economic system
even more attractive, liberal and competitive by way of additional
policy reforms and improvements in legal, administrative and
procedural matters to instill further dynamism in the industry and
commerce sectors and attract local and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"With a view to developing a self-reliant economy and gradually
reducing foreign aid dependence, my government will lay emphasis
on the productive utilization of foreign aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Special emphasis will be given to managing expenditures,
mobilizing revenue and financial discipline," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress government, which was formed in May after
the general elections, is the first majority government in Nepal
in four and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of a hung parliament in the mid-term polls in
November 1994 had resulted in political instability, which had
seriously hurt the country's development.

<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II on Thursday
formally opened the Scottish Parliament with a speech praising the
Scots' "wit, determination and humor" and their contributions to
the life of the United Kingdom as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Her address to an array of politicians, celebrities and
citizens in the Scottish Parliament's temporary home at the
Assembly Hall in Edinburgh culminated the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
She called the day a "turning point," from which democracy had
been renewed in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The new 129-member parliament was the result of a referendum
held in 1997 with its members voted on May 6, 1999. The previous
parliament voted itself out of existence in the 1707 union with
England to form Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, political leaders delivered speeches in Parliament
Hall, part of the law courts where the Scottish parliament last
sat in 1707.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has to stay in Belfast
for the Northern Ireland peace talks, did not show up in the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Crown, which dates back to the 15th Century, was
brought to the Assembly Hall and used in a public ceremony for the
first time since 1953.
</P>
<P>
It was placed in front of the Queen in the Assembly Hall's
debating chamber.
</P>
<P>
Guests attending the ceremony included ambassadors from more
than 30 countries and speakers from 13 parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Also present were leading figures from the armed forces,
businesses, churches, the circles of entertainment and sports in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The eve of the parliament's birth was marked with several
beacons, lit at strategic locations in the city after sunset, and
hundreds of people staying up all night to celebrate the re-
founding of their parliament after nearly 300 years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Devotes His Life To Ethnic Minority People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor who has worked for
36 years in China's westernmost county has become a national model
for his outstanding service to the mostly ethnic minority people
there.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Dr. Wu Dengyun was born in east China's coastal
province of Jiangsu, but has spent his entire adult life in Wuqia
County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where 72 percent
of the people are Khalkhas. He came to Wuqia after graduating from
Yangzhou Medical School in 1963 and is esteemed by the people of
this poverty-stricken county and the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Because of his resemblance to late Chairman Mao Zedong, the
local people call him a younger brother of Chairman Mao. Public
lectures about his work are being given in major Chinese cities
like Beijing and Shanghai. The doctor is admired not only for his
professionalism, something in great need in a country where
doctors and people in other occupations are often criticized for
their unprofessional or even unethical behavior, but also as a
symbol of harmony and the bond between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
There was a lack of blood in the remote mountainous area where
he lives and the local people were afraid of giving blood because
of their belief that blood is where the soul resides. So, over the
years, Wu has donated more than 7 liters of his own blood to save
the lives of his patients.
</P>
<P>
Following his example, his children have also donated blood and
more than 1,000 local government employees have broken the
traditional taboo on blood giving and become donors.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Wu cut 13 patches of skin off his own body to save
the life of a seriously burned two-year-old Khalkhas boy. In May,
the patient who is now a 29-year-old man, came with his father to
visit the doctor to whom he'll be indebted all his life, but for
whom it is just one of the many acts of help he has given over the
years.

Following in his footsteps, his daughter became a doctor at a

of his life to the local people.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia said on Thursday that it is
ready to help normalize relations between India and Pakistan if
requested by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin made the
statement in response to a Pakistani envoy's remarks a day earlier
that Islamabad would welcome Russia's mediation in the Pakistani-
Indian dispute over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Khurshid Kasuri, special envoy of the Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, said here on Wednesday that he would like
representatives of the Russian cabinet to visit Islamabad and New
Delhi for a better insight into the situation.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also delivered Sharif's personal letter for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin through Alexander Losyukov, secretary
general of the Russian Foreign Ministry. The content of the letter

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Devotes His Life to Ethnic Minority People(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Wuqia, Dr. Wu is a physician, a surgeon, and about any other
kind of specialist you can name, precisely the kind of doctor that
remote, underdeveloped regions need. From the very beginning up to
the end of the 1980s, he spent three or four months of each year
in the countryside helping people.
</P>
<P>
After he was appointed chief surgeon at the county hospital, he
ruled that people from poor families only needed to pay for their
medicines, and those who couldn't afford could delay payment until
they could sell their sheep to the hospital kitchen in the fall,
or do odd jobs around the hospital, to cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
"We make a 100 percent effort if there is 1 percent of hope,"
he said, "and we won't delay treatment because of a money problem,
" --not a small thing at a county hospital in a poverty-stricken
area, where it's hard to get new medical equipment or a new
ambulance. So, he focuses his efforts on training staff recruited
locally to replace Han Chinese doctors who have found jobs
elsewhere and who can't adjust to the harsh climate and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Through a 10-year training program, Dr. Wu has sent 26 Khalkhas
doctors and nurses for professional training in schools and
hospitals in more developed areas and today, 7 out of every 10
staff members are from local ethnic minorities. Where they once
found it difficult just to do an appendectomy, they now can do
just about everything except chest surgery or a craniotomy, making
this a rare hospital for a border area.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wu grew up in eastern China in mild weather and a milder
environment but the pastureland of the Pamirs has become his home
and the 43,000 people living here his family.

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Trying to Iron Out Disputes Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian military officials are
coordinating with NATO on most of the issues relating to Russian
peacekeepers in Kosovo and will hopefully solve remaining issues
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Russian military negotiators, led by Vice Admiral Valentin
Kuznetsov in Belgium trying to find a way for a deal with NATO
commanders, have insisted on letting their troops be under the
control of only Russian commanders, and wanted them deployed also
in zones under Italian, French, American and German control in
Kosovo, NATO sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kuznetsov told Itar-Tass on Thursday that the atmosphere during
the three-day talks was friendly and business-like, and both sides
have coordinated most of the issues shown in a protocol.
</P>
<P>
The remaining problems will be ironed out during a second visit
of the delegation to NATO headquarters in Belgium 10 days later,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of NATO's military Committee, Admiral
Guido Venturony, of Italy, told a press briefing Wednesday that "
only minor problems are left" between NATO and Russia over Kosovo
peacekeeping arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that Kuznetsov and his delegation had
broken off the talks for further instructions from Moscow. They
were not expected back at the military command in Mons, Belgium,
until next week.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the Russian officers had also asked for a
Russian role in the political supervision of operations by the 3,
600 Russian troops who are expected to go to Kosovo. But NATO
insists on keeping political control of all Kosovo operations in
the hands of the North Atlantic Council, NATO's 19 permanent
representatives at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels.

<P>
DHAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A 10-day Chinese Art Exhibition
featuring oil paintings and engravings opened at the Bangladesh
Shilpakala Academy in the Bangladeshi capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition comprises 59 works of oil painting and graphic
engraving by 54 contemporary artists of China, who use different
media and techniques to express their deep love of nature and sing
the praises of life.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition would mark a major departure from the
traditional watercolors mostly displayed by Chinese painters the
world over, according to Qiu Baiping, a professor of the China
Central Academy of Arts and Design, who was here to represent the
art exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The show would allow Bangladeshi viewers a more contemporary
insight into the works of oil painting and engraving in China, he
said. Two of Qiu' recent works were displayed at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Qiu will host a five-day workshop during his stay in
Bangladesh, to train 15 students of the Institute of Fine Arts,

0TTAWA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada is expected to send 50 to 100
police officers to Kosovo in the second half of this year, local
press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officers will be part of the U.N. civilian police whose
duty is to maintain social order in the Yugoslav province. They
will fly to Kosovo once funding is arranged.
</P>
<P>
Only 40 U.N. police officers are deployed in Kosovo so far,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy expressed concern
Wednesday over growing crimes in Kosovo at an international
meeting on Kosovo in New York.
</P>
<P>
"There are many examples of lawlessness" and "we're concerned
certain vacuums are being created that the KLA (Kosovo Liberation
Army) and others are filling," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Kosovars bent on revenge have gone on a rampage of
murder, looting and arson, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
Canada has 800 soldiers in Kosovo and 500 more are expected to
arrive there by mid-July. It has also dispatched two mine-removing
teams and committed 5 million Canadian dollars (about 3.4 million
U.S. dollars) to the action.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Seizes Back Towns From Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Somali National Front (SNF)
faction Thursday declared that their forces have once again taken
control of Garbaharrey and Bur Dhubo towns from the Ethiopian
forces who had allegedly captured them three days ago.
</P>
<P>
According to an SNF faction spokesman in Mogadishu, their
forces have launched well-organized and separate attacks on the
newly-established Ethiopian bases in these towns, thus forcing
them to retreat.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Thrahim Jama Howleh, said that the SNF forces
have killed two Ethiopian soldiers and captured another uniformed
one during the ambush on Bur Dhobo town.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that his forces have lost three fighters while 10
others have sustained gun-shot wounds during the attacks for
control of these towns.
</P>
<P>
Howleh said the consecutive attacks especially during the night
time have forced the Ethiopians to withdraw from the regional
capital of Garbaharrey and Bur Dhubo towns later Wednesday night
and early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the SNF forces will pursue the
Ethiopians to the last point as long as they occupy what he called
their territories in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians are now reportedly stationed in Luq town, the
former Al- Itihad Islam organization stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Howleh further said that the SNF men won't commit to any
cease-fire treaty until they liberate the remaining three towns of
Bulo Hawo, Dolow and Luq which still remain under what he called
the Ethiopian occupation.
</P>
<P>
However, eyewitnesses contacted on the VHF radio in those towns
said Ethiopians have withdrawn from Garbaharrey and Bur Dhubo
towns early Thursday morning on their own accord.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said that the Ethiopians did not seem to have
been in a hurry and left the area in full confidence of their
forces.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are unconfirmed reports indicating that the
Ethiopians have agreed with some of the elders of those towns to
keep the area safe and pave the way for reconciliation between the
ethiopian-backed portion of the SNF and its mainstream group led
by General Omar Hajji Masalleh.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad said Thursday that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
visit to China was successful and the Pakistani side is fully
satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the media, Shamshad said the discussions
held by Sharif with the Chinese leaders were "positive and
substantive," focusing not only on further enhancing the
multi-dimensional cooperation between the two countries but also
on the current volatile situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were reflective of the warmth and sincerity of the
abiding friendship between Pakistan and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions, he added, enabled the two sides to take stock
of all aspects of the current situation and its inextricable links
with the larger issue of Kashmir which lies at the heart of the
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that a final settlement of this core issue
would bring about a durable peace in the region, Shamshad added.
</P>
<P>
"Talks were very productive and we are fully satisfied," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that other major powers will adopt an
approach which helps promote peace rather than complicate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad also hoped that in view of the serious situation in
Kashmir, the world's major powers will use their influence with
India to join Pakistan in bringing to an end the present crisis in
Kargil and beginning a meaningful process for resolving the core
issue of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Falls Second Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department reported
Thursday that construction spending dropped by 0.9 percent in May,
after falling by 2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the declines were widespread, with decreases
reported in single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and
motels as well as big government construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decrease was not expected and it indicated
one of the U.S. economy's strongest sectors is starting to slow.
</P>
<P>
Home building and other construction activity, driven by low
mortgage rates, were a key contributing factor to the strong
economic growth in the early part of the year. Sales of new and
existing homes had hit record highs during the winter.
</P>
<P>
But the pace of home sales has cooled in recent months, owing
to the rising mortgage rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent
in May while sales of existing homes dropped 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Department's construction report showed that spending on
residential building fell 0.5 percent in May to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 320 billion dollars with both
single-family homes and apartments showing declines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction spending for all private building
projects fell 0.7 percent, the second straight month of decline,
something that has not happened for three years. Spending on
factories, hotels and hospitals all saw declines. But spending on
office buildings showed a gain.
</P>
<P>
Also, spending on government construction projects dropped 1.6
percent in May, the third straight monthly decline, the first time
that has happened in eight years.

<HEADLINE> China Stocks Tumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's two bourses, in Shanghai
and Shenzhen, saw strong market response to the country's first
securities law, which became effective today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai composite index closed at 1560.79 points, down 7.
61 percent, while the Shenzhen composite index was down 7.99
percent to end at 466.62 points.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts here say that the drop reflects a wavering in
investor confidence when institutional investors began dumping
stocks after taking profits from the upward trend in recent weeks
and they hint at a possible link with the contrary mood of
investors because of the new law.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the securities law will help the long-
term development of China's stock market, but on the negative side,
investors fear that the withdrawing of large amounts of funds
could make it hard for the remaining capital to support the market,
said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts link the downward trend to technical
readjustments and to rumors that certain dealers could be punished
for irregularities and that stocks held by legal persons might go
on sale after years of being officially prohibited. There are also
fears that a large number of big companies may go public in the
near future to get a share of the stock market too quickly.
</P>
<P>
Many stock investors here were worried about today's market
drop and said that it has damaged the market's status and that it
will be very costly to mend it if the trend continues, but that
the market could continue to slide down if there is more negative
information and further destroy the confidence of smaller
investors.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, when large numbers of smaller investors flooded
into local stock outlets across the country to pay sky-high prices,
their big counterparts, the institutional investors, had begun
retreating.
</P>
<P>
Local experts warned that if the downward trend continues, a
large amount of smaller buyers could be trapped.
</P>
<P>
Friday's trading could be crucial to market development, they
say, and if no favorable information comes, the psychological
barrier of 1520 to 1530 points could be crossed on the Shanghai
stock market.
</P>
<P>
China began to issue stocks in the mid-1980s but the shares
could not be traded until the end of 1990, when the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock exchanges opened.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40 million individual stock investors in China.
The recent rally, or what it referred to here as an "eruption",
began on May 19 after two years of sluggish markets.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the number of new accounts opened by investors was
said to have approached 20,000 per day last week, up from a few
hundred before the recent bull market.

U.S. dollars at the end of 1998 from 968 billion dollars a year
earlier. The total is based on the current cost of replacing
factories, equipment and other tangible assets.
</P>
<P>
U.S. assests abroad, at current cost, increased to 4.9 trillion
dollars at the end of 1998 from 4.5 trillion dollars a year
earlier. Foreign assets in the United States rose to 6.2 trillion
dollars from 5.5 trillion dollars during the same period, in large
part reflecting the rising value of U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
In the near term, the net inflow of funds benefits the U.S.
economy by providing jobs, capital for businesses, credit for
consumers and helping to keep U.S. interest rates low, economists
say.
</P>
<P>
But they also worry that foreign investors eventually will want
to take their earnings home, and that will mean Americans have to
export more or import less -- in other words, reverse the trade
deficit -- to finance repayments.
</P>
<P>
"The concern is the longer-term one that you build up a large
level of foreign debt. If history is any guide, it could become a
sufficient large share of your economy... that it could raise some
sustainability questions in the minds of the market," Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics,
was quoted by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
If investment is measured on a current-cost basis, the United
States went from net creditor to net debtor between 1985 and 1986,
just as the federal government was boosting its borrowing to cover
budget deficits.

<HEADLINE> German Ship Outfitters Warned of Tough Asian Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- German officials warned on Thursday
that a low-price offensive by Asian shipyards is posing a tough
challenge to German shipping industry suppliers which promises to
last a long time, the Deutsche Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The German Shipbuilding and Offshore Supply Industry
Association in Hamburg said that more and more orders are going to
South Korea, Japan and China and that German firms are facing a
lasting and difficult stretch of low-price competition against the
Asians.
</P>
<P>
The association said the response of German maritime equipment
suppliers would be to go where the customers are and establish a
strong local presence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
With an annual turnover of around 8.5 billion U.S. dollars and
a work force of 70,000, Germany's shipbuilding suppliers industry
is larger than the shipbuilding sector itself.

PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- France spent 1.33 billion francs (
about 210 million U.S. dollars) during NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia from March 24 till June 10, said a French Parliament
report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented by parliament deputy Jean-Michel
Boucheron, who is in charge of reporting defense spending to the
National Assembly, put the costs of French participation in the
Kosovo Peacekeeping Force (KFOR) this year at 966 million francs (
153 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
French air force dropped 988 bombs, including laser-guided
missiles, on Yugoslav targets, which cost a total of 384 million
francs (60 million dollars), said the report.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures of war costs in Yugoslavia are lower than
predicted by French Defense Minister Alain Richard at the
beginning of June, when the war had not ended.
</P>
<P>
Richard estimated then the war costs for the whole 1999 would
run to between 3.5 billion to 4 billion francs (570 million to 620
million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Solar Energy Fair Held in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A three-day "Solar Energy '99" fair
opened Thursday in Germany's capital city of Berlin, aiming to
further expand the production and utilization of solar power.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, the sector grows at 20 percent
annually, with 120 megawatts of installed solar power being added
each year around the world. Germany accounts for 10 MW of that
amount.
</P>
<P>
Gernot Oswald, chairman of the Siemens Solar company, praised
the German government's "100,000 rooftops" program to promote the
use of solar panels, saying the program was off to an outstanding
start.
</P>
<P>
"If the program is carried out as foreseen, the German
photovoltaic market will grow by more than 40 percent annually for
the next six years and will increase tenfold the installed
capacity of solar cells in Germany," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Shell executive Fritz Vahrenholt said that if Germany
is to tangibly reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, 30 percent to
50 percent of its primary energy will have to come from renewable
fuel resources by the year 2050, adding that his company aims to
become the market leader in Germany's solar power business.
</P>
<P>
With an annual output of 25 MW, a new solar cell production
facility to be set up in Gelsenkirchen will be the largest of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum executive Peter Knoedel announced that its
subsidiary BP Solar, in taking over the American firm Solarex,
aims to double its share of the world photovoltaic cell market to
20 percent. BP Solar's annual photovoltaic cell production now
comes to 30 MW, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fair organizer Rainer Heinzel predicted that some 20,000 people
will visit the three-day show, adding that next year the fair will
involve other forms of renewable energy resources, such as wind
power, fuel cells and biogas fuels.

Some other major aspects of the international situation last
year were: changes in the strength of world powers; the financial

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Energy Ministers to Meet for Power Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Energy ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will meet here
Saturday to discuss a proposed project to install a power grid
network linking all 10 members of the group, Thai News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They will talk over efforts and ways to complete the project by
the year 2020, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The project was first proposed in 1982, but only limited
progress had been made due to low growth in demand for electricity
in the region, and the situation had worsened since the finance
crisis struck the region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Massive costs of the project to construct transmission lines
and submarine cables over long distances to suit the complicated
landforms in the region have also made it difficult to find firm
supporters so far, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Union is reportedly preparing to extend a
new package of loans to support the regional project, which also
requires well-planned regulatory and technical framework.
</P>
<P>
More progress is expected to be made at the upcoming meeting,
including proposed ways to tackle the obstacles.
</P>

ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.

LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker of Germany, the
youngest men's champion in Wimbledon history, said goodbye to
centre court on Wednesday after a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 fourth-round
defeat by second seed Patrick Rafter of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old veteran was too slow to match big-serving
Rafter's quick game.

<P>
Rafter plays eighth seed Todd Martin who eased past last year's

</P>
<P>
Top seed Pete Sampras of the United States continued his cruise
towards a sixth final in seven years when he beat Daniel Nestor of
Canada 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Sampras meets seventh seed Mark
Philippoussis of Australia who beat another Briton Greg Rusedski 2-
6, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Tim Henman delighted home fans when he saved three
match points on the way to beating former world number one Jim
Courier of the United States 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
Henman's next opponent is France's Cedric Pioline, who beat
Karol Kucera of Slovakia, the 13th seed, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, second seed Steffi Graf of Germany
finished off Belgium's teenage qualifier Kim Clijsters in eight
minutes to win their rain-delayed match 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Graf plays sixth seed Venus Williams in the quarter-finals
following the powerful American's 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian
Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
A woman qualifier will reach the semifinals at Wimbledon for
the first time after American Alexandra Stevenson came from a set

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls International Conference on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan convened an international conference Wednesday to accelerate
the deployment of troops and U.N. personnel in the war-torn
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan said a day earlier that he would call on the 18 nations
and three international organizations attending the meeting to
offer personnel and resources in order that the U.N. civilian
operations in Kosovo work efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters early Wednesday,
Annan told reporters, "As you know, we do have a major
responsibility in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to bring the ministers together to
discuss what our needs are, to try and accelerate the deployment,
particularly of the troops, and the money we need to get the job
done, and also to bring them up to date as to what the situation
is on the ground and how things are going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the four-hour meeting are the foreign ministers of
Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and the United States, which are
described as "friends of the Secretary-General for Kosovo." The
other seven nations represented are Austria, Canada, China,
Denmark, Japan, Russia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent representative to the
United Nations, attended the meeting as the senior representative
of Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the European Union, which is charged with the
reconstruction of Kosovo, and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, responsible for institution building, as
well as the Organization of the Islamic Conference have also been
invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's most pressing need at the moment is an international
police force which can tackle the rising crime in the region with
the withdrawal of Serbian police and military forces and the
return of more than 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees. So far, only
a small U.N. contingent has arrived from the international mission
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Police seconded to the United Nations are in shorter supply
than soldiers, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday. "There
are no police barracks on our front lawn."
</P>
<P>
So far some 18 countries have promised to send 900 police
forces, who are expected to begin moving into Kosovo next month in
contingents of 150-200, Eckhard said. They come from Austria,
Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Italy, Kenya,
Lithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Romania, Tanzania, Turkey,
Britain, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to announce who will be his special
representative or chief administrator for the entire operation,
now run temporarily by Sergio de Mello, the Brazilian U.N.
undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. He has said he
would nominate a European for the position.
</P>
<P>
Another portfolio has also been added to the existing list: a
deputy special representative for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
known as UNMIK. "The deputy is to coordinate the four pillars of
the U.N. mission," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are vying for the post and some U.N.
officials prefer Martti Ahtisaari, whose tenure of office as the
Finnish president has another six months to finish.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been getting
tents and supplies to returning Kosovo refugees, says it has only
2.4 million U.S. dollars left for July. It estimated that up to 45,
000 houses in Kosovo need to be repaired or rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard noted that the U.N. mission will carry out its mandate
without undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as stipulated by the June 10
Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Non-Confidence Motion on Kenyan Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti survived the non-confidence motion initiated by a
parliament member of the opposition party in the National Assembly
here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The motion was introduced by Otieno Kajwang, claiming to be a
move to root out corrupt individuals in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling party dominates the parliament, the motion was
seen by local analysts just as an attack on Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the motion aroused debate among the
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti was appointed vice-president in 1989 and the position
was left vacant following the 1997 general election and was
re-appointed by President Daniel arap Moi earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He was Finance Minister from 1983 to 1992 when nearly 100
million U.S. dollars was drained from the treasury as the
government gave the Goldberg International tax and duty breaks and
allowed the company sole rights to export gold and diamond. It is
known as the Goldberg scandal.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kenya's economy is sluggish with each passing
year. The economic growth rate in 1998 registered only 1.8
percent as against 2.3 percent in 1997 and 4.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown economy in the country is attributed to many
reasons such as natural disasters, poor governance and
infrastructures, reduced foreign investment and graft among
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund suspended a 205-million-U.S.
dollar loan to Kenya in July 1997 allegedly because of the
country's poor governance and corruption, which had worsened
Kenya's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Goldberg case is now still under court proceedings. The
conclusion of this case is one of the conditions the IMF has
imposed on the Kenyan government before it resumes the talks on
aid.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Lashes at U.S. Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Trade Minister Sergio
Marchi is warning of challenges raised by a protectionist U.S.
Congress and a shift of economic power to the south and west of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"You have a very protectionist, inward-looking Congress," the
minister said Tuesday, emerging from the middle of a two-day
cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out a "very dangerous attitude for congressmen to
take...a very harmful position for the international community."
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that economic power has been shifting
within the United States from the north and northeast to the south
and southwest, away from the Canadian border and long-standing
Canadian commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
"What that means is we've got to get to know a whole part of
the United States," the minister declared, adding "we have to take
a look at a whole new north-south axis from the one that we've
been traditionally used to."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's cabinet session was described by the local media as "
concentrated on Canada-U.S. issues," especially recurring disputes
over Canadian softwood lumber and agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien expressed an idea of a hemisphere-
wide Free Trade Agreement of the Americas at the beginning of the
cabinet session. Despite a warm relationship between Chretien and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the pan-America free trade idea has
met a lukewarm reception in Washington, according to reports of
the Canadian media.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Editorial on Chinese Communist Party Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily newspaper has
called for the building up of the Party's power and greatness, in
an editorial to be published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the speech made by Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee General Secretary and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at a forum on June 28 marking the 78th
anniversary of the founding of the CPC is a guideline for thus
building up the Party in these new, exciting and interesting times.
</P>
<P>
It says that Jiang's speech is highly instructive for both
improving the Party and pushing forward the reform, opening up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized in his speech that an extensive education
drive in theoretical study, political awareness and expecting good
conduct among government officials above the county level is a
prevailing priority of the Party at present.
</P>
<P>
The editorial sums up in one dynamic sentence the long and
glorious, if somewhat tortuous, history of the CPC as it drove
forward the revolutionary and construction course of the country:
"The key lies in the Party." It insists that without the CPC,
there would never have been a new China, the growth of socialism,
the great achievements of the reform, opening up and modernization
drive, or the bright prospects now facing the country and the
people.

<P>
The editorial goes on to emphasize that political awareness is
at the core of the education drive.
</P>
<P>
"The politics that we are talking about is concrete and pure,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to elaborate that political awareness refers to "
reinforcing the correct ideals and beliefs," "for party members to
be good at correctly recognizing and assessing situations in terms
of politics," "to be able to maintain a cool mind and a firm and
basic political line on wide-ranging issues, guidelines and
policies," "consciously able to adhere to the Party's principle of
democratic centralism," and "whole-heartedly serve the interests
of the people."
</P>
<P>
"Above all, every party member and cadre, and especially the
leaders, should raise their political awareness, no matter in
which field and on which front he or she works," it says.
</P>
<P>
It calls for party members to learn modern sciences, because "
communists are outstanding individuals who are armed with the most
advanced achievements of human civilization."
</P>
<P>
Noting that today's international competition means there will
be constant tests for the leadership of all countries in terms of
governmental skills and capabilities, the editorial says that
China's Communist Party members have a duty to work harder to make
the Party and the country stronger and more powerful.

<HEADLINE> Strengthening Work on Ethnic Affairs : Party Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Party's work on ethnic affairs should only be strengthened,
not weakened," said Wei here today at a forum marking the
publication of the "Selected Works of Ulanhu" with an inscription
of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly held by the United Front Work Department
of the CPC and the regional CPC committee of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To do a good job in ethnic affairs, Wei said, we should first
correctly handle the relationship between the central authorities
and the autonomous regions. "On the other hand, measures should
also be taken to accelerate both social and economic development
of areas mainly populated by minority Chinese," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei also pointed to the importance of safeguarding unity among
all ethnic groups in China and urged officials in the autonomous
regions to creatively implement the policy of the Party on the
work of ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He praised Ulanhu for his creativity in solving problems
related to China's minority ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Ulanhu (1906-1988), formerly the Vice-president of the People's
Republic of China, was a native of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. He joined the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) in
December 1923 and became a member of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) in September 1925.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's forum were Ulanhu's son, Buhe, vice-
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, Wang Zhaoguo vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, and
other senior CPC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The "Selected Works of Ulanhu" include articles, notes,
speeches, and talks written or made between 1945 and 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial notes that some members of the Party and a number
of government officials are "in a unsatisfactory state of mind in
terms of following the path of socialism," "falling down in their
political qualifications and beliefs," and "unable or partially
unable to adapt to the new situation to meet the demands of the
tasks ahead."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it says, "Some of these officials have actually even
failed the new tests on their beliefs and dogma."
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that in the new international
situation and scenario, the Party has to create various conditions
for future progress. It must also make painstaking efforts to
overcome many difficulties in order to lead the 1.2 billion
Chinese people positively forward in the ongoing reform and
opening up so as to realize and achieve the country's strategic
targets of national development.
</P>
<P>
It says that the most imperative thing to do at present is to
carry out and reinforce the existing results of the education
drive in theoretical study, political awareness and good conduct
and comprehensively strengthen the ideological, political and
organizational building of the Party. As a result, therefore, the
overall quality of the leadership and leaders at all levels will
be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Those government institutes that have already implemented and
carried out the education drive have proved that the CPC Central
Committee's decision on launching such a campaign is of great
strategic significance. It is an innovative process for enhancing
party building and an important measure in strengthening the
leadership, improving the quality of officials and resolving
outstanding problems in the spirit and style of work of the Party.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that the education drive plays an
important role in increasing the cohesive force and capacity of
the CPC organizations at all levels and improving the political
awareness and the abilities and skills of the leaders.

The editorial points out that the CPC has overcome many
difficulties and paid certain prices for every step forward it has
made in the past 78 years. Its future depends on the quality and
standards it imposes and on its insight and mastering of the
situation both in China and in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The 78 years of history have proved that our Party is the only
Party that insists on combining the basic principles of Marxism
with China's real conditions and characteristics while
continuously pushing forward historic progress and acting as a
trail blazer," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It praises the CPC for faithfully serving the Chinese people
and bringing about big and beneficial changes in the country; for
withstanding setbacks and severe tests of its courage and
fortitude while also maintaining vitality by being at the
forefront of historical trends.
</P>
<P>
These new times, new situations and tasks have imposed higher
and more stringent requirements on the Party in terms of the arts
of leadership and government, along with the quality and
capability of its leadership at all levels, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
On the present situation, it points out that the reform and
opening up course of action has encountered some deep-rooted
problems, about which we know little of the rules on how to tackle
them, as yet.
</P>
<P>
The polarization of world politics and globalization of the
world economy pose both opportunities and grim challenges for a
China that is rapidly, with big strides, closing up on the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The hegemony and power politics adopted by certain Western
powers make China fully aware that the world is not yet a peaceful
one and that hostile forces in the West will not give up attempts
to try and bring about China's fall, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for More Efforts on Population, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Wednesday that progress has been made in recent
years in meeting the challenge of population and development, but
there is a lot of jobs to do.
</P>
<P>
Opening a special session of the General Assembly on the follow
up to the Cairo conference on population and development in 1994,
Annan gave some examples of how things have changed since the
first population conference 25 years ago:
</P>
<P>
-- Women in developing countries have fewer than three children
instead of an average of five then,
</P>
<P>
-- Sixty percent of couples use family planning and the vast
majority of governments support it, in contrast to the fact that
only thirty percent of couples used it then,
</P>
<P>
-- In many countries fewer women die in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
-- Growth of world population has slowed from 2-% to 1.3%.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the international community should do more, as
</P>
<P>
-- In too many countries, girls still do not have the same
chance to be educated as boys,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many women still cannot choose when or whether to become
pregnant,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many women are victims of sexual violence especially
during conflict,
</P>
<P>
-- Too many people are exposed to sexually transmitted diseases
and AIDS,
</P>
<P>
-- People in developing countries still die too young.
</P>
<P>
Annan said since the Cairo conference, developing countries
have proved their commitment, but they are "cruelly limited in
what they can achieve without outside help".
</P>
<P>
"They are entitled to expect more sympathy, and better
treatment, from countries which are more fortunate," he added.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Many Drugs Donated to Albania Useless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Vast amounts of drugs donated in
humanitarian aid to Albania in May are useless, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO report, 400,000 tablets and 1,200 large-
volume intravenous fluids have passed their expiry date and 2
million tablets, 8,500 vials for injection and 16,000 tubes of
cream for external use will become useless by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way they can be distributed and used before the
end of the year," said Indro Mattei, a member of the Swiss
Disaster Relief Unit under the WHO Humanitarian Assistance Project
Office in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that 50 percent of the drugs coming into Albania
donated by non-medical organizations are inappropriate or useless
and will have to be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that some pharmaceutical companies are
using this humanitarian crisis to get rid of unwanted stockpiles,"
Mattei added.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of import permit documents submitted to the
Albanian Ministry of Health by humanitarian agencies in May showed
that 65 percent of the drugs presented an inadequate expiry date,
32 percent were declared with brand names that are unfamiliar to
Albanian health professionals, and almost 10 percent of medical
donations were not accompanied by any detailed packing list at all,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that the situation in June had not improved.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, the Albanian health authorities softened import
controls to speed up the entry of badly-needed drugs to meet the
demands of the 460,000 Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
WHO also stressed that good coordination of drug donations will
be crucial to avoid duplication, waste and the arrival of
unnecessary and inappropriate drugs. The U.N. agency urged strict
adherence to international guidelines for drug donations worked
out by WHO with major humanitarian agencies.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins International Conference on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday morning convened an international conference to
accelerate the deployment of troops and U.N. personnel to run the
war-torn Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to ask for money as well as personnel from
those attending the one-day meeting that includes 10 foreign
ministers among 16 nations, who are described as "friends of the
Secretary-General for Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting are representatives from 18 countries.
Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent representative to the
United Nations, took part in the coming meeting as the senior
representative of Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Attending the one-day meeting are the foreign ministers of
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,
Spain, Turkey and Britain and the United States. Other nations
represented, in addition to Ambassador Shen, will be Austria,
Canada, Denmark, Japan, Russia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the European Union, which is in charge of
reconstruction in Kosovo, and the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, responsible for institution building, as
well as the Organisation of the Islamic Conference have also been
invited to the four-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters early on Wednesday,
Annan told reporters, "As you know, we do have a major
responsibility in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to bring the ministers together to
discuss what our needs are, to try and accelerate the deployment,
particularly of the troops, and the money we need to get the job
done, and also to bring them up to date as to what the situation
is on the ground and how things are going," he said.
</P>
<P>
In turn the ministers are expected to ask why the U.N.
political presence in Kosovo is barely visible, although experts
on such missions say other organisations would do worse.
</P>
<P>
The most pressing need is for an international police force to
tackle crime that has flourished with the exit of Serbian police
and military forces and the return of more than 300,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees. Only a small U.N. contingent has arrived from
the international mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Police seconded to the United Nations are in shorter supply
than soldiers, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday. "There
are no police barracks on our front lawn."
</P>
<P>
So far some 18 countries have said they would send 900 police,
which should begin pouring into Kosovo every five days next month
at 150-200 in each contingent, Eckhard said. They come from
Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Italy,
Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Romania, Tanzania,
Turkey, Britain, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to announce who will be his special
representative or chief administrator for the entire operation,
now run temporarily by Sergio de Mello, the Brazilian U.N.
undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. He has said he
would choose a European, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
But a one more portfolio is added to the existing list: a
deputy special representative for the U.N. mission in Kosovo,
known as UNMIK. "The deputy is to coordinate the four pillars of
the U.N. mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and France are vying for the post and some U.N.
officials prefer Martti Ahtisaari, who however does not finish his
term as president of Finland for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been getting
tents and supplies to returning Kosovo refugees, says it has only
$2.4 million left for the month of July. It estimated up to 45,000
houses are now uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will carry out its mandate without undermining
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, as stipulated by the June 10 Security Council
resolution, the senior official added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Resolutions Clarify Parameters on Cyprus: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council's two
resolutions on Cyprus, approved on Tuesday, have clarified the
parameters in which the search for a Cyprus settlement will be
conducted, Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the resolutions (1250/1999) is on Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's good offices mission (1250/1999) and another
(1251/1999) on the extension for a further six month period of
the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
While passing the resolutions, the Security Council called for
unconditional talks for a settlement in Cyprus by putting all
issues on the table. Meanwhile, it endorsed a statement by the G-8
(seven most industrialized nations plus Russia).
</P>
<P>
The security council also reiterated that a settlement on the
island must provide for the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told the press that the two sides of Cyprus should
exhibit good will to create necessary preconditions and wait for
the Secretary-General's invitation for talks.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also said he was disappointed that no mention was
made in resolution 1251 on the missing persons issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has accused the Turkish side of failing
to implement an agreement between the two sides, which provides
for the exchange of information about locations of graves and
return of remains of people killed during the 1974 war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored agreement was signed on July 31, 1997 by
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks (including five
U.S. citizens), were listed by the Cyprus government as missing
persons in the 1974 war.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Voices Concern over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
parties Wednesday expressed concern over the government's decision
to send troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as
peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
While generally acknowledging that South Africa has a role to
play in maintaining peace in the continent, the parties warned
that it should not send troops until there is a clear peace
agreement accepted by all parties.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki told parliament earlier
Wednesday that South African troops would be sent to the DRC as
peace-keepers once a cease-fire is in place.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), South Africa's biggest opposition
party, said that it neither condemned nor supported the decision
to send peace-keepers to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
But it said the government had to be certain there is a peace
agreement accepted by all parties before sending in its troops.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from countries involved in the DRC conflict have been
meeting in Zambian capital Lusaka in the past few days to try to
put an end to the 11-month war.
</P>
<P>
The talks have given hopes for a possible cease-fire in the
vast central African country. But the ministers from various
countries concerned have so far not been able to reach agreement
to the draft cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front (FF) leader Constand Viljoen, a former head of
the South African defense force, said he is opposed to the
decision, because the South African troops are not well trained or
disciplined enough for such kind of mission.
</P>
<P>
"Discipline is of absolute importance, as the troops have to be
 completely neutral," Viljoen said.
</P>
<P>
He also questioned who would pay for the peace-keeping
operation, noting that the burden would likely fall on South
African tax payers.
</P>
<P>
However, the New National Party (NNP) and the United Democratic
 Movement (UDM) supported the decision, saying South Africa could
not escape its peace-keeping responsibilities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said sending in peace-keepers would
be in line with a decision by the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"It is felt that we should participate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said that a U.N. approval was essential for
any peace-keeping force to be sent to the DRC, especially when
considering the huge cost of such an exercise.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Institute for Security Studies Jakki Cilliers
said it is vital for South Africa and Africa as a whole that any
peace-keeping force be properly mandated by U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Cilliers said that the United States -- U.N.'s biggest debtor
-- appears keen that those who participate should pay the costs,
and it is unlikely that the United States would participate in the
DRC mission.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the U.N. was planning to provide a
peace-keeping force of no more than 30,000 people for the DRC,
Cilliers said.
</P>
<P>
Although this is large by international standards, it is
hopelessly inadequate for the DRC -- a country the size of a
quarter of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Department said Wednesday that it could
take considerable time to finalize details for the deployment of
South African troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Patrick Lekota said South African troops would
be part of a "non-combative" monitoring mission, the size of which
would be decided by the OAU.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Threaten to Boycott Lusaka Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels have threatened
to withdraw from the Lusaka peace negotiations if ousted leader
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba is given a seat as a rebel representative,
the Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD),
Moise Nyarugabo, was quoted as saying that the CRD has formed a
common front with another rebel group, the Congolese Liberation
Movement led by Jean Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for ousted Wamba," Nyarugabo said. "We cannot
 accept to be imposed representatives in the Lusaka talks."
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel leader, the talks in Zambian capital
Lusaka hit a snag Tuesday with Zimbabwe and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) insisted in integrating Wamba in the rebel
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable that (Zimbabwean President) Robert Mugabe
 and (DRC President) Laurent Kabila appoint our representative to
the talks,'' Nyarugabo said.
</P>
<P>
"We will pull out of talks if this situation prevails with
Kabila and allies making every thing they can to cripple progress
in the talks," the rebel leader added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks Malaysia's Support To End Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday expressed
the hope that Malaysia will use its influence on India to halt
military action and resolve the Kashmir border dispute amicably.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister's Special Envoy Mian Abdul Waheed
said his country believed Malaysia would urge India to exercise
restraint and seek a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Malaysia can use its influence on India so that it
will enter into dialogue with Pakistan to address this issue," he
told a press conference at the Pakistani High Commission here.
</P>
<P>
"We want a third party intervention. There are no prospects for
bilateral talks with India to end the dispute. Pakistan's repeated
initiatives for a dialogue through bilateral means have not
received positive signs from India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mian, who arrived here two days ago on a mission to garner
world support to help end the dispute, said he believed India
would eventually stop all military mobilization if the world
voiced its concern over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mian said he would hand over a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif to his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad before
leaving for Tokyo later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, India's lukewarm response to the holding of
talks to end the dispute had resulted in the Pakistani government
sending special envoys to European Union countries, Africa, Latin
America and Asia to seek their support to help end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan wants peace and we want a dialogue to end the
dispute," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict has cost many Kashmiris their lives and many
others had to seek refuge in Pakistan territory," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tough Road to Negotiation Table in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- There is a rough road to go before
the two rival sides in Cyprus sit again on the negotiation talbe
though the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday urged them to resume
talks in autumn on reuniting Cyprus, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots have already rejected a talks resumption
call proposed recently by the seven most industrialized nations
and Russia, or G-8, and echoed in a report by Annan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of G-8 urged the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any pre-conditions
and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday passed two resolutions,
which clarified the parameters for a Cyprus settlement, and called
on the two sides to hold unconditional talks by putting all issues
on the table.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots have been entrenched in a position that
they will return to the negotiation table only as their
self-declared state in the northern third of the island is
recognized and the negotiation is for a confederation.
</P>
<P>
They said that bi-communal talks, which have dragged on for
decades, do not reflect realities on the island and any future
negotiations must be on a state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the peace talks were
stalled in 1997 after Turkish Cypriots decided to stay out of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side in 1998 conditioned the resumption of
the talks on the establishment of a confederation on the island
and the incoming talks should be held between two equal states.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said he would not attend
any talks at which President Glafcos Clerides represented the
Cyprus government. Denktash argued that Clerides represents only
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
"They say the talks should be without preconditions. But you
put the precondition that a government of Cyprus exists, which is
why there has been no settlement in Cyprus," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Backing Denktash, Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish president, has
also reiterated that "the existence of two sovereign states must
be accepted," warning that a forced solution in Cyprus will create
a clash between Turkey and Greece, the ally of the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots have said they are willing to engage in
talks without preconditions, but have flatly rejected the
confederation solution for the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he will refuse to discuss confederation if the
issue is brought up at negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
There are obvious concerns among Greek Cypriot politicians
that the phraseology in U.N. resolutions - "put all issues on the
table" - may open the door for the Turkish side to table demands
for confederation and recognition of two states.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Cairo Program of Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made the
population issue a strategic one and integrated it into the
overall program for socio-economic development, its representative
told a special session of U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the Cairo Conference on population and development in
1994, China has given high priority to the implementation of the
Program of Action, said Wang Zhongyu, State Councillor and
Secretary-General of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
China, the most populous developing country in the world,
formulated the National Family Planning Program and set long-term
goals for its population and family planning work, he said.
</P>
<P>
While opposed to the use of coercive measures, China's
population program puts more emphasis on the integrated approach
of carrying out publicity and education campaigns, providing
quality services in reproductive health and family planning and
bringing into play the role of the civil society and NGOs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Special attention has been given to combining the family
planning program in the rural areas with economic development,
poverty-alleviation, universal education programs and improvement
of women's status, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
He said China's family planning program has not only stabilized
its population and promoted its social-economic development, but
also greatly contributed to the stabilization of the world
population.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China is still faced with grave challenges in
the field of population and development.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of about 12 million people to its
population exerts a great pressure upon its social-economic
development, resource utilization, environmental protection,
education, medical care and creates many new problems.
</P>
<P>
Turning to international cooperation for meeting the challenge
of population and development, Wang said China would call on the
developed nations to honor their commitment and provide financial
assistance to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops to Transit Through Greek Ports for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia is expected to begin
transiting its troops and heavy equipment through Greek ports for
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo next week.
</P>
<P>
Russia had approached Greece to allow troops to transit through
the Greek ports as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Kosovo and talks between the two countries over the matter were
nearing an end, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted
a Greek military source as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the only issue still to be tackled was
whether Thessaloniki, Litohoro or Volos would be used as their
transit points.
</P>
<P>
There was a possibility that all the three ports would be used
and Russian military officials might be in the northern Greek port
of Thessaloniki as early as Thursday to prepare for the
transports, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, Thessaloniki has been
a major transit point for NATO troops heading for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 14,000 soldiers and 7,000 vehicles have
passed through the port.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Rebounds in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading economic
indicators rose 0.3 percent in May, more than reversing the 0.1
percent decline in April, the Conference Board, a prominent
research group, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said with the increase of 0.3 percent in May, the
leading index stands at 107.4. During the six-month span through
May, the leading index rose 1.1 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The leading indicators show the resilience and robustness of
this expansion, which is poised to become the longest ever in
early 2000," said Michael Boldin, Director of Business Cycle
Research at the Conference Board. The index of Leading Economic
Indicators spots economic growth trends for the coming three to
six months.
</P>
<P>
The report said nine of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in May. The most significant increases are
vendor performance, interest rate spread, and money supply in 1992
dollars, it said.

<HEADLINE> China: Kosovo Is Not U.N. Trustee Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China said here Wednesday
that "Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY),
and it is not the United Nations trustee territory," calling upon
the international community to respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, China's acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an
international conference on Kosovo as the senior representative of
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10,
stipulates that all nations respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the FRY, Shen said, "This should be
carried out in action, rather than simply expressed by words."
</P>
<P>
The international community, when rendering humanitarian relief
and the post-war reconstruction in Kosovo, should fully solicit
viewpoints from the FRY Government and the FRY should be involved
in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China always maintains that all ethnic groups are equal in any
multi-ethnic country, they should live in harmony and work for
common development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not favor discrimination or persecution against any
ethnic group, nor do we favor any ethnic cleansing," he said, "At
the same time, we also oppose any attempt to use the ethnic
problem to split a country."
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic problems in a country should be properly solved
through correct policies by the government and people of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the international peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, known as
KFOR, Shen said, the multi-national forces have made some progress
in carrying out the Security Council resolution since they entered
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"However, there exists many problems in this regard," he said.
"After FRY's full military withdrawal from Kosovo in accordance
with relevant agreement, the multi-national forces should have an
unshirkable duty to safeguard peace and security in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"But the situation in Kosovo is continuing to be worsened," he
said, "For example, non-Albanian residents in Kosovo are still
being driven away, intimidated or even killed."
</P>
<P>
"In some areas in Kosovo, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has
taken nearly all public facilities and organs under its control,"
he said, "Such a grave violation of the Security Council
Resolution 1244 can be no longer tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"The multi-national forces should take a quick action to fully
disarm the KLA and other armed groups so as to create a peaceful
environment, restore the normal social order and ensure the
safety, security and dignity of all ethnic groups in Kosovo," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the post-war reconstruction, Shen said, the relevant program
should be well-balanced, rather than discriminative.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's 79-day wanton bombing of Yugoslavia has caused a huge
loss and serious humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and other regions
of Yugoslavia, including the destruction of the system to supply
water and power," he said, "This gravely affected the normal life
of the Yugoslav people."
</P>
<P>
The international should not put Serbia, a Yugoslav republic,
outside its relief operation program, "this is unfair and
inhumane," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or senior representatives of 18 countries and
the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Conference took part in
the four-hour meeting, during which they discussed how to
accelerate the deployment of troops in the war-torn Yugoslav
province.

<HEADLINE> Barak Clinches Coalition Deal With Key Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak signed a coalition agreement Wednesday with the
powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party, moving significantly closer to
his goal of forming a broad-base government.
</P>
<P>
"Shas signed the coalition agreement. This brings us to 69
seats in parliament so far, giving him a wide government," said
Barak's spokeswoman Merav Parsi-Tzadok.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 17 seats in the 120-member parliament, Shas' support
is instrumental for Barak's effort to revive the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party (NRP) and the left-wing Meretz
have also signed an agreement respectively with One Israel to join
the coalition government led by Barak.
</P>
<P>
The next few days will be crucial for Barak in his coalition
forming effort as he has to submit the cabinet list to the
acting Knesset (parliament) one week before July 9, the deadline
for his government formulation stipulated by the election law.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who won the May 17 prime ministerial election, has to
rally support from other smaller parties to form a broad-based
coalition government because his One Israel alliance got only 26
seats in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Stocks Rose With Failure of Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The stock values of three major
French private banks, the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the
Societe Generale (SG) and Paribas, rose on Wednesday at the Paris
stock exchange after an government intervention to arrange an
agreement between them failed.
</P>
<P>
The three banks have been engaged in a merger battle since the
BNP tried to buy up SG and Paribas in a hostile takeover bid
announced in March.
</P>
<P>
SG and Paribas, which had by then agreed to merge, rejected the
bid by BNP, which was the largest ever take-over bid in France's
financial history and the first of its kind in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank, Banque de France, and the government
arranged talks over the past week between the BNP as one side, and
SG-Paribas the other, to seek a consensus solution and avoid a
greater battle at the stock market.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of failure of the talks, BNP's share
rose by 2.68 percent to 80.60 euros (77 U.S. dollars), SG by 4.10
percent to 175.50 euros (168 U.S. dollars) and Paribas by 1.68
percent to 108.90 euros (104 U.S. dollars) by mid-day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dealers at stock market apparently welcomed the collapse of
the government intervention, after they sold off many stocks of
the three banks over the past week, causing an estimated 6.5
billion euro (6.1 billion U.S. dollars) loss for the banks.

PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
will pay an official visit to Russia from Thursday to Friday this
week, his second visit to Moscow in two years, announced the
French government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jospin will preside with his Russian counterpart Serguey

He will focus his talks with Russian leaders on Russia's
economic problems, the country's economic reform, and the
establishment of fiscal and other regulations by Russia to draw
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Jospin and Russian leaders will also discuss bilateral trade
and cooperation in the fields of airspace, telecommunications,
energy, agriculture and food, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume between France and Russia dropped by 25
percent in 1998 as is compared with 1997, mainly because of the

<HEADLINE> EU Official Says Duty-free Benefit For Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELES June 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) is formally
to abolish duty-free shops in its 15 member states at midnight
Wednesday, saying it is good news for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Duty-free sales to travellers will come to an end at midnight
on June 30 in accordance with the unanimous decision of the EU
Council of Finance Ministers adopted in 1991, European Commission
said today in a statement. "This is excellent news for EU
taxpayers," said Mario Monti, European Commissioner for EU
internal market.
</P>
<P>
"It ends the curious situation under which massive subsidies,
worth over two billion euros every year, were paid to air and see
travel within the EU," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
Monti also said that many duty-free sales operators have
announced that they will maintain not only retail sales to
travellers but also "their prices on the majority of goods sold by
absorbing from their profit margins the value-added taxes that
will be applicable from tomorrow".
</P>
<P>
"It is a compliment to democracy in the EU that the interests
of a narrow-interest lobby group with seemingly unlimited
financial resources proved unable to overturn a unanimous decision
of EU member states," the EU commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"Just in case some travellers may have been misinformed or are
unaware, I would like to reemphasize that people's rights
concerning cross-border shopping are not affected by the abolition
of duty free sales within the EU," Monti said, adding people will
still be able to buy goods for their own personal use without
limit in other member states and will not have to pay any
additional taxes or excises when they return home.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Reconciliation in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Wednesday
called on Somali factions to honor signed agreements in a bid to
seek national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with David Steven, U.N.
chief's representative for the Somali affairs, AL Assistant
Secretary General Ahmed Bin Helly urged the Somali factions to
cooperate with the world community in attaining the goal.
</P>
<P>
The Somali warring factions signed an agreement last year on
establishing a broad-based central government, a move viewed as a
major breakthrough in the war-devastated country. But deep rifts
among the factions have blocked the implementation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The concerned parties, especially the Arab League and the U.N.,
have been exerting efforts to help the country in the Horn of
Africa end division caused by the civil war since 1991 and realize
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Bin Helly said the 22-nation pan-Arab forum has been working
with all parties to help Somalia form a national authority that
will restore the country's position in the Arab world, Africa and
international community. Somalia's AL membership has been frozen
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He called on AL members to offer technical, financial and
humanitarian aids to the Somali factions that take serious steps
towards national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the league's readiness to host a reconciliation
conference grouping all the Somali factions.

<HEADLINE> Italian GDP to Grow by 1.2 Percent This Year, Studies Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Italy's gross domestic
product (GDP) this year is not likely to exceed 1.2% to fit the
country into the bottom slot in Europe but Italy will rise to
equal French and German GDP growth by 2002, a Italian economic
study center said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In other forecasts, the economists in Prometeria, an economic
think tank in Italian central city of Bologna, said greater labor
market flexibility could lead to the creation of 121,000 new jobs
of which 91,000 will be wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
Increasing oil prices will begin having an impact on domestic
prices in the coming months to help take inflation, now hovering
at 1.4 percent annually, to an average of 1.6 percent for the full
year.
</P>
<P>
Prometeria said that beginning in 2000, Italy should begin
reaping the benefits of financial stability in the form of
increasing domestic demand and economic activities more in line
with the norm in the euro area and showing greater potential over
the medium term.
</P>
<P>
According to the study center, domestic demand is likely to
increase at below last year's rate, about 1.6 percent compared to
2.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In their outlook taking them to the year 2002, these
forecasters said domestic demand will be the engine of growth in
the coming year to lead fixed capital investments made by
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Business and industry could draw benefit from a brighter
profitability picture, low interest rates and fiscal breaks so,
the report reasoned, demand and investments should both show
growth similar to the trends in Italy's European Union partner
countries.
</P>
<P>
The cycle of expansion in the Italian economy could be
associated with a long and substantial expansion in jobs with the
tertiary sector showing the way up.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of troubles originating outside the country,
inflation will remain low because of the lack of tension on the
import side and at home.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the two-year period, the gap between Italy and
France and Germany on the other side will be fully closed,
Prometeia said.

<HEADLINE> Conservation, Development Urged in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Wednesday called upon people of all walks of life and
investors at home and abroad to take an active part in the
conservation, recovery and development of the Mozambique Island.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call in capital Maputo at the
opening of an international conference on the comprehensive
conservation and human and economic sustainable development for
the island.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi asked the participants to make the meeting an impetus
for the overall development of the island and a driving force to
accelerate the development of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique Island lies in northern coast and belongs to the
province of Nampula. The three-square-km island is one of the most
ancient cities in the southern African country. It had been the
capital of Mozambique for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
With many cultural and historic relics, the island was
identified as a human heritage site in 1991 by the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The island, with a population of 18,000, is facing various
difficulties in the conservation of the relics and the improvement
of people's living because of its worn-out infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The recovery and development plan for the island includes some
50 projects covering road, water supply, transport,
communications, tourism, fishery and power supply. These projects
will need a total amount of 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) country representative in
Maputo, Emmanuel de Casterle, said at the opening that the UNDP
will respond positively to any reasonable requests made by the
Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
However, he saide that the support and participation of the
civil society, the private sector in particular, is crucial to the
success of the plan.
</P>
<P>
President of the City Council of the Mozambique Island, Abacar
Haimo, said at a fund raising meeting that the residents on the
island cherish great hope for the comprehensive conservation and
sustainable development of their land.
</P>
<P>
Haimo hoped that the meeting will do something for poverty
reduction, job creation, and improved conditions in education,
environment and health care.
</P>
<P>
It was told that a number of countries have expressed their
interest in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are 140 representatives from the
Mozambican government, U.N. branches, some non-governmental
organizations, as well as such countries as Portugal, Germany,
Canada, Brazil, Egypt and France.

<HEADLINE> Angola Has Highest Maternal Mortality: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The maternal mortality rate in
Angola is 2, 800 per 100,000 pregnant women, the highest in the
world, the U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA technical counsel Joao Bosco Feres revealed this at a
function to mark the World Population Day which falls on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official attributed the high mortality to infections
caused by inappropriate birth methods and care.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Feres pointed out that teenage mothers also
attributed to the high mortality, saying that many young women
aged 16 or 17 years have given more than two births.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official noted his fund will exert its effort to
reduce maternal mortality and improve the living conditions of
women, especially the mothers.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Angolan government to play its part in this
regard.

<P>
HARARE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Major differences in the draft
cease-fire agreement for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) had been ironed out, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge and Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said in Zambian capital
Lusaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to recent press reports that progress was slow and
that hopes of concluding the document were dim, Mudenge and
Mahachi said the atmosphere at the talks was positive and that all
the ministers attending were committed to ending the 11-month war
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have gone well so far, we have reduced the areas of
contention, they are only a few items left in the document," the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Mudenge as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is our objective to complete today, but they are certain
areas centered around definitions which we will look at later," he
said. "There is steady progress and we remain hopeful."
</P>
<P>
"The disagreement is not on the question of peace," Mahachi
said. "People here are concerned that there should be peace in the
DRC. We have agreed in principle that there should be peace."
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting started Tuesday and it ended around
2:00 a.m. local time. The talks resumed Wednesday and by 4:00 p.m.
the ministers were continuing with the talks.
</P>
<P>
Defense and Foreign Ministers from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states plus Kenya, Uganda and
Rwanda are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regional heads of state have been kept on stand-by for a summit
in Lusaka to sign the cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
Both Mahachi and Mudenge could not specify when the summit
might be held.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on the paragraphing, wording and emphasis and
also on the modalities of implementing the cease-fire agreement
and timetable of implementation," said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
On the rebel insistence that all foreign forces withdraw
simultaneously, Mahachi and Mudenge said they were currently
working out a timetable for withdrawing the SADC allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of an integrated national army, Mahachi
said the Congolese had not indicated any problems regarding that.
</P>
<P>
He said the DRC government and rebels would work out how the
armies should be integrated.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the division within the rebel movement would not
derail the talks.

<HEADLINE> Slide in Credit Growth Puts Retail Recovery in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 30 (Xinhua) - Consumer borrowing in Britain slid to
its lowest level for more than four years in May, the Bank of
England said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's latest figures released Wednesday, net
consumer credit rose by just 609 million pounds in May, almost
half market forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts gave warning that the weaker-than-expected lending
figures could mean lower retail sales over the summer and throw
doubt on the strength of the retail recovery.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America said: "The data is soft
enough to raise a few doubts about the strength of the recovery in
retail sales and we continue to expect another cut in the base
rate over the next few months."
</P>
<P>
But some of economists said the underlying trend remained
strong and pointed to figures showing that mortgage borrowing was
still robust.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage lending rose 2.7bn pounds in May, a slightly smaller
increase than April's 3.1bn and March's 3.2bn. The number of new
approvals was almost unchanged at 96,000, compared with 100,000 in
April.

<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- France warned on Wednesday against a
possible breakaway of Montenegro from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY), which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
``France holds to warn against the risks of regional
destabilization which such an attempt could bring about,'' said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic has never
expressed his intention to secede the republic from FRY.
</P>
<P>
But the spokeswoman also said that France has supported for
years Djukanovic's efforts at ``democratization of institutions
and political life'' of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
``These efforts, which we continue to support, are carried out
in the framework of FRY,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that France is due to provide Montenegro
with 5.5 million francs (848,000 U.S. dollars) worth of
humanitarian aid to Montenegro, including food and other
agricultural materials.

<HEADLINE> Italy Swears to Save Life of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will exert
"every possible form of pressure" to save the life of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, condemned to death by a Turkish
court Tuesday, Deputy Premier Sergio Mattarella told parliament
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said Italy had moved at the bilateral and
multilateral level over the last few weeks to warn Turkey that a
death sentence would represent "a serious obstacle" to Turkey's
ambitions to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will now impress on Turkish authorities
the need for the Turkish parliament to be fully aware of the
"inevitable" consequences of its ratification of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to Mattarella, if the parliament votes against the
death penalty, the vote "would have a great value and would not
fail to ease the progress of that country towards EU membership.''
</P>
<P>
Italy will exert similar pressure on the Turkish head of state,
who has the last word on the matter if parliament fails to block
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Mattarella noted that the European Union Tuesday called for the
death penalty to be commuted in Ocalan's case, saying his
execution would be prejudicial for Turkey's hopes of joining the
EU.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Charges His Team on National Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
 Wednesday swore in 45 of the 47 ministers cleared by the
country's senate and charged them to help plug the loopholes
through which national resources have been pilfered over the
years.
</P>
<P>
"You have a responsibility to plug the loopholes for the
bending of rules and pilfering of state resources," he told the
ministers, a day after the last set of five nominees were cleared
by the 109-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, repeatedly pledging to focus on anti-corruption since
he took over from military regime in May 29, urged the ministers
to join him in the process of national restoration through the
revival of the country's national institutions, battered by years
of military mis-rule.
</P>
<P>
"The great challenge that face the country calls for attention
on the battered economy, the consequences of past mismanagement,"
the president said a week after submitting an anti-corruption
bill to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the consequences of years of mismanagement included the
" widening of the poverty gap, the prevalence of hunger and
disease, the deterioration of public service, low capacity
utilization, low agricultural productivity and outmoded
communication."
</P>
<P>
Demanding them to reflect the best "ideals of democratic
governance" in their performance, Obasanjo said that should not
allow the return of the " dark days of deprivation and misery".
</P>
<P>
He urged them to be prepared for public scrutiny and criticism,
saying they should demonstrate a tolerant spirit.
</P>
<P>
As have been speculated, former chief of army staff, Gen.
Theophilus Danjuma was named in charge of the defense portfolio
while Adamu Ciroma, former central bank governor and minister of
Agriculture was named in charge of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The surprise portfolio was that of Sule Lamido, secretary of
the defunct social democratic party, who was named the new
Foreign Minister while Tony Anenih, former chairman of the same
party was named for the Works Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The only absentee at the swearing-in was Senator Udo Udoma,

<HEADLINE> France Hopes to Build New High Speed Railway With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- France has proposed to build a new
high speed railway between the Mediterranean city of Marseille and
the western German city of Mannheim.
</P>
<P>
The French delegate minister in charge of European affairs
Pierre Moscovici said that the project, called
``TGV-Rhine-Rhone'', should be among the projects to be
implemented with priority by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
He told the French Parliament Tuesday evening that such a
railway will help strengthen the railway transportation links of
all European countries.
</P>
<P>
France is also planning to build high speed railways between
Paris and Strasbourg, eastern France, and that between Lyon and
the Italian city of Turin, plus a west-east high speed railway in
the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
But all these railway projects are expected to meet with
financial difficulties because of lack of interests by private
investors.
</P>
<P>
France's railway industry is 100 percent owned by the state
railway company SNCF.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Kosovo Mission Faces Big Challenges, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday said that the U.N. Interim Civilian Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) is facing a task which "is enormous in scope and
complex in execution."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement as he opened an international
conference here on Kosovo, described as "the Friends of the
Secretary-General for Kosovo," which involved foreign minister or
senior representatives from 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
"The mission faces a number of immediate challenges," Annan
said, "The first is coping with the massive daily flow of
returning refugees and internally displaced persons -- at a rate
that exceeds any on record."
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian agencies, led by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), "are performing heroically under exceedingly
difficult conditions; they deserve our commendation and support."
</P>
<P>
"The next challenge concerns the establishment of a regime of
law and order," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only KFOR (the international peacekeepers in Kosovo) has the
capacity to establish a secure environment in Kosovo," he said.
"The demilitarization of armed Kosovar groups is a critical step,
and we are pleased to note that the KLA (the Kosovo Liberation
Army) has complied with the first key deadline set in its
agreement with KFOR."
</P>
<P>
"A third immediate challenge is political in nature," Annan
said, "The UNMIK team in Kosovo, again with KFOR at its side, has
begun to engage the various political groupings in Kosovo, in a
process of rehabilitation and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"The long-term success of our mission is defined in terms of
enabling all Kosovars to participate fully and effectively in the
public life of their province: creating viable legislative and
judicial bodies, delivering public services, and establishing a
robust civil society," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once that is achieved, UNMIK can be drawn down and phased out,
and its activities turned over to indigenous institutions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As an interim measure, we have established a United Nations
Trust Fund to finance salaries of local administrators, equipment
to support their work, and quick-hit projects that will
immediately improve the daily lives of Kosovars," he said. "I
urge you to contribute to the fund."
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution, adopted on June 10,
the U.N. dispatched a civilian mission to Kosovo in parallel
with KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"This civilian presence is intended to provide an interim
administration under which the people of Kosovo are able to enjoy
substantial autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who chaired the four-hour meeting, was asking attending
countries for money and personnel to run the war-torn Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
The pressing issue is the deployment of troops and the short
supply of police in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says DPRK in Preparation of Missile Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon indicated on
Wednesday that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
appears to be making preparations for a new missile launch.
</P>
<P>
Washington is certain to use this as a pretext for strengthening
its military presence in the Asian and Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair to say that we have seen some
preparations... some indications of a potential launch in the
future," Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Kurt Campbell told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said if a new missile test is performed the DPRK would be
viewed in Washington as "a very serious act with very real
consequences for U.S. policy toward" Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Campbell declined to offer any details, including the type of
missile being prepared for launch or a possible time schedule.
</P>
<P>
He refused to discus details what U.S. intelligence, including
satellites, might have gathered. But he said South Korea's
President Kim Dae-jung, who will hold talks with President Bill
Clinton in Washington on Friday, had spoken sternly against such a
step.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have enough indications yet to know what kind of
system is potentially being contemplated for launch now," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rejects U.N. Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash Wednesday rejected a U.N. call for the resumption of the
Cyprus talks in the autumn of this year with no preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that "if U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
invites me for exchange of views, I am ready to talk with
him. But there is no ground for talks between me and (Cyprus
President Glafcos) Klerides," according to a report of Anatolia
News Agency reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously approved resolution Tuesday, the U.N.
Security Council urged Annan to invite the Turkish and Greek
Cypriot sides to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the talks should start with no
preconditions, all aspects of the conflict be on the table and the
negotiations last until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on the other points of the resolution
because we categorically reject it. If they continue to recognize
Greek Cyprus as the government of the whole Cyprus and stick to
its positions despite all our objections, then nothing they say is
binding for us, " Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution followed a similar appeal by the G-8
countries, grouping the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
Italy, Germany, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the G-8 urged Annan "to invite the leaders of
the two parties on Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of 1999."
</P>
<P>
With Turkey's strong support behind him, Denktash has ruled out
any possibilites of talks not on a state-to-state basis, demanding
an international acknowledgment for the "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a solution on Cyprus can be reached only with
the recognition of two states, two peoples and two sovereignties.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Denktash declared the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which is now recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.

PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The French ferry company Emeraude
Lines will continue to envoy a duty-free business when sending
tourists from France to the British islands of Jersey, Guernesey

these islands.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) will ban from mid-night Wednesday any

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Peace in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday urged all political parties in Northern Ireland to "give
peace a chance" as they worked against a midnight deadline to save
the Good Friday peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago, Clinton said
he stands ready to become personally involved in the deadlocked
talks in Belfast, if he is needed.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators including British and Irish prime ministers in
Belfast were trying to resolve an impasse over creation of a
power-sharing body made up of Protestants and Catholics and
disarming the Irish Republic Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
"I will do whatever I can to be helpful. We're moving forward
and I'm hoping for the best," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked the parties not to let the pact fall apart before
it even has a chance to succeed or fail.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody fails to fulfil any condition, including the
decommissioning, at any time in the future by the appropriate
deadline it can always be taken down, but it shouldn't be taken
down in the absence of a failure to fulfil the conditions."

<HEADLINE> EU Accuses FIA of Violating Competition Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said here
Wednesday that it considers the Federation of International
Automobile (FIA) to be abusing its dominant position and
restricting competition.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive body said it has concluded a
thorough investigation, prompted by a number of complaints, into
the way international motor sports is organized and commercially
exploited.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission formally accused the FIA, the body in
charge of international motor racing, of violating the EU
competition law while sending the same statement of objections to
two companies: Formula One Administration Ltd (FOA), which sells
the television rights to the Formula One cchampionship, and
International Sportsworld Communicators (ISC), which markets the
broadcasting rights to a number of major international motor
sports events.
</P>
<P>
A statement of objections is a preliminary procedural document
and not the commission's final verdict on the case. Under the
statement, one of the EU executive body's most significant
conclusions is that many of the contracts concerning the
commercial exploitation of international motor sports,
particularly those involving broadcasters, were viewed on the
basis of a situation unlawful under European Union competition
law.
</P>
<P>
"These contracts would therefore have to be renegotiated if the
commission's initial view is ultimately confirmed," said the EU
executive branch, which is responsible for proposing and enforcing
regulations of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Sign Treaty on Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building
up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough
negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian
fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs
and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty was signed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas
R. Pickering and Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chtien at the U.S.
State Department's Treaty Room.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both
countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border
scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the U.S. to spend 140 million U.S. dollars to
restore salmon habitat and other measures to rebuild stocks.
</P>
<P>
The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen
only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and
growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of
chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho,
while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that
have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Receive 3.7 Billion Dollars in Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Wednesday that they
have agreed that Mozambique has met the requirements for receiving
close to 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in debt relief from its external
creditors under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The total debt relief package is worth 1.7 billion dollars in
today's values. Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative is expressed
in net present value terms -- today's values -- which discounts
future debt service payments to the current year's values, using
current discount (interest) rates and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest debt relief operation organized by the
international community under the HIPC Initiative so far, and
raises the total relief granted under the HIPC Initiative to 5.5
billion dollars, or 2.7 billion dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is the fourth country to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative, along with Uganda, Bolivia and Guyana.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative debt relief will reduce Mozambique's
external public debt by almost two-thirds from about 2.7 billion
dollars to 1 billion dollars in today's values, on top of debt
relief provided under traditional mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's external debt-service obligations will fall to an
annual average of 73 million dollars in 1999-2005, compared with
an average of 169 million dollars that would have been due in the
absence of HIPC Initiative relief, and the 104 million dollars
actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, debt service due would fall to 8 percent of exports
and 10 percent of government revenues, compared with 19 percent of
exports and 23 percent of revenues actually paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique remains one of the world's poorest countries, with
about 70 percent of its population living in poverty. Debt relief
is expected to help deepen the social benefits of good economic
management and will enable the government to sustain increases in
spending for social development, the World Bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative entails coordinated action by the
international financial community, including multilateral
institutions, to reduce to sustainable levels the external debt
burden of heavily indebted poor countries that pursue IMF and
World Bank-supported adjustment and reform program, but for whom
traditional debt relief mechanisms are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)
will provide debt service relief to Mozambique equivalent to 975
million dollars, or 381 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
This debt reduction will be delivered mainly through the
purchase and cancellation by the HIPC Trust Fund of IDA credits,
resulting in debt service savings of 327 million dollars in
today's values. In addition, an IDA grant has been made to support
improved economic management which will provide debt service
savings of 54 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
The IMF assistance under the HIPC Initiative will take the form
of a grant deposited into an escrow account to be used to cover
part of the debt service falling due to the IMF. This assistance,
to be delivered over the life of outstanding obligations to the
IMF, will amount to about 125 million dollars in today's values.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique also is expected to benefit form the changes
proposed by the recent G-7 Cologne Summit to strengthen the HIPC
Initiative. Once agreement is reached on an enhanced HIPC
Initiative, additional HIPC Initiative assistance will be
considered for Mozambique, the World Bank said.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Wednesday approved the long-delayed nomination
of Richard Holbrooke to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was approved by a voice vote. Chairman Jesse
Helms of the Committee said it was "the quickest vote" in the
history of the panel.
</P>
<P>
The vote sends the nomination to the Senate floor. Holbrooke
supporters hoped the Senate could vote on the nomination by week's

filled.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former assistant
secretary of state and ambassador to Germany. He has also served
as Clinton's special envoy on the Balkans, and was the "architect"
of the peace accord that ended the civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Holbrooke
in June 1998, but the nomination was held up for nine months while
the Justice and State Departments investigated ethics allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Relations Committee then conducted its own
investigation into the allegations, and held three separate
confirmation hearings on Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
The allegations focused on private-sector contacts Holbrooke
had and speaking fees he received after leaving the State
Department for the private sector in 1996. Holbrooke admitted no
wrong-doing.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Coalition of Peace and Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) - By sealing a deal with the
powerful ultra-religious party Shas, Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has secured broad-based support for his strategic goals
of reviving the peace process and achieving internal unity.
</P>
<P>
Joined by Shas, Barak's emerging coalition has already enjoyed
a majority of 69 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament). The
expected joining of two additional parties will finally give Barak
a majority of 77 seats, the widest parliamentary majority in
Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
The broad support is exactly what Barak needs in the light of
the enormous tasks he faces: reach a permanent peace with the
Palestinians, resume negotiations with Syria, pull Israeli troops
out of south Lebanon, and heal the internal rifts deepened in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant ex-army chief won a landslide in the prime
ministerial election on May 17, but the One Israel alliance led
by his Labor Party seized only 26 seats in the new Knesset, which
has a record number of 15 factions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Barak has had to struggle in the last six
weeks to court various factions with diversified demands in
order to put together a workable coalition.
</P>
<P>
While he could have formed a narrow government of left
and center parties, Barak has tried to include the right-wing
Likud and the Shas, the second and the third largest parties
in the Knesset, in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the coalition talks, Barak preferred the
Likud to Shas in his government. Most of the secular voters,
a majority of them supporting Barak in the election, did not
want to see Shas, a party they accuse of disrespecting the
rule of law, to sit together with their parties.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the secular Likud would help Barak to carry
out internal reforms he promised: restrict the religious-coercion
in individual and public life, draft religious students who enjoy
military exemption for the last 50 decades, and adopt an
institution to guide the relationship between religious affairs
and politics.
</P>
<P>
But it soon turned out that the right-wing Likud was not an
ideal partner for peace. It disputed with Barak's guidelines in
almost every significant field.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to halt increasing Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, and make necessary territorial concession over
the Golan Heights, the Syria territory seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war, in order to reach a comprehensive peace
deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud wanted the Jewish settlement activities to
continue and opposed any compromise on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, after suffering a humiliating defeat in the
election, the Likud was thrown into shambles. While the internal
struggle for its leadership intensified, the internal gaps over
whether it should join the coalition also became unbridgeable.
</P>
<P>
So, when Barak appeared to abandon the Likud and turned
to Shas, many people said he has changed his priority, putting
the peace process ahead of internal reform.
</P>
<P>
Although a pillar of Netanyahu's right-wing government, Shas
is relatively moderate on the peace process. And, since its
spiritual leader makes the final say, Barak would get a
unanimous support of the party.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Barak wheeled and dealed patiently, insisting that
the convicted Shas leader Aryeh Deri have to resign, persuading
the left-wing Meretz party to retreat from its objection to
sitting in the government with Shas, and resisting criticisms
from the impatient media and members inside his One Israel who
called on him to quickly form a narrow but "workable" government.
</P>
<P>
While he almost used up the time allocated the law,
Barak's labors finally bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true in saying that by choosing Shas rather
than the Likud, Barak has put the peace process on top of his
agenda, it is also true that it will be easier for him to achieve
his goal of unity by including Shas in his government.
</P>
<P>
Shas represents low-income Middle East Jews, who feel they
are discriminated in this country established by the "elite
class." It scored a stunning victory in the parliamentary
election, jumping from 10 seats to 17, just because its
supporters regarded the conviction of Deri as an oppression of
their whole class.
</P>
<P>
If Shas remains outside the government, which means its
schools and welfare networks will face financial difficulty, the
rift between its supporters and the country will only be
deepened.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, by including Shas in his government, Barak
will achieve, rather than delay or abandon, his goal of
internal unity. Many Israelis call the incoming government a
"coalition of peace," but observers say, actually, it is a
"coalition of peace and unity."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Coalition of Peace and Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) - By sealing a deal with the
powerful ultra-religious party Shas, Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak has secured broad-based support for his strategic goals
of reviving the peace process and achieving internal unity.
</P>
<P>
Joined by Shas, Barak's emerging coalition has already enjoyed
a majority of 69 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament). The
expected joining of two additional parties will finally give Barak
a majority of 77 seats, the widest parliamentary majority in
Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
The broad support is exactly what Barak needs in the light of
the enormous tasks he faces: reach a permanent peace with the
Palestinians, resume negotiations with Syria, pull Israeli troops
out of south Lebanon, and heal the internal rifts deepened in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant ex-army chief won a landslide in the prime
ministerial election on May 17, but the One Israel alliance led
by his Labor Party seized only 26 seats in the new Knesset, which
has a record number of 15 factions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Barak has had to struggle in the last six
weeks to court various factions with diversified demands in
order to put together a workable coalition.
</P>
<P>
While he could have formed a narrow government of left
and center parties, Barak has tried to include the right-wing
Likud and the Shas, the second and the third largest parties
in the Knesset, in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the coalition talks, Barak preferred the
Likud to Shas in his government. Most of the secular voters,
a majority of them supporting Barak in the election, did not
want to see Shas, a party they accuse of disrespecting the
rule of law, to sit together with their parties.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the secular Likud would help Barak to carry
out internal reforms he promised: restrict the religious-coercion
in individual and public life, draft religious students who enjoy
military exemption for the last 50 years, and adopt an
institution to guide the relationship between religious affairs
and politics.
</P>
<P>
But it soon turned out that the right-wing Likud was not an
ideal partner for peace. It disputed with Barak's guidelines in
almost every significant field.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to halt increasing Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, and make necessary territorial concession over
the Golan Heights, the Syria territory seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war, in order to reach a comprehensive peace
deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud wanted the Jewish settlement activities to
continue and opposed any compromise on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, after suffering a humiliating defeat in the
election, the Likud was thrown into shambles. While the internal
struggle for its leadership intensified, the internal gaps over
whether it should join the coalition also became unbridgeable.
</P>
<P>
So, when Barak appeared to abandon the Likud and turned
to Shas, many people said he has changed his priority, putting
the peace process ahead of internal reform.
</P>
<P>
Although a pillar of Netanyahu's right-wing government, Shas
is relatively moderate on the peace process. And, since its
spiritual leader makes the final say, Barak would get a
unanimous support of the party.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Barak wheeled and dealed patiently, insisting that
the convicted Shas leader Aryeh Deri have to resign, persuading
the left-wing Meretz party to retreat from its objection to
sitting in the government with Shas, and resisting criticisms
from the impatient media and members inside his One Israel who
called on him to quickly form a narrow but "workable" government.
</P>
<P>
While he almost used up the time allocated the law,
Barak's labors finally bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true in saying that by choosing Shas rather
than the Likud, Barak has put the peace process on top of his
agenda, it is also true that it will be easier for him to achieve
his goal of unity by including Shas in his government.
</P>
<P>
Shas represents low-income Middle East Jews, who feel they

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches War Against Malaria in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO), in conjunction with interested parties, has launched a
campaign against malaria in a bid to cut down the death rate and
boost the economy of Africa, an official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director for Africa Ebrahim Samba made these
remarks during a meeting dubbed Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in the
Zimbabwean capital.
</P>
<P>
Samba said there was guaranteed success of combating malaria
due to vastly improved knowledge and the availability of better
drugs for its control.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike previous anti-malaria efforts, RBM is an all embracing
 initiative which seeks to mobilize and coordinate a global
coalition including leaders from malaria-endemic countries, WHO,
United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations,
scientific communities and private and public sector
organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Roll Back Malaria partnership would pool resources
to eliminate costly overlaps.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting would review implementation of Roll Back
Malaria in Africa and how the partnership would work to support
the project.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Africans are estimated to be killed by
malaria each year.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses which are attributed to the disease in 1998
reached two billion U.S. dollars and were projected to reach three
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 participants from various countries including
Tanzania, Cote D'Ivoire, Mali, Sudan, Senegal and Ireland are
attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Investigates Togolese Copters Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Ministry of the Interior
is investigating last Monday's incident in which two Togolese
military helicopters landed unauthorized at Wli-Afegame, in the
Volta region southeast of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
 James Victor Gbeho, Ghanaian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that his Ministry was awaiting
the report from the Interior Ministry in order to assess the
situation and take the necessary actions.
</P>
<P>
 "It'll take a day or two for us to do a proper assessment,"
Gbeho said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Two Togolese air force helicopters Monday made unauthorized
landing at WLI-Afegame in the Hohoe district of the Volta region.
 One of them landed at the local Roman Catholic primary school
park, while the second one landed near the WLI Waterfalls,
creating fears and panic among the villagers.
</P>
<P>
 WLI-Afegame shares a common border with Togo and has the
biggest waterfall in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
 Ghanaian and Togolese officials in Accra have confirmed that
the Togolese authorities have been in touch with their Ghanaian
counterparts over the incident since the news broke out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 Nankoum Dzankla, ministerial counsellor at the Togo Embassy,
said , Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffigoh made contact
with his Ghanaian counterpart Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
 "They are still talking and will soon get to the root of the
matter," said Dzankla.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Road to Peace in DRC Long, Bumpy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Crucial talks to end the
11-month-long war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are
still busy giving final touches to a draft ceasefire agreement in
Lusaka, Zambia, however, a quick breakthrough is still not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started on Monday, are attended by defense and
foreign ministers from 14 members of Southern African Development
Community, as well as Rwanda, Uganda and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The highly-expected meeting ushers in a glimmering of hope for
the restoration of peace in the vast central African country, but
the postponement of the summit reminds people that the road to
peace in the DRC is long and bumpy.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from countries in the region are expected to
sign a ceasefire agreement at the ensuing summit and to map out
modalities for the withdrawal of foreign troops. However, their
wishes can be easily crushed by the grave differences among the
players in the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war in the former Zaire, the third largest country in the
continent, has drawn in at least six African countries and
threatens to engulf the continent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have provided military support to
DRC President Laurent Kabila at the latter's invitation.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda and Rwanda are supporting the rebels and
maintaining military presence in eastern part of the DRC in the
excuse of defending their borders.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister Amama Mbabazi has warned that Kampala
would not sign the documents if its security concerns were not
adequately addressed at the forthcoming summit. If Uganda did not
honor the ceasefire and refused to withdraw its troops there, it
would constitute a major obstacle to the restoration of real peace
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which regards Libya as its leading enemy in
Africa, would not tolerate Libya for deploying a large
peacekeeping force abroad and play a major role in the DRC peace
process. Libya initiated a ceasefire agreement of the DRC civil
war in Sirte of Libya on April 18.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials has accused Libya of attempting to use its
peacekeeping forces in the DRC to back the Ugandan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the United States would use its
power and influence to block the participation of Libya in the
multinational peacekeeping forces to be deployed in the DRC and
would not easily accept any peacekeeping program in which Libya
plays a leading role.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of peacekeeping forces should have the nod from
the Organization of African Unity and the U.N. Security Council.
It is expected that the U.S would not give its nod when the matter
seeks approval from the world body.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Tutsi rebels who have been trying to topple
the Kabila administration have now split into two major factions,
with one based in Goma in the east and the other in Kisangani,
northern DRC, due to what is said as nearly insurmountable
strategic and tactic differences. The Congolese Liberation
Movement which is fighting government troops in the northern part
of the country is now another rebel force.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from all these three rebel groups are now in
Lusaka and they all demand to sign the pact on behalf of the rebel
forces. Analysts here predict that an inevitable rebel clash would
precede the signing of the accord. The disparities among the
different rebel groups would add to the difficulty in the
realization of peace in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Although Kabila has agreed to talk directly with the rebels,
this has never been a reality up to now. The rebel forces have
warned more than once that they would not sign the pact if Kabila
refused to hold direct talks with them.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are still bargaining over the details of the
accord and trying to iron out their differences, but how to solve
all the problems mentioned above would matter much to the peace
process. The torch of hope is flickering there and is real, but it
looks somewhat distant.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Discuss Ratification of International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Southern African government
officials will meet in Pretoria next week to discuss ratification
of a statute providing for the creation of an international
criminal court, the South African Justice Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statute, adopted by a United Nations diplomatic conference
in Rome last year, needs to be ratified by 60 countries before
such a court can be set up.
</P>
<P>
So far only one country, Senegal, has ratified the document.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 14 Southern African Development Community (SADC)
member states, including South Africa, have signed the statute,
which amounts to an approval of its text.
</P>
<P>
"While SADC states are favorably disposed to ratification at
the earliest opportunity, a number lack the legal expertise,
experience and resources to identify and draft the national
legislation necessary for compliance with the statute, with the
resultant delay in their early ratification," the department said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the regional workshop, from Sunday to Friday next week,
would aim to familiarize government officials with the provisions
of the statute, and to discuss its implications for national
legislation.
</P>
<P>
It would also seek a coordinated approach to ratification, and
an agreement on a common negotiating strategy.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice and Constitutional Development Minister
Penuell Maduna will open the workshop Monday.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earnings Turnaround for Consolidated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Consolidated African Mines
(CAM) reported Wednesday a huge surge in earnings which took it
from a loss of 178.6 million rand (29.7 million U.S. dollars) for
the past nine months ending March 1998 to an attributable profit
of 132.5 million rand (22 million dollars) for the past financial
year.
</P>
<P>
CAM chief executive Brett Kebble said here in a statement that
the company's turnaround was the result of a vigorous clean-up of
its portfolio of interests since last year's unbundling of two
major gold mines -- Saflife and JCI Limited.
</P>
<P>
CAM and its major investment, JCI Gold, also announced they
were selling their non-gold assets to New Mining Corporation in a
273.4- million-rand (45.5 million dollars) deal designed to set
the scene for a proposed restructuring of their gold interests
involving Western Areas, Randfontein Estates, Randgold and
Exploration and Randgold Resources.
</P>
<P>
Kebble said the sale of the non-gold assets was a further step
in a process designed ultimately to lead to the creation of a new
world-class gold business.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of the non-gold assets of CAM and JCI Gold was
sure to transform New Mining Corporation, a fledgling empowerment
group, and to significantly enhance its asset base and make it a
substantial player in the global diamond industry, the corporation
said.
</P>
<P>
New Mining Chairman Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said the
acquisition of the assets would provide the company with
income-producing assets, a source of cash flow and substantial
mineral interests which could be developed either by New Mining
itself or through mergers and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"They will add critical mass to New Mining and provide it with
a solid platform for implementing its strategy of becoming a
substantial and diversified resources company," Nkuhlu said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of Integrity Urged for Africa </HEADLINE>

<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister of Internal
Affairs Sarah Kiyingi said Africa lacks leaders of integrity and
this hinders the development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks here Wednesday, Radio Uganda

</P>
<P>
She said African leaders do not mentor their successors, thus
leading to the lack of upright and successful leaders.

The continent has been involved in wars and conflicts over the
last 30 years, which resulted in the degeneration of values, the
minister said while officiating a leadership dinner.

<P>
This partly explains the backwardness of the continent, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
The incorrect decisions made by such leaders add to people's
untold suffering and rampant corruption among senior government
officials.

The minister called for leaders of the continent to pay more

this is the only way out for Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Independent Counsel Ends Whitewater Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. independent counsel
Kenneth Starr Wednesday ended the investigation of President
Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton into their financial dealings
in Arkansas with two fresh guilty pleas from key Whitewater figure
Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
"After five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,"
Hubbell said outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one
year of probation.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell pleaded guilty to misleading federal regulators to
cover up legal work he performed with Mrs. Clinton on a failed
Arkansas land development called Castle Grande.
</P>
<P>
He also pleaded guilty to a less serious misdemeanor violation
of failing to pay part of more than 890,000 dollars in owned taxes
and penalties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Robertson accepted Hubbell's guilty
pleas and agreed to a request from Starr's prosecutors not to
sentence the 51-year-old Hubbell to any more time in prison.
Robertson placed Hubbell on one year probation.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, a longtime friend and associate of the Clintons,
previously served a 16-month prison sentence for bilking his law
firm and his clients.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell said President Clinton and first lady Hillary did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I told the office of independent counsel, as I told them
five years ago, that I had no knowledge of any wrongdoing on the
part of Mrs. Clinton or the president," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Starr said Hubbell's plea brought to an
end the Arkansas phase of his investigation. For five years, he
has been investigating the Clinton's investment in the failed
Whitewater real estate venture in the 1980s in Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell's plea deal prevented Mrs. Clinton from potentially
testifying as a prosecution witness at Hubbell's trial next month
as she prepares a possible campaign for a Senate seat from New
York.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key U.S. Interest Rates by 0.25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
announced Wednesday that it was increasing its target for the
federal funds rate, at which banks charge each other on overnight
loans, by a quarter-point to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which had been widely expected, was announced at
the end of the second day of deliberations by the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), the group of Fed policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's decision marked the first time the central bank had
raised interest rates since a quarter-point increase in the funds
rate March 25, 1997, a move also taken as a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
</P>
<P>
While the Fed raised the funds rate by a quarter point, central
bank policy-makers said they were switching their policy
directive, which serves as an indication of future moves, back to
neutral.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of
conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has
chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about
near-term policy action," the Fed said in a short statement.
</P>
<P>
Before the current rate increase, the Fed had switched in the
direction of leaning toward an increase in rates, a signal the
markets took that a boost was likely soon. By switching back to
neutral, the central bank signaled it may not feel the need to
follow up today's rate action with an additional increase when Fed
officials next meet in August.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Fed cut the funds rate three times over a period
of seven weeks as concern mounted that world financial turmoil
could seriously harm the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
But today, the Fed said "since then much of the financial
strain has eased, foreign economies have firmed and economic
activity in the United States has moved forward at a brisk pace."
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless," the Fed added, it "recognize that in the current
dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence,
or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the Fed will be able to accomplish a "soft
landing" in which growth slows enough to keep inflation in check
without the economy toppling into a recession.
</P>
<P>
U.S. unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels in three
decades, currently at 4.2 percent. While inflationary wage
pressures have not yet become evident, Fed policy-makers are
concerned that many of the factors that contributed to low
inflation last year -- falling oil prices and weak global demand
-- are beginning to reverse, setting the stage for a potential
inflationary surge, especially with U.S. consumer demand remaining
so strong.

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises 35.5 Million Dollars For Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican front-runner
George W. Bush broke presidential fund-raising records with a
collection of 35.5 million dollars in the first six months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The fund Bush raised is nearly 10 times as much as his closest
Republican rival and millions more than Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who only has one Democratic rival and has the power of the
White House behind him, raised 17 million dollars less than Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush, at a news conference today in Los Angeles, said his
campaign was still counting donations and termed the figure a
"minimum number" .
</P>
<P>
"I am, as you can imagine, amazed at the outpouring of
support." he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who released his totals Tuesday, collected 18.2 million
dollars to 18.5 million dollars in the first six months of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
His only rival, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, will
report slightly more than 11.5 million dollars in overall
contributions, according to his spokesman Eric Hauser.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Approves Four-year Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Wednesday evening
approved the four-year economic plan, entailing a lighter budget for
next year than originally expected with no mention of highly
controversial pension cuts.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 budget was put at 15 trillion lire (8 billion U.S.
dollars), comprising 11.5 trillion lire in cuts, with the ax falling
heavily on the public employment sector and regional health spending,
and 3.5 trillion lire in spending designed to boost growth.
</P>
<P>
The 2001 budget was also put at 15 trillion lire, with 7.5 trillion
lire going towards boosting growth, while the budgets for the
following two years were put at 11.5 trillion lire.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said at a press conference
later that the government did not intend to reduce welfare spending
but rather reform the system to iron out imbalances, stressing that
this would be done through negotiations with unions and management.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema put the emphasis on job creation and growth Wednesday
night, saying that the money set aside for investment should create
thousands of jobs and complaining that attention had focused over the
last week on "issues of secondary importance."
</P>
<P>
"The plan's primary objective is to establish the economic
foundations for encouraging growth and employment, this represents the
great challenge," he said, adding that talks with unions and
management on the details of these policies would follow.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to allay concerns that the lighter line of the 2000
budget risked compromising Italy's ability to meet its euro-zone
commitments as laid down in the Stability Pact, D'Alema said that
"Italy is not at the bottom of the class when it comes to its public
accounts."
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury ministry undersecretary Piero Giarda said that the
11.5 trillion lire in cuts were designed to ensure that Italy hit a
deficit-to-GDP ratio of 1.5 percent next year, as required by the
Stability Pact.
</P>
<P>
Amato is due to go through the contents of the plan with European
Union finance ministers on July 12.
</P>
<P>
The plan forecasts growth of 1.3 percent in 1999 and 2.2 percent in
2000, putting it at the bottom end of the EU economic table, although
a small sign of encouragement was given by better-than- expected first
quarter growth figures released this morning.
</P>
<P>
The plan also aims to make public debt to fall to 99.6 percent of
GDP by 2003, while the inflation rate is expected to drop to 1.2
percent next year, 1.1 percent in 2001, remaining stable at 1 percent
for the following two years.
</P>
<P>
On fiscal issues, the plan confirmed the goal of cutting income tax
from 27 percent to 26 percent as well as tax breaks for poor families
and an increase in petrol tax to boost revenue.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Gets Pledges of Policemen to Keep Law and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced Wednesday that key international players had
promised to send him 1,900 of the 3,100 police needed to stop
post-war revenge killings and looting in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, he told a meeting of 18 countries that it was the
job of NATO-led peacekeepers, only half of which had been
deployed, to keep order until U.N. police could be put in place.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this is entirely in the hands of Member
States," Annan told a press conference, "because as a Secretariat,
we have no police, and we cannot deploy and distribute what we do
not have."
</P>
<P>
Annan said the meeting with the Group of Friends of Kosovo is
"very, very useful," and consensus understanding had been reached
on several issues, including the collective objective of a
multi-ethnic Kosovo, in which all people could live their lives in
peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was also agreement that the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, known as UNMIK, should
acquire the capacity to take over responsibility for public
security from the international peacekeepers, also called KFOR, as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of new major commitments for police, he
said. The United States had pledged some 450 police plus 100
police trainers. Germany offered 200 police. Italy, Turkey and
Canada also announced increases in offers they had already made.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the United Nations had 1,423 civilian police
pledged, out of a required 1,800, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also required 1,125 special police, and had
offers of 440 of those, he said, adding that 75 border police had
been promised out of a required 205. A total of 1938 police had
been pledged, out of 3,110 required.
</P>
<P>
"I have appealed to the Member States to work with us and
move to the theater as urgently as possible the men they have
offered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police units include regular police officers, border
police, special units and trainers for a new Kosovo police.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is in charge of civilian administration in
Kosovo that runs in parallel to the military operation to resettle
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees, whose massive
exodus came in the wake of the 79-day air strikes by NATO, which
began on March 24.

LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Formula One Management Ltd, the
company which runs the motor race, said on Wednesday that it
needed more time to study a document from the European Commission
starting legal proceedings against it and the FIA world motor
racing body on grounds of anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon for the company to have assimilated the
contents of the document, however, the company welcomes that the
EU has at last stated its position," Formula One Management Ltd
said in a statement.

</P>
<P>
The European Commission earlier said it had started the
proceedings against the FIA and Formula One on suspicion that they
breached EU competition rules.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission has now formally told the Federation
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)...that it considers the FIA
to be abusing its dominant position and restricting competition,"
the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Formula One said it had told the Commission "on a number of
occasions" that concerns previously expressed about certain
restrictions in the promoters' and broadcasters' contracts had
been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
It also said it was "gravely concerned" that a journalist had
an advance copy of the confidential Commission document before
itself.
</P>

"The company is considering the implications of this," it said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asian Crisis Hits Bottom, Recovery Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two years after a financial crisis
threw Asia into an economic turmoil, economies in the region are
now showing more and more signs of recovering from a deep
recession.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, 1997, the decision by the Bank of Thailand to float
the baht triggered a financial storm, which soon spread onto the
rest of the region. Currencies in Southeast Asian nations and
South Korea depreciated by 15 to 80 percent in the course of the
upheaval; stock markets in most part of Asia nose-dived by over 50
percent; foreign exchange reserves of the crisis-hit nations were
depleted to the lowest level in a decade...
</P>
<P>
With the deterioration of the crisis, dozens of banks
collapsed, thousands of companies closed, millions of people lost
their jobs and lived below the poverty line in the region. Asia,
once the fast growing region in the world, saw many countries
falling into a severe recession in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the crisis caused social unrest in Thailand, South
Korea and Indonesia and forced leadership shakeups in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
But now, on the second anniversary of the crisis, the financial
fires are out, the smoke over Asia is clearing. Asia's economic
picture has improved greatly, and the region is growing again.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe that the (Asian) countries
will successfully overcome the crisis and that a year from now we
will have a full-fledged recover," said Hubert Neiss, IMF
(International Monetary Fund) Asia-Pacific Director, at a recent
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Neiss' assessment is identical with that of many economists,
who believe that the two-year old crisis has hit the bottom and
Asia has embarked on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The most convincing sign of the recovery has come from the
financial market, whose turmoil was considered one of the direct
causes of the economic meltdown in the region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Asia's financial market has
remained relatively stable despite the launch of the euro,
Brazil's financial crisis and the unstable exchange rate of the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
However, a new round of financial storms did not break out as
many people had expected. On the contrary, Asian currencies have
appreciated steadily in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah, which depreciated to 14,750 to the U.S.
dollar in June 1998 from 2,390 in February 1997, has rebounded to
around 7,000 now. The Thai baht has rose to around 37 against the
greenback from 57 during the worst part of the crisis in the first
half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stocks in Asian countries have recovered by 30 to 50 percent,
near the pre-crisis levels, and continued their upturns.
</P>
<P>
Government officials in the crisis-hit countries are confident
that the rising foreign exchange reserves and current account
surplus could prevent a new around of a financial turmoil even if
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With the stabilization of the financial market, economic
reforms and measures to stimulate the growth by Asian countries
have pushed the region's economy to the stage of recovery.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by 4.6 percent in South Korea, 1.2 percent in the Philippines
and Singapore, compared to contractions in 1998. Malaysia's GDP
also increased by 1.4 percent in February and March, although it
declined in January.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank predicted that the economy in the
developing Asia could increase 4.4 percent this year, and 5.1
percent next year, from 2.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"I think the recovery is sustainable. Exports are picking up.
Inflation is contained. Interest rates are the lowest in two
decades. Foreign reserves have been increasing steadily. The
current account has been in surplus consecutively for over a year.
Foreign investment is coming back. International confidence is
improving," said Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan at the
annual corporate conference of the Far East Economic Review last
month.
</P>
<P>
All these factors mentioned by the Thai official have paved the
way for a full-fledged recovery in Asia and could help the
stabilization of political situation in the crisis-affected
nations.
</P>
<P>
Except Indonesia, most Asian countries have become quiet as far
as the internal situation is concerned. This, in turn, has
provided favorable social environment for an economic surge.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's economic recovery is just at the initial
stage. Without further reforms in the banking sector and the
corporate sector, Asia will need much longer time to regain its
economic strength, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
Asia, in the aftermath of the crisis, still has a long way to
go toward a full recovery. This is the general consensus of
opinions by almost all economists.

<HEADLINE> Hill Set for Silverstone Swansong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Englishman Damon Hill stunned the
motor racing world by revealing he will race for the final time at
the British Grand Prix on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion guaranteed himself an emotional and
lucrative send-off in front of 100,000 fans by completing an
astonishing U-turn when all in Formula One expected him to quit
now.
</P>
<P>
Hill made his decision after three days of discussions with his
family and friends at his Spanish villa. The 38-year-old will be
at Silverstone on Thursday for a two-day test in his Jordan car
ahead of the race at the Northamptonshire circuit.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to give Damon this opportunity in front of the
sponsors and fans who have supported his great career," said team
chief Eddie Jordan. "I hope everyone will join us in making this a
triumphant send-off."
</P>
<P>
The Dublin-based driver had flown in from Spain for a head-to-
head with Jordan to apparently thrash out the final severance
details of his contract. But after a day of increasing speculation
the team announced that Hill had told them he would drive his last
grand prix at Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of both Hill and his team would have been keen to
have their main drawing card present for the most important race
the calendar.
</P>
<P>
The British Grand Prix is also a huge pay-day for Hill whose
merchandise sales at the track are greater than the rest of the
drivers combined.
</P>
<P>
Hill's 5 million pound salary with the Silverstone-based outfit
is also understood to have been a sticking point. Half of that
salary has already been paid with next week's race marking the mid-
way point of the season.
</P>
<P>
Hill would then have been due the next installment for the
remainder of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Briton has given no reason for his decision, which is a
massive change of heart given his emotional state after he was
forced to retire from last week's French Grand Prix in Magny-Cours.

<HEADLINE> Monument Symbolizes China's National Reunification: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Thursday that the Monument in Commemoration of Hong
Kong's Return to China is a symbol of the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the unveiling ceremony of the monument here Thursday
morning, Hu said that the monument "keeps a historical record of
the struggles waged by sons and daughters of the Chinese nation
for national reunification and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's
great concept of "one country, two systems," achieved a peaceful
solution to the question of Hong Kong and has thus redeemed the
100-year-long national humiliation and realized the historical
aspiration of the Chinese people for the recovery of Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a monument in praise of the great practice of 'one
country, two systems," said the vice-president, adding that it
also "marks the beginning of Hong Kong people acting as masters of
their own and erecting a new milestone in building up Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Also, the monument marks the "important contribution by the
Chinese people to the cause of peace and progress of mankind"
since Hong Kong's return to China stands as a successful example
for the international community in solving historical problems and
disputes between states through peaceful means, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an immortal monument that will stand in the heart of
every Chinese people," he said. "It will forever serve as a
comfort to the dead, an encouragement to the people today and an
inspiration to the future generations."

<HEADLINE> Ferguson: We Did not Want Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua)-- Sir Alex Ferguson claims Manchester
United have ditched the FA Cup because they do not want to be
blamed if England's 2006 World Cup bid fails.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford boss realises that United's participation in
the inaugural FIFA World Team Championship is vital to England's
hopes of staging the tournament and that is why they have taken up
the Football Association's offer to opt out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
The United boss feels this is clearly the lesser of two evils
and he does not want the club to bear the wrath of the nation if
they refused to go to Brazil and England's bid failed. United
announced their withdrawal from the FA Cup after much soul
searching and Sir Alex said: "We had to think about the situation
regarding England hosting the World Cup, that was paramount."
</P>
<P>
He added: "No-one wants to see them not getting it and the
criticism we would have received if they had not got it and we had
refused to go to Brazil would have been unthinkable - and that's a
Scotsman talking!
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view we couldn't win and we're getting
criticised anyway because all of a sudden everyone is putting the
FA Cup above everything else.
</P>
<P>
"We know that and we understand that, but we've been brave
enough to make this decision."
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex claimed he was disappointed to be robbed of the chance
of defending the Treble before the season has even started. He
sympathised with the fans, who are naturally upset by their
decision, but he claimed the club had no option because they
cannot compete in the eight-team tournament in Brazil in January
on top of their existing heavy commitments.
</P>
<P>
The silver lining to this grey cloud, though, for Sir Alex was
the chance to be crowned the first club champions of the world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed and the FA Cup is very special to me because
it's the first trophy I ever won, but we have no option," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go for them all and we can't play in Brazil and go
for the FA Cup. But now we have the opportunity to be, without
question, the world champion club team," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Implement "One Country, Two Systems" Policy: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Thursday that the Chinese government is determined to
implement in full the policy of "one country, two systems," "Hong
Kong people administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of
autonomy as well as the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a ceremony for the unveiling of the
Monument in Commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to China, Hu said
that the central government "will never waver in supporting the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government led by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa in governing Hong Kong in accordance with
law."
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, the great socialist country will be a
strong backing for the continued prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong," said Hu, who arrived here Tuesday for the unveiling
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president commented that the policy of "one country,
two systems" and the Basic Law have been implemented in full over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The previous social and economic systems as well as the way of
life in Hong Kong remain unchanged, he said. Hong Kong maintains
its status as a free port and a hub of international finance,
trade and navigation, and keeps its extensive ties with foreign
countries, other regions, and relevant international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents "enjoy all kinds of rights and freedoms
fully," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have eloquently proved that the policy of 'one country,
two systems' and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR not only
conform to the fundamental interests of Hong Kong, but also serve
the interests of investors from all countries. They are the
fundamental guarantee for the long-term prosperity and stability
of Hong Kong," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his conviction that Hong Kong will overcome all
difficulties on its way ahead "with the correct guidance of the
policy of "one country, two systems," with the industry and wisdom
of the over six million Hong Kong compatriots, with the effective
work of the SAR government and with the strong support of the
people of all ethnic groups and the central people's government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Hails HKSAR Government Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
Thursday praised the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for successfully handling Hong Kong
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to unveil the Monument in Commemoration
of Hong Kong's Return to China, Hu said that Hong Kong compatriots
have, with an unprecedented sense of being the masters of their
own affairs, actively participated in the management of Hong Kong
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR government, headed by Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa, has handled Hong Kong affairs cautiously, but steadily
and firmly, and responded to various challenges calmly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has "succeeded in fencing off the strong
impact of the Asian financial crisis on Hong Kong and in
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The firm steps forward our Hong Kong compatriots have taken
under the leadership of the SAR government in overcoming
difficulties and warding off risks have shown to the world that
the SAR government led by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa has the wisdom and
capability to handle complicated situation and the people of Hong
Kong are undoubtedly capable of administering Hong Kong well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China 50 years
ago, Hu noted, the Hong Kong compatriots have "shared the common
fate with the motherland."
</P>
<P>
With the constant advancement of China's modernization drive,
he said, there will be closer and more extensive economic links
between Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will surely continue to play an irreplaceable
critical role in turning China into a strong and prosperous
country," he said. "The sustained and steady economic growth of
the mainland will provide a strong support for Hong Kong's
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Hu came to Hong Kong from Shenzhen Tuesday for the unveiling of
the monument.

<HEADLINE> Man United Pulls out of FA Cup (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United have confirmed
they will accept the Football Association's offer of missing next
season's FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Old Trafford giants have defied opposition from supporters
by agreeing to skip the competition so they can take part in the
inaugural World Team Championship in Brazil next January.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards said on Wednesday the club had "
no alternative" but to accept the offer for one year only.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision had been made "in the national
interest".
</P>
<P>
The FA wants United to play in the new tournament -- because
they believe it could aid England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
The Treble winners were concerned that the inaugural tournament
would add to their already hectic fixture schedule, which led to
the FA's proposal to ditch the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The FA's interim executive director, David Davies thanked
United for what he agreed had been an "agonising decision".
</P>
<P>
Supporters and influential figures within the game have
criticised the move, arguing that it devalues the oldest cup
competition in world football.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Edwards said: "We realise that many of our
supporters will be as disappointed as we are with our decision not
to compete in the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United see this as an opportunity to compete for
the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions."
</P>
<P>
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been a long-time critic of
the fixture congestion in English football and he was concerned
his team would be unable to challenge for yet another trophy.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go for them all," he said. "We can't play in the FA
Cup and in Brazil. That would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a no-win situation here. The criticism we would have
received if we hadn't gone (to Brazil) would have been unthinkable
-and that's a Scotsman speaking."
</P>
<P>
The FA has proposed reducing the number of teams in the
Premiership from 20 to 18 in an attempt to address next season's
growing fixture chaos.
</P>
<P>
The issue, brought into focus by United's exit from the FA Cup,
is a growing problem with some clubs now facing up to 70 matches
in a season.
</P>
<P>
David Davies said: "We are very concerned about the amount of
football that our players are playing.
</P>
<P>
"We can't just reach a solution in England. FIFA are working on
a world football calendar and we have to be part of that."
</P>
<P>
But Davies also acknowledged the lack of support among
Premiership clubs for a reduction - and was left in even less
doubt as a clutch of clubs again spoke out in defiance.
</P>
<P>
West Ham secretary Graham Mackrell led the rebuttal, saying: "
When you see the amount of money being generated in the
Premiership you can't realistically expect to see clubs voting to
fall on their swords."
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale added: "I feel very strongly that
domestic football is the foundation of our game, and if you
undermine that the rest is likely to collapse."

<HEADLINE> More People Watching Women's World Cup Than NHL League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Women's World Cup is
getting more and more popular in the United States and its
television ratings are already better than the NHL's.
</P>
<P>
ESPN has a .82 cable rating in five World Cup games so far
compared with a .59 mark on its NHL regular-season games this past
season.
</P>
<P>
The cable network also has broadcast 17 Women's World Cup games
on ESPN2, with a .51 mark.
</P>
<P>
ESPN's game last Thursday between the United States and Nigeria
drew a 1.85 rating and was seen in 1.4 million homes.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the United States played Colombia in the first round
of the men's World Cup. The game on ESPN drew a 4.3 rating and was
seen in 2.7 million homes.
</P>
<P>
ESPN's average for 41 men's games in 1994, when the tournament
was also held in the United States, was 1.8. The 1998 men's World
Cup was in France, where many games fell in a poor time slot for
Americans. ESPN had a .9 rating for 27 games.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's United States-DPR Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96
rating and was seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the highest
rating for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth most-watched
event on the network.
</P>
<P>
Each cable point of the rating represents 766,000 homes on ESPN
and 644,000 on ESPN2.

<HEADLINE> Becker Ends Wimbledon Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris
Becker of Germany ended his career on the All England Club lawn
tennis courts when he lost to second seed Patrick Rafter of
Australia 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 31 but still the youngest men's champion in Wimbledon
history, was outplayed by the Australian on Wednesday as the serve
that struck a thousand aces on the grass of the All-England Club
lost its bite.
</P>
<P>
The German, champion in 1985, 1986 and 1989, bowed out with a
wave and a smile, and the fans cheered him to the roof tops.
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice way to say good-bye," said Becker, smiling. "
This place was always special to me, it made me who I am today.
It gave me all the possibilities, all the freedom to do what I
want to do with my life from now one and I'm very thankful."
</P>
<P>
"I have so many memories, so many things have happened. I'm
thankful I had the chance to come back and play some decent tennis.
"
</P>
<P>
Rafter had no time for sentiment, saying he hadn't felt bad
about beating the Wimbledon legend. "He's obviously a presence
here but his game wasn't firing today."
</P>
<P>
The Australian plays eighth seed Todd Martin who eased past
last year's finalist Goran Ivanisevic 7-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, a three-time finalist here but never a winner, was
devastated by his loss.
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty slow and didn't return well. Every volley I was
panicking when I tried to hit it. I just had a bad day and when
you have a bad day, it's bad luck," said the 10th seed.
</P>
<P>
France's Cedric Pioline, losing finalist in 1997, beat Karol
Kucera of Slovakia, the 13th seed, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 and
will play Henman.
</P>
<P>
American Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who have
both won the French Open, meet in the other quarter-final after
finding enough time amid the showers to win on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Pete Sampras, yet to drop his serve or a set,
continued his cruise towards a sixth final in seven years when he
beat Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I had four days off since I last played, and it definitely
affects your rhythm," the defending champion said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's play was washed out and Sampras's match was a victim
of the early finish on Monday, caused by showers.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Tim Henman delighted home fans when he saved three
match points on the way to beating former world number one Jim
Courier 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7, 9-7 in a match lasting four hours 30
minutes and spread over three days.
</P>
<P>
Sampras meets seventh seed Mark Philippoussis of Australia who
beat another Briton Greg Rusedski 2-6, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski was in control until the second set tiebreak when the
huge Australian's feared serve finally began to click and he won
it 7-6, the first set he had ever taken off the ninth seed.
</P>
<P>
From then on the Briton lost heart and by the fourth set
Philippoussis was breaking the fastest serve in men's tennis with
embarrassing ease.
</P>
<P>
Second women's seed Steffi Graf showed no mercy when she
finished off Belgium's teenage qualifier Kim Clijsters in eight
minutes to win their rain-delayed match 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Graf plays sixth seed Venus Williams in the quarter-finals
following the powerful American's 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Russian
Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
A woman qualifier will reach the semifinals at Wimbledon for
the first time after American Alexandra Stevenson came from a set
and a matchpoint down to beat Lisa Raymond 2-6, 7-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old now plays Jelena Dokic, the 16-year-old
Australian who beat top seed Martina Hingis in the first round.
The last qualifier to reach the Wimbledon semifinals was John
McEnroe in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, at the centre of a row over racism after reported
comments by her mother, read a statement at her press conference
saying her mother had been misquoted by British newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But she confirmed she had been called a "nigger" during the pre-
Wimbledon Roehampton tournament in 1998. She said she was
delighted that she and Williams were both in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"It means a great deal to me. I represent both African-American
and Caucasian - without race or anything I think it's great
because we're both friends," said Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
Williams won just four points in the first four games as
Kournikova streaked into a 4-0 lead. But the American began to
find her length in the second set and eventually won with ease.
</P>
<P>
Mirjana Lucic, the unseeded Croatian who knocked out fourth
seed Monica Seles in the previous round, ground down Thailand's
Tamarine Tanasugarn 7-5 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Lucic, 17, now meets last year's losing finalist Nathalie
Tauziat of France, the eighth seed, who beat the 15th seed
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Davenport of the U.S., the second seed, will play
defending champion Jana Novotna in the other women's quarter-final
after they both won on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls decided to
keep their No. 1 draft pick tonight and selected Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
Brand, a forward from Duke after his sophomore season, was
chosen after the Bulls took a serious last look at Lamar Odom,
bringing him into Chicago for a workout on the eve of the draft.
</P>
<P>
Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as an
underclassman. He averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in his
final season at Duke, leading the Blue Devils into the NCAA
championship game.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Tab Francis with Second Pick in NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies
selected Steve Francis with the second pick in the NBA draft here
tonight, opting for a guard instead of a more-needed frontcourt
player.
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies appeared set at point guard after selecting Mike
Bibby second overall last year. Nevertheless they tabbed Francis,
who can play both guard positions, rather than Lamar Odom, a multi-
talented forward.
</P>
<P>
The Francis left Maryland after his junior season, when he
averaged 17.0 points, 4.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds and the Terps
to the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
Lightning-quick and an explosive leaper, Francis played
exclusively at shooting guard last season but does have the
ability to play both backcourt positions. He played point guard in
high school and junior college.
</P>
<P>
The Grizzlies won just eight games this season and entertained
offers for the pick, finding nothing overwhelming. The Miami Heat
wanted the pick to select Odom but offered only forward P.J. Brown
and the 25th overall pick.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Have to Take a Grueling Travel Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Russian teams
have been complaining about a grueling travel shedule, claiming
the scheduling of the tournament favored the United States.
</P>
<P>
If China makes it to the final, the team will have traveled 12,
673 miles and weathered four cross-country trips.
</P>
<P>
"It is the cruelest schedule we have ever experienced, " said
Ma Yuanan, Chinese head coach. "It is very, very tough. The first
two cross-country trips have cost us a lot and our players are
feeling very tired."
</P>
<P>
China is in Group D with Sweden, and faces Russia in the
quarterfinal tonight in San Jose. If China go through to the
semifinal, they'll have to fly back to Boston tomorrow for the
game on June 4.
</P>
<P>
If they make it through the final, another cross-country trip
will be required. The final is being held in the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, California
</P>
<P>
Russia started in Foxboro, Mass., then traveled to Portland,
Ore. From there it was on to Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and
Wednesday the Russians were in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Norway, another favorite, will have to cover 9,471 miles and
make three cross-country trips.
</P>
<P>
The United States, by comparison, will only need to travel 5,
498 miles and made only one cross-country trip. That is for the
final on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee president Marla Messing said the Women's
World Cup had met FIFA demands about the travel requirements "to
the extent feasible."
</P>
<P>
"I think on the whole, in the context of the event taking place
in the United States, the travel schedule is fair," she said.

<HEADLINE> North Ireland Peace Talks Continue Despite Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's peace talks are
continuing despite the passing of the Wednesday midnight "absolute
" deadline set by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, without any
sign of a breakthrough on the issue of guerrilla disarmament which
has paralyzed the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
North Ireland's main Protestant leader David Trimble, head of
the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), charged the Irish Republican Army
's political wing Sinn Fein had not offered anything to break the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any concrete proposals," the Reuters news
agency quoted Trimble as telling reporters an hour before the
deadline expired.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made an eleventh hour
impassioned plea to look to the future but insisted there would be
no immediate handover of guerrilla arms. He warned that the peace
talks could collapse unless agreement was reached between the pro-
Irish Sinn Fein and the pro-British Unionists over guerrilla arms
and the setting up of a power-sharing executive for the province.
</P>
<P>
"Prior decommissioning is not achievable," Adams said, "It is
whether we move forward, based on jumping together into the future
or go lurching back into the past."
</P>
<P>
Throughout Wednesday, Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, his co-broker at the talks, put pressure on Sinn Fein and
the Unionists to shift ground so they could reach a compromise,
sources close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
Unionists want Sinn Fein to give a clear guarantee that IRA
arms will be handed over and refuse to share power with the
republicans until this happens, but Sinn Fein says it has no
authority to make pledges on behalf of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Failure to break the deadlock was widely considered to fuel a
political vacuum at time of tension across the province as the
climax nears of the traditionally volatile Protestant "marching
season" to celebrate historic battlefield victories over Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Select Lamor Odom with Fourth Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Clippers would
let Lamar Odom drop no further, taking the multi-talented forward
fourth overall in the 1999 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
Odom has skills that fit four positions but hurt his stock with
a series of inexplicable moves, including failing to show up for
his physical examination and trying to re-enter Rhode Island after
hiring and firing an agent. He could have been the top pick in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
Odom declared for the NBA draft on the last possible day,
forgoing his final two years of eligibility. He is a rare talent,
a player with size who can play on the wing.
</P>
<P>
Odom averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists in his
only collegiate season, leading the Rams to the NCAA Tournament.
He shot 48.2 percent from the field but only 33 percent from 3-
point range and committed nearly as many turnovers as assists.
</P>
<P>
As an NBA player, his flexibility can be used at either
shooting guard or small forward will be his biggest asset.

<HEADLINE> UNCHR Envoy Calls for Halt to Attacks Against Minorities in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- UNCHR Special Envoy Dennis McNamara
Wednesday called on the returned refugees in Kosovo to stop
attacking the Serb and Gypsy population in Kosovo, the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency (ATA) reported.
</P>
<P>
ATA quoted the UNCHR (U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees)
office in Tirana as saying that McNamara indicated that there were
"reports of threats and violent attacks against the Serb and Gypsy
minorities in Kosovo" during the past two weeks and the envoy
requested these actions should end.
</P>
<P>
McNamara also urged the international peace keeping forces in
Kosovo to take security measures to protect the minority
population in Kosovo according to the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1244, ATA said.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said many returned Albanian refugees wantonly
plundered the property of the Serb and other minorities in Kosovo
and burned their houses as soon as they came back. As the disarmed
Kosovo Liberation Army backs them up, the ethnic Albanians have
nothing more to fear and hundreds of thousands of Serbs have fled
Kosovo for fear of revenge by ethnic Albanians, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Factions Sign Declaration on Common Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Rival factions of East Timor ended
their second-round dialogue here on Wednesday night, signing a
declaration on common principles, including a call on UNAMET (U.N.
Mission in East Timor) to be neutral.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was signed by 30 representatives of the
pro-integration camp and 30 others of pro-independence camp, as
well as by Dili Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, Baucau Bishop
Basilio do Nascimento and U.N. representative Tamrat Samuel.
</P>
<P>
The 16-point declaration dealt with four major matters:
politics, security, reconciliation and the popular consultation on
wide-ranging autonomy status scheduled to be held by the end of
August this year.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the Indonesian Police Force was the only
authority responsible for security and public order during the
entire popular consultation process, in accordance with the
agreement on May 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The May 5 agreement was reached in the tripartite meeting
between Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the U.N.
Secretary General in New York. It called for the holding of a
direct ballot as the final solution to the East Timor problem,
while the Indonesian Police would take the responsibility of
maintaining security and order.
</P>
<P>
The ballot would allow about 800,000 East Timorese people to
determine their own future by choosing whether they accept the
wide-ranging autonomy status as offered by Jakarta, or to be
separated from Indonesia to become an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration agreed to respect the bilateral agreement
signed here on June 18 on disarming the two factions. The
declaration also said both factions agreed to respect the outcome
of the U.N. administered popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the conference participants urged the
Indonesian Armed Forces to be neutral throughout the process of
the popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
The rival factions also urged the UNAMET to maintain its
neutrality throughout the process of the popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET has been criticized by several sides, especially by the
pro-integration camp, that it takes sides in carrying out its
duties in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Jailed rebel leader Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao said that
during the three-day meeting, its 60 participants did their best
to produce a compromise between the East Timorese people and the
Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
The positive contribution the two rival camps had made to the
church-organized conference was an assurance that they were aware
of their responsibility and that they respected the rights of East
Timorese, Gusmao was quoted by Antara News Agency Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador-at-Large Lopez da Cruz, who headed the
pro-integration camp during the meeting, said it was a beginning
of a long-term reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that before, during and after the August
direct ballot, the situation in East Timor would remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Tamrat Samuel said the meeting was the first real gathering of
leaders of the two conflicting factions. They had shown their
commitment to reconciliation despite the fact that none of the
conference participants were expecting reconciliation to be
achieved overnight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman for the talks Father Domingos Sequeira
said despite a good atmosphere around the negotiating table, deep
divisions remain between the rival factions.
</P>
<P>
"On the last day of talks, delegates from pro-integration and
pro-independence groups refined a statement of the basic ideas
they can agree on, but could find little common ground on
(establishing) a joint committee for the implementation of these
ideas," he was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the most significant achievement of the conference was
an agreement in principle to respect the June 18 agreement on the
disarmament of rival factions.
</P>
<P>
The second-round meeting was a continuation of a successful
church-sponsored conference held in Dare village, west of Dili,
capital of East Timor, in September last year.
</P>
<P>
In the talks last year, the rival factions agreed to recognize
their differing views and refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor had been under Portuguese colonial rule for more
than 400 years. It was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations, which still considers
Portugal as the administering power of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Ministers, MPs Banned From Traveling Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has banned cabinet ministers and parliamentarians from
foreign traveling till December 31, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that any minister or parliamentarian who
needs to go abroad for official purposes should obtain her special
consent, the Sinhalese Island newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga is reported to have made this announcement at a
cabinet meeting held Wednesday at her official residence "Temple
Trees".
</P>
<P>
While no official reason has been given for this decision,
informed sources said that the government is likely to put forward
national elections due in August and November next year.
</P>
<P>
At an executive committee meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party, the ruling coalition's major partner, it was decided that

<HEADLINE> Farmers End Protest After Agreement With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The farmers in Croatia ended their
five-day protest on Wednesday after the government agreed to
protect the farmers' interests, local TV reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached between the two sides, the
Croatian government and the farmers union will design a formula to
protect the domestic agricultural production in keeping with the
principles of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also establish a mixed committee to oversee
the issue of state debts owed to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The price of the wheat will be more rational and will be more
than one kuna per kilogram this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was reached, the farmers' union announced
that the farmers will stop their protest and all the road blocks
will be removed within eight hours.
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,000-15,000 farmers, who started their protests
last Saturday, blocked the roads with tractors and trucks in seven
of 21 prefectures to press for a dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the government ban the import of
agricultural products until surplus domestic products are
purchased. Besides they demanded that government pay back the
money owned to them and raise the wheat price from 1.1 kuna to 1.
32 kuna per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the farmers' union held a talk with the government,
but the two sides failed to reach an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Zones Play Important Role in Vietnamese Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial zones (IZs) and
export processing zones (EPZs) produced goods worth a total of 1.2
billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 20 percent of the nation's industrial
output, English daily Vietnam News Thursday quoted Vietnam's
national management board for IZs and EPZs as saying.
</P>
<P>
These zones achieved a combined export value of 800 million
U.S. dollars, 16 percent of the national total export value.
</P>
<P>
There are 66 IZs, EPZs and high technology zones in 27
Vietnamese provinces and cities, of which 13 are in the north
Vietnam, 13 in the central region and the remainder in the south
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 76 projects capitalized at a
total of more than 300 million U.S. dollars have been licensed to
operate in these zones. Of these, 36 are foreign-invested with
capital totaling 236 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the total number of operational projects in
Vietnam's IZs and EPZs to 732 with a combined investment of 6.8
billion U.S. dollars. More than 40 percent of these projects'
registered capital has been disbursed.
