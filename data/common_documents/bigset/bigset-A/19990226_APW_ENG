<HEADLINE>  Stocks Fall; Dow Down 45.91 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes were lower this afternoon, led by  
a selloff in technology shares, after Compaq Computer's warning of 
soft sales raised concerns of slowdown in the computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 45.91 at 9,320.43, expanding Thursday's 33.33-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 14.06 at 1,230.96, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 41.85 at 2,283.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer, the world's biggest maker of PCs, warned  
analysts that sales in its small- and medium- business market have 
slowed this quarter. That prompted Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse 
First Boston to cut its first-quarter earnings projection for 
Compaq, which sent the stock down 5 11/16 to 35 5/16 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-makers, including IBM, Gateway and Dell Computer,  
also fell sharply today on concerns that their sales may also slow 
in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lower in the technology sector was Intel, which fell  
sharply after PC Data reported that Advanced Micro Devices AMD-K6 
processor-based computers outsold all Intel-based desktop PCs in 
the U.S. retail market. It was the first time that Intel fell out 
of the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was down 8 3/16 at 119 5/8 in Nasdaq trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The stock market also came under pressure today after the  
Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 
faster-than-expected 6.1 percent annual rate in the final three 
months of 1998, the quickest pace in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of  
goods and services, had been originally reported at 5.6 percent for 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report showed the economy growing at a faster pace  
than expected, it also showed that inflation rose just 1 percent 
last year, the slowest pace since a 0.9 percent rise in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	That boosted bond prices, which have tumbled the last three days  
on worries that the Fed might boost interest rates to keep 
inflation in check. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 
$13.43 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, which moves opposite 
the price, fell to 5.55 percent from 5.65 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market and stock market are watching different parts  
of the report,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest 
Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is looking at strong economic growth and  
thinking there may be rising interest rates,'' he said. ``Bonds are 
looking at the low inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 591.22 million 
shares, off slightly from Thursday's pace.

	US Gives Colombia Drug Ally Status  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The United States on Friday fully  
certified Colombia -- by far the world's No. 1 cocaine producer -- as 
an ally in the war on drugs. The decision is a crucial vote of 
confidence in President Andres Pastrana's young government, his 
foreign minister said. Guillermo Fernandez de Soto said the nation 
would not fail in its efforts to fight drug trafficking ``so that 
Colombia can never again be treated by the community of nations as 
if it were a pariah.'' President Clinton also certified Mexico 
Friday as a fully cooperating partner with U.S. counternarcotics 
efforts. 

</P>
<P>
	Gains Cited in Drug War  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and allied countries made  
``solid gains'' in efforts to control narcotics trafficking in 
1998, the State Department said Friday, citing progress in crop 
reduction, drug interdiction and other areas. In its annual report 
on the illicit drug trade worldwide, the department said the most 
encouraging development in 1998 was the continued downward trend in 
illicit coca cultivation. The State Department study said overall 
coca cultivation in the Andean countries fell 17 percent to 471,000 
acres last year. The most dramatic decline was in Peru, once the 
world's largest coca producer, the report said. 

</P>
<P>
	Serb Border Police Detain Monitors  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb border police detained  
diplomatic observers and forcibly searched their cars in an 
incident the chief monitor called ``ominous.'' Police told the 
monitors they were ``suspicious'' about the contents of the 
vehicles. William Walker, head of Kosovo monitors for the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said a 
cease-fire between Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian forces was 
``non-existent'' despite NATO warnings for both sides to abstain 
from violence during a 2 1/2-week suspension of peace talks. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraq Contacts U.N. Weapons Panel  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq has contacted an expert panel that is  
exploring ways to restart U.N. weapons inspections, the panel's 
chairman said Friday. The Iraqi government invited the chairman, 
Brazilian U.N. Ambassador Celso Amorim, to visit Baghdad. The 
disarmament panel is holding its first meeting this week and will 
initially assess the state of the eight-year U.N. effort to rid 
Iraq of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range 
missiles. 

</P>
<P>
	Libya Suspect Deadline Extended  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Britain gave Libya  
one more month to turn over two suspects for trial in the 1988 Pan 
Am Lockerbie bombing. British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said 
London and Washington were willing to allow another month for the 
handover because Secretary-General Kofi Annan had expressed 
``cautious optimism'' that his diplomatic efforts might succeed. 

</P>
<P>
	China Criticized on Human Rights  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's human rights record deteriorated  
sharply late last year with a crackdown on political dissent that 
reversed recent signs of improvement, the Clinton administration 
said Friday. The administration's critical assessment of China's 
human rights performance came on the eve of Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright's departure for Beijing and a day after the 
Senate urged the administration to push for a resolution condemning 
China at the U.N. Human Rights Commission's meeting next month in 
Geneva.

	Dow Ends Down 59.76  
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell for the fourth day in a row.  
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 59.76 at 9,306.58. On 
the NYSE, losers led gainers 1,511-1,458. The Nasdaq composite 
index fell 38.81 to 2,288.01.

	Pistons Edge Heat 95-93  
</P>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Bison Dele's dunk with 2.7 seconds  
gave the Detroit Pistons a 95-93 victory over Miami on Friday 
night, ending the Heat's seven-game winning streak. Dele rolled off 
a screen, took a pass from Grant Hill and drove for the open dunk. 
Miami rushed back down the court, but Terry Porter's 25-footer 
bounced off the rim at the buzzer. Miami hadn't lost since falling 
108-101 in Boston on Feb. 9. Hill led Detroit with 22 points and 10 
rebounds, while Joe Dumars added 21. Alonzo Mourning led the Heat 
with 29 points.

	Rodman Makes His Debut With Lakers  
</P>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, the purple and gold in  
his hair complementing his Los Angeles Lakers new outfit, got a 
brief standing ovation when he entered Friday night's game against 
the Los Angeles Clippers at the Forum. He replaced Travis Knight at 
forward midway through the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> 4th Day of Violence in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Soldiers fired in the air today to  
disperse rioters who were burning houses in a fourth day of 
religious violence in an Indonesian town. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 24 people have died in the violence between Christian  
and Muslim gangs this week in and around the city of Ambon, the 
capital of Maluku province, and thousands of refugees have fled on 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian mobs threw stones at the homes of Muslim government  
officials today and set fire to several houses. Police dispersed 
the crowd with volleys of gunfire into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In another part of Ambon, about 1,000 people protested  
peacefully outside the police headquarters to protest officers' 
shooting of gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3,500 Muslims took shelter in a city mosque after their  
homes were burned down or wrecked in the riots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing now,'' said one refugee, Rahma Suli, 37.  
</P>
<P>
	At the height of the Ambon fighting this week, mobs battled each  
other with swords, bows and arrows and gasoline bombs. Soldiers 
fired on the rioters repeatedly in an attempt to disperse them. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 150 people have died in rioting on several Maluku  
islands this year. In riots last month, more than 3,300 houses and 
two dozen churches and mosques were burned. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S.-based human rights group warned that the violence could  
increase ``polarization'' ahead of June parliamentary elections in 
the predominantly Muslim nation of 210 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The deepening divisions could result in ``channeling political  
debate into communal issues,'' Human Rights Watch said in a 
statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections are expected to be the fairest in more than four  
decades, and follow the ouster last year of authoritarian President 
Suharto. However, there are fears of violence between rival 
political factions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambon is 1,400 miles east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian-controlled territory of East Timor, meanwhile,  
continues to see tensions between pro-independence factions and 
their opponents. Some 500 East Timorese marched with anti-violence 
banners today in Dili, 1,250 miles east of Jakarta, as they buried 
a pro-independence activist killed by Indonesian soldiers on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another separatist and a soldier were killed the same day, all  
in separate incidents in tensions that have swelled since Indonesia 
said it could give independence to the territory, held since 1975.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky will be sidelined for two weeks  
with a neck injury, breaking a 223-game consecutive game streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Gretzky has not missed a game in his three  
seasons with the New York Rangers. He first complained about neck 
pains after a January game in Washington and was later knocked to 
the ice against Carolina and complained about his back. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he missed practice, saying he was unable to grip  
his stick because of pains in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent an MRI Thursday and the Rangers announced Friday  
that he will miss two weeks. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake To Tone Down IOC Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city that gave the Olympics ski vacations,  
knee replacements, college scholarships and pocketfuls of cash 
wants to tone down the perks IOC members get during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee is prepared to renegotiate  
the millions of dollars it spends on ``pomp and ceremony'' 
surrounding International Olympic Committee delegates when they 
come in 2002, SLOC chairman Robert Garff said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff would not identify areas where SLOC might try to cut back  
and said ``cultural exchanges'' such as the opening and closing 
ceremonies would not be touched. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that, in light of the Olympic bribery scandal that  
erupted from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, it 
was proper that the public expect some changes in the often lavish 
treatment of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City in general is a very conservative community,''  
Garff said. ``We have a lot of wealthy people driving Chevrolets. 
We don't wear our wealth on our sleeves. That's just part of who we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all Olympic cities, Salt Lake signed a contract with the  
IOC that, among other things, promises certain standards of 
hospitality for the committee's 100-plus members during their stay 
at the games, including quality hotel rooms and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	While that contract is secret, SLOC board member Ken Bullock has  
estimated that the pricetag for keeping the committee comfortable 
comes to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff, speaking after addressing the International Radio and  
Television Society Foundation, said SLOC recognized its obligation 
to the IOC but would not hesitate to try to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the franchisee, they are the franchisor,'' he said.  
``We do have a budget with relation to protocol. But that budget is 
a living document that changes with time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the process of talking with them about a number of  
things that we believe will help return the spotlight to sports and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the opening ceremonies, which attract an  
international television audience of some 3 billion, and similar 
cultural showcases should not be touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a big part of the Olympic moment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's Olympic moment for the last three months has focused  
on the worst corruption case in games history. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expeled, and a Salt Lake  
ethics panel said 24 delegates benefited from $1.2 million in cash, 
scholarships, travel, medical expenses and other improper 
inducements from Utah bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it came to that vote, the bid managers decided they  
weren't going to lose this one,'' Garff told the society's monthly 
``Newsmaker'' luncheon. ``They became overzealous and, while the 
board had given them approval to use Plan A, they instituted Plan 
B. There needed to be better oversight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garff, SLOC's new chief executive Mitt Romney and senior vice  
president of communications Shelley Thomas said the committee had 
acted quickly and strongly to deal with the scandal and get back on 
the road to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of selecting Olympic cities needs changing,''  
Garff said. ``We hope we will be a catalyst for change.''

	Sen. Kerry Won't Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts announced today  
he will skip the 2000 presidential race. The three-term Democratic 
senator cited fund-raising concerns and party unity as major 
factors in his decision not to run. ``I have concluded that to 
raise the necessary amount of money with only 10 months to do so, 
compounded by the newly accelerated primary schedule, is simply 
impossible at this time,'' he said. Kerry also said that pulling 
out of the race could help Vice President Al Gore win the 
Democratic nomination and ``may be more helpful to our party's 
efforts.''

	Clinton Outlines Foreign Policy

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton today outlined a foreign  
policy of active involvement overseas -- from China to Kosovo -- for 
the final two years of his administration, saying Americans ``must 
embrace the inexorable logic of globalization.'' He also offered a 
defense of China on the same day that the State Department reported 
a sharp erosion of human rights in that country. Aides billed the 
president's speech to California business and policy leaders as a 
major address laying out his goals for the remainder of his term. 
The president has faced criticism over the continued standoff with 
Iraq and the peace talks on Kosovo.

	Clinton OKs Mexico on Drugs  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he is  
certifying Mexico as a fully cooperating partner in the fight 
against drug trafficking. ``Mexico is cooperating with us in the 
battle for our lives,'' Clinton said. The announcement set up a 
potential battle with Republicans in Congress who cite Mexico's 
drop in narcotics seizures and disappointing record of extraditions 
in arguing for sanctions against America's southern neighbor. But 
in a foreign policy address to California business leaders, Clinton 
credited Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he was ``working 
hard to tackle the corruption traffickers headlong.''

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Marine Capt. Richard Ashby testified  
today at his court-martial about how his jet struck an Italian ski 
gondola cable, killing 20 people. ``Mistakes were made on this 
flight -- and any flight, any mission you fly, mistakes are made,'' 
he said. ``We never intentionally did anything outside the scope of 
this mission, which was to try to maintain 1,000 feet'' and use 
terrain features to practice avoiding enemy radar. The Mount Cermis 
ski lift accident occurred Feb. 3, 1998.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western peace monitors were blocked  
from entering Kosovo today by Yugoslav border police. The 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said 21 
monitors were kept out for a second-straight day until their cars 
and luggage were searched. The monitors refused to be searched, 
invoking diplomatic immunity. It's the latest confrontation 
involving the monitors, whom Serbs accuse of supporting ethnic 
Albanian rebels fighting for the independence of Kosovo.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the global financial crisis, the U.S.  
economy grew at a sizzling 6.1 percent annual rate in the final 
three months of 1998, the fastest pace in nearly 15 years. The 
Commerce Department reported today on the gross domestic product, 
the nation's total output of goods and services. On Wall Street, 
investors worried that unless there is a slowdown soon, the Federal 
Reserve will start raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigars, which scientists say are just as  
deadly as cigarettes, should carry similar health warning labels, 
the Department of Health and Human Services recommended today. The 
inspector general also released a report today from a series of 
focus groups with young people about cigar use. It found more than 
a third of the teen-agers in the groups admitted having smoked a 
cigar in the past month.

<HEADLINE> Kerr McGee-Oryx Energy Merger OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Shareholders of Kerr-McGee Corp. and Oryx  
Energy Co. on Friday approved the merger of the two energy 
companies, a deal that will mean the loss of about 500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the combined oil and gas workforce will be  
reduced as a result of the merger, which will create the country's 
fourth-largest independent energy exploration and production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Schramm, spokeswoman for Kerr-McGee, said the two  
companies had about 1,300 employees in oil and gas in November. The 
count will be reduced to between 775 and 800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will retain the Kerr-McGee Corp. name and its  
headquarters will stay in Oklahoma City. Following the merger, 
about 3,550 people will be employed by Kerr-McGee overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company's board of directors will include the nine  
directors from Kerr-McGee and five new members from the former Oryx 
board.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Fashionably Late for Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- He's been traveling the world since last  
season ended and now Sammy Sosa is taking his time getting to the 
Chicago Cubs spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's not really late. Under the collective bargaining  
agreement, players don't have to report until Monday, and that's 
when the National League MVP is scheduled to show up at Fitch Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he'll be fashionably tardy. The rest of his teammates,  
except Manny Alexander with visa problems, had their first 
full-squad workout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said  
Friday. ``Sammy knows what it takes to get ready. He's had a very 
busy winter trying to rebuild his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an issue for me or (manager) Jim Riggleman.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has raised funds for hurricane relief in his native  
Dominican Republic. He's also been feted at a parade in New York, 
played with a touring team in Japan, helped light the national 
Christmas tree, attended the State of the Union address and picked 
up an ESPY Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was also a late arrival last year when the Cubs made some  
major changes following a 68-win season. This spring they're coming 
off 90 victories and a trip to the playoffs, thanks to Sosa's 
season, which also included 158 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sammy was three days late last year and he hit 66 home runs,  
so he gets to miss a week,'' joked first baseman Mark Grace. ``He's 
always a couple days later. It's not a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman insisted the Cubs aren't worried about Sosa's rigorous  
off-season schedule affecting his performance on the field. Reports 
say Sosa has been working out for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was more concerned than I am now because we  
brought in so many new players from different organizations,'' 
Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real professional group. What Sammy accomplished I  
think it's understood that he'll be ready plenty early. Sammy's got 
four children at home and as much running as he's been asked to do, 
I don't begrudge him a bit for not being here.''

<HEADLINE>  China Criticized on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's human rights record deteriorated  
sharply late last year with a crackdown on political dissent that 
reversed recent signs of improvement, the Clinton administration 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's critical assessment of China's human rights  
performance came on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright's departure for Beijing and a day after the Senate urged 
the administration to push for a resolution condemning China at the 
U.N. Human Rights Commission's meeting next month in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a speech in San Francisco, defended his  
policy of promoting ties with China. But he said China will come to 
understand, sooner or later, that it ``simply cannot purchase 
stability at the expense of freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They remain unwilling to open up their political system, to  
give people a peaceful outlet for dissent,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration still has not announced a decision on whether  
it will push for the human rights resolution condemning China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're considering what our approach would be,'' Assistant  
Secretary of State Harold Koh told a House panel. He suggested that 
Albright might give an indication of the U.S. decision next week 
while she is in China. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report to Congress on human rights worldwide, the  
State Department said China's loosening of restrictions on 
political debate and activism in 1997 and most of 1998 ended 
abruptly last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	During President Clinton's visit to Beijing last June, the  
Chinese people for the first time witnessed on live television and 
heard on radio uncensored comments and debate on formerly taboo 
issues such as human rights abuses, the crushing of the 
pro-democracy turnout at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	Books on Clinton's visit were published later and newspapers  
expanded their reports on corruption and legal reform. 
</P>
<P>
	But this trend was halted and China went into reverse on human  
rights beginning in November while all along continuing ``to commit 
widespread and well-documented human rights abuses'' that defied 
international norms, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The human rights report also criticized:  
</P>
<P>
	--Serbia, for its ``brutal crackdown'' on civilians and  
separatist insurgents in Kosovo, and Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic for using the military, police, judiciary and 
state-controlled media to strangle dissent throughout Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mexico, where it said police regularly obtain confessions from  
suspects through torture and the information is used in court. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turkey, where it said serious human rights abuses, including  
killings and torture, continued despite the promises of 
then-Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz that human rights would be 
his government's highest priority in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	--Israel, where the report found a significant reduction in the  
scope of human rights abuses against Palestinians on the West Bank 
and in Gaza. At the same time, the report said, ``Israeli security 
forces abused Palestinians suspected of security offenses. The 
government continues to detain without charge numerous 
Palestinians, some of them for lengthy periods, although the number 
has decreased significantly during the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In China, the department found besides killings, torture of  
prisoners, forced confessions and other practices of an 
authoritarian state, officials in November began to impose new 
regulations on the Internet, the publishing industry and social 
organizations, closed several newspapers and barred politically 
sensitive publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious groups experienced interference and repression even as  
the number of adherents in many churches continued to grow at a 
rapid pace, according to the report sent to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying on Capitol Hill, Koh, the assistant secretary of  
state for human rights, said the report showed that ``the world 
still has a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration was keenly aware of congressional  
support for a resolution criticizing China at the U.N. gathering, 
taking note of Thursday's 99-0 Senate vote in favor of such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., chairman of the House  
International Relations Committee's subcommittee on human rights, 
said the report shows ``it's been another bad year for human 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told Koh that the administration should not only sponsor the  
resolution in Geneva on China, but should actively promote it among 
other countries. He said he knew China would heavily lean on 
developing nations to vote against such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a priority decision for the administration,'' replied  
Koh. ``I don't think we pull any punches on China'' in the report. 
``We tell it like it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright last month voiced strong disapproval of China's  
crackdown on pro-democracy activists while saying the 
administration must seek cooperation with China. With its veto 
power, China can block the United States on several fronts in the 
U.N. Security Council, including economic punishment of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the administration found that Egypt's security forces  
tortured and mistreated citizens. The military junta in Burma, it 
said, targeted all forms of dissent; and in Cuba, despite the visit 
of Pope John Paul II in early 1998, the Castro government continued 
to exercise control over all aspects of Cuban life ``and to 
suppress ruthlessly all forms of political dissent.''. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iraq, the regime of Saddam Hussein ``continued its brutal  
campaign'' of executing perceived political opponents and leaders 
in the Shiite Muslim community. Syria quashed all organized 
political opposition and dissent. In Iran, the report said, a 
movement toward greater political openness was hampered by 
factional struggle and occasionally violent tactics by hard-liners.

<HEADLINE> John Sargent's Drawings on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Singer Sargent was just under 5 years old  
when he did his first recorded portrait. He went on to do hundreds 
of them and become the most famous American portraitist of the 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was engaged in writing to you,'' Dr. FitzWilliam  
Sargent said in a letter shortly before his son's birthday, ``John 
has had the impertinence to take my portrait, which I enclose, 
thinking you will prize it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-six of Sargent's drawings and two watercolors are now  
gathered in a show called ``Sketch Everything and Keep Your 
Curiosity Fresh.'' That first sketch as a boy is not included -- 
curators would like to show it, but say they don't know where to 
find it. 
</P>
<P>
	The title of the exhibit, which opened this month at the  
Corcoran Gallery of Art, is a bit of advice from the artist. The 
exhibit of sketches is running roughly at the same time as a major 
exhibit of Sargent's work at the National Gallery of Art -- 
including many of his most famous portraits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent did many watercolors and especially liked scenes in  
Venice, one of which is in the Corcoran show. A biographer has 
counted more than 600 portraits he did in his career, but more than 
2,500 other pictures -- landscapes, still lifes, cityscapes and 
canalscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The last 30 years of his life were devoted in large part to  
murals for the Boston Public Library, the Boston Museum of Fine 
Arts and the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the drawings in the Corcoran exhibit are studies for  
these murals, which are less known than his portraits. But Sargent 
was quoted as saying that his work in the public library -- the 
``Triumph of Religion'' -- was his most significant. Bostonians 
sometimes call these murals, now due for cleaning and restoration, 
``the Sistine Chapel of the West.''

<HEADLINE> Brits May Help BMW With Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is in talks  
with the British government for financial assistance to revive its 
Rover division, but declined to comment on a report its is seeking 
at least $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW spokesman Uwe Mahla said Friday the talks are intense and  
that aid will be crucial in deciding whether BMW will relocate 
Rover production outside Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, BMW said it was eyeing Hungary as an  
alternative location. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported Friday that BMW is seeking public  
aid of between $240 million and $320 million to keep the troubled 
Rover plant at Longbridge, near Birmingham, in operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based newspaper also said BMW is expected to announce  
at the Geneva Motor Show in early March a $2.7 billion project to 
replace Rover's 200 and 400 models. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahla declined to comment on the report and repeated previous  
company statements that it is still considering whether to build a 
medium-sized car to compete with the Volkswagen Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahla said, however, that the Longbridge plant has priority if  
the company decides to build a new Rover, stressing again that the 
decision depends on subsidies from the British government. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied that BMW would take another auto company in as a  
partner for such a project.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Front-Runner After Mo Vaughn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- It's Opening Day and Boston's new first  
baseman trots to the position once owned by Mo Vaughn. Chances are 
it will be Mike Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-catcher, as thoughtful with his comments as Vaughn was  
emotional, downplays the comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to replace Mo,'' says Stanley, who has inherited  
Vaughn's locker at the Red Sox spring training complex. ``I was on 
the team last year at the end of the year. I wasn't signed in the 
offseason to replace him. In a way, that's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .337, his fifth straight season at .300 or better,  
and leading the team with 40 homers, Vaughn signed with Anaheim. 
Other free agent first basemen Rafael Palmeiro and Will Clark 
didn't sign with the Red Sox, and Boston's interest in Chicago's 
Frank Thomas hasn't resulted in a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox have two other first base candidates, but Jose  
Offerman was Kansas City's second baseman the past two seasons and 
could play there or designated hitter, and Reggie Jefferson is 
returning from back problems and can't field as well as Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	While manager Jimy Williams remains noncommittal, Stanley,  
entering his 14th major-league season, has the inside track on 
Vaughn's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I'm playing the position that he was playing last  
year that doesn't mean I've got to do what he does,'' Stanley said. 
``This team went to the playoffs last year. If we could each push 
each other to drive in 10 or 15 more runs apiece or hit five more 
home runs, we'll be able to make up for what Mo did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, the Red Sox might not lose much.  
</P>
<P>
	``He made the transition from being a catcher to a very, very  
good first baseman,'' Williams said of Stanley. ``He has good 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 35 games at first base last year with Toronto and Boston,  
Stanley made one error in 298 chances, a fielding percentage of 
.997. In 142 games, Vaughn made 12 errors in 1,277 chances, a .991 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley spent spring training last year preparing to be  
Toronto's first baseman in place of the injured Carlos Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really enjoying the idea of playing there quite a bit  
because Carlos wasn't supposed to come back until June,'' Stanley 
said. ``Then it was May. Next thing you know, it was two weeks into 
April, so it was hard to let that go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he's not the hitting threat Vaughn is, Stanley has power.  
In 145 games last season, he had a career-high 29 homers with 79 
RBIs and hit .256. After being obtained from Toronto on July 30, he 
had seven homers, 32 RBIs and a .288 average in 47 games with 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	In six years as a part-time player with Texas and one with the  
New York Yankees, Stanley was a mediocre hitter. After hitting .249 
for three consecutive seasons, he hit. 305 with 26 homers in 1993 
for the Yankees. He followed that in 1994 with 17 homers and a .300 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	In 218 games with Boston in 1996 and 1997, he hit 37 homers  
before being traded back to New York. He's hit .280 over the last 
six seasons with an average of 22 homers and thinks he can improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove in 79 last year. I think I can drive in more runs than  
that,'' Stanley said. ``Nobody in here had tremendous years, other 
than Nomar (Garciaparra) and Mo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox might miss Vaughn's leadership as much as his bat,  
but the 35-year-old Stanley can fill some of the void, although his 
style is different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings quiet leadership,'' Williams said. ``There are times  
when he'll stand up and make some statements. Because he's not 
trying to make those statements all the time, when he does, I think 
an awful lot of people, myself included, take notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley likes the low-key approach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem saying something but I'm not as vocal as  
Mo,'' Stanley said. ``I wouldn't yell and scream and rant and rave 
like he did to get the players' attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, Stanley just wants to slip quietly into the position  
occupied by Vaughn for the last eight seasons. Besides, he's used 
to being touted as a replacement for an outstanding player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when I signed with Toronto, I was supposed to take  
Joe Carter's place,'' Stanley said. ``I said, `Wait a minute, this 
guy's a World Series hero.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfair to a player to say you've got to do what  
this guy did.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Down; Dow Off 59.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes fell today, led by a selloff in  
technology shares, after Compaq Computer's warning of soft sales 
raised concerns of slowdown in the computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 59.76 at 9,306.58, expanding Thursday's 
33.33-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 declined 6.69 to 1,238.33, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 38.81 to 2.288.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,511 to 1,458 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 566 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 762.85 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
737.17 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.97 to 586.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.82 to 698.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.33 to 392.36.  
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer, the world's biggest maker of personal  
computers, warned analysts that sales in its small- and medium- 
business market have slowed this quarter. That prompted Merrill 
Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston to cut its first-quarter 
earnings projection for Compaq, whose shares were down nearly 6 
points on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-makers, including IBM, Gateway and Dell Computer,  
also fell sharply today on concerns that their sales may also slow 
in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also lower in the technology sector was Intel, which fell  
sharply after PC Data reported that Advanced Micro Devices AMD-K6 
processor-based computers outsold all Intel-based desktop PCs in 
the U.S. retail market. It was the first time that Intel fell out 
of the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was down more than 8 points in Nasdaq trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The stock market also came under pressure today after the  
Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 
faster-than-expected 6.1 percent annual rate in the final three 
months of 1998, the quickest pace in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of  
goods and services, had been originally reported at 5.6 percent for 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report showed the economy growing at a faster pace  
than expected, it also showed that inflation rose just 1 percent 
last year, the slowest pace since a 0.9 percent rise in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	That boosted bond prices, which have tumbled the last three days  
on worries that the Fed might boost interest rates to keep 
inflation in check. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up a 
little more than $10 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, which 
moves opposite the price, fell to 5.58 percent from 5.65 percent 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market and stock market are watching different parts  
of the report,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest 
Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is looking at strong economic growth and  
thinking there may be rising interest rates,'' he said. ``Bonds are 
looking at the low inflation.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Sentenced in Ill. License Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal judge imposed prison terms on three  
defendants and house arrest on a fourth Friday in their plot to 
sell truck driver's licenses to pay for Gov. George Ryan's 
political fund-raising tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ann Mastrodomenico, former manager of the driver's license  
facility, was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of 
home confinement, scaled back from a possible 20-year sentence 
because she cooperated with prosecutors and has a sick father. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Suzanne Conlon brushed aside her claim that aides for  
Ryan, the former secretary of state who was elected governor in 
November, pressured her to sell $20,000 a year in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no evidence that Ms. Mastrodomenico's  
supervisor pressured her to extort money or take bribes,'' Conlon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck mechanic Mike Dobrosavljevich got 14 months in prison and  
two years of supervision, driving instructor Janusz Krzyzak got 10 
months in prison and two years of supervision and Carmen Fajdich, a 
retired state employee, got one year of home confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	The four pleaded guilty to charges that included racketeering,  
conspiracy for accepting bribes for the licenses, or recruiting 
those who paid the bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said licensing officials filled in the answers on  
written commercial driver's license exams for unqualified drivers 
who had paid bribes. Those drivers were then given permits 
indicating they had passed all necessary tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, trucking firms paid the bribes to assure that  
their applicants received proper licenses, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money taken as bribes had been used to pay for  
tickets to Ryan's fundraisers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar told reporters that the investigation  
is continuing but that Ryan is not a target. He would not give more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan had ordered as many as 3,000 truck drivers to be retested  
after the scandal became public.

<HEADLINE> US Ups Aid to Okla. Bombing Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department awarded an additional  
$342,086 Friday to assist victims and survivors of the 1995 
Oklahoma City federal building bombing, the most deadly terrorist 
attack in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotional and psychological impact of this horrendous  
crime has affected many people,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. 
``The effects of such a crime can last long after the last piece of 
rubble has been hauled away and a jury has sentenced a defendant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Office for Victims of Crime has now awarded a  
total of $841,000 to Project Heartland, which has been the 
principal mental health care provider for survivors and relatives 
of victims of the truck-bomb attack that killed 168 people and 
injured hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Heartland, which was created by the Oklahoma Department  
of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, ``has greatly 
contributed to the process of healing,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds have been used to pay for crisis counseling at  
the Safe Haven facilities in Oklahoma City and 650 miles away in 
Denver, where Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were tried and 
convicted in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal money also paid for travel and training for staff  
workers and volunteers working with the victims. Some family 
members of the victims traveled to Denver for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of programs, such as Project Heartland, are  
immeasurable,'' said Kathryn Turman, acting director of the victims 
of crime office. ``The tireless efforts of those individuals who 
are involved in these programs provide victims of crime with needed 
support at a most vulnerable time in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal office was established in 1984 to fund state victim  
assistance and compensation programs. The Crime Victims Fund, which 
is the source of the funds for Project Heartland, comes solely from 
fines and penalties assessed on federal criminal offenders, not 
from taxpayers. It supports 3,000 victim services agencies, 
including domestic violence shelters and programs to assist victims 
of child abuse and sexual assault and survivors of homicide 
victims.

<HEADLINE> Nonprofit Will Sell Ventura Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The company selling Jesse Ventura  
merchandise apparently will be allowed to operate as a private 
corporation instead of a political committee, meaning it won't have 
to report how it earns or spends money. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board plans to  
make a formal ruling next month after Friday's preliminary decision 
involving Ventura for Minnesota Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically blazing a new trail here,'' said company vice  
president David Olsen, who is also the Minnesota governor's 
personal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen said the nonprofit corporation was formed to protect the  
rights to Jesse Ventura's likeness and trademarked moniker ``The 
Body,'' and to raise money for educational and civic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the company has contracts for Ventura action figures,  
pants, T-shirts, baseball caps, key chains and refrigerator 
magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's campaign committee will continue to sell merchandise,  
too, with profits that could be used for a future political run. 
The committee is expected to buy from the nonprofit company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very strange thing. Nobody's ever seen anything  
quite like this,'' said Doug Freidline, president of Ventura for 
Minnesota Inc. and also the manager of the campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign disclosure board members said they were convinced that  
the company would not operate as a political committee. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schultz, president of Common Cause Minnesota, said he  
wants to make sure that the nonpolitical purpose is enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the general firewall they are trying to draw is a good  
one,'' Schultz said. ``If this money is going to go to charity and 
not for political purposes, then it sounds like a good decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura didn't seem to be clear on that when he spoke earlier  
this week to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., about the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the money will be donated to charitable cause. And  
we're hoping to get a ruling from ethics that we can use the rest 
of the money to finance a campaign,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen said he didn't know what Ventura was talking about, but  
that the company will not be able to contribute to any political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ventura action figure debuted earlier this month at the  
American International Toy Fair in New York. A Ventura doll was 
first seen in his campaign commercials last year, banging his fist 
on a desk and dismissing ``Evil Special Interest Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60,000 of the action figures have been ordered. The  
dolls are expected to be in stores in April, priced at $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Freidline said some of the money collected through the company  
may be used for public service announcements using the action 
figures to teach children about politics. Other money will be used 
to run the business and the rest will be donated to educational and 
civic programs.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Bennett, one of President Clinton's  
attorneys, will lead testimony at a Senate hearing Wednesday into 
whether Congress should renew the act that gave Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr his job. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Bennett's first appearance before a congressional  
panel on an issue connected to the Monica Lewinsky matter, and the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's second hearing into whether 
to renew the law, revise it or let it expire June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old law is widely disliked by members of both  
parties after independent counsel investigations of Republican and 
Democratic presidents. If Congress lets the law expire, as it did 
in 1992 before renewing it 18 months later, dozens of high-ranking 
government officials who now could be subject to an independent 
counsel probe would be investigated instead by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Also set to testify Wednesday before panel chaired by Sen. Fred  
Thompson, R-Tenn., is Theodore Olson, an assistant attorney general 
during the Reagan administration who was the target of an 
independent counsel; Nathan Lewin, former counsel to Attorney 
General Edwin Meese; Henry Ruth, leader of the Watergate special 
prosecution force; and Robert Fiske, former special prosecutor for 
the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno is to testify before the committee  
in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the House Subcommittee on Commercial and  
Administrative Law is set to open its own hearings on the law. The 
Justice Department has announced that Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder will testify there and may map out at least part of the 
administration's position.

<HEADLINE> HHS Recommends Cigar Warning Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigars are as deadly as cigarettes and widely  
used by teen-agers yet face virtually no federal regulation, 
government health officials said Friday, recommending a mandatory 
national warning label for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring health warnings on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  
but not cigars sends the wrong message, said Surgeon General David 
Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The absence of labels on cigars implies cigars are different  
and don't carry the same risk,'' Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top officials at the Health and Human Services Department hope  
the report by its inspector general will push another agency, the 
Federal Trade Commission, to require such warning labels. The FTC 
has been considering the matter since last April but has yet to 
announce a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has the power to require the labels on its own, although  
it plans to report to Congress on the issue this spring. Most boxes 
already include a label required under a settlement of a California 
court case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do you need another one?'' asked Norman Sharp, president  
of the Cigar Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics respond that the California labels are not strong enough  
or consistently used. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher has been urging the FTC to require labels for some time.  
``It's frustrating that we have not made more progress on this 
issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cigar smokers discount the health risks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I often think of them as producing less risk in terms of lung  
cancer than with cigarettes,'' said Michael Burnstein, 30, of New 
York City, who quit smoking cigarettes but still enjoys an 
occasional cigar. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery Kosma, 31, an attorney from Annandale, Va., also  
smokes a cigar every few weeks. He figures he and other smokers can 
evaluate the risks on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the upsurge (in cigar smoking) is people who are  
fairly well educated and don't need a paternalistic human service 
agency coming and telling them what to do and making them feel 
guilty for what they do,'' he said. ``It's like a nagging mother 
who is completely unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute last year reported that although  
cigar smokers inhale less smoke than cigarette smokers, cigars can 
be just as toxic because they contain up to 90 times as much of 
some carcinogenic elements as cigarettes. And with higher 
quantities of such toxins, cigars can create even more harmful 
secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Regular cigar smokers greatly increase their risk of mouth,  
throat and lung cancer, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher and others say a warning label alone will not do much  
unless it is part of a larger effort to shift cultural attitudes. 
He is now working on a public awareness campaign on the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, beyond labels, the inspector general's office  
recommended that Satcher develop an ``action plan'' for educating 
the public about cigars, which have enjoyed a renaissance in the 
1990s after years of public scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solution is cultural. It requires a change in our way of  
thinking about this,'' said George Grob, a deputy inspector general 
at the HHS who supervised the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general also released a second report based on a  
series of focus groups with young people: About one in five of the 
teen-agers in the groups acknowledged having smoked a cigar in the 
past month, and half the smokers said they planned to smoke again. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal to sell cigars to minors in all 50 states, but the  
inspector general found that state enforcement of these laws is 
uneven and generally not a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigar use appears to be increasing in popularity among  
teens,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Government surveys have found varied results on teen cigar use:  
One, in 1997, found 22 percent of high school students saying they 
have smoked a cigar in the last month. A different survey the same 
year found 5 percent of 12- to 17-year-old saying that. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no question, though that cigar smoking is on the rise.  
With a proliferation of cigar bars and high-profile celebrity cigar 
smoking, the number of smokers rose 50 percent between 1993 and 
1997, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cigar industry maintains that cigar smoking among teens  
is rare. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings required in California are on boxes, not individual  
cigars, and it's unclear what federal regulations might require. 
</P>
<P>
	The California label says the product ``contains/produces  
chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and 
birth defects and other reproductive harm.''

	Clinton gave a glimpse of the message he wants to deliver about  
confronting ethnic conflicts abroad and strengthening security 
alliances when he appeared Wednesday at a White House press 
conference with Ghanian President Jerry Rawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the disastrous consequences when the United States  
withdrew from world affairs after World War I. A nation must 
reinforce its values with dialogue and action around the globe, he 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides who had seen an early draft of the foreign policy address  
described it as a broad review of the international scene. Among 
the topics said to be covered are peace in the Middle East, 
expanding trade, the situations in Kosovo and Northern Ireland, and 
the threat terrorism poses to U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the speech is for the president to lay out his  
vision for continuing American leadership and supporting peace, 
prosperity and freedom into the next century,'' said one White 
House official who had reviewed a draft. 
</P>
<P>
	With the impeachment trial over, Clinton has found himself more  
easily able to involve himself in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has faced criticism over the continued standoff  
with Iraq and the peace talks on Kosovo. The speech, however, was 
being portrayed as a call to press ahead with existing policy, not 
as a sign of a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton was expected to tout his foreign policy  
accomplishments, he was admitting to some frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no progress, although I've tried, in trying to get  
Greece and Turkey to get along,'' he said late Thursday night. 
``I've made no progress in trying to resolve the tensions between 
India and Pakistan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also planned to mention this year's entry into NATO of  
the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. Another topic was the 
importance of fully integrating nations such as Russia and China 
into the world economic scheme if the United States and Europe are 
to have stable relations with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the address, Clinton was meeting with William Perry, the  
former defense secretary, to hear his views on U.S. policy toward 
North Korea, where Perry recently visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the State Department was expected to issue two long  
awaited reports, one on human rights around the globe and another 
on Mexico's efforts to fight drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect any surprises,'' White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said Thursday when asked if the administration would 
certify Mexico's drug-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent a busy Thursday traveling from Washington to  
Arizona, giving a speech in Tucson on Social Security and Medicare. 
He then traveled to San Francisco to raise $1 million for House and 
Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	At the fund-raiser, he delivered an upbeat message about the  
Democrats' prospects for regaining control of Congress in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But in praising the perseverance of party leaders like House  
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, he suggested that the Democrats 
who left Congress after the Republican victories in 1994 lacked 
conviction in their party's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, frankly ... they just quit,'' Clinton said.  
``I'll say this for the Republicans, they don't quit. Strom 
Thurmond and Jesse Helms don't quit, right? And a lot of our guys, 
they had a hard time, so they just ... left their careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond is a Republican senator from South Carolina. Helms  
represents North Carolina in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot: I Was Looking at Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot testified at his  
court-martial Friday that he was engrossed in a map strapped to his 
navigator's knee in the seconds before he looked up to see a yellow 
gondola and ski lift cable looming in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Capt. Richard Ashby had ever testified  
about last February's accident in the Italian Alps that sent 20 
people in the gondola plunging to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler that clipped the cable,  
grasped a model of the jet mounted on a stick as he explained to 
the military jury how he lowered his plane into the valley where 
the ski lift was situated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said that he wanted to make sure he was in the right  
valley because he had missed its entrance a short time earlier. He 
looked up from the map and saw the cable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this wire was going to go through the canopy. I  
thought, `We're all dead,''' Ashby said. He said he instinctively 
ducked and pushed his stick forward, causing the plane to descend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched this wire go over the canopy and nothing happened,  
and I started to recover. Then at some point between nothing and 
recovering, there's a thump like that,'' he said, knocking the 
witness box rail. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable damaged a wing and electronics gear in the tail, but  
Ashby managed to fly the jet back to the NATO air base at Aviano, 
where he and his three crewmates were stationed for possible duty 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is being court-martialed on  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and other charges and could 
get more than 200 years in prison. The defense is expected to wrap 
up its case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, attempted  
to videotape the early part of the flight through the Dolomite 
Mountains, but had trouble operating the camera and finally put it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he pocketed the tape after they landed. Later,  
Schweitzer asked for it, and Ashby never saw it again, he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer, who will be tried next month, both are  
charged with obstruction of justice because investigators never 
found the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby also said that at the outset of the flight, he set the  
radar low-altitude alarm to go off at 800 feet -- 200 feet below the 
minimum prescribed altitude and about 430 feet higher than where 
the plane struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want the thing going off continuously,'' he  
testified. ``You want that tone to mean something to you. It means, 
`I've got to do something with the aircraft now or I'm going to 
die.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was not asked whether the alarm went off before the  
accident. However, other witnesses, including the backseat crewmen, 
have testified that the alarm did not sound as it should have after 
the jet descended into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident caused an uproar in Europe and strained relations  
between Italy and the United States. People living in the Alpine 
ski area said they had long complained about jets from Aviano and 
their low-flying, ``Top Gun''-style antics. 
</P>
<P>
	Italians demanded that the crew be tried in that country and  
that U.S. landing rights at Italian bases be revoked. The officers' 
lawyers had argued that the aviators were charged because of 
political pressure that went as high as the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby was intentionally flying too low and  
too fast -- more than 600 mph -- when his jet hit the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he knew of no speed limit for the mission, despite  
prosecutors' claims that it was 517 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also say his altimeter alarm malfunctioned;  
his government-issue map didn't show the ski lift; and he suffered 
from an optical illusion that made him think he was flying higher 
than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby appeared nervous when he first took the stand, and his  
voice cracked when he told how he learned that people in the 
gondola had died. But otherwise he was composed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mistakes were made on this flight -- and any flight, any  
mission you fly, mistakes are made,'' he said. ``We never 
intentionally did anything outside the scope of this mission, which 
was to try to maintain 1,000 feet'' and use terrain features to 
practice avoiding enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
	During a testy, two-hour cross-examination, Maj. Daniel  
Daugherty asked Ashby: ``Were you simply negligent, Captain Ashby, 
or were you recklessly negligent by doing something you weren't 
qualified to do -- putting your aircraft in a 2,400-foot-per-minute 
descent, flying as low as you could and as fast as you could?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither, sir,'' Ashby said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another time, Daugherty asked Ashby: ``You can't imagine going  
to jail, can you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I can't,'' Ashby said.  
</P>
<P>
	During a break, relatives of the victims appeared upset as they  
emerged from the courtroom. One woman was crying; other relatives 
had their arms around one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said under questioning from his lawyers that he was  
initially trained to fly at 500 feet. Once, while serving in Italy 
in 1996, he was flying at that altitude in the mountains when he 
encountered a paraglider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared the hell out of me,'' Ashby said. ``I could see the  
whites of his eyes.''

<HEADLINE> McCaffrey Wants Mexico Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Refusing to certify Mexico as a fully  
cooperating partner in the fight against drug trafficking would 
send an unwise and wrongheaded political message, White House drug 
policy director Barry McCaffrey says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration was scheduled to announce today  
whether it would certify that Mexico, America's second-largest 
trading partner behind Canada, was fully cooperating with U.S. 
anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect any surprises,'' White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said Thursday when asked if President Clinton would 
certify Mexico's anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Jeffrey Davidow, also indicated  
Thursday that Clinton would certify Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexico's efforts in fighting narcotics are appreciated in the  
United States,'' Davidow told the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Mexico City. ``Acting alone, we cannot face, we cannot confront and 
beat the narcotics traffickers. We have to do this in a cooperative 
fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., expressed disappointment with the  
expected certification. ``Why is this administration rewarding 
Mexico with U.S. trade and foreign aid when they are dramatically 
increasing their heroin production and significantly lowering their 
seizures of illegal drugs?'' he asked in a written statement. He is 
chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's panel on 
criminal justice, drug policy and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the president must judge the performance of all foreign  
drug-producing and transiting countries by March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries not certified as fully cooperating -- and not given a  
national security waiver -- would be hit with economic penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have expressed doubt about Mexico's  
commitment to stop narcotics trafficking. But McCaffrey said 
Thursday the country is struggling to rid itself of drug-related 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to work in practical cooperation with men and  
women of good will who share our view that this drug threat is a 
terrible menace to their own political institutions and their own 
children,'' he told Mica's subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who contend Mexico has failed to meet its  
responsibilities may move to block its certification. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to ask the Senate, 'Is it time to say no,  
you do not get recertified?''' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said Thursday. ``They're not doing what they're supposed 
to be doing on the drug wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert criticized McCaffrey's  
goal of reducing U.S. illegal drug use and availability by 50 
percent by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Republicans, we have insisted that the nation's drug czar  
meet achievable performance standards by 2003,'' said Hastert, 
R-Ill. ``Moreover, we need the Clinton-Gore administration to share 
our commitment to fight to win the war on drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also announced that Mica and Reps. Rob Portman, R-Ohio,  
and Bill McCollum, R-Fla., would lead the new Drug-Free America 
Working Group, a task force of House Republicans working on the 
drug issue.

<HEADLINE> Woman May Have Mistreated 75 Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VACAVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- A woman arrested after authorities  
discovered 75 poodles wading through 6 inches of feces in her home 
said the dogs were her whole life and she didn't mean them any 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean for it to go this far,'' said Nancy Jean  
O'Neill, 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Police responded after neighbors complained about the stench  
coming from O'Neill's condo. Authorities said one dog was dead when 
they arrived Wednesday and others were in poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The condo was ruled uninhabitable after firefighters had to use  
breathing equipment to counter the overpowering odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found sales receipts from 1986, police Lt. Ed  
Goldberg said. ``There are indications of it being a puppy mill,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who was jailed, said she only wanted to keep the  
animals out of the pound and she kept them fed and watered. They 
were taken in by Humane Animal Services.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Release Receiver Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFC champion Atlanta Falcons on Friday cut  
their leading receiver, Tony Martin, who was charged this month 
with laundering money for a convicted drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was the second prominent player to be cut by the Falcons  
since their Super Bowl loss to the Denver Broncos, following 
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the team's leading tackler. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, led Atlanta with 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six  
touchdowns, but the Falcons were clearly concerned about his legal 
troubles and a clause in his contract that called for him to 
receive $400,000 if he was on the roster Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's lawyers filed a motion this week asking the federal  
court in Miami to postpone the trial -- tentatively scheduled to 
begin May 3 -- until next year. The receiver is charged with five 
counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said if Martin was  
exonerated, ``there's always the chance we would consider 
re-signing him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's release came on the same day the Falcons signed  
receiver Chris Calloway, who led the New York Giants in receptions 
the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two moves are not related,'' Richardson said. ``We would  
have signed Calloway even if Martin were still on the roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson deferred all other questions to Atlanta coach Dan  
Reeves, who was en route to Kansas City to receive an award 
Saturday night and not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's agent, Jimmy Sexton, of Memphis, Tenn., was not at his  
office and could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin caught five passes in Atlanta's 34-19 loss to Denver in  
the Jan. 31 Super Bowl at Miami. One week later, he appeared in a 
Miami courtroom after being named in a federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's legal troubles stem from his longtime relationship with  
Rickey Brownlee, who spent seven years in prison for 1980s drug 
convictions and faces new charges for alleged heroin and cocaine 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not guilty of anything,'' Martin told reporters after  
being released on $250,000 bond. ``This whole thing is ludicrous. 
After this trial is over, I will be cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not accused of involvement in Brownlee's alleged drug  
business. Prosecutors said he wrote checks to lease luxury cars and 
pay legal fees for his friend because Brownlee's lawyers wouldn't 
take cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee allegedly gave cash to Martin for deposits on the cars  
and the lawyers' fees. After his financial records were subpoenaed, 
Martin stopped payment on a $175,000 check to the lawyers and 
showed a copy of the subpoena to Brownlee's associates, according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin also returned thousands in cash in an effort to conceal  
the scheme, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's lawyers, Howard Srebnick and Roy Black, hope to get a  
ruling on their request for a delay in the trial before their 
client's arraignment on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons acquired Martin from San Diego for a second-round  
draft pick last June. He teamed with Terance Mathis to give the 
Falcons the NFL's second-most productive pair of receivers in terms 
of yardage, trailing only Minnesota's duo of Randy Moss and Cris 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin made $1.5 million this season and was to have been paid  
$1.8 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin began his NFL career with the Miami Dolphins, his  
hometown team, before going to San Diego, where he averaged 72 
catches and 1,046 yards in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second Falcons player to face legal trouble in Miami  
in recent weeks. Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson was arrested the 
night before the Super Bowl on charges of soliciting oral sex from 
a female undercover police officer. Robinson is due back in court 
March 2.

<HEADLINE> Rambis Named Lakers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Kurt Rambis, the epitome of a  
blue-collar player, was hired as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers on 
Friday, taking over a star-studded but struggling team that just 
added Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	A forward on four Lakers NBA championship teams, the 41-year-old  
Rambis replaces Del Harris, who was fired Wednesday after the 
Lakers lost three straight to fall to 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak introduced Rambis  
during a press conference, Rambis smiled and asked, ``What? No 
applause?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis and fellow assistant Larry Drew were the candidates for  
the job. Bill Bertka, 71, also a Lakers assistant, coached the team 
in Thursday's victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis' coaching debut was to come only hours after he was  
hired, in a rematch at the Forum against the Clippers. It also was 
to be Rodman's first game in a Lakers uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Kupchak said Rambis would be the coach through the end of the  
season, when management will evaluate his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Rambis has considerable success, the Lakers may go after  
a high-profile coach, such as former Chicago Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson, following the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, a player who seemed to make up for what he lacked in  
natural ability with hard work and determination, continued that 
when he became an assistant, Kupchak said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the hardest worker of any assistant I have ever seen,''  
Kupchak said. ``He continues to ask questions every day, he watches 
tape and he is eager to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to know details (of the game) more than other players  
(who had more talent), and that certainly didn't hurt him. He 
speaks well and, most importantly, he has been involved in a 
winning organization for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis said when it was announced he was being considered for  
the Lakers' post: ``It's not an easy job, head coaching in the Los 
Angeles area, because of the high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't settle for anything less than winning a championship.  
That's all I looked at as a player, and that's all I look at as a 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis averaged 5.5 points and 5.8 rebounds in 813  
regular-season career games. He played seven years for the Lakers 
and won championship rings with them in 1982, '85, '87 and '88. He 
retired in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Come Down With Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Call it the Philly flu.  
</P>
<P>
	It's painful, it moves fast and it swept through the  
Philadelphia Phillies clubhouse faster than a Curt Schilling trade 
rumor. Nearly a third of the 59 players in camp Friday were 
stricken, including starters Scott Rolen, Rico Brogna, Mike 
Lieberthal and No. 1 draft pick Pat Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here at 5:30 in the morning, I found Burrell and  
(Steve) Carver asleep on a table,'' said manager Terry Francona, 
who had managed to ward off the stomach virus -- at least for the 
day. ``They were not looking ready for any extra work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few players were too sick to even show up at Jack Russell  
Stadium Friday morning. Others came in anyway and were sent home. 
And a few, like Carver, didn't feel anything until after they 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Wayne Gomes sat at his locker with his head in his  
hands and a grim look on his face, but insisted on doing his 
scheduled throwing anyway. He went home as soon as he was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Doug Glanville had a fever, worked out briefly  
and was sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a fever, but he hasn't thrown up yet,'' said  
spokesman Larry Shenk, in his new role as head of the Clearwater 
MASH unit. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team returned from its workout at the Carpenter Complex  
-- about 4 miles from the stadium -- pitching coach Galen Cisco had 
succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fine, I think,'' Francona said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first one to get sick was left-hander Paul Spoljaric, who  
missed the first day of workouts last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spoljaric infects clubhouse,'' lefty Jim Poole joked as the  
now-healthy Spoljaric walked past his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had nothing to do with it,'' Spoljaric said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Sentenced in Ill. License Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Three people were sentenced to prison and a  
fourth to house arrest for a plot to sell truck driver's licenses 
to pay for tickets to Gov. George Ryan's political fund-raising 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ann Mastrodomenico, former manager of the driver's license  
facility, was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of 
home confinement on Friday. A possible 20-year sentence was reduced 
because she cooperated with prosecutors and has a sick father. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Suzanne Conlon brushed aside her claim that aides for  
Ryan, the former secretary of state who was elected governor in 
November, pressured her to sell $20,000 a year in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly no evidence that Ms. Mastrodomenico's  
supervisor pressured her to extort money or take bribes,'' Conlon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck mechanic Mike Dobrosavljevich got 14 months in prison and  
two years of supervision, driving instructor Janusz Krzyzak got 10 
months in prison and two years of supervision and Carmen Fajdich, a 
retired state employee, got one year of home confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	The four pleaded guilty to charges that included racketeering,  
conspiracy for accepting bribes for the licenses, or recruiting 
those who paid the bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said licensing officials filled in the answers on  
written commercial driver's license exams for unqualified drivers 
who had paid bribes. Those drivers were then given permits 
indicating they had passed all necessary tests. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, trucking firms paid the bribes to assure that  
their applicants received proper licenses, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money taken as bribes had been used to pay for  
tickets to Ryan's fund raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar told reporters that the investigation  
is continuing but that Ryan is not a target. He would not give more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan ordered as many as 3,000 truck drivers to be retested after  
the scandal became public.

<HEADLINE> Eli Lilly Is Sued Over Evista </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- British drug maker Zeneca Inc. has sued rival  
Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., accusing the company of improperly selling its 
osteoporosis drug Evista as a medication to prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Evista is not approved as a breast cancer drug in the United  
States, though early tests look promising. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca makes Nolvadex, which in October became the first drug  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of 
breast cancer in healthy women. Nolvadex is Zeneca's brand name for 
tamoxifen, which has been used to as a treatment for advanced 
breast cancer for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in New York contends  
Lilly has reduced demand for Nolvadex with its marketing of Evista. 
Lilly has allowed its sales staff to claim during meetings with 
doctors that Evista is proven to prevent breast cancer, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars drug companies from promoting drugs for uses  
not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, although doctors 
are permitted to prescribe drugs for any use they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly denied the suit's allegations. ``We feel our promotion of  
Evista is 100 percent appropriate,'' said spokesman Jeff Newton. 
``We're promoting this product for its labeled indication, which is 
osteoporosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, though, has hopes that Evista will eventually be used to  
prevent breast cancer. Early studies show Evista may work just as 
well as Nolvadex, though large-scale human tests have yet to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca said one market study found physicians have begun  
prescribing Evista at least as frequently as Nolvadex to reduce the 
risk of breast cancer. This, the company said, ``poses a grave 
public health risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many women have already begun to use Evista instead of  
Nolvadex in the mistaken belief that the drug has been proven to 
reduce their chances of developing breast cancer,'' Zeneca said in 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, whose biggest-selling drug antidepressant Prozac is  
expected to lose patent protection in 2004, launched Evista early 
in 1998. Lilly targeted a market of women eager for a substitute 
for the hormone estrogen in fighting bone deterioration after 
menopause. However, last year's $138 million in U.S. sales were 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, Nolvadex had $369 million in U.S. sales last  
year. Since October, the number of U.S. prescriptions written for 
Nolvadex has been flat at about 66,000 per month, according to 
market data firm IMS Health. In the same period, the number of 
prescriptions for Evista rose from 220,000 in October to 261,000 in 
December, IMS said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly was up  
$1.25 at $94.50, while Zeneca's U.S. shares were down $1 at $41.06 1/4 
a share.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Want Pitching Depth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey  
Johnson wants to keep six veteran starters competing for five spots 
in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Friday he isn't considering a six-man rotation --  
something the New York Mets tried last season -- but he would like a 
sixth starter with major league experience on the roster as 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to have that depth,'' Johnson said. ``You end up  
having injuries, so the depth is important. That's what the Yankees 
had last year by keeping six or seven starters around. Atlanta's 
pretty much the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodger officials say they aren't close to making any decisions  
about Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Carlos Perez, 
Darren Dreifort and Dave Mlicki. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mlicki has been mentioned in trade rumors this spring.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Malone said at the beginning of camp that  
he probably would attempt to trade whichever starter didn't crack 
the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers could use an extra left-handed reliever and an  
experienced backup catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Dodgers leave Mlicki out of the rotation, they still  
could keep him in the bullpen or use him as a spot starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki said he enjoys pitching in Los Angeles and might consider  
a move to the bullpen if it allowed him to remain with the team. 
But he prefers to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've proved myself as a starter and I prefer that  
role,'' Mlicki said. ``I'm more of a routine-type guy. I like 
knowing what I'm going to do every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mlicki went 1-4 with a 5.68 ERA for the New York Mets last year,  
then went 7-3 with a 4.05 ERA after coming to Los Angeles in the 
trade that sent Hideo Nomo to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``All six of them deserve to be in a rotation somewhere,''  
Malone said. ``We just have to figure out which five are best for 
us. There's no clear-cut odd man out.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall Further / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) --Grain and soybean futures extended their slide  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a fundamentally weak 
supply-and-demand picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans and wheat posted new lows amid expectations of large  
deliveries of grain to satisfy contracts expiring in March. Futures 
prices have been pressured by expectations U.S. inventories will 
remain sharply higher this year amid weak demand from Asia and huge 
harvests in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were pressured by plunging soybean oil prices.  
Soybean oil fell to 11-year lows amid concern China, one of the 
largest buyers of U.S. exports, will cancel orders. India and 
Pakistan recently canceled their orders as a 20 percent decline in 
prices prompted them to move to the sidelines and wait for a 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell mostly in sympathy with wheat and soybeans.  
Corn inventories are expected to fall slightly as demand remains 
fairly steady for the crop in feed and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.37 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.04 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 4 1/4 cents to 
$1.04 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 4 3/4 cents to $4.49 3/4 a bushel; 
March soybean oil fell 0.37 cent to 17.62 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as  
slaughterhouses appeared content to wait for lower prices. Beef 
futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell 0.68 cent to 68.02 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 0.30 cent to 74.17 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell 1.15 cents to 43 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 
1.05 cents to 49.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Radical Feminist Prof. Creates Stir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston College Professor Mary Daly has some strong  
beliefs about how to teach. The strongest? That advanced feminist 
theory shouldn't be taught to men. 
</P>
<P>
	And after administrators at the Jesuit institution ordered her  
to admit men in her classes, the self-described radical feminist 
said she would rather not teach at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, a feminist pioneer whose seven major books include  
``Outercourse,'' took a leave of absence from the college this 
semester rather than admit senior Duane Naquin into her feminist 
ethics class. 
</P>
<P>
	Letting in men, she explained Thursday, would compromise her  
belief that women tend to defer to a man whenever one is in the 
room. Besides, she said, she has taught men for decades -- in a 
one-on-one format, rather than in seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	Naquin, who complained about discrimination, has the backing of  
the Center for Individual Rights, a conservative law firm in 
Washington, D.C., whose lawsuit ended affirmative action at the 
University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The center sent a letter to school administrators last fall  
threatening legal action if Daly did not change her policy. Daly, 
meanwhile, argued Naquin did not have the prerequisite of another 
feminist studies course. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials said a second male student also complained of  
discrimination. Neither Naquin nor the center returned calls 
seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old Daly, who reportedly has rejected a retirement  
offer, taught only men when she first arrived at the Newton campus 
in 1966. The college of arts and science did not begin admitting 
women until 1970. In the early '70s, she said, she observed 
problems in her co-ed classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if there were only one or two men with 20 women, the  
young women would be constantly on an overt or a subliminal level 
giving their attention to the men because they've been socialized 
to nurse men,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College officials said Daly's ground rules violate  
federal civil rights laws and school policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar dispute occurred about a decade ago. Whenever  
controversy has arisen, the tenured professor would leave campus 
for a semester, hoping the matter would blow over, college 
spokesman Jack Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he said, the college won't let Daly continue ``her  
archaic and stereotypical notion that men shouldn't have access to 
her perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a male professor tried to bar women from his classes, Dunn  
said, ``we'd be run out of town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who abandoned her Roman Catholic faith in the early 1970s,  
describes herself as a radical feminist, which she interprets as 
``going to the roots'' of societal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Her books include ``The Church and the Second Sex,''  
``Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' and 
``Outercourse,'' a theological autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she views the controversy as an attack on academic  
freedom and an assault on feminism by ``an extreme right-wing 
organization'' trying to ``assert white male supremacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's students are rallying around her, and 14 of them wrote a  
letter to college administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there comes a point where women need to claim their  
own space,'' said Kate Heekin, a senior from Greenwich, Conn. ``If 
that needs to be a classroom, so be it.''

<HEADLINE> Theater Director Jose Quintero Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Award-winning theater director Jose  
Quintero, whose landmark productions of Eugene O'Neill dramas 
renewed interest in one of America's greatest playwrights, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero directed more than a dozen major productions of works  
by O'Neill, who in the last decade of his life had been 
increasingly ignored by critics and audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	He won two Tonys, for a production of ``Long Day's Journey into  
Night'' and for directing ``A Moon for the Misbegotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was also a founder of Circle in the Square, a small  
Greenwich Village theater credited with energizing the off-Broadway 
movement after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the actors he worked with during his nearly 50 years in  
the theater were Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst, George C. Scott 
and Geraldine Page. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his 1952 revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and  
Smoke,'' starring a luminous Page as spinster Alma Winemiller, that 
first brought him and Circle in the Square attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it was as a director of O'Neill plays that Quintero won the  
most acclaim. In 1956, he directed the original Broadway production 
of ``A Long Day's Journey into Night,'' which starred Fredric March 
as the tyrannical James Tyrone and Florence Eldridge as his 
drug-addled wife. Robards and Bradford Dillman played their 
troubled sons. The autobiographical drama, produced three years 
after O'Neill's death, is generally considered to be the 
playwright's finest work. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that year, Quintero directed an off-Broadway revival of  
``The Iceman Cometh,'' starring Robards as Hickey, the hale and 
hearty barfly. It had Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times 
proclaiming, ```The Iceman Cometh' is a mighty theater work. 
O'Neill is a giant, and Mr. Quintero is a remarkably gifted 
artist.'' Quintero, Robards and ``Iceman'' were reunited in 1985 
for a second highly praised production, this time on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The director and Robards joined forces on several other major  
O'Neill revivals on Broadway, including ``Hughie'' (1964); ``A Moon 
for the Misbegotten'' (1973); and ``A Touch of the Poet'' (1977). 
Robards and Dewhurst starred as the parents in a Quintero-directed 
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero did not neglect the lesser-known O'Neill works either,  
directing ``Strange Interlude'' on Broadway in 1963 (with Page, Ben 
Gazzara and Jane Fonda), ``Marco Millions'' at Lincoln Center in 
1964 and ``More Stately Mansions'' with Ingrid Bergman on Broadway 
in 1967. He also did ``Desire Under the Elms'' with Dewhurst and 
Scott off-Broadway in 1963 and a Broadway production in 1977 of 
``Anna Christie,'' starring Liv Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other Broadway productions he directed were two  
Tennessee Williams flops, ``The Seven Descents of Myrtle'' (1968) 
and ``Clothes for a Summer Hotel,'' (1980) as well as Brian Friel's 
``Faith Healer'' (1979), starring James Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed one film, ``The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone'' (1961),  
based on a Tennessee Williams novella. It starred Vivien Leigh and 
Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was born in Panama City, Panama. He attended the  
University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1980s, Quintero developed throat cancer and had his  
vocal cords removed. He learned to speak with the assistance of a 
mechanical amplifier that he held to his throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero is survived by a sister and his companion, Nick  
Tsacrios. A memorial service will be announced later.

<HEADLINE> Gains Cited in Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and allied countries made  
``solid gains'' in efforts to control narcotics trafficking in 
1998, the State Department said today, citing progress in crop 
reduction, drug interdiction and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report on the illicit drug trade worldwide, the  
department said the most encouraging development in 1998 was the 
continued downward trend in illicit coca cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The total coca crop remains at its lowest level in 10 years,  
even factoring in a sharp rise in cultivation in Colombia,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, President Clinton was issuing his assessment of the  
counterdrug performance of 28 countries considered major sources of 
illicit narcotics or transit points for narcotics shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has signaled his intention to ``certify'' Mexico as  
being fully cooperative with U.S. counternarcotics activities 
despite a reduction in narcotics seizures and other setbacks in the 
drug war last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries found not to be fully cooperative are ``decertified''  
and can face economic sanctions. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., indicated there may be a Senate move to overturn Clinton's 
expected endorsement of Mexico's counterdrug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey said Thursday  
that refusing to certify Mexico as a fully cooperating partner in 
the fight against drug trafficking would send an unwise and 
wrongheaded political message. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said the United  
States appreciates Mexico's efforts. ``Acting alone, we cannot 
face, we cannot confront and beat the narcotics traffickers. We 
have to do this in a cooperative fashion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight countries were decertified last year: Colombia, Cambodia,  
Pakistan, Paraguay, Afghanistan, Burma, Iran and Nigeria. The first 
four were given a presidential waiver on national security grounds 
and therefore were not subject to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Iran was removed from the list of drug problem  
countries because of an ambitious campaign against the opium poppy, 
from which heroin is produced. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department study, titled International Narcotics  
Control Strategy Report, said overall coca cultivation in the 
Andean countries fell 17 percent to 471,000 acres last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most dramatic decline was evident in Peru, once the  
world's largest coca producer,'' the report said. ``Peruvian coca 
cultivation in 1998 fell 26 percent from the year before, and is 
now 60 percent below the peak level of 1990,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive 733-page document also evaluates the illicit  
narcotics situation country-by-country. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Colombia remained the world's leading producer and  
distributor of cocaine and is a major source of heroin and 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	A combined U.S.-Colombian eradication program had its best year  
ever in 1998, successfully spraying over 160,000 acres of coca, an 
increase of 50 percent over 1997. Nonetheless, overall product 
increased because of stepped-up cultivation, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, Mexico continues to be the primary  
route for northbound South American cocaine and is a major source 
of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a comprehensive anti-drug strategy, the report said,  
cocaine seizures were down 35 percent and opium cultivation 
increased by 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Persistent corruption at all levels of the justice sector and  
frequent changes in personnel have combined to hinder Mexico's 
ability to meet the goals of its anti-drug strategy,'' the study 
said.

<HEADLINE> GDP Grows at 6.1 Pct. Annual Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the global financial crisis, the U.S.  
economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly 15 years last quarter, 
closing out a year in which Americans enjoyed the best combination 
of rapid growth, low unemployment and low inflation in at least 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's gross domestic product, the total output of goods  
and services, shot up at a sizzling annual rate of 6.1 percent from 
October through December, the Commerce Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was even better than the 5.6 percent rate the government  
originally reported a month ago. Updated statistics pointed to more 
strength in trade and consumer spending than originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the newfound growth, inflation was nowhere to be seen.  
An inflation measurement tied to GDP was up just 1 percent for all 
of last year, the smallest increase in 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an incredibly good performance last year,'' said David  
Wyss, chief financial economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``How 
long can the United States survive as this oasis of prosperity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the economy grew by 3.9 percent, the third  
straight year of above 3 percent growth, the strongest such stretch 
since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. performance last year was all the more remarkable given  
the severe financial turbulence at midyear after the Asian economic 
crisis spread to Russia and threatened Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock prices went into a nosedive only to rebound after the  
Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times to inoculate the 
American economy from trouble overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, the Fed and many private economists  
believe economic growth will slow markedly this year as pent-up 
consumer demand is finally exhausted and as the U.S. trade deficit 
widens further, reflecting that one-third of the globe is in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent reports have called that consensus view into  
question. Just this week, data showed that new orders for durable 
goods shot up in January at the fastest pace in 14 months and sales 
of existing homes and consumer confidence both climbed into record 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Those stronger-than-expected reports caused a sell-off on Wall  
Street on Thursday as investors became concerned the Fed will soon 
reverse course and start to raise interest rates because of fears 
the economy is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market recovered some of those losses Friday as  
investors chose to focus on the exceptionally low inflation figure 
in the GDP report. Stocks, however, gave up further ground, falling 
59.46 to end the week at 9,306.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress this week  
that Fed policy-makers believe the economy will slow to between 2.5 
percent and 3 percent growth this year, in line with private 
forecasts. But he pointedly signaled that if growth does not slow 
on its own, the Fed is prepared to start raising rates to make it 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal  
Reserve Bank, said, ``Frankly, after three years of underestimating 
the U.S. economy's ability to grow, it wouldn't surprise me to see 
it exceed expectations for a fourth year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the country's economic expansion became the longest  
in peacetime history. If growth lasts another year, it will be the 
longest recovery in history, surpassing the 1960s expansion during 
the Vietnam War. By many measures of growth, unemployment and low 
inflation, the country is already enjoying its best days since the 
1960s, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economic performance is one of the chief reasons cited  
for President Clinton's strong approval ratings even during the 
darkest days of the impeachment battle. A new poll by the Pew 
Research Center found that Americans' optimism about their nation 
is higher than it has been since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last year, consumer spending -- which accounts for  
two-thirds of total economic activity -- rose 4.8 percent, the 
fastest increase in 14 years. That offset the widening trade 
deficit, which subtracted 1.1 percentage points from growth last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	By quarter, GDP was up at a 5.5 percent annual rate in the first  
quarter, followed by increases of 1.8 percent and 3.7 percent 
before ending with the 6.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter. The 
fourth quarter increase matched the gain in the second quarter of 
1996 and was the strongest performance since GDP grew at an annual 
rate of 6.4 percent in the second quarter of 1984.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Have Tax Cut Quandary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in Congress are struggling to find  
a tax cut formula even as they unveil new proposals on an almost 
daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, where tax bills must originate, half of Speaker  
Dennis Hastert's symbolic top 10 bills propose some form of tax 
relief. They range from a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income 
tax rates to a measure lifting limits on outside earnings by Social 
Security recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans have already agreed with President Clinton that  
62 percent of the budget surplus -- estimated at $2.6 trillion over 
the next decade -- should go to ensure Social Security's future 
solvency. Clinton now wants 15 percent to fix up Medicare, which 
would leave 23 percent for increased spending or tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House  
Ways and Means Committee, released a congressional analysis 
Thursday indicating that Clinton's proposed fiscal 2000 budget 
contains a net tax increase of $89.7 billion over the next decade. 
The new focus on Medicare, he said, is evidence of the president's 
unwillingness to pursue any broad tax reduction using the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It strikes me as strictly a political moving of the goal posts  
by taking the positions he has,'' Archer said in an interview 
Thursday. ``They are always trying to put roadblocks in our way to 
tax relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question for the GOP is whether to push hard for a major tax  
cut that might never become law -- but could be fodder for the 2000 
elections -- or work with Democrats on a more modest bill with a 
variety of targeted tax relief measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the debate right now: which kind of tax relief we  
should provide,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. ``They're all going into the pot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initial interest in the 10 percent income tax rate cut is fading  
fast because of GOP concerns about its cost -- more than $775 
billion over 10 years -- and the unlikelihood it could become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty unlikely that we will pass a single tax provision  
of this magnitude,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said at a tax 
seminar Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the tax cut candidates have broad bipartisan support.  
Dozens of Democrats favor legislation providing relief to the 
estimated 21 million two-earner married couples who pay more taxes 
than they would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Phasing out the estate, or ``death,'' tax has more than 100  
co-sponsors, and many Democrats strongly back a permanent extension 
of the research-and-development credit. Some Republicans back 
Clinton's proposals for new credits helping people care for the 
elderly and disabled and for parents who stay home with infants. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are solidly against the 10 percent across-the-board  
tax cut, arguing that too much of it benefits people earning more 
than $100,000 a year. And they are firm in insisting that Social 
Security and Medicare come first. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is not whether we want a tax bill. It's whether  
we want to take care of Social Security and Medicare,'' said Rep. 
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., senior Democrat on the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, however, are determined to make tax cuts their  
signature issue, one they can take to voters in 2000 to show their 
ability to get things done and erase perceptions that they were 
mainly concerned with impeaching Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want smaller government, we are going to have to have  
tax cuts to take that extra money off the table,'' said Hastert, 
R-Ill. ``If you leave it here, it will get spent and you will have 
bigger government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One early stab at compromise is being circulated by Rep. Nancy  
Johnson, R-Conn. It would include several of the popular targeted 
tax cuts -- some of them proposed by Clinton -- and cost about $100 
billion over five years. So far, Johnson's bill has attracted 
support from 19 other moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dunn and other Republicans are said to be working on another  
alternative focused more on the GOP proposals, such as relief from 
the marriage penalty and inheritance taxes, and leaving out 
Clinton's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can limit ourselves to one big proposal,''  
Archer said. ``We need to address a lot of things that are 
important.''

<HEADLINE> Orie Tries To Hang On With Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty minutes after the day's final  
spring training drill, Kevin Orie still has a bat in his hand and 
perspiration on his brow. His job is in jeopardy, and that's enough 
to make anyone sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	Once touted as the Chicago Cubs' best third baseman since Ron  
Santo, Orie was bust at Wrigley Field. Now he's trying to hang on 
with the Florida Marlins, baseball's worst team last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've hardened a good bit,'' said Orie, 26. ``I guess it's my  
turn to experience the ups and downs of the game. But I've had 
enough for a while. Let me rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, Orie figured a spot in the Marlins' lineup was his.  
Then they acquired top prospect Mike Lowell from the New York 
Yankees to compete for the job at third. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, just before spring training started, Lowell was  
diagnosed with testicular cancer. Following surgery and brief 
radiation treatment, he's expected to join the team, although the 
timetable is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mike comes back, there will be competition at third  
base,'' manager John Boles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficult situation has left Orie rooting for Lowell, 25.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he feels better,'' Orie said. ``My grandfather  
died of cancer. When something like this happens, it puts 
everything into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully good things will happen for both of us. I know this  
is his best chance too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high because only one of the two will make the  
Marlins' 25-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Orie hit .263 with six homers in 48 games last year after the  
Cubs traded him and two young pitchers to the Marlins for reliever 
Felix Heredia. His career average is .246 with 16 homers in 226 
games over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell spent almost all of the past two years in the minors,  
hitting .309 with 56 homers and 191 RBIs. The Marlins traded three 
pitching prospects to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say, `You have to be leaning toward keeping Lowell  
because you traded a lot to get him,' '' Boles said. ``Well, we 
traded a lot to get Kevin Orie, too. Felix Heredia is no slouch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of suburban Pittsburgh, Orie ranked among the National  
League rookie leaders in 1997 with eight homers and 44 RBIs. He hit 
.275 in 114 games and ranked second in fielding percentage among NL 
third basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year he was hitting just .179 when demoted to Triple-A  
in late May. He rejoined the Cubs a month later but couldn't regain 
the starting job and was traded to Florida on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a new life coming over here, something I needed,'' he  
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, the job is still mine to lose. 
Worrying about it doesn't do any good.''

	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons have signed Chris  
Calloway, who was released by the New York Giants for salary cap 
reasons after leading them in receptions for four straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons also have reached agreement with defensive tackle  
Bob Kuberski, a former reserve in Green Bay. 
</P>

touchdowns. He also has a streak of 47 straight games with a 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Football Conference winners also reached a contract  
agreement with defensive tackle Bob Kuberski, a reserve who saw 
action in 16 games for Green Bay last year.

	For his nine-year career, which began in Pittsburgh, Calloway  
has caught 359 passes for 5,088 yards, a 14.2 average, with 29 
touchdowns in 140 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuberski, 6-4, 298 pounds, played both defensive tackle and end  
in Green Bay.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs Mexico Antidrug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite large-scale, cross-border drug  
smuggling and a decline in drug seizures, President Clinton 
certified Mexico on Friday as a fully cooperating partner with U.S. 
counternarcotics efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, part of an annual evaluation of drug problem  
countries, could touch off strong opposition in Congress, where 
many lawmakers are exasperated by Mexico's inability to stem 
U.S.-bound narcotics flows. To overturn the president's decision, a 
two-thirds vote of both houses is required. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, countries found not to be fully cooperative are  
``decertified'' and can be subject to economic sanctions unless the 
president grants them a waiver on national interest grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexico is cooperating with us in the battle for our lives,''  
Clinton said in a speech in San Francisco. Mexican President 
Ernesto Zedillo is ``working hard to tackle the corruption 
traffickers headlong,'' he said, adding, ``He cannot win this 
battle alone. And neither can we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In justifying the Mexico decision, Barry McCaffrey, who heads  
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that 
last year, Mexico implemented legislative reforms, arrested 
numerous drug traffickers and sustained massive interdiction and 
eradication programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a news conference that outright decertification of  
Mexico would ``devastate'' efforts to build long-term cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, official figures indicate cocaine seizures in  
Mexico were down 35 percent last year and that eradication of opium 
poppy did not keep pace with new cultivation. The overall harvest 
increased by 25 percent, government figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a group of eight senators, led by Sen. Charles  
Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate caucus on drug issues, 
wrote to Clinton and recommended that in next year's certification 
process, Mexico be judged more by results instead of efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	They recommended that the evaluation be measured by strict  
criteria, including Mexico's willingness to extradite drug 
chieftains, its ability to arrest and prosecute money launderers 
and leaders of narcotics syndicates, and its record on drug 
eradication and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining seven Republicans in signing the letter was Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico was one of 28 countries evaluated by Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia was certified as being fully cooperative after being  
decertified last year. At the time, Clinton waived the economic 
penalties against Colombia. The country's clean bill of health 
reflects the close ties the Clinton administration has established 
with President Andres Pastrana, who took office six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Haiti, plagued by what officials called a  
``dysfunctional criminal justice system,'' was decertified with a 
national interest waiver. In the same category were Cambodia, 
Nigeria and Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan and Burma, key opium poppy countries, were  
decertified with no national interest waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 22 countries were certified as fully cooperative with  
American counterdrug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a State Department study released simultaneously with  
the certification announcement said Mexico continues to be the 
primary route for northbound South American cocaine and is a major 
source of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Persistent corruption at all levels of the justice sector and  
frequent changes in personnel have combined to hinder Mexico's 
ability to meet the goals of its antidrug strategy,'' the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is issued annually and evaluates international  
narcotics control efforts. It said the United States and its allies 
made ``solid gains'' in controlling narcotics trafficking in 1998, 
citing progress in crop reduction, drug interdiction and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The most encouraging development last year on the drug front,  
the report said, was the continued downward trend in coca 
cultivation, saying the total crop ``remains at its lowest level in 
10 years, even factoring in a sharp rise in cultivation in 
Colombia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department study, titled International Narcotics  
Control Strategy Report, said overall coca cultivation in the 
Andean countries fell 17 percent to 471,000 acres last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most dramatic decline was evident in Peru, once the  
world's largest coca producer,'' the report said. ``Peruvian coca 
cultivation in 1998 fell 26 percent from the year before, and is 
now 60 percent below the peak level of 1990,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 733-page document also evaluates the illicit narcotics  
situation country-by-country. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Colombia remained the world's leading producer and  
distributor of cocaine and is a major source of heroin and 
marijuana.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Down; Dow Off 59.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Friday for the fourth day in a  
row, as fears of higher interest rates and slower computer sales 
overshadowed positive signs of a strong economy and very low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.76 points to 9,306.58,  
ending down 33.37 for the week. The blue-chip index now sits 336 
points below its all-time closing high of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8. It is 
up 125.15, or 1.36 percent, for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators fell as well. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index lost 6.69 to 1,238.33, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index dropped 38.79 to 2,288.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors ignored lower yields in the bond market -- a  
signal of declining interest rates -- and drove prices lower after 
Compaq Computer warned analysts that sales in its small- and 
medium- business market have slowed this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's statement prompted Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse  
First Boston to cut first-quarter earnings projections for the 
company, whose shares declined 5 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange to 
35 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-makers, including IBM, Gateway and Dell Computer,  
also fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Also bothering the technology sector was Intel, which fell  
sharply after PC Data reported that Advanced Micro Devices AMD-K6 
processor-based computers outsold all Intel-based desktop PCs in 
the U.S. consumer retail market. It was the first time that Intel 
fell out of the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel skidded 7 13/16 to 119 15/16 in Nasdaq trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The decline in technology shares distracted investors from good  
economic news. The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. 
economy grew at a blistering 6.1 percent annual rate in the final 
three months of 1998, the quickest pace in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of  
goods and services, had been originally reported at 5.6 percent for 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report showed the economy growing at a faster pace  
than expected, it also showed that inflation rose just 1 percent 
last year, the slowest pace since a 0.9 percent rise in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The report boosted bond prices, which had tumbled the last three  
days on worries that the Fed might raise interest rates to keep 
inflation in check. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 
$10.94 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, which moves opposite 
the price, fell to 5.57 percent from 5.65 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks might have moved higher on the news that the economy was  
strong and interest rates falling. But the bond market had been 
battered too hard, and long-term interest rates were still up 
nearly 1/4 percentage point for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``For stocks, the key concern is interest rates,'' said Mark  
Vitner, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in 
Charlotte, N.C. Higher rates increase borrowing costs for companies 
and can put a damper on consumer spending, both bad for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy is strong, as the GDP report indicates it is,  
then manufacturing and transportation stocks should be rising, 
Vitner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not happening. I think there seems to be some fear in  
the markets that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, and 
going to do so at a time when the market thinks it shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in  
Minneapolis, said stock and bond investors were ``looking at 
different parts of the report. The stock market is looking at 
strong economic growth and thinking there may be rising interest 
rates. Bonds are looking at the low inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues edged out advancers on the New York Stock  
Exchange. NYSE consolidated volume totaled 933.89 million shares, 
up from 891.57 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.97 to 586.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.82 to 698.29. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.46 to 392.26. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo eased 0.71  
percent. In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX index declined 0.94 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 in London lost 0.51 percent, and the CAC in Paris 
dropped 1.44 percent.

<HEADLINE> Evista Maker Sues Eli Lilly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- British drug maker Zeneca Inc. has sued rival  
Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., accusing the company of improperly selling its 
osteoporosis drug Evista as a medication to prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Evista is not approved as a breast cancer drug in the United  
States, though early tests look promising. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca makes Nolvadex, which in October became the first drug  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of 
breast cancer in healthy women. Nolvadex is Zeneca's brand name for 
tamoxifen, which has been used as a treatment for advanced breast 
cancer for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in New York contends  
Lilly has reduced demand for Nolvadex with its marketing of Evista. 
Lilly has allowed its sales staff to claim during meetings with 
doctors that Evista is proven to prevent breast cancer, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars drug companies from promoting drugs for uses  
not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, although doctors 
are permitted to prescribe drugs for any use they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly denied the suit's allegations. ``We feel our promotion of  
Evista is 100 percent appropriate,'' said spokesman Jeff Newton. 
``We're promoting this product for its labeled indication, which is 
osteoporosis''. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, though, has hopes that Evista will eventually be used to  
prevent breast cancer. Early studies show Evista may work just as 
well as Nolvadex, though large-scale human tests have yet to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca said one market study found physicians have begun  
prescribing Evista at least as frequently as Nolvadex to reduce the 
risk of breast cancer. This, the company said, ``poses a grave 
public health risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many women have already begun to use Evista instead of  
Nolvadex in the mistaken belief that the drug has been proven to 
reduce their chances of developing breast cancer,'' Zeneca said in 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly, whose biggest-selling drug antidepressant Prozac is  
expected to lose patent protection in 2004, launched Evista early 
in 1998. Lilly targeted a market of women eager for a substitute 
for the hormone estrogen in fighting bone deterioration after 
menopause. However, last year's $138 million in U.S. sales were 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, Nolvadex had $369 million in U.S. sales last  
year.

<HEADLINE>  Big Mac Getting the Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- At 5:30 a.m. Friday, the lights were  
burning at the St. Louis Cardinals' spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	It's never too early in the day for the spotlights to shine on  
Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' yet another  
one of the TV shows clamoring to interview baseball's new home run 
king. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire chatted with host Charles Gibson about his 15-second  
visit with Pope John Paul II, discussed his boyhood hero (his 
father) and on a question relayed from Diane Sawyer, answered that 
yes, he gets sore early in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he gets through it by dunking himself daily in an  
ice tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets better as each day goes along,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, McGwire appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
``Late Show'' with David Letterman and Rosie O'Donnell's talk show. 
He made his acting debut on ``Mad About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```The `Today' Show was great, the Rosie show was great, they  
were all great,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	After drawing nearly 3.2 million during the 1998 regular season  
-- a team record -- the Cardinals already have sold 2,215,000 tickets 
for home game this year, up 433,000 from this point last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Their season-ticket base is up 2,100 to 20,300 despite a 12  
percent hike in prices. McGwire, who gets $1 for every home ticket 
sold above 2.8 million, figures to collect on that again. The bonus 
earned him $395,021 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Mark is not resting on his laurels, and our fans aren't  
resting on their laurels, either,'' Cardinals managing partner Bill 
DeWitt said. ``He's really taken it to a new level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the playing field, McGwire is increasing his charitable  
efforts beyond the $1 million he annually donates to his foundation 
for sexually abused children. He's working on a web site called 
``McGwire's Kids'' to debut in June or July, with information on 
various types of abuse and interviews with psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be exciting,'' McGwire said. ``I was like blown  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His preference for Starbucks coffee also led to a foundation  
that donates $5,000 to the local literacy program for each homer he 
hits, in the city where he hits it. 
</P>
<P>
	He also might assume a more vocal role in the players'  
association. Earlier this week, McGwire said he would walk away 
from the game if there was another labor stoppage after the current 
labor agreement expires, probably after the 2001 season. He's 
urging both sides to start talking now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the only role I can take is to express my opinion,''  
McGwire said. ``I don't care if you're a player or an owner, you 
have to understand we're not heading toward a good thing. Common 
sense says yes, it needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's changed his mind about writing a book -- but won't do it  
until after he retires. He said last fall he'd never write a book, 
but that was because wannabe authors were ``hounding'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to do it when I'm still playing, because there's  
still things unveiling,'' McGwire said. ``If I write a book now, 
how do I know that's what it's really going to mean to me five 
years or 10 years down the line? So, I think waiting is the best 
thing.''

<HEADLINE>  Big Mac Getting the Star Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- At 5:30 a.m. Friday, the lights were  
burning at the St. Louis Cardinals' spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	It's never too early in the day for the spotlights to shine on  
Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' yet another  
one of the TV shows clamoring to interview baseball's new home run 
king. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire chatted with host Charles Gibson about his 15-second  
visit with Pope John Paul II, discussed his boyhood hero (his 
father) and on a question relayed from Diane Sawyer, answered that 
yes, he gets sore early in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he gets through it by dunking himself daily in an  
ice tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets better as each day goes along,'' McGwire said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, McGwire appeared on NBC's ``Today'' show,  
``Late Show'' with David Letterman and Rosie O'Donnell's talk show. 
He made his acting debut on ``Mad About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```The `Today' Show was great, the Rosie show was great, they  
were all great,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	After drawing nearly 3.2 million during the 1998 regular season  
-- a team record -- the Cardinals already have sold 2,215,000 tickets 
for home game this year, up 433,000 from this point last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Their season-ticket base is up 2,100 to 20,300 despite a 12  
percent hike in prices. McGwire, who gets $1 for every home ticket 
sold above 2.8 million, figures to collect on that again. The bonus 
earned him $395,021 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Mark is not resting on his laurels, and our fans aren't  
resting on their laurels, either,'' Cardinals managing partner Bill 
DeWitt said. ``He's really taken it to a new level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the playing field, McGwire is increasing his charitable  
efforts beyond the $1 million he annually donates to his foundation 
for sexually abused children. He's working on a web site called 
``McGwire's Kids'' to debut in June or July, with information on 
various types of abuse and interviews with psychologists. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Rodman Makes His Debut With Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal finally got his wish --  
Dennis Rodman in a Lakers uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the purple and gold in his hair complementing his new  
outfit, got a brief standing ovation when he entered Friday night's 
game against the Clippers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaced Travis Knight at forward midway through the first  
quarter and, the first time he touched the ball, didn't exactly get 
a rebound and didn't exactly get an assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to grab the rebound off a miss by Shaquille O'Neal,  
Rodman fumbled the ball to O'Neal and the Los Angeles center 
dunked. 
</P>
<P>
	A few moments later, Rodman grabbed his first rebound for the  
Lakers, fed O'Neal under the basket and O'Neal dunked again. The 
crowd at the Forum rose to its feet again, some shouting, ``Dennis! 
Dennis!'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sort of rebound and feed was just what O'Neal had in mind  
when he pressed for the Lakers to sign Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said after Friday's shootaround, ``We're excited. I can't  
wait to get on the court. It's going to be fun to play with him, 
and I know he will make my life easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to the time I don't get the (defensive)  
rebound and he does, and I can just sprint away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman signed late Tuesday, so was playing with just three days  
of practice with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works hard,'' O'Neal said. ``We were trying to figure out a  
pick and he explained it. He's smart, real smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers guard Derek Fisher likes Rodman's credentials -- two NBA  
championship rings with Detroit and three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a champion and he's a winner, and I hope he can have that  
effect on us,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bertka, an assistant who has been with the Lakers for 18  
years, said Rodman's arrival reminds him of when a couple of other 
players joined the team some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to play against him when he was with Detroit in the  
'80s, then at Chicago,'' Bertka recalled. ``He brings to our team a 
veteran who's very knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think back to when Wilt (Chamberlain) came to the team, when  
Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) came, what they brought with them. They loved 
to play basketball, and now I feel that same kind of energy with 
the team. I think he's going to be very helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, asked if Rodman's rebounding would make up for any  
distractions he might cause with his bizarre behavior, said: 
``Dennis and I are alike in that we're both very good at 
marketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kobe Bryant, who has been posting some impressive rebounding  
numbers this season, said he doesn't intend to change because 
Rodman's on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it can only make the team better,'' he said. ``Why not  
have all of us crashing the boards? Why not just dominate the 
boards, and dominate the game?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman wasn't talking after the shoot-around, and a couple of  
burly men helped him push through a line of TV cameras and 
reporters at the Forum. He and the two others squeezed into a car -- 
not a limo, not a luxury car, but an aging, slightly dented Honda -- 
and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers have been through a tumultuous week, with Rodman  
attending his first practice at the same time coach Del Harris was 
being fired Wednesday. Then on the night of Rodman's first game, 
the Lakers called another press conference to announce coach Kurt 
Rambis' promotion.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Diving Star Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- She's back and, her coach says, diving better  
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu Mingxia riveted the Olympics when she became a champion at  
all of 13. She won gold medals in 1992 and 1996, then retired at 
19, tired of diving and ready for college. Now she's aiming for the 
Sydney Games next year. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 12-year-old who became the youngest diving world  
champion in 1991, Fu has grown into a confident 21-year-old with a 
ready laugh and twinkling coffee-brown eyes. She's also added gold 
tints to her black hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she resumed training only last July after two years  
without a single dive, Fu shows little sign of rust. 
</P>
<P>
	During practice this week, Fu somersaulted, twisted and splashed  
cleanly off the platform, the event in which she won her first 
Olympic gold in Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	On the springboard, she was all compact, controlled, muscular  
grace. Fu won the springboard and platform at the Atlanta Olympics 
in 1996, the first woman in 36 years to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	She likened her return to diving to learning how to bicycle.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you first start, you're all wobbly, but the more you  
ride, the smoother you become. That's the feeling,'' Fu said with a 
giggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Spotted at age 10 and brought to Beijing from her home in  
central Hubei province, Fu endured eight or nine hours of training 
a day. Such regimens are typical of China's state-sponsored sports 
machine, which tries to mold its top young athletes into champions. 
</P>
<P>
	When Fu retired after Atlanta, she said she was exhausted and --  
at age 19 -- too old. She enrolled at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua 
University and gained so much weight ``I didn't want to put on a 
swimming costume,'' she said. ``I didn't really miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Fu had second thoughts. She had shed some pounds,  
and Qinghua had set up a diving team. ``I thought I'd come along 
and give it a try, to see if it was still possible for me to be 
good,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of her first platform dive, ``I really was a little  
scared, but I had to pretend I wasn't,'' she said. ``I wasn't very 
good. My splashes were very big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, ``I've recovered very quickly, better than my coach  
and others expected. I can more or less do everything. I haven't 
forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as part of Qinghua's team, Fu trains more than four hours a  
day, with weekends off. Techno-music thumped from a boom box by the 
pool as Fu scaled the platform and dived off, over and over again. 
She laughed at fluffed dives. She looked relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu Fen, her longtime coach, said Fu is enjoying her diving and  
is more motivated than when she was younger. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's turned this -- how should I put it? -- into a job, a  
profession, a thing to pursue, a challenge, something she feels she 
has to do. It's not like in the past when everyone made her to do 
it,'' Yu said. ``Now she feels `I have to do this, and I have to do 
this well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fu is not yet as fit as she was when she retired, but  
technically she's ``even better in some areas than she was 
before,'' Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu's first test comes in March at a national competition. If all  
goes well, Olympic qualifiers are next. If she competes in Sydney, 
and again aims for the platform-springboard double, Fu could become 
the first diver to take five Olympic golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her goal, of course, is to pursue Olympic gold. An athlete who  
doesn't pursue Olympic gold is, I think, not a good athlete,'' Yu 
said. ``But this is not her only goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By studying economics management in the morning and training in  
the afternoon, Fu could challenge a belief in China that top-level 
sports and studies don't mix. She could also prove that athletes, 
many of whom retire young in China, can come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all explorations. If these explorations succeed it  
will play a good promotional role for sport in our country, 
including sports people of the future,'' Yu said. ``What Fu Mingxia 
is doing is very significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fu and Yu both add, however, that lots of hard work lies ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting from zero,'' Fu said. ``I stepped down, so now I  
have to climb back up one step at a time.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Down; Dow Off 59.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Friday for the fourth day in a  
row, as fears of higher interest rates and slower computer sales 
overshadowed positive signs of a strong economy and very low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.76 points to 9,306.58,  
ending down 33.37 for the week. The blue-chip index now sits 336 
points below its all-time closing high of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8. It is 
up 125.15, or 1.36 percent, for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators fell as well. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index lost 6.69 to 1,238.33, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index dropped 38.79 to 2,288.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors ignored lower yields in the bond market -- a  
signal of declining interest rates -- and drove prices lower after 
Compaq Computer warned analysts that sales in its small- and 
medium- business market have slowed this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's statement prompted Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse  
First Boston to cut first-quarter earnings projections for the 
company, whose shares declined 5 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange to 
35 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-makers, including IBM, Gateway and Dell Computer,  
also fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Also bothering the technology sector was Intel, which fell  
sharply after PC Data reported that Advanced Micro Devices AMD-K6 
processor-based computers outsold all Intel-based desktop PCs in 
the U.S. consumer retail market. It was the first time that Intel 
fell out of the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel skidded 7 13/16 to 119 15/16 in Nasdaq trading.  
</P>
<P>
	The decline in technology shares distracted investors from good  
economic news. The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. 
economy grew at a blistering 6.1 percent annual rate in the final 
three months of 1998, the quickest pace in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of  
goods and services, had been originally reported at 5.6 percent for 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report showed the economy growing at a faster pace  
than expected, it also showed that inflation rose just 1 percent 
last year, the slowest pace since a 0.9 percent rise in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The report boosted bond prices, which had tumbled the last three  
days on worries that the Fed might raise interest rates to keep 
inflation in check. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 
$10.94 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, which moves opposite 
the price, fell to 5.57 percent from 5.65 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks might have moved higher on the news that the economy was  
strong and interest rates falling. But the bond market had been 
battered too hard, and long-term interest rates were still up 
nearly 1/4 percentage point for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``For stocks, the key concern is interest rates,'' said Mark  
Vitner, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in 
Charlotte, N.C. Higher rates increase borrowing costs for companies 
and can put a damper on consumer spending, both bad for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the economy is strong, as the GDP report indicates it is,  
then manufacturing and transportation stocks should be rising, 
Vitner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not happening. I think there seems to be some fear in  
the markets that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, and 
going to do so at a time when the market thinks it shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in  
Minneapolis, said stock and bond investors were ``looking at 
different parts of the report. The stock market is looking at 
strong economic growth and thinking there may be rising interest 
rates. Bonds are looking at the low inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues edged out advancers on the New York Stock  
Exchange. NYSE consolidated volume totaled 933.89 million shares, 
up from 891.57 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.97 to 586.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.82 to 698.29. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.46 to 392.26. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo eased 0.71  
percent. In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX index declined 0.94 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 in London lost 0.51 percent, and the CAC in Paris 
dropped 1.44 percent.

	On Friday, more than 100 people continued what had been an  
all-night search for the fourth-grader, battling snowdrifts and 
poor visibility to comb a three-mile-wide circle of woods, lakes, 
swamps and cranberry bogs in the town about 30 miles southeast of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it's something like he just got lost and found a  
warm place to sleep for the night,'' said Corey's mother, Maria 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities searched in teams of five, their arms linked.  
Helicopters, snowmobiles, ice boats and search dogs were also used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a needle in a haystack,'' Fire Chief George Burgess  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers also went into Lake Winnecunnet, less than a mile from  
the boy's home. The lake had a thin cover of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey suffers from attention deficit disorder and missed at  
least one dose of medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight temperatures had dropped into the low 20s. The area  
had gotten a foot of snow by Friday morning. Corey was bundled up 
in two jackets, a sweater and his mother's fur-lined boots when 
left his house Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is bad, it's freezing, it's windy and he has not  
been seen since 12 o'clock yesterday,'' state police Lt. Tom Curran 
said Friday afternoon. ``There are wooded areas that are so thick 
they're almost impassable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller group was expected to search through Friday night,  
when 20 degree temperatures were forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynda Andino, the former wife of one of the child's uncles,  
described the boy as a computer whiz. And K. Gerald Smith, 
principal of the L.G. Nourse Elementary School, said Corey is known 
as a bright, witty and creative child who is ``absolutely consumed 
by video games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Corey's school Friday, the principal and two counselors  
talked with all the children during homeroom period to answer their 
questions and explain why a police command center had been set up 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers were told ``to be very honest with their emotions  
and their feelings,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> John Lewis Conducts Duke Ellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Music that Duke Ellington composed for his band  
during the Blanton-Webster years --1940 to 1942 -- floated on the air 
again when John Lewis conducted the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet, was a  
teen-ager when he first heard the Ellington Band. That dance 
concert, in 1939 in Albuquerque, N.M., has stayed with him all his 
life. He called the compositions by Ellington and Billy Strayhorn 
``the most beautiful music I know. And it's ours. America's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis played piano for ``Bojangles,'' Ellington's musical  
portrait of dancer Bill Robinson, and an encore, ``Duke's Place.'' 
Wynton Marsalis played trumpet twice, on a rocking ``Perdido'' and 
on ``Concerto for Cootie,'' composed for trumpeter Cootie Williams. 
He played an exquisite section not used when the piece, with 
lyrics, became ``Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Ellington changed arrangements. But Thursday  
night, at Alice Tully Hall, the arrangement matched those of the 
early '40s when bassist Jimmy Blanton and tenor saxophonist Ben 
Webster charged the band. 
</P>
<P>
	Strayhorn's ``Chelsea Bridge'' was thrillingly beautiful.  
Ellington's ``Warm Valley'' and ``Ko Ko'' flowed like honey. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening began with sounds of instruments swirling in ``Sepia  
Panorama,'' in a way Ellington enjoyed. The music was bright and 
sharp, though not driving. Ellington's evocative ballad, ``All Too 
Soon,'' conjured thoughts of a romantic woman in chiffon and high 
heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington wrote ``Jack the Bear'' for Blanton, who introduced a  
melodic way to play bass beyond keeping rhythm. Webster 
collaborated with Ellington on ``Cottontail,'' a rouser driven by a 
saxophone that closed the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, part of the ``Ellington Centennial,'' celebrates  
Ellington's music during the 100th anniversary year of his birth. 
He died at 75 in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Restaurant Ski Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) -- An early morning fire broke out at an  
empty ski resort near Lake Tahoe on Friday, destroying a 
mountaintop restaurant and causing at least $1.5 million damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was injured in the fire that destroyed the Summit Deck  
and Grill at the top of the Northstar Ski Resort on Mount Pluto. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters climbed the mountain in all-terrain snow cats after  
a worker grooming the slopes reported the flames at 3:51 a.m. They 
ended up letting the fire burn itself out. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause remained under investigation. Arson was not suspected.  
</P>
<P>
	``The one nice thing was the timing. Nobody was here. Nobody was  
hurt,'' said Kelli Twomey, a spokeswoman for the resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Two chair lifts were closed until about 10:30 a.m., but  
otherwise things were back to normal by midday at the Sierra Nevada 
resort between Truckee and Tahoe City, Twomey said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Jordan Knows His Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- It's a lonely life for bench players  
like Kevin Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Their idols are not Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio or Hank Aaron,  
because they can relate much better to Jim Eisenreich and Rusty 
Staub. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who led the Philadelphia Phillies in pinch-hits for the  
second straight year in 1998, leads a group of role players who are 
among the best and most versatile in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to play every day,'' said Jordan, third in the  
NL with 15 pinch hits last season. ``I don't think anyone when 
they're coming through the minors, one of their goals is to come up 
and be a pinch hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, valuable not only for his bat but for his versatility as  
a backup infielder, learned from pinch-hitter extraordinaire Jim 
Eisenreich when the left-handed specialist played in Philadelphia. 
Getting 200 at-bats a year isn't what Jordan dreamed of when he was 
playing DiMaggio League baseball and in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my role, but it can change day to day,'' Jordan said of  
his pinch-hitting duties. ``We have to be ready, because we might 
be called upon to start every day for a week and we might have to 
sit down every day for a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The life of a part-time major leaguer isn't always glamorous.  
Phillies manager Terry Francona knows, because he did it for 10 
years. Told that he would never start again after Montreal released 
him in 1985, Francona reached 100 at-bats only once in his last 
five seasons with four teams -- the Cubs, Cincinnati, Cleveland and 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the hardest thing that I ever did,'' Francona said.  
``That was harder for me than quitting baseball. My wife said for 
two years, she thought I was a caged animal. When I retired -- or, I 
like to say, when they retired me -- I didn't miss baseball anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever heard of a young kid who said it was his dream to be the  
lefty off the bench?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe Francona handles his bench so well because he's been  
there. The 39-year-old manager makes sure there's always a coach 
working with the reserves, and he makes Jordan, Kevin Sefcik and 
Arias feel as though they're a big part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, maybe it's because he was a backup guy,'' Jordan  
said. ``He's the kind of guy that you want to play hard for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francona said Arias, the backup shortstop behind Desi Relaford,  
will probably pinch-hit more than last year. Jordan, 15-for-54 
(.278) as a pinch-hitter with two homers and 10 RBIs last year, 
remains the top option off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives you a quality at-bat against any pitcher,'' Francona  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sefcik, who backs up Doug Glanville in center field, is solid  
defensively and batted .314 last year in a part-time role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who outworks Sefcik?'' Francona asked. ``Nobody.''  
</P>
<P>
	While this bench brigade won't make as much in their careers as  
Kevin Brown gets in his new $100 million contract, the Phillies 
tried to give them some security. Sefcik and Arias signed two-year 
contracts after last season. Jordan was offered a similar contract, 
but opted for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that we discussed, I just didn't take one,''  
Jordan said. ``In the future, it's something that, yeah, I'd like 
to stay in Philadelphia. It was the Phillies that gave me a chance 
to play in the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it's only a part-time job.

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Pull Fast One on Clemens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Clemens was actually smiling on the  
mound Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young winner was facing minor league catcher  
Jaime Torres during his first live batting practice stint with the 
New York Yankees when new teammates Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch 
appeared in full catcher's gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The gag went unnoticed by Clemens, who was locked in on pitching  
to Torres, until Knoblauch entered the cage. That prompted a smile, 
a tip of the cap and pitch softly throw behind the second baseman's 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw his normal pitch up ... a pitch Jeter and I have seen  
before,'' Knoblauch said. ``We were having a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens worked on all his pitches during a 10-minute bullpen  
stint and threw 58 pitches during the 13-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew eventually something would be up ... I think it was a  
good move by them, actually,'' Clemens joked. ``So to make them 
feel right at home, I went ahead and threw those ones behind 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Knoblauch both were hit by Clemens pitches in the past  
and vowed to get even when the Yankees obtained him from Toronto 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past is over with,'' Jeter said. ``He's part of the team.  
We know it ... he knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When informed that Knoblauch had said ``it will take us a while  
to catch up,'' Clemens replied he will ask pitching coach Mel 
Stottlemyre to have the pair assigned to his batting practice group 
if things get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that figures. I didn't think I would get off that  
easy,'' Clemens said. ``They better be careful, because sometimes I 
don't miss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said Clemens will likely start either  
March 6 against Boston or March 7 against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Other starters throwing batting practice Friday were David Cone,  
Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez. All three reported no problems 
following their workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte is scheduled to throw off a bullpen mound on  
Saturday. The left-hander missed his BP session Wednesday because 
of elbow tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, said Pettitte, who played catch Friday. ``I'm  
trying to talk them into letting me throw batting practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Jimmy Key watch is over. Torre said the left-hander has  
decided not to change his decision to retire. Although not ruling 
out a trade, the Yankees will look closely at filling from within 
the bullpen spot vacated by the trade of Graeme Lloyd to Toronto. 
``I think we have to find out what we have here and if we can get 
the job done,'' Torre said. ... Torre, who was traded from Atlanta 
to St. Louis for Orlando Cepeda in 1969, would love to see the 
veterans' committee select Cepeda on Tuesday for Hall of Fame 
induction. ... Clemens and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner talked 
briefly in the outfield. It was their first meeting since last 
week's trade. ``I think it's neat to have him show up when you're 
working out,'' Clemens said. ... Yankees general manager Brian 
Cashman said there is no news regarding contract negotiations with 
Ramiro Mendoza and Jorge Posada. Both can renewed by the team next 
month.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Get Speedy Womack From Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks finally traded for the  
leadoff man they wanted, getting NL stolen base leader Tony Womack 
from the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday for a minor league outfielder 
and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks had been trying for weeks to get Womack, the NL  
steals leader the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But a deal that would have sent the second baseman and  
outfielder Al Martin to Arizona for outfielder Bernard Gilkey fell 
through Tuesday when Gilkey refused to re-work a contract worth $11 
million in base salary and deferred payments in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was all over, and it felt like a great weight had  
been lifted off my shoulders,'' Womack said. ``It's disappointing 
to me. I like Pittsburgh. I like playing for the Pirates. No 
disrespect intended to the Arizona Diamondbacks, but I was happy 
where I was at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, 29, will be asked to play right field with Arizona, a  
prospect that makes him apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played some outfield but it's been center field,'' he  
said. ``I've never played right field. It's going to be tough 
trying to learn a new position and coming to a new team at the same 
time. I'm flattered Arizona wants me, but it's going to be an 
adjustment on a couple of fronts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona used Tony Batista, Andy Fox and Jay Bell at second base  
last year as an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for Womack, the Pirates received outfielder Paul  
Weichard, 19, who hit .293 with 28 RBIs and 19 stolen bases in 54 
games with the Diamondbacks' rookie team at Lethbridge, Alberta, 
last year. The native of Australia is a switch-hitter and was 
signed by Arizona as a non-drafted free agent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks went on a $119 million spending spree in the  
offseason, adding free agents Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre, 
Steve Finley and Greg Swindell, but lacked a leadoff hitter with 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The addition of Tony Womack shifts us into a different gear,''  
said Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. ``The speed he 
possesses brings another dimension to our club and makes for a much 
more balanced offensive attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, who started five games in center field for the Pirates  
last season, stole 60 bases in 1997 and 58 in 1998. The 
Diamondbacks, by comparison, stole 73 bases in their inaugural 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack was expendable because the Pirates are grooming Warren  
Morris as their second baseman of the future. Veteran Mike Benjamin 
is expected to start the season at second, but Morris, acquired 
from the Texas organization last July in a trade for pitcher 
Esteban Loaiza, could be in the big leagues by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who hit a combined .331 with 19 homers and 103 RBIs last  
season in 139 games with Texas' Double-A Tulsa club and 
Pittsburgh's Double-A Carolina affiliate, is also considered a 
better fielder than Womack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made this trade for the future,'' Pirates General Manager  
Cam Bonifay said. ``We feel we have the opportunity to put the 
total package at second base in the future (in Morris). We could be 
as sound at second base as we've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Womack batted .282 with three home runs and 45 RBIs in 159 games  
last season. He made his debut with the Pirates in 1993 and has a 
career average of .278 with nine homers, 103 RBIs and 122 stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack made $290,000 last year. He has a $1.65 million, one-year  
contract that covers this year.

<HEADLINE> Washington Traffic Is Getting Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Your typical bureaucrat has trouble getting  
from here to there. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, so does everyone else who must drive around the  
nation's capital. And things are about to get much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists flocking to see the monuments, museums and government  
institutions already face traffic so bad the city is second only to 
the gridlock capital of the country, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Truckers running goods up and down the East Coast on Interstate  
95 also try desperately to hit the capital when traffic is less; it 
is almost never really light. 
</P>
<P>
	Area residents cope with commutes timed around carpool-lane  
restrictions, while government motorcades throw another roadblock 
into motorists' progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, to speed their journey, people stop by informal ``slug  
lines'' on routes out of the city to fill their cars with strangers 
waiting for a lift; that qualifies the vehicle for express lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the Texas Transportation Institute concluded  
that District of Columbia commuters waste the equivalent of two 
full work weeks each year sitting in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	As bad as the traffic is, two road projects are about to make it  
worse for the locals and visitors alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is preparing to rebuild the massive I-95/I-395/I-495  
interchange just southwest of the capital. Much like Chicago's 
highway ``Spaghetti Bowl,'' the multilane jumble connects traffic 
running in and out of Washington with the famed Capital Beltway 
encircling the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Reworking what is called the ``Mixing Bowl'' will cost $350  
million and take eight years. During that time, planners say, the 
construction could add up to a half-hour each way for commuters 
unless 2,500 motorists can be persuaded to use mass transit or car 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers also are completing a $1.8 billion plan to replace the  
Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Part of the I-95 portion of the Beltway, it 
spans the Potomac River and connects Virginia, Washington and 
Maryland just upstream from George Washington's old home, Mount 
Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	The metal-grid drawbridge was designed to carry 75,000 cars per  
day. It is crumbling under the weight of 190,000 vehicles every day 
and has become the region's Achilles heel. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, gridlock tied up roads within a 25-mile radius  
of the Wilson Bridge when police shut it down because a man was 
threatening to jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though there was a life at stake, and police thought the  
man had a firearm, travelers complained vigorously about the 
inconvenience. The bridge replacement is expected to take six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either one of them alone would be enough to cause an enormous  
impact. Together, I can't even guess how horrible it's going to 
be,'' said Ron Shaffer, a commuting columnist for The Washington 
Post known affectionately as ``Dr. Gridlock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Area road experts say the region and all who travel through it  
suffer from poor road planning, Washington's popularity as a 
tourist destination and the simple abundance of vehicles found in 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the '50s and '60s, planners said we would need three  
beltways. We built one and did away with the other two, and now we 
have the second worst gridlock in the nation,'' said Lon Anderson, 
spokesman for AAA's Potomac club. 
</P>
<P>
	Relieving the congestion creates a Hobson's choice: ``If we  
don't do this, we're in horrible shape; if we do it, we're in 
horrible shape,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic is such a part of capital life that the city's primary  
all-news radio station broadcasts traffic reports every 10 minutes, 
24 hours a day, 365 days a year, as is done in other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Like their counterparts in other congested areas, Washington  
commuters also have come up with novel solutions for coping with 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pick up strangers from the ``slug lines'' at the Pentagon  
so they can qualify for three-person carpool lanes running out of 
the city in the afternoon. Others pull over into the breakdown lane 
at the entrance to the carpool lanes, waiting for the stroke of 6 
p.m., when the three-person limit is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaffer said he is amazed by the shortcuts people devise.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like water that seeks the point of least common  
resistance,'' he said. ``They will find that leak in the foundation 
and slip through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other way the locals cope is by beginning their commute very  
early or very late -- an option not available to others traveling 
through the area.

<P>
	John Wack, a computer furniture salesman, starts his 65-mile  
drive from Fredericksburg, Va., to Bethesda, Md., either by 5:15 
a.m. or after 9 a.m. If he wants to make it home for dinner, he 
must leave the office by 3 p.m. or else wait for 7 p.m. and brace 
himself for leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would compare Washington to what San Francisco was like  
after the earthquake -- when many of the roads had collapsed,'' Wack 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton today outlined a foreign  
policy of active involvement overseas -- from China to Kosovo -- for 
the final two years of his administration, saying Americans ``must 
embrace the inexorable logic of globalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also offered a defense of China on the same day that the  
State Department reported a sharp erosion of human rights in that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything from the strength of our economy, to the safety of  
our cities, to the health of our people depends on events not only 
within our border but half a world away,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides billed the president's speech to California business and  
policy leaders as a major address laying out his goals for the 
remainder of his term. The bloody conflict in Kosovo, where his 
administration has yet to cement a peace deal despite Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright's intercession and an offer of U.S. 
peacekeepers, was a centerpiece of Clinton's outline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is not an easy problem,'' Clinton said today. ``But if  
we don't stop the conflict now, it clearly will spread. And then, 
we will not be able to stop it except at far greater cost and 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke on the West Coast as the State Department released  
in Washington its annual human rights report to Congress. The 
coincident timing put Clinton in the awkward position of defending 
China -- and his policy of engagement with the communist giant -- at 
the same time his administration reported a sharp deterioration in 
that's country's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	A crackdown on political dissent late last year reversed recent  
signs of improvement, the State Department found. Clinton tried to 
find an explanation in China's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``China's rate of economic growth is declining just as it is  
needed to create jobs for a growing and increasingly more mobile 
population,'' Clinton said. ``We can see in China the kinds of 
problems a society faces when it is moving away from the rule of 
fear but is not yet rooted in the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing to defend his engagement, without interruption by  
applause, Clinton said: ``Sooner or later China will have to come 
to understand that society and the world we're living in ... simply 
cannot purchase stability at the expense of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, we have to ask ourselves: What is the best  
thing to do to try to maximize the chance that China will take the 
right course?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the impeachment trial over, Clinton has found himself more  
easily able to involve himself in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has faced criticism over the continued standoff  
with Iraq and the peace talks on Kosovo. The speech, however, was 
being portrayed as a call to press ahead with existing policy, not 
as a sign of a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton touted accomplishments, he also admitted to some  
frustrations in a separate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no progress, although I've tried, in trying to get  
Greece and Turkey to get along,'' he said late Thursday night. 
``I've made no progress in trying to resolve the tensions between 
India and Pakistan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton also mentioned this year's entry into NATO of the  
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. He called expanding the Western 
alliance one way of giving other nations ``incentive to deepen 
their democracy.'' Another topic was the importance of fully 
integrating nations such as Russia and China into the world 
economic scheme if the United States and Europe are to have stable 
relations with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the address, Clinton was meeting with William Perry, the  
former defense secretary, to hear his views on U.S. policy toward 
North Korea, where Perry recently visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent a busy Thursday traveling from Washington to  
Arizona, giving a speech in Tucson on Social Security and Medicare. 
He then traveled to San Francisco to raise $1 million for House and 
Senate Democrats.	   At the fund-raiser, he delivered an upbeat message about the 
Democrats' prospects for regaining control of Congress in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But in praising the perseverance of party leaders like House  
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, he suggested that the Democrats 
who left Congress after the Republican victories in 1994 lacked 
conviction in their party's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, frankly ... they just quit,'' Clinton said.  
``I'll say this for the Republicans, they don't quit. Strom 
Thurmond and Jesse Helms don't quit, right? And a lot of our guys, 
they had a hard time, so they just ... left their careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond is a Republican senator from South Carolina. Helms  
represents North Carolina in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson Building Dallas Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ericsson, maker of mobile phones and other  
telecommunications equipment, is moving more than half of its 3,000 
Dallas-area workers from the ``Telecom Corridor'' to another 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish company announced Friday it will build a  
500,000-square-foot office complex in Plano just south of J.C. 
Penney's corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson joins several other major employer in the Telecom  
Corridor of Richardson, Texas, that are planning to relocate 
operations to Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel USA announced in November that it would move its U.S.  
headquarters and 1,500 workers. More recently, Fujitsu said it will 
move 250 jobs and a divisional headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson officials said they have signed a letter of intent to  
acquire a 35-acre plot with an option to buy up to 110 acres more. 
About 1,700 Ericsson employees will work in the new facility. The 
move is expected to be completed by mid-2001.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Gold Medalist Lewis Shines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Three years ago, Steve Lewis had a cyst on his  
lower back that was ``as big as a sausage,'' and if he didn't have 
surgery he might not have been able to walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lewis, winner of three Olympic gold medals and one silver  
medal, again appears to be among the world's fastest 
quarter-milers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not finished making history yet,'' Lewis said Friday after  
winning his section of the 400 meters in 46.38 seconds in the USA 
Indoor Track and Field Championships at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning, the 29-year-old Lewis advanced to Saturday's final  
against a field that will include Milt Campbell, who qualified in 
45.75, the fastest by an American this year, and Angelo Taylor 
(45.91), the 1998 NCAA 400-meter hurdles champion from Georgia 
Tech. Derek Mills, the 1997 USA indoor champion, won his heat but 
didn't advance because his time of 46.70 wasn't among the six 
fastest. 
</P>
<P>
	While Campbell, Taylor and Mills have been running without much  
interruption in recent years, Lewis' career was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, he ran his first indoor race in five years and  
ran under control, winning a low-key event in 46.48. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, there was a lot more at stake -- and Lewis was ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good,'' he said, after easing up at the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	His two performances within a week are a testament to his strong  
determination. He thought about quitting running before his 
operation because ``I was so weak,'' he said, ``I couldn't even 
work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had a virus,'' Lewis said. ``Then, I had an MRI.''  
</P>
<P>
	The test showed the huge cyst that was affecting nerves in his  
body and legs, weakening him completely. Because of the way it was 
situated, Lewis said he could not feel the cyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was embedded in my spine, and it was expanding,'' he said.  
``I couldn't even jog a mile because I was in such pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed in April 1996 and Lewis was  
incapacitated for a year, unable to work out, train or exercise. He 
resumed training in April 1997, competed sporadically that year and 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is pain free and coming back full time in a quest to  
regain the stature he held in 1988 when he won gold medals in the 
400 and 1,600 relay, and in 1992, when he was the silver medalist 
in the 400 and earned another relay gold. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins or finishes second in Saturday's final, he would earn  
a place on the U.S. team for next week's World Indoor Championships 
at Maebashi, Japan. His last international team appearance was at 
the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said that if hadn't been injured, he might have quit after  
a possible third Olympics in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't feel I've reached my potential,'' he said. ``I  
don't feel too old to accomplish things. I feel I have a lot more 
in me. I feel I still have it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a runner, it's hard to stop because of injuries.''  
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there's no quit in Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to find the old Steve Lewis,'' he said. ``That will  
save the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still there.''  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the trials in the men's 400, trials were held in  
the women's 400 and the men's and women's 200 and 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Little, the 1997 world champion in the men's 200, won his  
heat comfortably in 20.59. Tyree Washington, the 1997 world outdoor 
bronze medalist in the 400, also qualified for Saturday's final in 
the 200, finishing second in his heat in 20.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the defending world champion in the women's  
400, easily won her heat in 53.12 and advanced to Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister-in-law, Joetta Clark, the defending U.S. champion in  
the women's 800, and Meredith Valmon, the 1991 national champion, 
won their heats. Clark was timed in 2:05.15 and Valmon in 2:06.45. 
</P>
<P>
	While Valmon was running, her 19-month-old son Travis was asleep  
in the stands with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a little distressed when I run,'' Valmon said,  
``especially when he can see that I'm tired. He doesn't always like 
it. So it's better that he slept through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Kenah, the 1997 world indoor and outdoor bronze medalist in  
the men's 800, also qualified for Saturday's final, finishing 
second in his heat in 1:49.44.

	Twenty-nine championship finals will be held Saturday.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Says Diaper Prevents Rash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble believes parents will be  
willing to pay 50 percent more for a diaper the company says has 
been medically proven to prevent and treat diaper rash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pampers Rash Guard diaper, which started arriving in stores  
last week, contains strips treated with petrolatum, found in 
petroleum jelly, and stearate, a skin conditioner. The new diaper 
can still absorb waste because not all areas are treated with the 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaper rash is caused partly by wetness, which causes irritation  
and abrasion of the baby's skin, leading sometimes to sores that 
require medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our consumer research has shown us not only that diaper rash  
is a painful and common ailment for children, but it causes a 
genuine misery for parents, who feel guilty over not being able to 
prevent their children's suffering,'' company spokesman Scott 
Stewart said Friday. ``This is a way to help both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jumbo package of 36 treated diapers costs about $13.25, the  
same as the average price of a package of 56 of the company's basic 
diapers. That works out to about 37 cents for each Rash Guard 
diaper compared with 24 cents for the standard product. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be willing to try anything I thought would help, but  
the added expense may keep some people from trying it,'' said Dena 
Smith, the mother of a 6-month-old girl and an aide at Hope Early 
Childhood Center in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	One doctor who has three children, including an 8-month-old,  
isn't ready to recommend Rash Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a skeptic. My first impression is that I'm not sure I  
would be willing to pay the price for the product,'' said Dr. Anita 
Sheth, director of pediatric dermatology at Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary thing for prevention is really good hygiene and  
changing diapers frequently,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies, the nation's most  
popular diapers, said it is monitoring the impact of the new diaper 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing difficult about coating a diaper with  
petrolatum and stearate, but we welcome competitiveness,'' said 
company spokeswoman Wendy Strong.

<HEADLINE> Nobel-Winner Glenn Seaborg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glenn Seaborg, the Nobel Prize-winning  
chemist who discovered 10 atomic elements including plutonium and 
one that now bears his name, has died. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg died Thursday night at his home in Lafayette, near  
Berkeley, where he had been convalescing since August, when he 
suffered a stroke while being honored at an American Chemical 
Society meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Seaborg was a true giant of the 20th century, a legend in  
the annals of scientific discovery,'' Berkeley Lab Director Charles 
Shank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg, who worked on the Manhattan Project that unleashed the  
atomic bomb during World War II, went on to campaign for the 
peaceful use of atomic energy and against the testing of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the laboratory, he served as chairman of the Atomic  
Energy Commission, forerunner to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
from 1961-1971. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was in the lab, mostly at the University of California,  
Berkeley, that Seaborg gained renown as one of the century's 
greatest scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with  
the late Edwin McMillan for research into the transuranium elements 
(those beyond uranium on the periodic table), Seaborg received the 
National Medal of Science in 1991, the nation's highest award for 
scientific achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of No. 94, plutonium, happened on a stormy night  
in February 1941 when he, McMillan, Joseph Kennedy and Arthur Wahl 
bombarded a sample of uranium with deuterons and transmuted it into 
the new element. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, joined by Emilio Segre, the team identified the  
isotope plutonium-239 and showed that it was fissionable. That made 
it the candidate to be the explosive ingredient in a bomb as well 
as the fuel for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he have any idea what they had accomplished at the time?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always asked that question,'' Seaborg said in a 1997  
Associated Press interview. ``I was a 28-year-old kid and I didn't 
stop to ruminate about it. I didn't think, `My God, we've changed 
the history of the world.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Seaborg formulated a concept of the structure of heavy  
elements that was called one of most significant changes in the 
periodic table since Mendeleev's 19th century design. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg and his colleagues used this concept as a stepping stone  
to the creation of other heavy ``transuranium'' elements, including 
americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, 
mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``seaborgium'' was officially accepted as the name for  
element 106 in August 1997, it was the first time an element had 
ever been named for a living person. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a great honor because that lasts forever,'' Seaborg  
said in a 1997 interview. ``One hundred years from now, or a 
thousand years from now, it'll still be seaborgium when you'd 
probably have to look in obscure books to find any references to 
what I had done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Seaborg's fingerprints are all over 20th century history.  
</P>
<P>
	His colleague Albert Ghiorso, who with Kenneth Hulet, Seaborg  
and others co-discovered element 106, said Seaborg's scientific 
brilliance, way with words and administrative aplomb made him a 
good ambassador for his field. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg earned a chemistry degree from UCLA before moving on to  
Berkeley, a mecca for the burgeoning world of nuclear science. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole atmosphere at Berkeley was just like magic to me,''  
Seaborg said in 1997. ``I just felt like I was in a new world, 
transported to a kind of Valhalla.''

<HEADLINE> Joy Overcomes Hate in Jasper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- One family was vindicated, another  
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trial and death sentence of racist John King united the  
families of the black victim and the white killer in one important 
way: Both agree it's time for the hate to end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all are human beings, black and white. We all are children  
of God,'' King's ailing father, Ronald King, said in a written 
statement after his son was sentenced to die for dragging James 
Byrd Jr. to death last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must learn to love one another,'' he said, ``and not  
hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett, said she hoped the death sentence  
would send ``a message throughout the world that hate crimes must 
stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, her heart goes out to King's father.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can understand his loss,'' she said. ``But what we have to  
realize is that it was his son that made the choice to bring this 
pain upon his father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Kings and the Byrds, not all in this rural east Texas  
community agreed on King's punishment, but most were grateful for a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't ask the Lord to give him the death penalty,'' said  
the Rev. Bobby Hudson, a Baptist who opposes capital punishment. 
``We're going to get on with life, regardless. You can't show in 
the Bible where one man or one incident stopped people from getting 
on with life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethel Parks, who celebrated the sentence by exchanging a  
high-five with another woman on the courthouse lawn, said she 
usually opposes the death penalty. ``But in this case I can make an 
exception,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, King's sentencing is only the first stitch in an open  
wound. Two more suspects, Shawn Berry and Lawrence Brewer, are 
still to be tried for Byrd's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got a lot to go through,'' said Jasper resident  
Jim Saari. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite having to endure two more trials, Byrd's sister, Clara  
Taylor, said some good already has come out of her brother's death 
and King's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks and whites are beginning to talk, and the problem of race  
is no longer taboo. Perhaps, she said, the wound can be healed 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we all work together in our own communities, we can  
hopefully prevent other John Kings from carrying out their hateful 
acts toward other individuals,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Health Workers Vote on Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Years of campaigning paid off with one of  
labor's biggest victories in decades -- a landslide vote to unionize 
74,000 Los Angeles County workers who care for elderly and disabled 
residents in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day whose time has been a long time in coming,''  
David Rolf, deputy general manager of the Service Employees 
International Union, said of Thursday's voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters were jubilant at the final tally: 16,200 votes in  
favor of unionizing and 1,925 against in one of the nation's 
largest such votes in years. Experts said the vote showed a new 
commitment by organized labor to focus on women, minorities and 
low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders and observers said it would lead to better wages,  
which in turn will result in better care as fewer people would 
require long-term stays in hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are very happy,'' union member Steve Trossman said.  
``It's a good day for home care workers and home care consumers 
because this a major step toward improving the quality of home care 
for people in L.A. and California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote involves county workers like Cecilia Rivas who tend to  
the personal needs of about 80,000 elderly and disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rivas said she has considered quitting her $5.75-per-hour  
job but worries about what would become of the 90-year-old man who 
relies on her for everything from trimming his toenails to 
preparing his meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers are paid minimum wage primarily from local, state  
and federal funds, although some patients pay a portion of their 
care providers' wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm almost speechless. For more than a decade we have  
struggled,'' said Verdia Daniels, president of fledgling Local 
434-B and a homecare worker for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote means more tax money will be spent on benefits and  
higher pay for homecare workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It will save money in the long run, said Harley Shaiken, a  
University of California, Berkeley professor specializing in labor 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Higher wages will attract a more stable and more professional  
group of people to home health care and to the extent that people 
remain in their homes, it is significantly cheaper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union will negotiate with a county agency created to  
regulate the industry. Homecare workers have formed locals in five 
California counties in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and AFL-CIO officials say it is the biggest union drive  
since 1937, the year General Motors workers joined the United Auto 
Workers after the historic sit-down strike of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaiken said the vote also highlights the significance of women  
and ethnic minorities to a national labor movement still trying to 
regain ground lost during the 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It indicates a major success in a new and important economy in  
the service sector,'' he said. ``It reflects the new face of 
labor.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to HIV Exposure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A man accused of exposing more than a  
dozen young women in upstate New York to the virus that causes AIDS 
has pleaded guilty to statutory rape of a 13-year-old and having 
unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Nushawn Williams, 21, faces up to 12 years in prison after  
pleading guilty Friday in Chautauqua County to two counts of 
second-degree rape and a charge of reckless endangerment. 
Sentencing was set for April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams already has pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment for  
having unprotected sex with a New York City high school student. He 
could get up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on that 
charge April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's confidentiality laws prevent people who are HIV  
positive from being identified. But in October 1997, concerned 
health officials took the extraordinary step of identifying 
Williams in a poster campaign aimed at warning his sex partners 
that he may have given them the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chautauqua County health department was being besieged with  
calls from worried residents. Authorities there have said Williams 
infected nine of at least 28 sex partners with the HIV virus, six 
of them knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
	State Health Department officials said a sweeping HIV-reporting  
and partner notification program is expected to begin in the spring 
in response to the Williams case. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is currently serving a one- to three-year prison  
sentence for selling cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants 'Cyber Stalking' Fought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called Friday for a  
fight against ``cyber stalking,'' saying the Internet has 
inadvertently become a sinister new avenue for carrying out 
violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference in the Roosevelt Room, Gore asked  
Attorney General Janet Reno to study cyber stalking, the practice 
of using the Internet's vast reach to harass someone, and report 
back in 90 days on how to guard against it without infringing on 
First Amendment rights to free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is presenting us with some cases we have never  
seen before,'' Gore said. ``And make no mistake -- this kind of 
harassment can be as frightening and as real as being followed and 
watched in your neighborhood or in your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the story of a California man who, angry that a woman  
spurned him, retaliated by assuming her identity and distributing 
personal information about her in a number of sex chat rooms on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ... listed directions to her house, gave details of her  
social plans, and even provided advice on how to short-circuit her 
alarm system,'' Gore said. ``Within days, this terrified woman was 
not only receiving lewd phone calls, she had men showing up on her 
doorstep. She could have been sexually assaulted or even worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called for the cyber stalking report after announcing $223  
million in grants to communities to help them provide services to 
victims of domestic violence and foster collaboration between 
victims' advocates, prosecutors, police officers and judges in 
handling domestic abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not just family matters, these are crimes,'' Gore  
said. ``As a society, as a country, as a national family, we don't 
have to put up with this kind of abuse, and we will not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by Reno and Health and Human Services Secretary  
Donna Shalala, who both said there has been a sea change in 
authorities' attitudes toward battered women but that much work 
remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is so important that times have changed,'' Reno said. But,  
``we cannot become complacent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said $138 million will go to 56 states and territories  
under the S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women program, to strengthen 
the criminal justice system's response to violence against women. 
States must allocate at least 25 percent of the money to law 
enforcement, prosecutors and victim services. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $62 million will go to battered women's shelters,  
through HHS, for counseling, legal assistance, emergency aid such 
as transportation or meals and referral services for women and 
children seeking to escape a violent home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, $23 million will go to 32 states and five territories to  
coordinate criminal justice efforts against domestic violence such 
as creating centralized units of police, prosecutors and judiciary 
officials to handle those cases.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Lansing Overcomes Palsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Mike Lansing's first year with the Colorado  
Rockies left him little reason to smile. Shortly after the season 
ended, he literally became incapable of mustering any kind of grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't smile,'' Lansing said Friday, describing his bout  
with Bell's palsy. ``This (left) side would smile and this (right) 
side would go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's palsy is a temporary facial paralysis that has no warning  
signs and affects one in 5,000 Americans. Lansing learned about it 
in November after he began having trouble moving his mouth while 
brushing his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bit my lip an awful lot,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The paralysis lasted nearly a month, and Lansing said he is just  
about fully recovered. In about 80 percent of all cases, Bell's 
palsy patients have complete, spontaneous recovery within four 
months, according to medical research. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you didn't know I had it, you wouldn't know at all,''  
Lansing said. ``It doesn't give me any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The onset of Bell's palsy came following a disappointing season  
with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first year of a $23.25 million, four-year contract,  
Lansing got off to a slow start before finishing the year with a 
.276 average with 12 homers and 66 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he said it was unrelated to his sub-par season, Lansing  
underwent corrective eye surgery on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	A contact lens wearer since the ninth grade, the 31-year-old  
Lansing said he wanted to have the laser surgery partly because he 
got frustrated with constantly administering eyedrops between 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``San Francisco's a prime example. It's the worst.'' Lansing  
said of the Bay area's renowned winds. ``If you get some dirt in 
there, you can't see and then your contacts dry out so quick that 
you could be trying to blink and you miss a pitch, or you're on 
defense and you miss something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With surgery, Lansing's vision went from 20/200 to about 20/20 --  
a result that he says was worth the risk of the increasingly 
popular, but still unproven, procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	To help put his mind at ease, Lansing did his own research and  
specifically requested Englewood, Colo., Dr. Lawrence Spivack. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I'd heard and looked into, he's considered one of  
the best in the country because he's been doing it for so long,'' 
Lansing said. ``He knew that I played baseball and he knew what my 
worries were and he was very sympathetic to that and reassured me. 
That made me feel a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing joins a growing list of baseball players and managers  
who have had laser eye surgery. The group includes San Diego's 
Wally Joyner and his manager Bruce Bochy. Both went under the laser 
this offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking, I've got a couple more years to play. I've  
played with these bad eyes all my career,'' Joyner said last week. 
``If there's a possibility of getting better eyesight, let's see if 
it helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it doesn't improve Lansing's batting average this  
season, the eye surgery -- which can cost anywhere from $2,000 to 
$4,000 -- won't be a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing is to wake up in the middle of the night and  
look over and I can see the alarm clock without going, `What time 
is it?''' Lansing said.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Can Vote on Tyco Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- AlliedSignal Inc., rejected in its hostile  
bid to acquire AMP Inc., will get to vote on Tyco International 
Ltd.'s $11.3 billion agreement to buy the maker of electrical 
components, a federal appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal already owns 200 million shares, or 9.1 percent, of  
AMP, that it purchased before making a $10 billion bid for 
Harrisburg, Pa.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that  
AlliedSignal could not vote as a shareholder because of a 1990 
state anti-takeover law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law says purchasers of more than 20 percent of a company's  
stock cannot vote the stock without getting the approval of the 
remaining shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Though AlliedSignal bought less than 20 percent, U.S. District  
Judge James T. Giles had ruled that its shares were ``control 
shares'' because they were bought with intent to make an 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the appeals court ruled on Feb. 18 that the law  
requires ``actual acquisition of at least 20 percent of the 
outstanding shares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMP officials did not return calls Friday for comment on the  
likely impact of the ruling when AMP shareholders meet April 1 to 
vote on the Tyco bid. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal has not decided how it will vote, said Mark  
Greenberg, a spokesman for the Morristown, N.J.,-based maker of 
aerospace and automotive products, chemicals and high-tech 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with ruling,'' said Greenberg, though he would  
not predict whether it would change anything. ``We only own nine 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMP agreed in November to accept the $11.3 billion bid by Tyco  
International, a Bermuda-based provider of electronic security 
services and a manufacturer of flow control valves.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Say King Posed Future Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The photographs of James Byrd Jr.'s  
mutilated body were appalling and almost too much for juror Lequeta 
Flowers to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	She and 11 other jurors spent days listening to brutal racist  
language and looking at horrifying crime scene photos. The 
41-year-old school teacher said she found strength to endure the 
evidence in the words of prosecutor Guy James Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept remembering what Mr. Gray said, `This is hard, but you  
can do it.' I kept telling myself that because I was thinking I 
can't turn this page,'' Flowers said, referring to an evidence 
booklet containing dozens of photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated less than three hours Thursday before  
sentencing John King to die by injection rather than spend life in 
prison for the June 7 dragging death of Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors had to find that King intended to kill Byrd, that  
King was a future danger to society and that no mitigating 
circumstances warranted a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Collins, the lone black juror and the one elected to lead  
the panel in its deliberations, said jurors honored their 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us believes that justice has been served,'' said  
Collins, a guard at a private prison in nearby Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, 49, was killed after he was chained to a truck and dragged  
for nearly three miles. His head and right arm were severed in what 
prosecutors said was a killing designed to launch a new racial hate 
group in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel that nobody should be tortured that way,'' said  
Collins, who called the crime scene pictures ``terrifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flowers said the jury searched for evidence to avoid a death  
sentence, but searched in vain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked for ways to not have to do what we did today, and  
they were not there,'' she said. ``You just can't have this. 
Society cannot accept this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flowers said she found King's prison letters and other  
writings persuasive proof of his guilt. The 24-year-old laborer had 
outlined plans for a new hate group and his desire to die as some 
sort of martyr for white America. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very compelling to me,'' Ms. Flowers said. ``I felt  
like he didn't show any remorse for his actions after the deed was 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other evidence that swayed jurors included the victim's blood  
found on King's shoes, King's lighter inscribed with a Ku Klux Klan 
symbol and King's DNA found at the scene where Byrd was chained to 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	King was the first of three white suspects to go to trial for  
Byrd's murder. Trial dates for the other two -- Shawn Berry, 24, and 
Lawrence Brewer, 31, -- have not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flowers and Collins said jurors rejected a defense argument  
that King, who spent two years in prison for a burglary conviction, 
became a racist in order to protect himself from attacks by black 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sad as it is, whether he is a victim of his environment, as  
humans we still have a mind and heart to make our judgment,'' Ms. 
Flowers said. ``Mr. King chose poorly.''

<HEADLINE> AMD Chips Knock Intel From Top Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY RACHEL BECK   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tarnishing the launch of Intel's newest Pentium  
chips, a report Friday revealed that consumers bought more 
computers in January with semiconductors made by Advanced Micro 
Devices -- knocking Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Intel slid $8, or more than 6 percent, to $119 on Wall  
Street amid news that 43.9 percent of all desktop PCs sold in 
January were equipped with AMD-K6 processors, according to the 
research firm PC Data. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's chips powered 40.3 percent of the machines sold, while  
National Semiconductor's Cyrix chips came in third at 15.8 percent, 
the monthly report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major milestone for AMD,'' said Stephen Baker, the  
senior hardware analyst at PC Data, which bases its figures on unit 
sales, not dollar volume. ``This is the first time that a processor 
family, other than one manufactured by Intel, led the U.S. retail 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as Intel unveiled the Pentium III, a new line of  
microprocessors with graphic and video capabilities that are far 
faster and clearer than anything else available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But like its predecessors, the Pentium III is also far more  
pricey than most chips, and it was clear from Friday's report that 
Intel has been hurt by its limited exposure to the sub-$1,000 PC 
market -- which accounted for a record 65.6 percent January's retail 
sales, up from 51 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the average selling price of a PC fell to $953 in  
January, a 6 percent decline from December, said PC Data, which is 
based in Reston, Va. By contrast, computers powered with the 
Pentium III are selling for about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sub-$1,000 market, AMD-powered machines captured more  
than 50 percent of the sales -- doubling Intel's 25.4 percent share. 
Of those selling below $800, AMD chips were in 45.1 percent of the 
computers, while Intel chips were in 14.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, however, maintained its leadership in the above-$1,000  
market, with its chips powering more than two-thirds of the 
machines sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel is taking us to a new power level with its new line  
processors,'' namely the Pentium III, said Tim Bajarin, president 
of Creative Strategies Research International in San Jose, Calif. 
``But they aren't as aggressive in the low end of the market where 
they need to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having recognized the boom in the sub-$1,000 market, Intel is  
spending $300 million on marketing to entice consumers to buy 
pricier, Penium-powered computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Intel has lost market share at the retail level, it's  
important to note that its microprocessors still power more than 80 
percent of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Intel's profits remain quite healthy, although much of  
that strength actually comes from the company's most expensive 
chips -- like the Xeon -- which are used as the brainpower in desktop 
machines bought by businesses.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Co. Probes Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- New technologies from a small Silicon Valley  
company are making it possible to peek under the Earth's crust and 
learn how dinosaurs were wiped out, whether mythical pirate ships 
existed and where earthquake faults lurk. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the new instruments and techniques available these days,  
we're able to get very fine detail about what the subsurface is 
made of,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Rufus 
Catchings. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings has been using Geometrics Inc.'s newest seismographic  
instruments to survey -- for the first time -- an active section of 
California's San Andreas fault. The hole, planned to be about two 
miles deep, will hopefully reveal what rock is like when it is 
squeezed and ready to rumble. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the drilling, Catchings and other geophysicists  
detonated small explosions on the ground around the fault. As the 
sound traveled down, the desk-sized Geometrics monitors tracked the 
sound wave deflections and then produced an underground cutaway 
map. 
</P>
<P>
	``That subsurface image is the best in the industry,'' said  
Catchings. ``We get all kinds of physical parameters of what's 
associated down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a nondescript office park surrounded by mostly new and  
upstart high-tech firms in San Jose, Geometrics has quietly spent 
the past 30 years turning out increasingly sophisticated 
instruments that reveal the mysteries of the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
	With recent computer advances, it is now possible for  
researchers to obtain detailed information and pictures from 1 inch 
to 3 miles under the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a technology which is always in demand,'' said Geometrics  
vice president of seismic sales Rob Huggins. ``People are always 
going to want a better picture of what's under them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, it was a Geometrics instrument that led researchers  
to a shipwreck off the coast of North Carolina believed to be the 
pirate Blackbeard's flagship. The tantalizing underwater trail of 
gold bars, coins, guns and skeletons, along with a perfectly 
preserved chunk of what appears to be the ship's hull, are now 
being analyzed by archaeologists. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, National University researchers are using another  
Geometrics device to analyze the borders of a crater scientists 
believe was formed when a gigantic asteroid slammed into the planet 
65 million years ago. They'll try to find out whether the impact 
could have thrown up enough dust to change the weather patterns on 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The analysis could buttress the widely accepted theory that  
dinosaurs vanished because of a collision with a huge asteroid or 
comet. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's founder, geophysicist Sheldon Breiner, is a  
Stanford University graduate who used the first cesium magnetometer 
to discover two colossal and ancient Olmec heads in Mexico in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially everything we make is to look under the ground and  
make someone healthy, wealthy or wise,'' said Geometrics president 
Steven Duckett. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a shift for a company that began making instruments aimed  
almost entirely at discovering oil, gas and other underground 
minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the early 1980s, Geometrics' annual revenue  
reached $20 million as prospectors searched for oil that could 
bring in $40 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the oil crisis abated and the Cold War came to an end,  
Geometrics was forced to broaden its products. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the seismographs, magnetometers and electromagnetic  
instruments are hand-carried, pulled on bicycles and towed by 
buggies for archeology, mineral exploration, earthquake research, 
weapon detection, treasure hunting and even military applications. 
Prices for the devices range from $5,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although once a player in a competitive field, Geometrics is now  
the only company making this broad array of products. A smaller 
competitor in Toronto makes fewer products. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, Geometrics brought in steady profits and  
has seen revenue increase from about $5 million in 1993 to $13 
million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was purchased 18 months ago by the $500 million  
Tokyo-based Oyo Corp., a geological engineering survey and research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Geometrics executives say they are now mulling a public stock  
offering with several other Oyo subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to leverage our knowledge base,'' said vice  
president of magnetometer sales Ross Johnson. ``We're one of the 
few companies around that can see into the Earth.''

<HEADLINE> Koufax Visits Mets' Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Sandy Koufax made what's becoming an  
annual appearance at the New York Mets spring training camp Friday, 
viewing batting practice and speaking with pitchers and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Famer, who also visited last year,  
again took interest in Al Leiter, a fellow left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, not only to see Sandy Koufax, but to hear him, he's  
so succinct,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``Seems like the 
world doesn't spin as fast when Sandy's looking at it. He sees 
things very clearly, and it's really good to have him around and 
slowing things down a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax, who resides in Vero Beach, 20 miles north of the Mets  
camp, worked with Leiter last year when he made his first visit, 
talking about mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely cares and he's not here for show,'' Valentine  
said. ``He'd rather come here when the lights were turned off and 
have his own little corner so he could do his work there. Not that 
he's working, because he's not getting paid, but he is making a 
contribution and he likes to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax is a friend of Dave Wallace, a senior advisor to general  
manager Steve Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Mets pitcher also got some advice, but it came from a  
different corner. Bobby Bonilla told Armando Benitez the reliever 
was tipping his pitches during batting practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a good conversation with Armando about the grips of  
different pitches,'' Valentine said. ``He had a conversation with 
him about changing his glove position. Armando came out today and 
felt real good about the change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez came to the Mets from the Baltimore Orioles.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes with a new organization there will be a little bit  
of resistance,'' Valentine said. ``There wasn't any, he felt good 
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Hard Rock Cafe, NBA Plan Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- At a time when theme restaurant stocks have  
fallen and owners are shuttering one after another, NBA officials 
and players have broken ground on a basketball-oriented restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	National Basketball Association legends Dolph Schayes, John  
Havlicek and James Worthy, Orlando Magic center Ike Austin and the 
WNBA's Nykesha Sales were on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony 
Thursday for the 17,000-square-foot NBA City restaurant at 
Universal Studio's Citywalk entertainment district. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock Cafe, which operates 99 rock-themed restaurants in 35  
countries, will build the NBA City restaurant and plans to spend 
$90 million over the next four years opening nine more NBA City 
restaurants around the globe. Each restaurant will cost between $8 
million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA officials said last year when they announced plans for the  
restaurant that it would open early this year. The opening has 
since been pushed back to this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending the NBA's name, video clips and memorabilia to the  
restaurants gives the league a presence, especially abroad, where 
there are no NBA teams but plenty of fans, said NBA Commissioner 
David Stern. The next NBA City will likely open in Japan and other 
restaurants are planned in Asia, Latin American, Europe and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another demonstration of our global reach,'' Stern said.  
``We're a global brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant will be divided into three parts: a dining area,  
a merchandise shop and an interactive recreation area where diners 
can shoot baskets and test their NBA trivia skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock first approached the NBA about the restaurants because  
market studies showed that it was the fastest-growing sport in 
popularity for people ages 18 to 25, a market the company hoped to 
target because they will be eating at restaurants for many more 
years, said Hard Rock president and CEO Jim Berk. The NBA also was 
attractive because of its international appeal, personalities and 
its sizable marketing and retail components, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard Rock officials are predicting 1 million people will eat at  
the restaurant in its first year, generating $15 million in 
revenue. Unlike other themed restaurants, many which have closed in 
the past year after patrons found them overpriced and offering bad 
food, Berk promised the menu, not basketball, would be the focus at 
the NBA City restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando restaurant, billed as upscale casual, will offer  
American cuisine such as grilled salmon, roasted bell pepper pizza 
and pork chops. It will be situated between Universal Studios' two 
theme parks, where an estimated 15 million people will pass through 
each year. Universal's second Florida theme park, Islands of 
Adventure, opens in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus (at some theme restaurants) has been parading movie  
stars down some red carpet and charging $10 for a hamburger,'' Berk 
said. ``We know we have to be first and foremost a restaurant.''

<HEADLINE> DirecTV To Lose CBS, Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Thousands of satellite dish owners will need  
something they thought they'd never bother with again -- a rooftop 
antenna -- to watch CBS and Fox shows next week. 
</P>
<P>
	U. S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt granted a restraining order  
Thursday, preventing DirecTV, the nation's largest satellite TV 
company, from providing the network shows directly to its 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how many people will be affected by the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV has more than 4.6 million customers and offers about 185  
channels. Spokesman Jeff Torkelson did not return telephone 
messages seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Petersburg Times has reported that about 700,000  
customers nationwide will lose programming Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, satellite TV companies can't provide network  
programming if customers can pick the shows up with an antenna. 
They are permitted to provide network signals from faraway stations 
to those who can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters, including the four major networks -- CBS, Fox, ABC  
and NBC and their affiliates -- complain that satellite companies 
rob them of advertising revenue by allowing viewers to bypass local 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesbitt ruled last year that Prime Time 24, a major supplier of  
network programming for satellite TV, had done so illegally. She 
ordered the practice to stop Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming the order applied only to Prime Time 24, DirecTV made  
its own arrangements to get CBS and Fox shows for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's frankly outrageous that DirecTV has done this  
little stunt,'' said attorney Tom Olson, who represents the 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	A DirecTV lawyer said the company was only trying to protect  
customers who are entitled to the programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no effort to pull a shenanigan, to utilize a  
loophole,'' said Alan Greer.

<HEADLINE> Austria Wins at Nordic Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- With the tip of his right ski, Christian  
Hoffmann made cross-country history in his native Austria, and 
Japanese ski jumpers swept the medals Friday for the first time 
since the Olympic Games at home in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazuyoshi Funaki, the Olympic champion last year in Nagano, won  
the 90K gold in the Nordic Ski World Championship, followed by 
Hideharu Miyahira in second and Masahiko Harada, the Olympic bronze 
medalist, in third again. 
</P>
<P>
	Funaki soared 96 and 94 meters and earned 255 points to lead the  
first ski jumping sweep in a major championship since the Japanese 
did it in Sapporo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team carried me, because we all jumped well,'' Funaki  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyahira, bronze medalist on the large hill, had 253.5 points  
for jumps of 95.5 and 93.5 meters. Harada went 98 meters in the 
first series and 94 in the second, but his style was not as clean 
and he took the bronze with 252 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann lunged forward in a desperate final burst to beat  
Norway's favorite Thomas Alsgaard at the finish line of the men's 
4x10-kilometer relay and give Austria its first cross-county gold 
medal in a major competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' Hoffmann said. ``I've practiced that finish  
so often but it wasn't easy to beat Alsgaard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thrilling finish turned the ski stadium into a sea of waving  
red-and-white Austrian flags in a jubilation scene more frequently 
associated with Hermann Maier and the nation's other Alpine stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, the whole nation stood behind us,'' said Hoffmann, the  
Olympic 50K bronze medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Markus Gandler, the 10K Olympic silver medalist, and Alois  
Stadlober, who was second here in the 10K, had given Austria a 
solid lead after the first two classical style legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrians were nearly 30 seconds ahead of the Norwegians  
when Mikhail Botwinov fell, allowing Norway's star Bjorn Daehlie to 
slash the deficit in the third leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Botwinov, a Russian-born naturalized Austrian citizen, fell in a  
downhill section of the course, losing a pole and damaging his ski 
boot, which nearly came undone. He got up, threw away his goggles, 
grabbed another pole and again charged ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to increase our margin, but I was tired and both of  
my skis went into the same grove and they crossed,'' Botwinov said. 
``A team official threw me another pole but it was too short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had lost the gold it would have been my fault,''  
Botwinov said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Botwinov tagged Hoffmann for the final leg, Daehlie  
was only 5.5 seconds behind and handed over to Alsgaard, a powerful 
finisher with a long stride who had confirmed his 15K Olympic gold 
with another close victory here in the pursuit Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both racers stayed close at a slow pace and eyed one other. Both  
were saving their strength for the decisive finish, with Alsgaard 
passing up several invitations to move into the lead. Homestretch 
sprints are Alsgaard's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Alsgaard who miscalculated in the neck-to-neck finish  
as Hoffmann never lost the pace and pushed his ski forward to win 
by .02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us took the victory for granted and when you take  
everything for granted it doesn't always turn out the best way for 
you,'' Daehlie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's combined time of 1 hour, 35 minutes, 7.5 seconds  
snapped Norway's relay winning streak stretching back four world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway used three skiers who were also on the gold medal team in  
the Olympics last year in Nagano. Espen Bjervig was the newcomer, 
joining Erling Jevne in the two classical legs. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver gave Daehlie, a record eight-time Winter Olympics  
champion, 17 world championship medals, tying him on the career 
list with Elena Vaelbe, the retired Russian star. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daehlie was still disappointed, comparing the loss to  
Norway's defeat by Italy at the 1994 Olympics at home in 
Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy took the bronze this time, using three racers from the  
team that won the Olympic silver in Nagano. Giorgio di Centa joined 
the Olympic trio of Fulvio Valbusa, Fabio Maj and Silvio Fauner. 
Fauner was also on the victorious team in Lillehammer.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Town Reeling after Girl's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC, Mo. (AP) -- The police account is the stuff of  
nightmares: a 3-year-old girl left to die in a field on a winter 
day, her mother passed out drunk at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are calling it a homicide and have two suspects in  
custody: an 8-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Ronald Reed would not provide any more details or  
say Friday whether the two children would face charges. There are 
no other suspects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story began in this small community a half-hour west of St.  
Louis on the afternoon of Feb. 19, when Butch Horner returned home 
from work. According to Reed, Horner found Billie Karns, 42, the 
mother of his daughter, passed out drunk on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	But their daughter, Ciara Horner, couldn't be found.  
</P>
<P>
	Horner flagged down officers and after an hour's search, Ciara  
was found naked and unconscious in a soggy field near a drainage 
ditch, about a quarter-mile from her home. Her clothes were found 
nearby. She died a short time later of hypothermia. The temperature 
was in the 40s that day. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted. Reed said  
interviews and other physical evidence led him to conclude that the 
two neighborhood children were responsible for Ciara's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody Hicks, whose husband runs a resale shop across the street  
from the trailer park where Ciara lived, smiled as she recalled the 
quiet little mop-haired blonde in Teletubbies sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shy little girl -- a little bitty thing. Cute as a bug,'' she  
said, her smile turning to a gentle sob. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner has moved out of the trailer and couldn't be reached  
Friday. But on Thursday, he said the children should not be blamed 
for Ciara's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who they are, and I don't want to know,'' he told  
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``I'm sure whatever happened was an 
accident. I'm sure those young kids couldn't have wanted to hurt 
Ciara.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karns was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment. She is  
being held in jail on $2,500 bond.

<HEADLINE> Man's Torture Shocks N.J. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEANSBURG, N.J. (AP) -- They came looking for him at McDonald's,  
just before he got off work. They invited him to come to a party, 
where he could meet a pretty girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Clutching the stuffed whale he carried with him everywhere, the  
23-year-old retarded man eagerly followed, happy to be included in 
a circle of people he wanted to call his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all a cruel trick, authorities say. At least 14 people  
were waiting for him at a Keansburg apartment. As he walked in the 
door, they grabbed him in a choke hold, cut off his McDonald's tie 
and ripped his beloved toy to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege Eric Krochmaluk's attackers then taped him to  
a lawn chair and tossed lighted cigarettes into his mouth -- and 
kept on torturing him for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after nine men and women were charged in the attack,  
people in this blue-collar Jersey Shore town speak of the 
aimlessness of its young people, underage drinkers who raise havoc 
in a wooded area called ``The Pit,'' and the lack of recreational 
opportunities for young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one can fathom the rage and cruelty that led to this.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think that they know what to do with themselves  
and they don't care what they do,'' 69-year-old Ellen Park said as 
she bought lottery tickets at a convenience store. ``I'm sure you 
can find better things to do than go around torturing people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 30 attack is drawing comparisons to the 1989 gang rape  
in Glen Ridge of a retarded teen-ager by popular athletes who 
sexually assaulted her with a broomstick and baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people out there that prey on the vulnerable,'' said  
Tom Baffuto, director of the Arc of New Jersey, an advocacy group 
for the mentally handicapped. ``This is the dark side of society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Krochmaluk graduated from a vocational-technical school  
with honors, family members describe him as having the emotional 
and mental capacity of a 15-year-old. He is deaf in one ear and has 
a heart murmur. 
</P>
<P>
	But he enjoys the same heavy-metal music as his alleged  
attackers, some of whom he knew from his Middletown High School 
days, and he attended some of their parties. One suspect, 
22-year-old Marni Solomon, is a former girlfriend, Monmouth County 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	The young man may have offended the tough, tight-knit group by  
spilling a drink on someone at a New Year's Eve party. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, authorities contend, some of the suspects  
grabbed him at another party and forced him to wear a bra. 
Krochmaluk called his father, who persuaded them to let his son go. 
No one called police. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 30, Solomon and Michael Finlay, 37, showed up at a  
Tinton Falls McDonald's where Krochmaluk worked as a cook. They 
invited him to a party at an apartment shared by Jennifer Dowell, 
21 -- a special education aide at Krochmaluk's old school -- and 
Brandon Cruz, 23. 
</P>
<P>
	When Krochmaluk arrived, he was stripped to his underwear and  
tied down, prosecutors said. The group put out cigarettes on his 
teeth and tossed some into his mouth. They made him lick a spilled 
drink off the floor, dressed him in a bra and skirt and used 
plastic razors and electric clippers to shave his head and 
eyebrows. His head was then set afire with hair spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are investigating whether a string of plastic beads  
used to whip Krochmaluk may have been used to sexually assault him 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After about two hours, the group put a pillow case over  
Krochmaluk's head and dragged him to ``The Pit,'' where they beat 
him in the woods before leaving him there, prosecutor Robert 
Honecker Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	One eye swollen shut, Krochmaluk eventually staggered to a  
security guard's booth at a nearby factory. He was treated at a 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are considering charging the nine under New Jersey's  
bias crime law, which would double their penalties. The suspects -- 
most in their early 20s -- face charges ranging from theft to 
kidnapping and aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz and Dowell, who face the most serious charges, remain in  
jail, while seven are free on bail. Attempts to reach them were 
unsuccessful; most have not retained lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were horrified by the attack, though many said that  
Keansburg -- where a boardwalk, amusement park and well-kept condos 
clash with empty storefronts -- isn't to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said the torture shows that mentally retarded people  
sometimes trust people they shouldn't because they are so desperate 
to belong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part is, this young man was looking for companionship  
and friendship and he looked to these people,'' said Police Chief 
Raymond O'Hare. ``They took advantage of that.''

<HEADLINE> Dozen GOP Govs. Publicly Back Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has the support of  
12 fellow Republican governors for a presidential run even though 
he has not formally announced his intention to seek the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors on Friday declared their backing for Bush, and  
seven more governors may follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Govs. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Marc Racicot of Montana  
began collecting names at last weekend's National Governors' 
Association meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
	The two divided a list of Republican governors -- 30, not  
including Bush -- to contact and on Friday released 12 names. 
Michigan Gov. John Engler, Bush's unofficial point man with the 
governors, also kept busy reaching out to leaders to gauge support 
for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more governors have committed themselves to endorsing  
Bush, but will not make public statements until they inform party 
members in their states, said Andrew Malcolm, Racicot's executive 
assistant. Malcolm said four others are expected to announce their 
backing soon. 
</P>

	Bush, eldest son of former President George Bush, said Friday he  
intends to reveal more about his plans next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week I'll discuss it with you as to whether or not I want  
to take this process a step further,'' Bush said. ``The decision is 
yes, I'm going to run; no, I'm not going to run, or I might run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But advisers to Bush say he will form an exploratory campaign  
committee in the next month, which would allow him to raise and 
spend money while testing his potential support. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors said they hope their coalition will encourage Bush  
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideological and geographical breadth of support among  
Governor Bush's peers demonstrates just how strong a candidate he 
would be,'' Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Bush a ``proven winner,'' Racicot praised the Texas  
governor's pragmatic reforms and family-oriented administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Other governors listed as Bush supporters, including his  
brother, Jeb, the governor of Florida, are: Engler, John Rowland of 
Connecticut, Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho,

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Raise Nuke Plant Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned that some workers at nuclear power  
plants are putting in too many hours, lawmakers asked the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to examine whether plant safety is 
being jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Democrats, Reps. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, John  
Dingell of Michigan and Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, wrote to NRC 
Chairwoman Shirley Ann Jackson to request an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are writing in concern that low staffing levels and  
excessive staff overtime may present a serious safety hazard at 
some commercial nuclear plants in the United States,'' they said in 
a letter sent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers are worried that fatigue caused by too few workers  
putting in too many hours could lead to operating errors. They did 
not identify plants where they thought safety could be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an NRC document, they said fatigue ``can degrade an  
operator's ability to rapidly process complex information such as 
that presented by off normal plant conditions. In addition, fatigue 
may jeopardize the ability to respond in a timely fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers heard of possible problems with staff overtime and  
shift staffing from whistleblowers. The issue of staffing and 
safety at the Byron nuclear plant in Illinois was also raised in a 
February article in Inside N.R.C., a trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Gilliland, an NRC spokesman, said the agency had no  
immediate comment. ``We will respond to their letter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was asked to launch a broad investigation into the  
prevalence of overtime at the nation's 104 federally licensed 
plants and its safety significance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other points, the lawmakers want to know whether the NRC  
could attribute any examples of errors in performing safety-related 
functions in the past five years to operator fatigue, staffing 
levels or staffing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency was also asked about its rules, including whether it  
has enforceable regulations on overtime and staffing, and why there 
is no explicit ban on excessive overtime, as there is for airline 
pilots and truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1982 NRC policy statement, which is not enforceable, states  
that plants should employ enough operating personnel to adequately 
cover shifts without ``routine heavy use of overtime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It sets out guidelines for using overtime on a temporary basis  
and states that deviations from guidelines in ``very unusual 
circumstances'' should be authorized by plant managers and 
documented for possible NRC review. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers also said they were worried that overtime and  
staffing problems could get worse if the commercial nuclear 
industry tried to cut costs due to increased competition in 
electricity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kerekes, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the  
main industry trade group, said the best-run nuclear plants also 
tend to be the most economical. It makes little sense to hurt 
operations, and risk federal penalties, by cutting costs too much, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Preparing for Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The chief medical officer for the Winter  
Olympics said the groundwork is being laid now for a drug testing 
program that will ensure no doped-up athletes compete in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Salt Lake also tests for growth hormones and drugs that  
enhance oxygen capacity -- requiring more invasive blood sampling -- 
is an open question, said Charles Rich, a Salt Lake neurosurgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just simply don't know,'' Rich said Friday during a  
briefing for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing for growth hormones, the latest wave of  
performance-enhancing substances, will depend on the ability of the 
world's Olympic and political leaders to fund technology 
development and resolve the thorny issue of privacy, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The science is getting there,'' said Douglas Rollins, a  
pharmacologist and toxicologist who began work as the medical 
director for doping control last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins works for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee while  
remaining as director of the Center for Human Toxicology at the 
University of Utah. In 2001, he will go to work full-time for the 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring is one of the reasons Rich believes Salt Lake's  
doping control will be as good as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that they've ever had anyone as qualified,'' Rich  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC also has contracted with The Indiana University  
Athletic Drug Testing and Toxicology Laboratory to do the actual 
testing during the games and Paralympic Winter Games that follow. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of only two labs accredited by the International  
Olympic Committee in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Space will be leased for the lab, possibly at the University of  
Utah's Research Park, Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins said that he and the new doping control program manager,  
Michele Brown, are learning how the seven winter sports federations 
do their drug testing and will pay close attention to what Sydney 
does right and wrong during the 2000 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	If any new drugs show up there, ``We're going to have to be  
prepared to test for it here,'' Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The details of the doping control program -- down to which urine  
collection cups to use -- will be dictated to the SLOC by the IOC 
and sports federations that govern the sporting competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But it will be the job of the organizers to make sure the  
program runs smoothly and with the best technology for accurate, 
prompt results, the SLOC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich, Rollins and Brown all attended the IOC's three-day summit  
in early February, which was an attempt to crack down on drugs in 
sport and harmonize anti-doping sanctions among international 
federations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there remain many unresolved issues, Rich lauded the  
IOC for bringing together athletes and governmental representatives 
for what turned out to be a raucous forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to be honest brokers, trying to get the  
players together,'' Rich said. ``This is extremely complex. This is 
a problem that, if it's going to be solved, it's going to be solved 
in stages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rollins said he suspects the drugs most likely to show up in  
athletes at the 2002 Winter Games will be anabolic steroids, 
stimulants like amphetamine and beta-blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	Biathletes, for instance, may be tempted to use beta-blockers to  
slow down their heart rates and thus steady their hands for 
shooting rifles, Rollins said.

<HEADLINE> US Names Colombia As Drug War Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The U.S. decision to fully certify  
Colombia -- by far the world's No. 1 cocaine producer -- as an ally 
in the war on drugs is a crucial vote of confidence in President 
Andres Pastrana's young government, his foreign minister said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents one more step in a new era characterized by the  
normalization of relations with the United States,'' Guillermo 
Fernandez de Soto told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation would not fail in its efforts to fight drug  
trafficking ``so that Colombia can never again be treated by the 
community of nations as if it were a pariah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton gave Colombia full certification Friday as an  
anti-narcotics ally. Last year, the country did not receive full 
certification and was decertified in 1996 and 1997 as punishment 
for President Ernesto Samper's alleged ties with drug bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	Samper was elected in 1994 with $6 million in contributions from  
the Cali drug cartel, money he claimed entered his campaign without 
his knowledge. Accompanying economic sanctions were minimal, but 
being blacklisted by Washington was a huge blow to Colombian pride. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's national police sprayed 230 square miles of coca, the  
raw material of cocaine, with herbicides in 1998, but the coca crop 
nevertheless grew from 310 square miles to more than 390 square 
miles. Police also reported making record drug seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the new coca cultivation displaces acreage lost in  
neighboring Bolivia and Peru, the two other major coca-growing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Colombia's coca is located in areas controlled  
by leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups, for whom 
drugs are a major revenue source. Colombia is also a source of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. decision to grant full certification recognizes a new  
partnership with Pastrana's government, which took office in August 
and has continued the eradication campaign. Pastrana has also 
pushed for alternative development, however, insisting eradication 
and law enforcement alone will not end drug trafficking in 
Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants $153M for Farm Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the farm economy continuing to slump, the  
Clinton administration wants $153 million from Congress to make 
additional emergency loans to farmers and to hire temporary workers 
to handle the heavy demand for disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said Friday that economic turmoil in Asia and  
elsewhere in the world continues ``to make it difficult for 
American farmers and ranchers to export their goods overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more farmers need loans to see them through to better  
times,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal would provide $1.1 billion in direct loans or loan  
guarantees for an estimated 10,000 producers who can't get credit 
from private sources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is running 
out of money to make loans because of the heavy demand for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of gloomy economic forecasts, many bankers are skittish  
about lending money to marginal farmers unless the government 
guarantees the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman predicted this week that  
farmers face another year of lagging exports and low prices. USDA 
has lowered farm export projections to $49 billion -- down from last 
year's $53.6 billion. Farm income could fall at least $3 billion, 
according to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without this help many farmers simply would not be able to put  
in their spring crops,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA officials have come under criticism as they  
struggle to keep up with requests from farmers for $6 billion in 
disaster assistance approved by Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request earmarks $43 million for hiring temporary  
staff in USDA's county offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``To date the vast majority of farmers haven't been signed up to  
receive relief,'' said the House Agriculture Committee's chairman, 
Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas. ``I don't know what's going on down at 
the department, but I do know that our farmers can't wait forever 
for this money.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Relieved by Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexicans expressed grumpy relief Friday after  
President Clinton's certification of their country as a partner in 
drug fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The importance of the decision was reflected in the television  
reporting on the announcement and in the headlines of afternoon 
dailies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gracias, Uncle Sam,'' declared El Universal Grafico.  
</P>
<P>
	``CERTIFIED,'' announced Ovaciones.  
</P>
<P>
	Juan Rebolledo, undersecretary at the Foreign Secretariat, said  
Mexico was happy ``that an obstacle has not been imposed to 
cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is required each year to certify whether Mexico and  
other countries are fully cooperating in the fight against 
narcotics trafficking. A negative decision may have led to 
financial sanctions against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican officials argue that certification and the threat behind  
it is an insult to their own good will and sovereignty, and they 
say it has damaged cooperation against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be us who certify the United States,'' Vicente  
Yanez, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing 
Industries, said in an interview with the Formato 21 radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican officials often complain that U.S. demand for drugs  
fuels the illegal drug trade between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Steel Crisis Shows Signs of Abating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key administration officials are warning  
Congress against approving stricter trade sanctions sought by the 
U.S. steel industry to block cheap imports. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Thursday that  
the United States must weigh the steelworkers' desire for quotas 
and other relief with the risk of starting a trade war that could 
jeopardize U.S. exports of other products and further weaken 
foreign economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have to be cautious about the way in which we proceed,''  
Barshefsky told a House panel. ``We cannot dismiss out of hand the 
notion that other countries will take retaliatory action or might 
impose mirror legislation. ... We have a broad range of interests, 
economic in particular, that we need to protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky spoke as the Commerce Department announced that  
imports continued to drop in January, a signal that the steel 
import crisis is abating. Nevertheless, she did express concerns 
about imports from Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that steel imports to the  
United States dropped 6.7 percent last month. While Russian imports 
plunged by 70 percent and Brazilian shipments went down 18 percent, 
imports from Japan decreased only 4 percent. Shipments from South 
Korea went up 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record levels last year in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis and have been blamed for thousands of U.S. layoffs 
and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration faces difficult choices about how to respond.  
Labor is a key constituency for Democrats, but the administration 
also is a proponent of free trade and believes that open markets 
abroad is best for U.S. companies with goods to export. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary William Daley  
indicated they would stick with procedures available through 
existing trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department found evidence earlier this month that  
Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped hot-rolled carbon steel, 
a widely used steel product, in U.S. markets at prices dramatically 
below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said imports of that product from the three  
countries combined fell by 96 percent since November. South Korea 
was not a party to the complaints filed by the U.S. steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers are encouraging,'' Daley said. ``They show that  
tough enforcement of our trade laws does work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that ``one or two months of good data do not  
make a trend'' in light of record highs last year. The U.S. 
industry says that despite the short-term drops, the levels still 
are too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs, but the United States  
announced a deal with Russia on Monday in which Russia would slash 
its shipments of hot-rolled and other steel products by almost 70 
percent to avoid tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	At a House Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing on steel,  
Daley raised the possibility of settlement talks with Brazil as 
well, saying Brazilian officials recently expressed interest in a 
deal. No discussions have taken place so far, Daley said.

<HEADLINE> Drs. Charged at Home for Retarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Pa. (AP) -- A two-year investigation of deaths at  
Pennsylvania's largest home for the retarded led to charges Friday 
against six doctors accused of such offenses as manslaughter and 
sewing up patients' wounds without anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you shivers. I've never heard of anything like  
that,'' said Charles Lakin, who tracks abuse cases nationwide at 
the Institute on Community Living at the University of Minnesota. 
``If that's not the regular treatment for human beings, obviously 
someone's under the perception that these are not human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drs. Cesar Miranda, 68, and Hyunchel Shin, 74, were charged with  
manslaughter in the deaths of three patients from the Polk Center, 
a 101-year-old, state-run facility in western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda did not examine a man with a blocked intestine for hours  
-- until his body temperature had dropped to 82 degrees -- and sent a 
vomiting, feverish woman whose skin had turned blue for an X-ray, 
prosecutors said. Both patients died. Shin allegedly failed to get 
a brain scan of a patient, leading to his brain deterioration and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other doctors -- former Polk medical director Samir Moussa,  
47; David Byers, 53; Donald Stitt, 84; and Louka Makkar, 50 -- were 
charged with assault and neglect. Among other things, they and 
Miranda were accused of using sutures and surgical staples to close 
wounds without anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for all six doctors said their clients are innocent.  
Five of them were arraigned Friday and released on $50,000 bail; 
the sixth, Byers, is expected to surrender Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Mike Fisher, whose office began investigating  
in 1997 after the deaths of the three patients, called it ``a very 
sad and disturbing case.'' The center employs about 1,200 people 
and has 565 residents, some of them so severely disabled they 
cannot communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``These doctors were entrusted with the care of some of our most  
dependent citizens,'' Fisher said. ``Many of these residents could 
not express pain or discomfort to the doctors. However, that's no 
excuse for circumventing normal medical procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Makkar said hospital and state officials were aware that doctors  
at Polk commonly used surgical staples without anesthesia if an 
injury needed immediate treatment. ``You judge which pain is 
worse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Pagni, a spokesman for the state Welfare Department, which  
operates the center, said there is no policy directing doctors to 
treat wounds without anesthesia. He would not comment further on 
Makkar's allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the manslaughter charges against Miranda stems from the  
death of Eugene Rozgonyi, 62, who was mentally retarded because of 
injuries he suffered from surgical instruments at birth.

	Rozgonyi, who lived at Polk for 55 years, became sick on March  
6, 1997, with a blocked intestine that made his belly expand. He 
got worse throughout the day, but Miranda did not examine him until 
midnight, when his body temperature had fallen to 16 degrees below 
normal, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda also allegedly failed to transfer Rozgonyi to a hospital  
until four hours later. He died six hours after being admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a hard time being born and a hard time dying,'' said  
Rozgonyi's brother, John, 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ellen Fritz, a spokeswoman for the state welfare agency,  
said the department fixed problems at Polk and drafted stricter 
rules for doctors after the allegations first arose, in 1996. Four 
doctors resigned and three were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	One fired doctor was reinstated after arbitration. It was  
unclear whether that doctor was among the six charged.

	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Carl Bernstein, who helped bring  
down President Nixon, said American journalism is ``disfigured by 
celebrity, gossip and sensationalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's the role of journalists to challenge people,  
not to just mindlessly amuse them,'' Bernstein said Thursday at a 
Jewish Federation gathering. ``In this culture of journalistic 
titillation, we teach our readers and our viewers that the trivial 
is important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein's work with Bob Woodward at The Washington Post  
exposed the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>

the standards of even the high end of our busines,'' Bernstein

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians fled villages on  
tractor-pulled trailers by the dozens to escape new fighting and a 
buildup of Serb forces today. Western peace monitors, meanwhile, 
were prevented from entering Kosovo by Yugoslav customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which  
runs the monitoring mission in Kosovo, said Yugoslav border 
authorities blocked peace monitors from entering the province from 
neighboring Macedonia for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	OSCE spokesmen said the customs officials were demanding to  
search luggage and vehicles of the monitors, violating 
international conventions on border procedures for diplomats. The 
problems began Thursday and by this afternoon 21 staffers were 
stuck at the border, waiting in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	American diplomat William Walker, the head of the mission, was  
trying to mediate the standoff by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortar fire and gunshots resounded in northern Kosovo in a  
second day of clashes in the Bukos area between the Yugoslav army 
and rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb police blocked roads into the area, but humanitarian aid  
workers said they saw about 30 Yugoslav tanks and armored cars in 
the area. Four tanks were poised at the edge of the village of 
Nevoljane, about 15 miles northwest of the capital Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Field workers for the U.N. refugee agency said four civilians  
were wounded by shrapnel and bullets Thursday in the village of 
Ljubovec. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 500 Kosovo Albanian refugees, mainly women and children,  
fled to neighboring Macedonia today, Macedonian state radio 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians were said to have fled their homes near Kacanik  
after Serbian security forces conducted house-to-house searches in 
the town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army was reported to be beefing up its defenses  
near Kacanik, a border region where NATO forces currently in 
Macedonia would cross into Kosovo if they are deployed in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and Western officials are concerned about the new fighting  
and the massing of Yugoslav and Serb forces and are trying to hold 
both sides to a cease-fire during a 2 1/2-week suspension in peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Defense Department says Yugoslavia has deployed 4,500  
troops on the border of the separatist-minded province in southern 
Serbia, backed by tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What frightens me and worries me is that these weeks are taken  
advantage of for the purpose of conflict rather than for 
consolidation'' of steps toward a peace deal, NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Spain's Channel 9 TV that there would be punitive  
airstrikes on Serb targets ``only if absolutely necessary ... and 
always in the service of a political objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in Kosovo began almost a year ago when Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic sent forces to crush a KLA 
insurrection. More than 2,000 people have died and 300,000 others -- 
mostly ethnic Albanians -- have been displaced by the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fighting came as ethnic Albanian negotiators returned to  
Kosovo from talks in Rambouillet, France, which ended this week 
without substantial agreement on how to bring lasting peace to the 
impoverished province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Serbs refused to let NATO troops enforce a peace plan  
-- a key ingredient to any deal -- ethnic Albanians agreed to sign a 
tentative agreement when talks resume March 15 after consulting 
with KLA commanders back in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Kosovo Albanian political leader reiterated today that  
his side will make good on its pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader of pro-independence ethnic  
Albanians, expressed approval of the agreement -- broad autonomy as 
an interim solution without formal secession, combined with NATO 
troops as an implementing force. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rugova did not head the Albanian negotiating team in  
France, he remains an influential leader among the 90 percent 
ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A radio talk show host slandered a woman  
when he said she aborted Bob Dole's baby in the early 1970s, a 
judge ruled, awarding the woman $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Glorioso didn't contest the case at trial on condition  
that any judgment be collected only from his insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Glorioso, now a political consultant, had a talk show on KMBZ-AM  
when he made the remark on the air in 1996 about Phyllis Wells 
Smith of suburban Overland Park, Kan. Dole was running for 
president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Glorioso said Dole arranged for Ms. Wells Smith to get an  
abortion. But the former flight attendant and model testified she 
never had an abortion. Dole also denied arranging an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge John O'Malley awarded the damages on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower, Japanese Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Comments by U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence  
Summers suggesting that Japan needs to take further steps to boost 
the economy helped the dollar recoup much of its early losses 
against the yen. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 120.32 yen, down 0.30 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level 
of 119.63 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 102.91 points,  
or 0.71 percent, closing the week at 14,367.54 points. On Thursday, 
the index closed up 115 points, or 0.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as low as 119.07 yen early in the session,  
following the release of a Japanese government report showing that 
Japan's industrial output rose by 0.8 percent in January from the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback jumped after Yukihiko Ikeda, a senior official  
in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters that Summers 
had urged further action from Japan when they met in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikeda quoted Summers as telling him: ``The Bank of Japan's  
monetary steps so far may not be enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments raised speculation that the Bank of Japan, or BOJ,  
might ease monetary policy further, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Summers' words to Ikeda showed that the U.S.... is not  
satisfied with the monetary easing steps taken so far by the BOJ,'' 
said Tetsu Aikawa, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference later today in Tokyo, Summers urged Japan  
to take a policy of creating a ``strong domestic demand-led 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan should be careful not to rely too much on export sales to  
drive growth, Summers said at the end of a weeklong tour of Asia 
that included stops in Singapore, Indonesia, China and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose as high as 121.05 yen during the day but shed  
some of the gains after Summers said he wouldn't make specific 
``recommendations'' to the central bank on monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.35 yen, down  
from 132.78 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices drifted lower in midway today  
as market players became cautious about exchange rate and interest 
rate movements. An overnight fall on Wall Street also was another 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 33.33  
points at 9,366.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 469  
million shares, up marginally from Thursday's 463 million shares. 
Decliners outnumbered advancers 684 to 481, with 140 issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 4.10 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,120.03 
points. The TOPIX rose 3.84 points, or 0.34 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.885 percent from today's finish of 1.915 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.32 yen from 99.09 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Announce Campaign Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush promises an  
announcement about his presidential ambitions in two weeks, while 
advisers say the Republican will form an exploratory campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	And one senior adviser who has talked to Bush in recent days  
said the governor ``fully intends to run'' for president but plans 
to announce in mid-March only that he is ``testing the waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's smart enough to always leave a door open,'' the adviser  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several months, Bush has dodged questions about whether he  
will run for the White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my name started to surface, people started calling in,''  
Bush said Thursday. ``There seems to be a lot of interest and 
genuine interest. Obviously, this is part of testing the waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would make a definitive statement about his  
campaign plans in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another adviser to Bush said the governor would form an  
exploratory committee next month, which would allow him to raise 
and spend money while testing his potential support. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser said Bush would not formally announce a candidacy  
for several weeks or months, and he cautioned that Bush could still 
opt out although he is already building a campaign team. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other advisers said they had been told to prepare for the  
formation of a campaign exploratory committee. All spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has begun to build a stable of outside advisers on issues  
such as the economy, and he has been courted by fellow GOP 
governors to make a White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal entry into the race probably wouldn't come until after  
the Texas Legislature adjourns May 31, sources close to Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he should decide to go forward with an exploratory  
committee, during the summer he would spend time traveling, 
listening to people, and then make some final decision in late 
summer or early fall,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of polls have given Bush and Elizabeth Dole  
front-runner status in a rapidly growing GOP field of potential 
candidates in 2000. Ms. Dole has not declared her candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Spoiled Arizona Wheat Crop Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Wheat growers in Arizona have been trying to cope  
with a federal quarantine of their crop for three years. The 
government just made their hardship worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine restricting the shipment of Arizona wheat was  
imposed after Karnal bunt was found in some of that state's fields. 
The fungus is not harmful to humans, but it can reduce yield and 
give wheat a fishy odor. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarantine was bad enough. Now the state's wheat industry  
has learned that seeds carrying Karnal bunt spores may have gone to 
fields free of the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	An embarrassed Arizona Department of Agriculture said Thursday  
that its lab since October has improperly tested some 232 tons of 
wheat seeds, potentially fouling fields in southern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not pleased that our staff apparently misused filtering  
equipment and we are working to ensure this is an isolated 
incident,'' said Sheldon R. Jones, the department's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which mandated the  
quarantine, is now scrambling to figure out where the seeds were 
planted. Farmers are being warned their spring harvest could face 
stringent testing and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency supplied the filters, but mislabeled them,  
said Lloyd Brown, spokesman for the Arizona agriculture department. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jarnagian, president of the Arizona Wheat Growers  
Association, said the mistake demonstrates the mismanagement of a 
program that has also quarantined some wheat in California, New 
Mexico and Texas, costing millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really depressing, frustrating and confusing,'' he said.  
``They impose this quarantine and they can't even do the test 
properly. Where's the credibility?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA said Friday it's investigating the mistake and whether  
the agency itself was responsible for mislabeling the filters. The 
agency also said the Arizona lab will face an internal review of 
its procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Arizona quarantine was imposed in 1996, it has been  
gradually scaled back from the entire state to just two counties, 
said USDA spokesman Larry Hawkins.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Unlikely To Rule on Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark McGwire can probably take all the andro pills he wants this  
season because baseball is unlikely to ban the muscle-building 
supplement any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of a baseball-commissioned Harvard study on  
androstenedione, which are not expected until after opening day, 
will not be enough to warrant a ban, even if they show that andro 
raises testosterone levels, according to the No. 2 official of the 
players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, whose agreement is needed for any ban, want much  
stronger proof that andro enhances performance before they agree to 
a ban and random testing to enforce it, said Gene Orza, the union's 
associate general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while,'' Orza said. ``No one should  
expect that somehow this study at Harvard is going to definitively 
resolve the question that has to be answered, which is: Does the 
use of a perfectly legal substance somehow give a player a 
competitive advantage? If it doesn't, we don't care what the 
Olympics thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of andro, which is sold over-the-counter at nutrition  
stores and on the Internet, is not an issue baseball is even 
considering at the moment, despite numerous warnings from steroid 
experts about the hazards of testosterone-boosting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assume the drug is safe,'' Orza said. ``The United States  
government chooses not to regulate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard study by endocrinologist Joel Finkelstein and fellow  
researcher Benjamin Leder is just phase one of baseball's inquiry 
into the effects of andro, Orza said. That study is designed to 
determine simply whether andro converts in the body to 
testosterone, as it is purported to do by manufacturers, and, if 
so, to what degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get that question answered,'' Orza said, ``the next  
question we will decide is: To what degree and what extent does 
androstenedione contribute to muscle mass in the body? 
</P>
<P>
	``The third question is going to be: Does muscle mass in the  
body necessarily constitute a performance-enhancing opportunity for 
players?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separate studies on andro's effect on muscle mass or performance  
enhancement could take months, if not years, and baseball has set 
no deadline on when a decision would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a timetable on it,'' Orza said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The players share our internal view, which is that nobody  
really knows anything about androstenedione, and until we do we're 
going to reserve judgment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if andro is proven to boost testosterone and bulk up  
muscles, that would not necessarily mean players would agree that 
it enhances performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four years ago, I used to have discussions with general  
managers about how weight training was bad for baseball players,'' 
Orza said. ``The best, most competitive baseball players were seen 
as those guys who stayed sinewy and lithe, and the ones with more 
mass were winding up on the disabled list. Now, all of a sudden 
because of the current fashion, no one talks about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's record 70 homers last season focused attention on his  
bulging muscles, which he said benefited from using andro for more 
than a year to enhance his weightlifting and his recovery between 
workouts. When he arrived at spring training for the St. Louis 
Cardinals this week, he said he's still using andro. 
</P>
<P>
	Classified as a dietary supplement, andro is permitted in  
baseball but is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and the 
men's and women's tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's revelation that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues, however, will not enter into the union's decision  
about whether to agree on a ban of andro, Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if andro is determined to give some players a competitive  
advantage over others, then the union would consider a ban and, for 
the first time, random testing. At the moment, baseball does not 
have a random drug testing program, as do the Olympics, the NFL, 
and the tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we opposed random drug testing, we were opposing the  
clubs' request to test for substances that were illegal, and our 
objection to that was a philosophical one,'' Orza said. ``We don't 
believe that in America people are required to give evidence of 
wrongdoing to their employers. Testing for illegal drugs and 
testing for performance-enhancing drugs are quite different.''

<HEADLINE> African Olympic Chief Rebuffed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The African sports executive accused of the most  
serious offenses in the Salt Lake City scandal looks increasingly 
isolated in his attempts to fight expulsion from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga, president of the Association of National  
Olympic Committees of Africa, was rebuffed Friday in his bid to 
rally African support to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
	African Olympic officials said Ganga had failed to mobilize a  
quorum for a meeting of his group's leadership. Ganga had called an 
emergency meeting of the organization's executive committee for 
Tuesday in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
	But a senior member of the committee, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, told The Associated Press that at least seven and 
possibly nine members of the 13-man board were refusing to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ganga lacking a quorum of at least seven members, the  
meeting is now expected to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those declining to attend were ANOCA secretary general  
Tomas Sithole of Zimbabwe, vice presidents Major Gen. Francis 
Nyangweso (Uganda), Gen. Zoumaro Gnofame (Togo) and Sladdine Baly 
(Tunisia) and treasurer Ismail Bhamjie (Botswana). 
</P>
<P>
	This lack of African support is a major setback for Ganga, who  
is one of five International Olympic Committee members facing 
permanent expulsion at a special general assembly in Switzerland on 
March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other IOC members have already resigned over accusations of  
ethical misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's successful bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga of the Republic of Congo is accused of receiving more than  
$250,000 in cash and inducements for himself and his family from 
Salt Lake officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight his  
case at the March session, where a two-thirds vote of the assembly 
is required for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	With few allies, Ganga's chances of beating expulsion appear  
slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, who led the African boycott of the 1976 Montreal  
Olympics, is portraying his case as part of a wider campaign 
against Africa. Of the 24 IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake 
scandal, 12 are Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to African Olympic officials, Ganga suggested that  
African members were being punished for their role in opposing 
apartheid in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing stands out in this whole process,'' said the Feb. 15  
letter, a copy of which was obtained by the AP. ``By excluding 12 
Africans ... the intention is to `behead' African clout within the 
leading decision making body of world sport. I have the feeling 
that we are being held to pay for all the struggles waged against 
racial discrimination in sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC contested Ganga's allegations in a letter sent this week  
to all African IOC members and African national Olympic Committees. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter stressed that the IOC was in the forefront of the  
fight against apartheid, was the first organization to expel South 
Africa from international sports, and was the first to set up a 
committee to smooth the way for the nation's return to the Olympics 
in Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a consequence, the (expulsion) decisions taken by the IOC  
executive board cannot be seen as an action taken against the 
African continent,'' the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Americans' Optimism High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of Americans say they want their  
next president to continue President Clinton's policies, but they 
want a leader with a different set of personal qualities, says a 
new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vice President Al Gore would seem to benefit in that  
situation, the poll indicated the public may not see it that way at 
this point. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is the current front-runner for the  
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. But enthusiasm for Gore 
is lagging behind two leading Republicans -- Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush and Elizabeth Dole -- who are considering running for the 
presidency, said the poll released Thursday by the Pew Research 
Center for the People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' optimism about their nation is higher than it has  
been in more than three decades even though their trust in 
government is low, the poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are good times that aren't going away,'' said Andrew  
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. According to the poll, 
28 percent of the public in the new poll was very optimistic about 
the current state of the country, almost as high as in 1964 and an 
increase over the 20 percent who felt that way last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are more positive about the country and therefore,  
there is a desire for continuity,'' Kohut said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is also a desire for change,'' he said, noting the  
large majority who want different personal qualities in the next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest majority of adults, 54 percent, would like to see the  
next president offer policies and programs similar to those offered 
by the Clinton administration. But four out of five want someone 
with different personal qualities from those of Clinton, who 
survived an impeachment effort this winter prompted by the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think Al Gore would fill that bill better than he  
does in terms of public reaction,'' Kohut said. ``He obviously has 
some work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's internal polls show the public likes what  
he's doing, said Bob Squier, a Gore campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are open to the Gore message,'' he said. ``How do you  
keep a good thing going?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Squier said it was natural for the two Republicans to get good  
poll numbers this early because ``Bush and Dole are brand names, 
and they're not filled in yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Clinton have different personal styles, but some  
analysts question whether Gore has differentiated himself enough 
from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the election, we will have had eight years of  
Clinton-Gore,'' said presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the 
Brookings Institution. ``They have been twinned in ways that rarely 
happens with vice presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half of the registered voters in the poll said there  
was at least some chance they would vote for Gore, while 45 percent 
said there was no chance they would vote for him. More than 
two-thirds said there was at least some chance they would vote for 
Bush for president. Almost that many said there was a chance they 
would vote for Mrs. Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runners for president did well even though  
half the public says they disapprove of the job the GOP leaders in 
Congress are doing. And the public's trust in government was at 31 
percent, lower than the 37 percent who felt that way in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's job approval remains high at 64 percent, but that  
approval may not transfer fully to Gore, the poll indicated. Among 
those who approve of the job Clinton is doing, a third say there is 
a good chance they will vote for Gore, but 26 percent of the 
Clinton supporters say there is no chance they would vote for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,203 adults was taken Thursday through Sunday and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> $11 Million Award in Gun Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A judge has ordered an Italian gunmaker to  
pay $10.8 million to a man paralyzed in 1992 when he dropped his 
pistol and was shot in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratelli Tanfoglio S.R.L. manufactured the .25-caliber pistol  
with a firing pin that was too long, U.S. District Judge Mary Ann 
Vial Lemmon ruled in a lawsuit brought by 52-year-old Arnold 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun manufacturers have an obligation to reasonably anticipate  
that owners of guns, will, at some point, unexpectedly drop them,'' 
Lemmon said. ``The manufacture of the pistol with a defective 
firing pin made it virtually certain that the gun would fire if 
dropped or bumped on its hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmaker did not defend itself in the case, and court papers  
listed no lawyer for the company. The judge's ruling was filed Dec. 
31, and the 30-day appeal period passed without an appeal being 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting  
Sports Council, an organization of gunmakers, said the company 
won't have to pay unless Jackson sues in Italy and wins.

<HEADLINE> Malinina Wins Four Continents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan won  
the biggest title of her career Thursday, edging three Americans at 
the Four Continents figure skating championships Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Malinina, who trains in the United States, won  
the short program the previous night, then added a victory in the 
free skate. She beat out Amber Corwin, Angela Nikodinov and Erin 
Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina, winner of the NHK Trophy in December in Japan, took  
the inaugural Four Continents gold medal by landing four clean 
triple jumps in a routine to ``Aladdin.'' It was the first medal in 
an International Skating Union event for Uzbekistan and was a long 
time in coming for Malinina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Age has no meaning whatsoever,'' she said. ``Some skaters  
become champions at 15, others achieve this later on. There is no 
age limit for competitions and I can skate until I'm 40 if I want 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She will skate in the Grand Prix finals next week in St.  
Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Corwin, 20, of Hermosa Beach, Calif., nailed a triple  
loop-triple loop combination. She also hit three other triples, two 
in combination in one of the strongest performances of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited because nationals were a very depressing few  
days for me,'' said Corwin, who was sixth at the U.S. championships 
earlier this month. ``Tonight, I started off strong, but I got a 
little weak, then I pulled it off in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Continents event is for skaters outside of Europe,  
which holds an annual continental championship for its skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian couples dominated the ice dance, holding down three of  
the top four spots after the original dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Shae-Lynne Bourne and Victor Kraatz were first, even though  
Bourne is competing with torn cartilage in her left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been keeping my knee injury quiet up until this point  
and are just trying to deal with it,'' said Bourne, who was hurt a 
few weeks before she and Kraatz won their seventh Canadian 
championship last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time world bronze medalists will decide after the Four  
Continents whether they will skate at the Grand Prix final. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourne didn't show any outward signs of knee problems during the  
waltz in the original dance. But she admitted she is feeling pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Chantal Lefebvre and Michel Brunet moved up a notch from third  
to second after the original dance. Compatriots Megan Wing and 
Aaron Lowe moved up from sixth to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	American champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev dropped to  
third heading into the free dance Friday night.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Outlines Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a sweeping review of world problems,  
President Clinton warned Friday that NATO is ``prepared to act'' in 
Kosovo, pledged to redouble his efforts for peace in the Middle 
East and offered encouragement to Russia and China in their 
struggle for prosperous stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out his foreign policy hopes for the final two years of  
his presidency, Clinton said, ``For our nation to be strong, we 
must maintain a consensus that seemingly distant problems can come 
home if they are not addressed and addressed promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans should resist the temptation for ``minding our own  
business'' just because there is no overriding threat to U.S. 
security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, flanked by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and  
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, spoke before an audience of 
foreign policy specialists. He used the occasion to announce he was 
certifying Mexico as a reliable ally in the war against drugs -- 
even though Mexico has ``a serious drug problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he was lifting sanctions imposed on  
Nigeria for its alleged role in drug trafficking. It was a reward 
to Nigeria's transition government for guiding the country toward 
democracy after long years of military rule. Presidential elections 
are set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his policy change, Clinton lifted a requirement that the  
United States vote against loan requests by Nigeria in 
international lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel where Clinton spoke, hundreds of protesters  
demonstrated about a variety of causes. One person carried a sign: 
``Clinton -- king of corruption in the reign of raunch.'' Another 
sign said: ``No NAFTA for Africa.'' Clinton flew to Los Angeles 
later for a $200,000 political fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is on the right path to the future and moving in the  
right direction,'' Clinton told cheering Democrats. ``We've come a 
long way in the last six years. We've had a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation must ``take advantage of these good times to  
deal with the big, long-term challenges we face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger described Clinton's speech as the foreign policy  
equivalent of his State of the Union address. It was intended to 
respond to critics who say ``there is no big threat out there'' and 
``we ought to tend to our own knitting,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the fighting in Kosovo poses ``the biggest  
remaining danger'' to peace in the Balkans. Kosovo ``is not an easy 
problem. But if we don't stop the conflict now, it clearly will 
spread,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and ethnic Albanians are to return to the negotiating  
table March 15, and Clinton warned Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to refrain from violence, saying: ``President Milosevic 
should understand this is a time for restraint, not repression. And 
if he does not, NATO is prepared to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger expressed concern about Serb troops massing on the border  
of Kosovo. He said the United States and most of its allies believe 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana should use his authority to 
act if the Serbs engage in widescale repression. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has pledged to contribute 4,000 American ground troops  
to a NATO peacekeeping force for Kosovo if a peace agreement is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would make a special effort to pursue  
peace in the Middle East. ``I intend to use the time I have 
remaining in office to push for a comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East, to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to reach a just and 
final settlement, and to stand by our friends for peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the Middle East can do it, but time is precious  
and they can't afford to waste any more of it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said it was unlikely Clinton would undertake any major  
initiative before the Israeli elections in May and a possible 
runoff in June. But he said the president ``intends to put all the 
energy necessary into moving this forward after the elections, 
obviously assuming the parties are prepared to get serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright joined the president in San Francisco on her way to  
China. In Washington, the State Department said that China's human 
rights record deteriorated sharply late last year with a crackdown 
on political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States must respond to the challenge of  
bringing ``our former adversaries, Russia and China, into the 
international system as open, prosperous, stable nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said China had made ``incredible progress in lifting people  
out of poverty and building a new economy.'' But at the same time, 
``They remain unwilling to open up their political system, to give 
people a peaceful outlet for dissent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said China will come to understand that it ``simply cannot  
purchase stability at the expense of freedom.'' He said the United 
States must expand its cooperation ``through principled and 
purposeful engagement with China, its government and its people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Russia, Clinton said the United States must come to  
the aid of a nation weakened by a legacy of communism. ``The 
dimensions of this problem are truly enormous. Eight years after 
the Soviet collapse, the Russian people are hurting,'' Clinton 
said.	   ``Yet, we have as much of a stake today in Russia in overcoming 
these challenges as we did in checking its expansion during the 
Cold War. This is not a time for complacency or self-fulfilling 
pessimism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian people will decide their own future,'' Clinton  
said. ``But we must work with them for the best possible outcome, 
with realism and with patience. If Russia does what it must to make 
its economy work, I am ready to do everything I can to mobilize 
adequate international support for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His speech came a day after a rare presidential admission of  
failures in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no progress, although I've tried, in trying to get  
Greece and Turkey to get along,'' he said late Thursday night at a 
political fund-raising dinner. ``I've made no progress in trying to 
resolve the tensions between India and Pakistan.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kerry Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The decision by Sen. John Kerry against  
challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential 
nomination shrinks the contest to a virtual two-man race, according 
to some political observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Democrat announced Friday that he wouldn't run  
against front-runner Gore, leaving former Sen. Bill Bradley of New 
Jersey as Gore's only declared competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart loves these issues. My heart said go out and fight  
for these things. My head said the day after I make an announcement 
I have to raise an exorbitant amount of money and do it all in 10 
months,'' Kerry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other leading Democrats who have decided not to challenge Gore  
include Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota, and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than Jesse Jackson, who could play a spoiler role and be  
an uncomfortable opponent for Al Gore, I think we have the field. 
This is a two-person field,'' said Washington political consultant 
Stuart Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, a three-term senator, had complained about raising more  
than $20 million to campaign. His wife, Teresa Heinz, widow of Sen. 
John Heinz, R-Pa., is a multimillionaire, but Kerry said he and his 
wife had decided it would be ``inappropriate'' to use their own 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry said the impeachment hearings hindered his ability to  
attract donations, and many key supporters and fund-raisers were 
reportedly already committed to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of the impeachment trial, Kerry has traveled coast  
to coast and re-evaluated the campaign. He concluded that while he 
might have done well in neighboring New Hampshire, the decision by 
California to move its presidential primary from June to March 2000 
-- when New York also holds its primary -- would have required too 
much upfront cash for political ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, 55, did not rule out a future presidential run and said  
he would endorse one of the Democratic contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals were disappointed but not surprised. ``The enormity of  
the task probably has to put a chill into anyone,'' said state 
Speaker of the House Thomas Finneran, D-Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry gained national attention in the 1970s as a decorated  
Vietnam veteran who upon his return spoke out against the war. He 
co-founded Vietnam Veterans Against the War and ran unsuccessfully 
for Congress in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a county prosecutor until being elected lieutenant  
governor of Massachusetts. From there, he launched a successful 
campaign for Senate, succeeding the late Paul Tsongas in 1984. He 
survived a challenge by former Gov. William F. Weld in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Final Witness in Microsoft Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- And then there was one.  
</P>
<P>
	In an important milestone of the government's antitrust case  
against Microsoft Corp., lawyers planned today to begin -- and 
finish -- questioning the last witness during this stage of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after an extraordinary recess of at least six weeks,  
Microsoft and the government will present to the judge their 
rebuttal arguments, each using testimony from three more witnesses 
who haven't all been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's final defense witness was Robert Muglia, a senior  
vice president who refuted earlier testimony that the company 
sought to undermine the rival ``Java'' technology from Sun 
Microsystems Inc., which allows software to run on a variety of 
computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation is part of the government's theme that Microsoft  
illegally wields its monopoly power to smother potential 
competitors of its lucrative Windows franchise. Microsoft denies 
that it possesses monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	Muglia, arguing that Microsoft was competing for ``the hearts  
and minds of software developers,'' said the company tried to 
encourage them to use Windows-only features that effectively 
prevent their Java programs from running under other operating 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were right and successfully executed our strategy, then  
Sun's attempts to use Java to establish a new development platform 
to replace Windows would not be successful,'' Muglia said in 
written testimony. ``... Developers can easily choose to use 
Microsoft's programming tools to write 'pure' cross-platform Java 
applications if they wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was expected today to finish briefly questioning its  
next-to-last witness, senior executive Joachim Kempin, who was 
responsible for the company's deals with the nation's computer 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kempin on Thursday defended restrictions that Microsoft puts on  
the sale of its Windows software, saying it doesn't want other 
companies to ``butcher'' its dominant operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's own questioning of Kempin generally lacked the  
courtroom drama that has recently become characteristic of the 
trial. Kempin, in his heavy Germanic accent, forcefully butted 
heads with Justice Department lawyer David Boies in occasionally 
feisty exchanges but neither gave much ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Kempin complained that he already had answered a  
question from Boies. ``The answer was?'' Boies asked. ``Because 
sometimes your answers change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that computer makers are free to install  
whatever rival software they want and to offer it as prominently 
Microsoft's. But it won't let companies make material changes to 
Windows, such as removing or hiding Microsoft's browser, called 
Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft's refusal to allow  
companies to make changes to Windows -- such as removing easy access 
to its bundled Internet software -- is designed to hurt rivals 
offering similar software features.

<HEADLINE> Man Takes on Three Would-Be Robbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI, Fla. (AP) -- Relying on his military training, a former  
commando managed to fend off and help catch three men who had burst 
into his hotel room posing as police. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Greer, 27, a former Army Airborne Ranger, returned from  
walking his two dogs Thursday morning to find the men in his hotel 
room and his wife, Rebecca, 32, tied up and screaming in the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Paul, Minn., native -- who moved here with his wife just  
over a week ago -- fought with the men, managed to untie his wife, 
then chased after the assailants for miles until police caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's instinctive, at least from the training that I've  
had in the military,'' Greer said at a news conference. ``They were 
in my room. They could have injured my wife -- and it's about not 
letting them get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greer's body showed signs of bites to the neck, legs and hands,  
as well as scratches to the face and blows to the eye. He took on 
two of the men at once in the hotel hallway before a bystander 
helped pin one down. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a barefoot Greer took off after the other two, who couldn't  
flee in their car because they had left behind the keys. It led 
across a road, over a fence and along a service road bordering 
Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have followed them for about two and a half or three  
miles,'' Greer said. ``Then I got the assistance that I needed from 
the police officers. They were able to detain one and then they 
were able to corner another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the three would-be robbers as William Coleman,  
35; Esteban Sanchez, 25; and, Michael Walker, 41. All face armed 
burglary, kidnapping and other charges, Detective Rudy Espinosa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, Sanchez and Walker all showed bruises from their  
encounter with the former Army Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade police said Mrs. Greer suffered only minor injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing okay, she's really shook up,'' Greer said. ``She's  
the real victim in this case.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Outlines Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a sweeping review of world problems,  
President Clinton warned Friday that NATO is ``prepared to act'' in 
Kosovo, pledged to redouble his efforts for peace in the Middle 
East and offered encouragement to Russia and China in their 
struggle for prosperous stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Laying out his foreign policy hopes for the final two years of  
his presidency, Clinton said, ``For our nation to be strong, we 
must maintain a consensus that seemingly distant problems can come 
home if they are not addressed and addressed promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans should resist the temptation for ``minding our own  
business'' just because there is no overriding threat to U.S. 
security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, flanked by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and  
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, spoke before an audience of 
foreign policy specialists. He used the occasion to announce he was 
certifying Mexico as a reliable ally in the war against drugs -- 
even though Mexico has ``a serious drug problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he was lifting sanctions imposed on  
Nigeria for its alleged role in drug trafficking. It was a reward 
to Nigeria's transition government for guiding the country toward 
democracy after long years of military rule. Presidential elections 
are set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his policy change, Clinton lifted a requirement that the  
United States vote against loan requests by Nigeria in 
international lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel where Clinton spoke, hundreds of protesters  
demonstrated about a variety of causes. One person carried a sign: 
``Clinton -- king of corruption in the reign of raunch.'' Another 
sign said: ``No NAFTA for Africa.'' Clinton flew to Los Angeles 
later for a $200,000 political fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is on the right path to the future and moving in the  
right direction,'' Clinton told cheering Democrats. ``We've come a 
long way in the last six years. We've had a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation must ``take advantage of these good times to  
deal with the big, long-term challenges we face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger described Clinton's speech as the foreign policy  
equivalent of his State of the Union address. It was intended to 
respond to critics who say ``there is no big threat out there'' and 
``we ought to tend to our own knitting,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the fighting in Kosovo poses ``the biggest  
remaining danger'' to peace in the Balkans. Kosovo ``is not an easy 
problem. But if we don't stop the conflict now, it clearly will 
spread,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs and ethnic Albanians are to return to the negotiating  
table March 15, and Clinton warned Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to refrain from violence, saying: ``President Milosevic 
should understand this is a time for restraint, not repression. And 
if he does not, NATO is prepared to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger expressed concern about Serb troops massing on the border  
of Kosovo. He said the United States and most of its allies believe 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana should use his authority to 
act if the Serbs engage in widescale repression. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has pledged to contribute 4,000 American ground troops  
to a NATO peacekeeping force for Kosovo if a peace agreement is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would make a special effort to pursue  
peace in the Middle East. ``I intend to use the time I have 
remaining in office to push for a comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East, to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to reach a just and 
final settlement, and to stand by our friends for peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the Middle East can do it, but time is precious  
and they can't afford to waste any more of it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said it was unlikely Clinton would undertake any major  
initiative before the Israeli elections in May and a possible 
runoff in June. But he said the president ``intends to put all the 
energy necessary into moving this forward after the elections, 
obviously assuming the parties are prepared to get serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright joined the president in San Francisco on her way to  
China. In Washington, the State Department said that China's human 
rights record deteriorated sharply late last year with a crackdown 
on political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States must respond to the challenge of  
bringing ``our former adversaries, Russia and China, into the 
international system as open, prosperous, stable nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said China had made ``incredible progress in lifting people  
out of poverty and building a new economy.'' But at the same time, 
``They remain unwilling to open up their political system, to give 
people a peaceful outlet for dissent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said China will come to understand that it ``simply cannot  
purchase stability at the expense of freedom.'' He said the United 
States must expand its cooperation ``through principled and 
purposeful engagement with China, its government and its people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Russia, Clinton said the United States must come to  
the aid of a nation weakened by a legacy of communism. ``The 
dimensions of this problem are truly enormous. Eight years after 
the Soviet collapse, the Russian people are hurting,'' Clinton 
said.	   ``Yet, we have as much of a stake today in Russia in overcoming 
these challenges as we did in checking its expansion during the 
Cold War. This is not a time for complacency or self-fulfilling 
pessimism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian people will decide their own future,'' Clinton  
said. ``But we must work with them for the best possible outcome, 
with realism and with patience. If Russia does what it must to make 
its economy work, I am ready to do everything I can to mobilize 
adequate international support for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His speech came a day after a rare presidential admission of  
failures in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made no progress, although I've tried, in trying to get  
Greece and Turkey to get along,'' he said late Thursday night at a 
political fund-raising dinner. ``I've made no progress in trying to 
resolve the tensions between India and Pakistan.''

<HEADLINE> McCain to GOP: Stop Sniping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, casting himself as  
the conscience of the GOP presidential field, promised on Friday 
``not to stoop to negative campaigning against fellow Republicans'' 
and challenged his rivals to take a similar pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scorched earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an  
Al Gore presidency,'' the Arizona senator warned in a speech 
prepared for delivery to the California Republican Party. And he 
urged activists to withhold their support from any GOP candidate 
who attacks another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let us go down the road of mindlessly destroying each  
other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge will be put to the test almost immediately. Four  
other GOP presidential prospects addressing the same group Saturday 
have been highly critical of front-runner Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. They are former Vice President Dan Quayle, businessman Steve 
Forbes, activist Gary Bauer and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bush moves closer to a formal campaign, the attacks are  
likely to step up. Party leaders fear a repeat of the 1996 GOP 
primaries, when eventual nominee Bob Dole was hobbled by internal 
attacks, particularly from Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson promised this week to  
``blow the whistle'' on Republicans who break Ronald Reagan's 11th 
commandment of politics: Speak no ill of a fellow Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain advisers believe his high-road promise will help his  
standing as a maverick candidate unafraid of bucking political 
trends to advance good government. 
</P>
<P>
	They privately acknowledge that McCain can't win the nomination  
without the Texas governor faltering. But his campaign doesn't need 
to attack Bush because other rivals are already doing the dirty 
work. Those foes have attacked Bush's ``compassionate 
conservatism'' slogan, accusing him of using ``weasel words'' and 
``mealy-mouth rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before McCain's arrival, the infighting was evident at the  
California convention. The state party refused to invite GOP 
presidential hopeful John Kasich, because the chairman of the House 
Budget Committee agreed two years ago to raise money for a 
Democratic congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview aboard the commercial flight that brought him to  
California, McCain said he is the best qualified presidential 
candidate. But he said that doesn't give him the right to tear his 
opponents down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say George Bush is not qualified or Elizabeth Dole is  
not qualified. What's the point? I think they are qualified,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The position may strike a chord with Republicans weary of losing  
partisan battles to a more unified Democratic Party -- from the 
government shutdown in 1995 to President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to hear somebody in the Reagan tradition get back  
to the basics of the party -- uplifting and optimistic themes 
instead of all these newfangled side tracks we're on,'' said Mary 
Lu Hamill of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats stick together,'' said her husband, Rich. ``We sort  
of crumble when we disagree with the Republican next to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, McCain said, ``I will not engage in personal  
attacks and the politics of division. I will not stoop to negative 
campaigning against my fellow Republicans. I will not run negative 
advertising. I give you my word on it. And I call on the other 
candidates to join me in that pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naming them, McCain said he respects all of his GOP rivals and  
is a friend of Bush, Dole and Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the day never comes when for the sake of personal  
ambition I try to destroy people I admire, and with whom I agree on 
most issues,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	His approach won't spare Gore, whom McCain sternly admonishes  
for the campaign fund-raising practices of the Clinton-Gore 
administration. ``The American people deserve a controlling ethical 
authority as well as controlling legal authority,'' he says at 
every campaign stop, referring to Gore's defense for making 
fund-raising calls from the White House. The vice president said 
there was ``no controlling legal authority'' forbidding his calls. 
</P>
<P>
	If McCain sticks to his pledge, it won't be the first time he  
has stood alone or nearly so. 
</P>
<P>
	He championed campaign finance reform and fought the tobacco  
industry, two ill-fated missions that bucked his party's 
leadership. He says his cede-no-ground approach stems from the 
years he spent in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me a greater sense of confidence,'' he said in the  
interview, squinting into the sun pouring through the plane's tiny 
window. ``I know the difference between right and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Political infighting is wrong, he said, ``and pretty stupid.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, 12 of the nation's GOP governors publicly lent  
their support for a Bush candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Govs. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Marc Racicot of Montana  
have led a drive over the past week to collect names of fellow 
Republican governors to back Bush. Those named Friday are: 
Cellucci, Racicot, John Engler of Michigan, John Rowland of 
Connecticut, Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, 
Jeb Bush of Florida, Bill Graves of Kansas, Mike Foster of 
Louisiana, Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Lincoln Almond of Rhode Island 
and Bill Owens of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others have committed to Bush but will not make public  
statements yet, a Racicot assistant said.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Reach Pact With Landeta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles agreed to terms  
Friday on a three-year contract with veteran punter Sean Landeta. 
</P>
<P>
	Landeta, 37, has played in the NFL for 14 years, most recently  
with the Green Bay Packers. He set team single-season records last 
year with a 37.1-yard net punting average and 30 punts inside the 
20-yard line. He ranks 12th on the league's career list with a 
43.6-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1983 to 1985, Landeta played for the Philadelphia (later  
Baltimore) Stars, who won two United States Football League 
championships. After his tour of duty with the Stars, Landeta 
joined the New York Giants as a free agent. He has also played for 
the Los Angeles and St. Louis Rams and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also signed free agent running back Tony Smith, a  
five-year veteran with Atlanta, Carolina, and the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 28, played for three years with the Falcons and ranked  
third in the NFL in 1993 with a 24.9-yard average on 38 kickoff 
returns. After his release in 1994, he became one of the first 10 
players to sign with the expansion Carolina Panthers. He missed the 
1995 season with a leg injury and later went to play in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Brazil OKs New Central Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil took an important step toward  
naming a new central banker Friday as a Senate panel approved the 
nomination of market-savvy economist Arminio Fraga. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before an often combative panel, Fraga defended his  
ideas for stabilizing Brazil's battered currency and keeping 
inflation under control. He also defended his past, his intentions 
and even his nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is relying on Fraga, a former associate of billionaire  
financier George Soros, to stabilize the wild swings in the 
country's currency, the real. The government allowed the currency 
to float last month, abandoning costly efforts to defend it on open 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga's nomination now heads for a vote before the full Senate,  
where the government holds an ample majority. But Fraga's 
association with Soros caused one opposition senator to compare his 
selection to ``putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Fraga promised measures to stop the slide of the  
real, which has lost 40 percent of its value since mid-January. 
``The preservation of the buying power of the currency should be 
the most important task of the Central Bank,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga said he prefers keeping interest rates high in order to  
protect the value of the real against other currencies. Rates now 
stand at 39 percent, and the government admits they are fueling 
Brazil's budget deficit and pushing the country into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan says the economy will shrink  
between 3-4 percent this year, and private analysts expect even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fraga says the sacrifice is needed to avoid the return of  
four-digit inflation. He predicted inflation will dip to 0.6 
percent a month in the last quarter and to a single digit for all 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33 senators on the panel drilled the Princeton-educated  
economist with questions for six hours, often digressing into 
diatribes against financial speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga, the son of an American mother and a Brazilian father,  
said his dual citizenship did not affect his allegiances or his 
eligibility to run the government's bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He also denied violating insider information norms when he was  
approached for the post late last month, when currency speculators 
forced the real down and nearly caused a run on banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the white marble Congress building, protesters brought  
dozens of chickens to illustrate the fox-in-the-henhouse 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never did anything that could have harmed my country,'' he  
said. ``I am here to serve my country as a technocrat and as an 
economist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga said he opposes restrictions on dollars leaving the  
country. ``Capital controls cut off access to foreign funding and 
therefore limit economic growth potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also endorsed a greater independence for the Central Bank and  
said bank officials who quit should be banned for a year from 
working in market-related jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraga also praised the International Monetary Fund, which is  
reveiwing an agreement for release of a $41.5 billion aid package. 
The IMF said the accord will be unveiled next week.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Study: Garbage Jobs Hazardous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The job not only stinks, but it's dangerous.  
</P>
<P>
	The rate of on-the-job deaths in Florida is 90 per 100,000  
garbage collectors, according to a new study by University of Miami 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's almost twice the national average -- 49 deaths per 100,000  
-- and more dangerous than piloting a plane and cutting timber, two 
of the most hazardous jobs in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a dirty job. We have gotten people hit by cars and  
bit by dogs,'' said James Stephens, 62, a garbage collector in 
Miami for 28 years who's suffered bumps and bruises but no serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, funded by the Florida Center for Solid and  
Hazardous Waste Management, spent a year watching Florida 
sanitation workers haul heavy bags and dodge cars. They analyzed 
five years of injury reports full of cuts, knee sprains, bruises 
and back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found the rate of injuries to be five to seven times  
higher than the average for other types of workers. That's 52 
injuries per 100 municipal solid-waste workers a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead researcher James Englehardt could not say why Florida's  
rate was so much higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we observed is back-breaking work,'' he said. ``It's  
extremely heavy labor with a potential for serious injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the garbage collectors who died nationwide  
perished in accidents involving automobiles and other vehicles. The 
UM study found that between 1993 and 1997, five of the 11 workers 
who died in Florida were killed in vehicle-related accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have slipped off the back of the truck and the truck ran  
over them,'' said Willie Seabrooks, president of the American 
Federation of State and County Municipal Employees for Miami-Dade 
County. ``Another guy ran away from a dog and jumped in the back of 
the truck and he got crushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cars can be deadly, though injuries more commonly are due to  
bags filled with broken glass, poison ivy and live animals.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Getting AIDS at Record Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black Americans are becoming infected with  
AIDS at record rates, receiving poorer care than whites and dying 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost two decades into the AIDS epidemic, about 1,000  
health care providers and activists gathered for the first medical 
conference on AIDS among black Americans -- a frantic hunt for ways 
to fight the exploding racial divide. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS in the United States is evolving from a disease that once  
mostly affected white homosexuals into one largely of poor blacks, 
often infected from dirty drug needles or heterosexual encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks make up 12 percent of the U.S. population but a  
devastating 45 percent of new AIDS cases. AIDS has been the leading 
killer of blacks between 25 to 44 for most of the decade. One in 50 
black men and one in 160 black women are estimated to be infected. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an historic event,'' Phill Wilson of the National  
Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership Forum told the conference 
Thursday. ``What we do ... will determine whether or not we make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no less a daunting challenge than we faced in the  
civil rights movement,'' added Dr. Stephen Thomas of Emory 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors, social workers and activists sought practical,  
day-to-day advice on fighting HIV, the AIDS virus, in communities 
often wracked by poverty and drugs, where a legacy of racism has 
left distrust of the medical system. 
</P>
<P>
	How do you get a drug user or a homeless person tested for HIV?  
How do you treat the hotel maid who can't afford the time off to go 
to a clinic only open weekdays? You're surprised that the bus 
driver quit taking the AIDS medicine you prescribed -- even though 
the main side effect was diarrhea? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about reaching ... people who might not have had  
a meal since noon yesterday, and they're still sitting in the 
clinic'' for four hours because the doctor overbooked, complained 
Debra Hickman of Baltimore's Sisters Together and Reaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the thorny issue of preventing and treating HIV in  
prisons. ``Our men are in the jails. They do come home to their 
wives and girlfriends,'' warned a California AIDS worker, 
describing one reason HIV infection is growing fast among black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do many black doctors specialize in AIDS, complained a  
Colorado nurse who described herself as the only black AIDS health 
worker in her town. White doctors ``do care, but they don't 
understand when I say, 'Patients don't trust you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has declared AIDS among minorities a crisis.  
The administration is spending $156 million this year and seeking 
$171 million next year to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton last year refused to use federal money to buy clean  
needles for drug addicts, one way to prevent HIV's spread. 
Frustrated at the ban, administration doctors urged local 
communities Thursday to raise the money themselves for needle 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	And critics questioned if the government's work is fair: One new  
program calls for 35 percent of AIDS research sites to be in 
minority communities, but two-thirds of new infections now occur in 
those communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference's main goal was to empower workers on the front  
lines of AIDS, providing information and resources to help their 
communities, said Cornelius Baker of the National Association of 
People With AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, ``We need to make care more culturally appropriate.  
Maybe clinics need Sunday hours, or you could give health care at 
church after Sunday services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And grass-roots doctors who don't often get to the fancy  
international AIDS meetings hungered for the latest data, 
questioning experts on which drugs to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can be flexible,'' said Dr. Joel Gallant of Johns Hopkins  
University. Not everyone needs that much-publicized but expensive 
``protease inhibitor'' cocktail right away, he said. Newly infected 
patients with low HIV levels might be all right not starting drugs 
for a while. Got a patient who won't swallow 15 pills a day? Some 
new drugs require far fewer. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no easy solutions.  
</P>
<P>
	Take Gallant's advice for doctors to test even newly diagnosed  
patients' blood to see if their HIV will resist certain drugs. The 
immediate response: Medicaid and other programs don't pay for those 
tests, so how can we use them?

<HEADLINE> Italian Leads Solo Sailing Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Italian navigator Giovanni  
Soldini took the lead Friday in a solo sailing race around the 
world while his nearest contender inched toward the Falkland 
Islands in the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini is expected to reach Punta del Este next Tuesday or  
Wednesday, race director Mark Schrader said by phone from the 
Uruguayan port. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow competitor Isabelle Autissier of France, whom Soldini  
rescued Feb. 16 when her yacht capsized, was still on the Italian's 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former frontunner Marc Thiercelin of France, who  
snapped his mast Thursday in the South Atlantic, held course toward 
the Falklands at 4 or 5 knots and is expected to arrive Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin was spotted by a Royal Air Force craft on a training  
flight from the British base on the islands, Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
	The French navigator, who averted any danger of sinking by  
sawing away the toppled mast and snarled rigging, made a jury rig 
out of bits and pieces on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiercelin had commanded an 18-hour lead over Soldini after  
leaving Auckland, New Zealand, on the third leg of the Around Alone 
regatta, a 27,000-nautical mile globe-girdling voyage. 
</P>
<P>
	The race began in September in Charleston, S.C., and is to end  
there in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchman's shore crew is in Uruguay and studying such  
options as flying a replacement mast to Thiercelin in the 
Falklands' Port Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier was plucked unharmed from her overturned yacht in the  
Southern Ocean, about 1,800 miles west of the southernmost tip of 
South America.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Storm Drops 2 Feet of Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A powerful storm that slammed into the Northeast  
slowed significantly early today after piling up nearly 2 feet of 
snow from Rhode Island to Cape Cod and leaving thousands of people 
shivering without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it spins back out to sea, the storm that has packed  
gale-force gusts could brush coastal New England -- particularly 
eastern Massachusetts -- with even more snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Roaring in amid a relatively balmy winter, the storm hammered  
the Northeast coast before daybreak Thursday, shutting down schools 
and businesses and forcing the cancellation of more than half the 
flights at Boston's Logan International Airport at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was open for business this morning, but some flights were  
delayed or canceled. Many schools remained closed today in 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Major cities, including New York, were spared the storm's worst  
wrath. On Cape Cod, plows couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Rusher, a Hyannis woman old enough to say she knows better  
than to tell her age, thinks it may be the worst storm she's ever 
seen. It was just about more than she could manage to put one foot 
in front of the other to get back from a neighbor's house on Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody came and plowed my driveway out close to 4:30, and  
there's all of 6 inches back again,'' Rusher said Thursday evening. 
``It's not the usual storm we've had the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15,000 homes were without power through much of the  
night on Cape Cod and islands Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The 
Red Cross set up emergency shelters on the Cape. 
</P>
<P>
	About 17 inches fell on Nantucket and 13.5 inches in Plymouth by  
early this morning. Boston got 6 inches in 24 hours. Ferry service 
was expected to resume to Nantucket this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Simeone of East Dennis, Mass., was aghast at the Cape Cod  
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep looking at it on my deck and I'm horrified,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nor'easter also sent police and firefighters into the cold  
night searching for 9-year-old Cory Anderson, who disappeared as he 
looked for his dog at midday in Norton, northeast of Providence, 
R.I. He didn't come home. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor found Cory's dog shortly after the boy went looking  
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews of police and volunteers battled snowdrifts and  
poor visibility to comb a two-square-mile area of woods, lake and 
cranberry bogs in the south shore town in search of the child. 
Divers and search dogs were to be brought in this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to lose some of its punch today, with  
sometimes heavy snow tapering to flurries. But 2 to 5 inches of 
fresh new snow could push totals to 2 feet. Partly sunny skies were 
predicted for later today. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm piled snow across New York's eastern Long Island and  
pounded coastal areas of southeastern Connecticut, where sandy 
beaches were buried under a heavy frosting. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday afternoon, the Rhode Island cities of Coventry and  
Foster had more than a foot of snow. Westerly and Providence had 10 
inches. Middletown got 7 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sessions of both houses of the Rhode Island's General Assembly  
were called off, and legislators went home as utilities geared up 
for a long night. 
</P>
<P>
	At T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, R.I., airline travelers  
scrutinized departures boards with dismay as flight after flight 
was canceled. By 5 p.m. Thursday, the airport had 9 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers' nightmares were a many a child's delight.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did a little dance when I woke up this morning'' and found  
out school had been called off, said 11-year-old Tommy Kumes, 
dragging a sled up a hill Thursday at a park in Cranston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	In city after city along the coast, grownups were warned to stay  
off roads. Some stayed home from work to avoid blizzard-like 
conditions; some were sent home early.

	Iranians Vote in Local Elections  
</P>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranians cast ballots today in the nation's  
first election of local officials in 20 years. Reformists are 
hoping to gain the upper hand in a power struggle against 
hard-liners in the Islamic government. About 330,000 candidates, 
including 5,000 women, are contesting the elections for Islamic 
Councils. Council members manage local government in cities, towns 
and villages. Nationwide, more than 200,000 seats are at stake. The 
vote is a contest between supporters of popular President Mohammad 
Khatami and hard-line rivals who are trying to stymie his attempts 
at reform.

	New England Covered in Snow  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Nor'easter dumped heavy snow across coastal New  
England yesterday, forcing the cancellation of thousands of 
flights. Plows couldn't keep up on Cape Cod and the coast south of 
Boston as the storm dumped up to 16 inches along the Cape. Fourteen 
inches fell in parts of Rhode Island, and an inch in Portland, 
Maine. By nightfall, snow was also falling as far south as New 
Jersey, New York City and Long Island, and Connecticut.

	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Scores of rescuers used long metal  
probes to search for people still believed buried beneath tons of 
snow in the village of Galtuer following a deadly avalanche. 
Earlier yesterday, in Valzur, rescuers found a 4-year-old boy who 
survived 100 minutes under the snow. But the death toll from two 
avalanches continued to rise, climbing to 33. Meanwhile, dozens of 
helicopters ferried food and supplies into the stricken area, and

survey released yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention found that 39.3 percent of people ages 18 to 64 living 
in neighborhoods they characterize as ``not at all safe'' reported 
no physical activity or exercise in the preceding month. That

should wait to see what the International Olympic Committee does at 
a special assembly next month.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Nichols' Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that Terry  
Nichols was fairly tried and sentenced, upholding his conspiracy 
conviction and a life prison term for his role in the Oklahoma City 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Nichols argued there were 11 grounds for dismissal  
of his conviction and sentence. In a 52-page decision issued 
Friday, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected each one. 
</P>
<P>
	``After consideration of the issues, we see no error in the  
actions of the district court and affirm its judgment,'' the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also upheld was the lower court's order that Nichols pay $14.5  
million in restitution to victims of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred 
P. Murrah Federal Building, which killed 168 people and injured 500 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of first-degree  
murder, conspiracy and weapons-related charges and sentenced to 
death. His lawyers have appealed his sentence and conviction to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected a defense claim that the trial judge  
erred in his instructions to the jury during Nichols' trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch should have  
told the jury that Nichols could not be sentenced to life 
imprisonment unless he had ``a specific intent to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury acquitted Nichols of first-degree murder and using a  
weapon of mass destruction, and the defense argued that in the 
absence of guilty verdicts on those charges he should have received 
a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence presented to the jury and relied upon by the  
district judge at sentencing establishes the malicious nature of 
Mr. Nichols' conduct,'' the appeals court wrote in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Nichols reached an agreement with Mr. McVeigh and its  
objective was to detonate a 3,000-6,000 pound truck bomb in front 
of the Murrah building,'' it said. ``Both defendants intended to 
use the bomb as a weapon of mass destruction against not only the 
building but the persons inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also rejected a claim that Matsch should have barred  
testimony from a British forensic expert who testified that a bomb 
in the cargo compartment of a Ryder truck allegedly rented by 
McVeigh was the source of the explosion. The defense claimed she 
exceeded her level of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	Also rejected was Nichols' claim that he should have been  
allowed to introduce a former FBI agent as an expert witness. Dr. 
Frederick Whitehurst had evidence questioning prosecutors' claims 
that fertilizer crystals found on truck pieces could have survived 
a night in the rain, defense lawyer Michael Tigar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the court rejected claims that the judge should have  
refused to admit the testimony of informant Michael Fortier, who 
testified in exchange for a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities to the  
bomb plot and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

</P>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Bates, a former FBI agent  
who led the hunt for kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst and 
supervised the initial stages of the Watergate investigation, died 
Thursday of a stroke. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates also led the investigation into the 1976 kidnapping of 26  
Chowchilla children and their school bus driver in the San Joaquin 
Valley. The victims escaped without injury, and three men were 
arrested and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the FBI in 1941 and worked for the bureau at various  
times in Omaha, Buffalo, Newark, Washington D.C. and Cleveland. He 
retired in 1977.

 *John L. Goldwater    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John L. Goldwater, the creator of the syndicated  
comic character Archie, died Friday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater grew up in East Harlem as an orphan and, as a  
teen-ager, left to travel across the country, working odd jobs as 
he went. After returning to New York several years later, he worked 
loading magazines at the docks before creating the Archie character 
in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved Superman and he wanted to create a kind of opposite  
to Superman,'' said his wife, Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from being a ``superhero,'' Archie is an average teen-ager  
with a penchant for getting into trouble. The red-haired character 
was an instant success and remained popular decades after his first 
appearance in print. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, Archie made his television debut. In 1973,  
Goldwater wrote ``Americana in Four Colors.'' ``Archie: To 
Riverdale and Back Again,'' a television movie based on the Archie 
characters, was broadcast on NBC in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Archie was based partly on a red-headed friend of his named  
Archie,'' Mrs. Goldwater said. ``He also created Betty and 
Veronica. Then he decided Archie needed a real good friend. That 
was Jughead. It just grew and grew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater ran Archie Comic Publications until his retirement in  
1983. The Archie comic books are now published in over 35 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldwater also founded the Comics Magazine Association of  
America and served as its president for 25 years. He was also a 
national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League.

<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Lena Markham, who helped found a church for  
black Catholics, died Wednesday. She was 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Markham was born Oct. 25, 1888, in San Antonio, Texas,  
where she went to college and taught school. She married Clarence 
Markham, a railroad worker, in 1910, and the family moved to Toledo 
in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	She was raised as a Roman Catholic, and in the mid-1920s helped  
form St. Benedict the Moor, a mission church in Toledo for black 
Catholics. The church was torn down in 1965 to make way for 
Interstate 75.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Glenn Seaborg, the Nobel Prize-winning  
chemist who discovered 10 atomic elements including plutonium and 
one that now bears his name, died Thursday night. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaborg, who worked on the Manhattan Project that unleashed the  
atomic bomb during World War II, served as chairman of the Atomic 
Energy Commission, forerunner to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
from 1961-1971. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with  
the late Edwin McMillan for research into the transuranium 
elements, Seaborg received the National Medal of Science in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``seaborgium'' was officially accepted as the name for  
element 106 in August 1997, it was the first time an element had 
ever been named for a living person.

of the Philadelphia Orchestra and director of Settlement Music 
School, died Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenbach, born in the Bronx, N.Y., began his career at age 5  
playing the piano. At 10, he played the bassoon in a Harlem 
children's orchestra. At 17, he played in the CBS orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoenbach took over Settlement at a time when the music school

left in 1981, 24 years later, enrollment was up to 3,000.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- David H. Smith, who co-developed a  
vaccine that has almost eradicated bacterial meningitis in the 
United States, died Tuesday of malignant melanoma, a skin cancer. 
He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and co-inventor Porter Anderson began developing the  
vaccine while both worked at the University of Rochester. After it 
hit the market, cases of Haemophilus influenzae Type B infections 
plummeted nationwide from 20,000 in 1987 to 81 in 1997, federal 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith formed Praxis Biologics, a company spun off from the  
University of Rochester in 1983. He eventually sold it for $232 
million, and put much of his wealth from the vaccine into a 
foundation that funds conservation and scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in  
Boston in the late 1960s to 1976, and chaired pediatrics at the 
University of Rochester from 1976 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Anderson were awarded the prestigious Lasker Clinical  
Medical Research Award in 1996 for their work on the vaccine. The 
same year, Smith received the Pasteur Award from the World Health 
Organization.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Award-winning theater director Jose  
Quintero, whose landmark productions of Eugene O'Neill dramas 
renewed interest in one of America's greatest playwrights, died 
Friday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero, who directed more than a dozen major productions of  
works by O'Neill, won two Tonys, for a production of ``Long Day's 
Journey into Night'' and for directing ``A Moon for the 
Misbegotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero was also a founder of Circle in the Square, a small  
Greenwich Village theater credited with energizing the off-Broadway 
movement after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked with Jason Robards, Colleen Dewhurst, George C. Scott  
and Geraldine Page during his nearly 50 years in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his 1952 revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Summer and  
Smoke,'' that first brought him and Circle in the Square attention. 
In 1956, he directed the original Broadway production of ``A Long 
Day's Journey into Night,'' which is generally considered to be his 
finest work. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintero and Robards joined forces on several other major  
O'Neill revivals on Broadway, including ``Hughie'' (1964); ``A Moon 
for the Misbegotten'' (1973); and ``A Touch of the Poet'' (1977). 
Robards and Dewhurst starred as the parents in a Quintero-directed 
Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed one film, ``The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone'' (1961),  
based on a Tennessee Williams novella.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Out of Solitary After Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson won this round.  
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight boxer was removed from solitary  
confinement Thursday and on Friday had telephone and other 
privileges restored after he appealed a disciplinary ruling at his 
Maryland jail, said his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's punishment for throwing a television set in a recreation  
room at the Montgomery County, Md., jail Feb. 19 ``was reduced to 
time served, and he was restored to regular privileges,'' said his 
lawyer Paul Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is back in his regular cell block, which he shares with  
two other prisoners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jail Director W.L. Smith received Tyson's appeal Wednesday,  
hours after a two-member panel at the jail ordered Tyson to 
solitary confinement for 20 days, said jail spokesman Eric 
Seleznow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith reviewed the appeal and suspended the remaining sanctions  
against Tyson, Seleznow said. The boxer has been placed on a 30-day 
institutional probation and could have his sentence reimposed if he 
commits further violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznow did not say specifically why Smith granted Tyson's  
appeal, but he did say the director tries to be consistent when 
reviewing all inmate cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Jail officials had accused Tyson of disorderly conduct,  
destruction of property and assaulting a corrections officer who 
was hit by shards of plastic when the TV was thrown. Tyson lost 
telephone, visitor and group activity privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp has said Tyson was provoked when he was abruptly taken off  
Zoloft -- an antidepressant drug he had been taking for four months 
-- after refusing to see a jail psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman of the  
psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical Center, met 
with the boxer Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg is now consulting with the medical director at the  
jail, Dr. Martin Colodzin, and Tyson is receiving the proper dosage 
of Zoloft, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer began serving a one-year jail term Feb. 5 after  
pleading no contest to charges he assaulted two men following a 
minor traffic accident in Gaithersburg, Md. in August. He has until 
March 7 to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said he has not yet decided whether to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation for a 1991 rape conviction in  
Indiana. He was released from prison in March 1995 after serving 
three years. Indiana officials are considering whether to revoke 
his probation based on his legal problems in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Disney Wants City Hall Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some City Hall officials think a request  
from Disney to use the newly renovated building as a backdrop for a 
Robin Williams movie could be trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney wants to use the landmark for a few days in April or June  
for filming of ``Bicentennial Man.'' The movie studio is willing to 
pay $5,000 a day for the legislative chambers, plus $300 a day for 
a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	The city film office strongly backs the project, but some  
officials are worried about damage to the stately columns, statues 
and gold embellishments that have made it a favorite spot for 
weddings and parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to remember that City Hall is a place for doing  
business,'' said Supervisor Michael Yaki, ``not for throwing 
parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Enke, location manager for the movie, said Disney would  
repair any damage.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Sorry for Broaddrick Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Sen. James Jeffords apologized Friday  
after saying Juanita Broaddrick's allegations that President 
Clinton sexually assaulted her are a ``private matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the kinds of things like that are supposedly  
private affairs and should stay that way,'' the Vermont Republican 
said on a radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by host Mark Johnson on Burlington radio station WKDR,  
the senator said, ``I don't know why it wouldn't be a private 
matter. If something that happened 21 years ago with a woman who 
invited, at least under her story, the president to her hotel room 
and she was not happy with what happened, I don't know why that's 
not a private matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick, an Arkansas nursing home administrator, said  
Clinton came to her hotel room in 1978 and sexually assaulted her. 
Clinton was the Arkansas attorney general at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, has called the  
allegations ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the radio program, Jeffords questioned Broaddrick's  
truthfulness and the timing of her allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords, who is up for re-election next year, later issued an  
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juanita Broaddrick's statements are disturbing and should be  
taken seriously, as any claim of rape should be. ... I truly 
apologize if my inarticulate comments this morning gave anyone the 
wrong impression,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's impeachment trial, Jeffords was the first  
Republican senator to go public with his decision to vote to acquit 
the president on both articles of impeachment.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A judge dismissed discrimination  
charges Friday filed by gays against a priest and a radio show

<P>
	The ruling found that Roman Catholic priest Minor Calvo did not  
illegally discriminate against homosexuals in a 1998 radio 
broadcast in which he criticized plans to hold a ``Lesbigay'' 
festival in San Jose. The festival was canceled because of heavy 
opposition.

	Two other doctors received warnings from the state-run Mexican  
Social Security Institute, which operates the hospital. It has 
pledged to cover the costs of treatment for one of the patients, 
who has tested HIV-positive.

<P>
	The doctors ``acted in good faith but violated procedures'' by  
not awaiting the results of an HIV test they had requested on the 
donor, Ricardo Cavazos Galvan, regional director of the institute, 
told local media.

<HEADLINE> Dozen GOP Govs. Publicly Back Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen Republican governors publicly lent  
their support Friday to a presidential candidacy by Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. Leaders of the drive to collect names say seven 
more gubernatorial Bush supporters are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and Gov. Marc Racicot of  
Montana began collecting names at last week's National Governors' 
Association meeting here. The pair divvied up a list of GOP 
governors -- 30 not including Bush -- to contact and on Friday 
released 12 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more governors have committed themselves to endorsing  
Bush, but will not make public statements until they inform party 
members in their states, said Andrew Malcolm, Racicot's executive 
assistant. Malcolm said another four are expected to announce their 
backing in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has not formally declared his candidacy. On Thursday, he  
promised an announcement about his presidential ambitions in two 
weeks. But an adviser to Bush said he will form an exploratory 
campaign committee in the next month, which would allow him to 
raise and spend money while testing his potential support. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors said they hope their coalition will encourage Bush  
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ideological and geographical breadth of support among  
Governor Bush's peers demonstrates just how strong a candidate he 
would be,'' Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Bush a ``proven winner,'' Racicot praised the Texas  
governor's pragmatic reforms and family-oriented administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Other governors listed as Bush supporters are: John Engler of  
Michigan, John Rowland of Connecticut, Frank Keating of Oklahoma, 
Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, Jeb Bush of Florida, Bill Graves of 
Kansas, Mike Foster of Louisiana, Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Lincoln 
Almond of Rhode Island and Bill Owens of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, eldest son of the former president, said Friday he intends  
to reveal more about his plans next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next week I'll discuss it with you as to whether or not I want  
to take this process a step further,'' Bush said. ``The decision is 
yes, I'm going to run; no, I'm not going to run, or I might run.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kerry Won't Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Conceding that he might damage his party's chances  
to win the presidency if he were to run, Sen. John Kerry said 
Friday he will skip the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart loves the battle. My heart loves these issues. My  
heart said go out and fight for these things. My head said the day 
after I make an announcement I have to raise an exorbitant amount 
of money and do it all in 10 months,'' the Massachusetts Democrat 
said at a news conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to challenge front-runner Vice President Al  
Gore for the Democratic nomination leaves former Sen. Bill Bradley 
of New Jersey as Gore's only declared competitor so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's decision could attract others to the field. Jesse  
Jackson is among those who have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other prominent Democrats who have decided against a run  
are Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone, and House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry said he will eventually endorse one of the Democrats, but  
declined to do that Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, a three-term senator, had complained about raising more  
than $20 million to campaign. His wife, Teresa Heinz, widow of Sen. 
John Heinz, R-Pa., is a multimillionaire, but Kerry said Friday 
that he and his wife had decided it would be ``inappropriate'' to 
use their own money. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals were disappointed but not surprised. ``The enormity of  
the task probably has to put a chill into anyone,'' said state 
Speaker of the House Thomas Finneran, D-Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision evoked memories of the 1980 presidential race, when  
the state's senior senator, Ted Kennedy, ran unsuccessfully and was 
criticized for hurting President Jimmy Carter's chances for 
re-election against Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, many key supporters and fund-raisers were reportedly  
already committed to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, 55, gained national attention in the 1970s as a decorated  
Vietnam veteran who upon his return spoke out against the war. He 
co-founded Vietnam Veterans Against the War and ran unsuccessfully 
for Congress in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a county prosecutor until being elected lieutenant  
governor of Massachusetts. From there, he launched a successful 
campaign for Senate, succeeding the late Paul Tsongas in 1984. He 
survived a challenge by former Gov. William F. Weld in 1996.

	IT'S 2000. ALL THE BUGS ARE GONE. NOW WHAT?: Companies that help  
computer users deal with Year 2000 bugs are hot commodities right 
now, but if they haven't figured out yet what they'll do once all 
the problems are fixed, they could be in trouble, says Individual 
Investor magazine. These companies, specialists in information 
technology, will see their revenue decline sharply next year if 20 
percent or more of their business comes from Y2K contracts, the 
magazine says. The most vulnerable are entrepreneurial concerns 
founded primarily on one idea or product for fixing the bugs.

	SHOES THAT PINCH YOUR WALLET TOO: Parents grimace when they see

Sporting Goods Association. The trade group found basketball shoes 
averaged $55.48 a pair last year, down 0.2 percent from 1997's 
$55.57. But baseball and softball shoe prices were up a sharp 9 
percent, rising to an average $43.03 a pair from $39.49. Golfers 
wore the most expensive sports shoes, paying an average $56.30 a 
pair -- but that was 6.3 percent less than the previous year's 
$60.11.

how bad the damage is over the course of a year, how does $26,379 
sound? American Express surveyed more than 800 adults in January 
and came up with that projection for a typical budget in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey included 803 people nationwide who  
identified themselves as the head of their household. They were 
asked about their expenses for groceries and fast-food, gasoline 
and tolls, utilities, insurance, health care, charitable donations, 
subscriptions, tuition, cable, phone and pager, taxes, home 
furnishings, drug store and beauty items -- but not rent or mortgage 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 percent of the respondents lived alone, 35 percent had  
two family members, 19 percent had three family members and 17 
percent had four family members. The others had households of five 
or more people.

	THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIPPING: If you tip a lot, it may not be  
because you're getting great service. You may just be neurotic. 
Cornell University professor Michael Lynn, quoted in Travel Holiday 
magazine, says his research shows the primary motivation for 
tipping in the United States is social approval. ``You feel you 
have to do what is expected,'' Lynn says. ``And you want the server 
to like you.'' Lynn says he's found that servers in restaurants 
earn bigger tips when they introduce themselves, smile, crouch down 
by the table and draw little smiling faces on the check.

<HEADLINE> Can Duke Go Unbeaten in ACC? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Duke never needs additional motivation  
when playing North Carolina -- but there it is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils, in one of college basketball's great rivalries,  
on Saturday can become the first team to go 16-0 in Atlantic Coast 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is a very challenging week for us,'' coach Mike  
Krzyzewski said. ``I don't want to get into making excuses but 
we'll see if we can play at that high, emotional level in this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 Blue Devils (28-1, 15-0) will also be going for a  
school-record 24th consecutive victory when they face the No. 14 
Tar Heels (22-7, 10-5) at the Smith Center, where they haven't won 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils clinched their sixth ACC regular-season title of  
the decade on Feb. 17 and have virtually secured a top seed in the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tendency to look ahead and we're trying to make sure  
that doesn't happen,'' Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	His players don't think that will happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Shane Battier, who is doubtful for Saturday's game with an ankle  
sprain, said the 24-point loss to the Tar Heels last season -- the 
Blue Devils' worst defeat in the series since 1983 -- is enough 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's added incentive,'' Battier said. ``Our season isn't  
defined by numbers. But combined with the humiliation we suffered 
there last year and being on the verge of this record, it would be 
very special to win there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven ACC teams (North Carolina three times, North Carolina  
State twice and South Carolina and Duke once) have gone unbeaten 
through the ACC regular season, but none won 16 games. Krzyzewski 
insists he isn't worried about the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to bring that up now, the kids will think I'm a  
phony,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I've always felt like, `Let's just play 
really hard, let's try to win the conference and let's try to win 
the national championship.' Those are our goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand, who scored 12 points in Duke's 89-77 win over North  
Carolina on Jan. 27, has some personal incentive for Saturday's 
game. Brand broke his left foot last December and missed the 97-73 
rout at the Smith Center last Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only arena in the ACC I haven't played in,'' said  
Brand, the league's second-leading scorer at 17.6 points per game. 
``It's definitely motivation, of course, beating Carolina, but also 
being 16-0 in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Motivation won't be any problem for the Tar Heels, who have nine  
wins over top-ranked teams, tied with Notre Dame for the most in 
NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely don't want them to make history on us,'' said  
North Carolina point guard Ed Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game will just add to the Duke-Carolina rivalry,'' said  
senior Ademola Okulaja, who will play in his 135th consecutive game 
in a North Carolina uniform. ``You have rivalries all over the 
place but none of them are as intense as Carolina and Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels have committed at least 16 turnovers in each of  
their last three games, all narrow victories. Duke leads the ACC in 
turnover margin, forcing nearly five more per game than its 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``All wins are great but we've done some things lately we  
shouldn't have done in these three games,'' North Carolina coach 
Bill Guthridge said. ``We're a good team, not a great team. But we 
about have to play a perfect game to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels will have an extra ballhandler in Jason Capel. He  
is expected to play after missing the first game with 
mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels are 10-3 against Duke at Smith Center, but  
Guthridge said the home court doesn't give North Carolina any 
advantage this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are saying, `Well, you played well over there  
and now you've got them at your place,' but they've proven they're 
an excellent road team,'' Guthridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really good teams like that are sometimes better on the road  
than they are at home. And Duke certainly doesn't have to rely on 
their fans to get them going.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to HIV Exposure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 21-year-old man pleaded guilty Friday to  
statutory rape and exposing women to the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nushawn Williams faces a prison term of four to 12 years on the  
Chautauqua County charges. Authorities believe he exposed more than 
a dozen young women to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was convicted earlier this month in New York City for  
exposing a 15-year-old girl to the virus. He is already serving a 
one-to-three-year sentence for selling crack and could receive an 
additional two to seven years for the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, the case caused health officials to take the  
extraordinary step of identifying Williams publicly, in the name of 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	State Health Department officials said a sweeping HIV-reporting  
and partner notification program is expected to begin in the spring 
in response to the Williams case.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Study: Garbage Jobs Hazardous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- James Stephens says collecting garbage for a living  
stinks -- literally. But researchers say the stench is nothing 
compared to hazards that make the job the deadliest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always a dirty job. We have gotten people hit by cars and  
bit by dogs,'' said Stephens, 62, a garbage collector in Miami for 
28 years who's suffered bumps and bruises but no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been lucky.  
</P>
<P>
	A new study by University of Miami researchers found the rate of  
on-the-job deaths in Florida at 90 per 100,000 garbage collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	That's almost twice the national average -- 49 deaths per 100,000  
-- and more dangerous than piloting a plane and cutting timber, two 
of the most hazardous jobs in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, funded by the Florida Center for Solid and  
Hazardous Waste Management, spent a year watching Florida 
sanitation workers haul heavy bags and dodge cars. They analyzed 
five years of injury reports full of cuts, knee sprains, bruises 
and back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found the rate of injuries to be five to seven times  
higher than the average for other types of workers. That's 52 
injuries per 100 municipal solid-waste workers a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead researcher James Englehardt could not say why Florida's  
rate was so much higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we observed is back-breaking work,'' he said. ``It's  
extremely heavy labor with a potential for serious injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the garbage collectors who died nationwide  
perished in accidents involving automobiles and other vehicles. The 
UM study found that between 1993 and 1997, five of the 11 workers 
who died in Florida were killed in vehicle-related accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have slipped off the back of the truck and the truck ran  
over them,'' said Willie Seabrooks, president of the American 
Federation of State and County Municipal Employees for Miami-Dade 
County. ``Another guy ran away from a dog and jumped in the back of 
the truck and he got crushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cars can be deadly, though injuries more commonly are due to  
bags filled with broken glass, poison ivy and even live animals.

<HEADLINE> Congress Assails INS Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers, citing the White House's  
decision not to seek 1,000 new Border Patrol agents next year, 
contend the Clinton administration is not doing enough to combat 
illegal immigration and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee  
also criticized Immigration and Naturalization Service managers for 
considering relieving some of the pressure on the agency's 
overburdened detention system by freeing some criminal aliens 
currently behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's record on release of criminal aliens and  
refusal to fund additional Border Patrol agents should be 
disturbing to everyone in the country,'' the panel's chairman, Rep. 
Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner testified that the  
administration was committed to border enforcement and said the 
much-criticized plan to release 1,500 nonviolent criminal aliens 
had been shelved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not released any aliens who are subject to mandatory  
detention under the 1996 immigration law'' and there are no plans 
to do so, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After word of the possible releases surfaced earlier this month,  
Smith and Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., threatened to seek 
Meissner's ouster. She said again Thursday she has no plans to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage of a sweeping immigration law in 1996 placed new  
pressures on the INS' detention program, with a requirement that 
the agency detain virtually all noncitizens whose criminal 
convictions have made them deportable. Before the requirement took 
full effect last October, the agency could release criminal aliens 
believed to pose no risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the pressure, the INS agreed to help the four Central  
American countries ravaged by Hurricane Mitch by temporarily 
delaying the deportations of detainees who otherwise would have 
been returned to their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS now has 16,400 people in custody -- triple the 5,500 five  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget constraints also have reduced available bed space,  
Meissner said. Last week, the agency requested an extra $80 million 
to add detention space. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Gallegly blamed INS managers for inefficiencies in the  
detention program, accusing them of failing to move quickly enough 
to identify and remove deportable criminal aliens who have 
completed their sentences in local jails and state or federal 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner also came under fire for the administration's decision  
not to seek 1,000 extra Border Patrol agents in its fiscal 2000 
budget. The 1996 immigration law directed the administration to add 
1,000 agents a year through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 70 percent of all illegal drugs coming across  
the Southwest border, the Border Patrol is ``our only line of 
defense,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration contends the Border Patrol, which has more  
than doubled since 1993, cannot continue to absorb new recruits at 
the current level. Nearly 40 percent of all Border Patrol agents 
have been on the job less than two years. Some worry that the ratio 
of inexperienced agents could pose problems for a force already 
accused at times of brutality.

<HEADLINE> California Republicans Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Fresh off November's losses,  
California Republicans will try to regroup at their convention this 
weekend as six White House hopefuls attempt to unify and rally the 
demoralized troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion looms as a potential stumbling block.  
</P>
<P>
	While one wing of the party supports abortion rights and another  
faction wants to bury the issue, all six of the presidential 
hopefuls oppose abortion. Several have unmistakably made banning 
abortion a central mission of their candidacies, and appear 
unlikely to shy away from it this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 1860s, Lincoln ended the moral outrage of slavery  
because he knew it was wrong. Abortion is the moral outrage of the 
20th century, and I will end it because it too is wrong,'' Sen. Bob 
Smith of New Hampshire said last week as he announced his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican moderates cringe at such words, believing that the  
party should soften its opposition and broaden its appeal to women. 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren spoke out against 
abortion in his campaign last year, and drew just 37 percent of 
female voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the verge of perfecting our circular firing-squad  
formation,'' warned Dan Schnur, a GOP media consultant who advised 
the Lungren campaign. Disputes over abortion and other issues have 
made state GOP conventions acts of ``semiannual self-immolation,'' 
he wrote in a recent opinion column. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some staunch abortion opponents want the issue to go away  
as the party seeks to rebuild four months after voters swept 
Republicans from nearly all statewide offices. Sensing the looming 
battle, they are publicly trying to avoid a bitter leadership 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day Smith was denouncing abortion in his candidacy  
speech, 23 Republican lawmakers -- several of whom have carried 
anti-abortion legislation -- called on state party activists to 
focus on other issues as they elect a new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like all the fights we're getting in the middle of  
over abortion or other things that seem to happen constantly within 
our party,'' said Republican Assemblyman Bruce Thompson, an 
abortion opponent from Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the Republican Party is probably in the worst shape  
it's ever been,'' he said. ``We are in disarray, we are lacking in 
leadership at the top of the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Valley entrepreneur John McGraw, currently the state  
party's vice chairman, would ordinarily ascend to chairman with 
little fanfare. But his fiercely anti-abortion views have prompted 
a challenge from Stanislaus County Republican leader Nicholas 
Bavaro, who has said he would, if elected, stress other themes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavaro and other moderates call themselves the Republican  
Mainstream Team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our current party leadership is seen by too many voters as  
`extreme,' even `radical,''' the team wrote to convention 
delegates. ``Democrats charge that a `cult of antiabortion zealots' 
run the state party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Fleischman, deputy executive director of the California  
Republican Party, said the GOP must realize it will not settle the 
abortion issue ``at this convention, or frankly any other 
convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have to understand that not everyone is going to  
agree on the platform,'' he said. ``You move forward on the issues 
of common agreement.''

<HEADLINE> Drag-Death Killer To Be Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- John William King could end up serving  
out his days on death row in a 5-by-9-foot cell, isolated from both 
black and white inmates who might have a score to settle with the 
racist killer. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, arrived on death row at the Ellis Unit of the state  
prison at Huntsville on Friday afternoon, one day after he was 
sentenced to lethal injection for chaining a black man to a pickup 
truck and dragging him to his death. There are 443 other men on 
death row. 
</P>
<P>
	All new arrivals on death row are kept apart from the other  
condemned men until prison officials determine when -- or if -- they 
will be allowed to spend recreation time with others and perform 
jobs around the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	During this evaluation period, the new arrivals spend 23 hours a  
day in their cells, with one hour of recreation all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of  
Criminal Justice, said the department has not decided what to do 
with King yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, some death row inmates are given work privileges,  
provided there is no danger to them or to others in letting them 
out of their cells. They might do janitorial jobs or work in the 
garment factory. 
</P>
<P>
	However, all death row inmates' work privileges were suspended  
until further notice after the unsuccessful escape attempt by seven 
condemned men last November. Now, Texas death row inmates get only 
an hour of face-to-face contact per day in recreation yards half 
the size of a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoners' rights advocate Ray Hill said King might never be  
allowed any contact with other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is a flashpoint to some of the population on death  
row, so to keep Texas from having another Jeffrey Dahmer situation, 
they'll keep him in pretty close quarters,'' Hill said. Dahmer, the 
Milwaukee serial killer, was beaten to death by another inmate in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald said that inmates who need protection or could be  
dangerous to others are not allowed to take part in recreation with 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued this week that King, who has dozens of racist  
tattoos, could be a murderous threat to minorities behind bars. 
Similarly, the 187 black men on death row might want to avenge the 
June 1998 killing of James Byrd Jr. near Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks aren't the only ones who might have a grudge against  
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzgerald said that King, when he was arrested, claimed to be a  
member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our investigation has revealed he was never a member,''  
Fitzgerald said. ``But as a result of making that claim, our gang 
intelligence people focused a lot of attention on the AB's that 
they did not want. He's not popular with the AB's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If King is kept apart from the others, he will be able to talk  
with other inmates through the bars but will rarely see them. 
</P>
<P>
	King's attorney, Brack Jones, noted his client's miserable  
prison prospects during closing arguments. He called King ``a dead 
man walking,'' whether he got life in prison or the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, new death row inmates can expect to spend six or  
seven years imprisoned before their appeals run out. A prisoner who 
chooses not to appeal could be executed in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said that King could become a hero to those who share his  
extreme beliefs. ``His isolation is going to have the ancillary 
effect of giving every other racist, Aryan nut a young, attractive 
role model,'' Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Has Polygraph Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Some of Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's witnesses in a case involving presidential accuser Kathleen 
Willey ran into problems when they took lie detector tests, a 
defense lawyer said Friday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming the witnesses, Eric Dubelier made the assertion  
in court as he argued unsuccessfully that Starr improperly 
assembled an obstruction indictment against Julie Hiatt Steele, who 
undercut Mrs. Willey's story that President Clinton made an 
unwelcome sexual advance in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a substantial polygraph issue with regard to their  
own witnesses,'' said Dubelier, who did not say how many of Starr's 
witnesses had polygraph problems. At another point, he said that 
``results of polygraph examinations'' are ``an issue for some of 
their own witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has given Mrs. Steele evidence in preparation for her  
March 30 trial, but at Starr's request, U.S. District Judge Claude 
Hilton has ordered the information kept secret for now. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing for secrecy, Starr said he is still investigating  
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection 
with the Willey matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has testified that Mrs. Willey's story was untrue.  
</P>
<P>
	Hilton denied a series of defense motions to dismiss the case or  
suppress Mrs. Steele's grand jury testimony. In the face of a 
defense motion, Starr deleted from the indictment the allegation 
that Mrs. Steele tried to obstruct Starr's grand jury investigation 
by making false statements on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dubelier made the comments about polygraph testing after  
referring to discussions between Starr's office and Mrs. Steele 
last year about Mrs. Steele taking a lie detector test. A written 
FBI interview summary says Mrs. Steele initially agreed a year ago 
to take a polygraph. She later refused on the advice of her 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Polygraph test results are not ordinarily admissible in court,  
but Mrs. Steele's lawyers could argue they are entitled to use the 
results to call into question the credibility of any Starr witness 
who testifies against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Courts are loosening up the standards for using polygraph  
evidence at trial,'' said former federal prosecutor Bruce Yannett. 
``Where you have a government witness who took a government 
polygraph and failed, it is certainly relevant information for the 
jury to have in order to assess that individual's credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement agencies use the tests to determine whether a  
person is being deceptive or not. In some cases, the test is 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before the judge, Dubelier, a former prosecutor on  
Starr's staff, said Mrs. Steele's lawyers are serving ``pro bono,'' 
free of charge, adding that her legal team is ``not part of some 
vast White House conspiracy to interfere with'' Starr's 
investigation of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor for 17 years, Dubelier recently left the U.S.  
attorney's office in Washington to join a law firm. He worked for 
Starr's office in 1996, investigating the White House's use of FBI 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey has alleged that Clinton made an unwanted sexual  
advance toward her in the White House in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele says she never heard Mrs. Willey's accusation before  
1997, and that she was acting on Mrs. Willey's instructions when 
she told Newsweek that year that Mrs. Willey had talked to her 
about the alleged Clinton advance immediately after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	She later signed an affidavit saying Mrs. Willey asked her to  
lie to the Newsweek reporter. Mrs. Steele expanded on that 
information in an FBI interview last March and in grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Mrs. Willey did tell Mrs. Steele about the  
alleged incident in 1993 and that Mrs. Steele lied to the grand 
jury about it.

<HEADLINE>  Students Storm Lebanese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARNOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- About 2,000 college students shouting  
``Death to Israel'' broke the Israeli military cordon around a 
southern Lebanese village today, cutting through barbed wire and 
crossing a declared minefield. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, Christians and Muslims from universities around  
Lebanon, were angered at Israel's takeover last week of Arnoun, 
three miles north of the Israeli border. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the whole world know that Arnoun is Lebanese, the whole  
south is Lebanese,'' said Ghassan Daou, an engineering student who 
was among the first to enter the village. 
</P>
<P>
	The students left the village hours later as night fell. Israeli  
forces and allied militiamen did not confront them directly, and 
there were no reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 35 Lebanese remain in Arnoun, which once had a population  
of about 2,000. Most residents fled after repeated artillery 
attacks by Israeli gunners aimed at avenging guerrilla assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel set up a self-styled ``security zone'' in southern  
Lebanon in 1985 to try to protect its northern settlements from 
cross-border attacks. The zone is patrolled by about 1,500 Israeli 
troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
	The students who marched on Arnoun today carried Lebanese flags  
and a few metal cutters. Ignoring signs saying the area was mined, 
they cut gates in the barbed-wire barrier around the village. Once 
inside, they celebrated with cheers and folk dances. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli troops cordoned off the village on Feb. 17, essentially  
annexing it to the Jewish state's security zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel said the action was needed to protect Arnoun's residents  
from harassment by Lebanese guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lebanese officials noted that Israel had complained that  
guerrillas were using the village as a launching pad for attacks on 
its outpost at the nearby Crusader-built Beaufort Castle. 
</P>
<P>
	President Emile Lahoud, whose government is preparing a  
complaint to the U.N. Security Council over the seizure, praised 
the students' action, presidential palace officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time since 1985 that the Israelis expanded the  
zone by setting a fence and ordering residents to go through a 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Lebanese guerrillas have been fighting to end the occupation.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot: I Was Looking at Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Apart from a navigational miscue,  
Capt. Richard Ashby said his training mission through the Italian 
Alps last winter felt normal, even comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	He crested a ridge in the Marine jet and glanced at a map  
strapped to the knee of his navigator to make sure he was in the 
right valley. Then he looked up and saw a gondola cable looming in 
his windscreen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were dead,'' Ashby said. ``I thought this wire  
was going to go through the canopy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public comment, Ashby testified Friday about last  
February's accident at the Mount Cermis ski resort that sent 20 
people in the gondola plunging to their deaths and caused an uproar 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler that clipped the cable, is  
being court-martialed on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and 
other charges and faces more than 200 years in prison. The trial is 
in recess until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argue he was given a map without the cableway  
marked on it, that he may have suffered an optical illusion and 
that his jet's radar altimeter malfunctioned. Prosecutors contend 
he simply flew too fast -- more than 600 mph -- and much too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., held a model of the jet as  
he explained to the military jury how he lowered his plane into the 
valley where the ski lift was situated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel high and I didn't feel low,'' he said. ``I felt  
comfortable. It felt right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after spotting the gondola, Ashby said he instinctively  
ducked and pushed his stick forward, causing the plane to descend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched this wire go over the canopy and nothing happened,  
and I started to recover. Then at some point between nothing and 
recovering, there's a thump like that,'' he said, knocking the 
witness box rail. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's right wing had two gashes in it and its tail fin was  
damaged by the wire. Ashby brought the jet back to the NATO air 
base at Aviano, where he and his three crewmates were stationed for 
possible duty in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said that at the outset of the flight, he set the radar  
low-altitude alarm to go off at 800 feet -- 200 feet below the 
minimum prescribed altitude and about 430 feet higher than where 
the plane struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want the thing going off continuously,'' he  
testified. ``You want that tone to mean something to you. It means, 
`I've got to do something with the aircraft now or I'm going to 
die.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he was trying to maintain a 1,000-foot altitude  
during the flight. He was not asked whether the alarm went off 
before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Other witnesses, including the backseat crewmen, have testified  
that the alarm did not sound as it should have after the jet 
descended into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Ashby testified, a Marine Corps electronics expert said  
the jet's radar altimeter may have misread altitudes because it had 
a broken wire that created interference with the radar signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby also said he knew of no speed limit for the mission,  
despite prosecutors' claims that it was 517 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The navigator on the flight, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31,  
attempted to videotape the early part of the mission through the 
Dolomite Mountains, but had trouble operating the camera and put it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he pocketed the tape after they landed. Later,  
Schweitzer asked for it, and Ashby told jurors that never saw it 
again. Both men are charged with obstruction of justice because 
investigators never found the tape; Schweitzer also faces the 
involuntary manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans were outraged over the accident, and Italians demanded  
that U.S. landing rights be revoked at bases in their country. The 
officers' lawyers have argued the aviators were charged because of 
political pressure that went as high as the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said during cross-examination by the government that he  
realized his actions caused the deaths of 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept responsibility, but there's a difference between  
responsibility and criminal responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't imagine going to jail, can you?'' asked the  
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I can't,'' Ashby replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby denied being negligent during the flight.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mistakes were made on this flight -- and any flight, any  
mission you fly, mistakes are made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said under questioning from his lawyers that he was  
initially trained to fly at 500 feet. Once, while serving in Italy 
in 1996, he was flying at that altitude in the mountains when he 
encountered a paraglider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared the hell out of me,'' Ashby said. ``I could see the  
whites of his eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly against the yen Friday,  
turning downward after an early rally that had been lit by a U.S. 
Treasury official's criticism of the Japanese government's economic 
recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar narrowly rose against the euro during a day when the  
yen was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quiet on all other fronts. The story is the  
dollar/yen (transactions) getting whipped around,'' said Jay 
Bryson, an international economist at First Union Capital Markets 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.17  
Japanese yen, down from 119.63 on Thursday. Also in late trading, 
the euro was quoted at $1.1026, down from $1.1032. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders dumped yen and bought dollars, sending the dollar up  
about 2 yen, during the Asian trading session. That followed 
reports concerning Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' tone 
during meetings with Japanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukihiko Ikeda, a top official in the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party, told reporters that Summers had urged Japan to take greater 
action in fighting its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikeda said Summers told him that ``the Bank of Japan's monetary  
steps so far may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. has been pressuring the Bank of Japan to expand money  
supply. That would push down the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders rode the dollar higher on expectations the Bank of Japan  
would take immediate action in response. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thought this is the pressure that is going to do  
it,'' Bryson said. But after a while, investors put the dollar into 
a tailspin, sending the U.S. currency and the euro falling by 2 1/2 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a rethink on how quick the bank is going to  
start'' its work, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro ``tried to stage a bounce off the bottom and  
didn't get anywhere,'' said Kathy Jones, a currency analyst at 
Prudential Securities. Investors are expecting that higher interest 
rates in the United States will weaken the euro in comparison to 
the dollar, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4469 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4485, and 1.5101 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4979. The British 
pound fell to $1.6026, down from $1.6033. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7737 German 
marks, up from 1.7727; 5.9488 French francs, up from 5.9453; and 
Italian lire, 1,757.47, up from 1,754.39.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Local Returned to Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Teamsters Local 560 was a national symbol of  
Mafia corruption for decades, even before its longtime boss was 
linked to the disappearance of international Teamsters leader Jimmy 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government took control of Local 560 nearly 13 years  
ago, but on Thursday, its members -- truck drivers, warehouse 
workers and factory employees -- got their union back. 
</P>
<P>
	In removing his court-ordered trustee, U.S. District Judge  
Harold Ackerman accepted assertions from the trustee and law 
enforcement officials that the northern New Jersey union was 
finally free of a Mafia ``cancer'' that drained its pension and 
murdered dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed it would be such a long time,'' said Ackerman,  
who got the case when the U.S. Justice Department sued the union in 
1982. In 1986, he imposed the order, the first federal takeover of 
a union. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 560, based in Union City, has about 4,400 members.  
</P>
<P>
	In the union's first election in a decade, members in December  
chose former truck driver Pete Brown as president, which trustee 
Edwin Stier cited as evidence of ``fundamental change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brown ticket got 55 percent of the vote, soundly defeating  
two other tickets, including one led by the nephew of Michael 
Sciarra, elected president in 1988 but expelled for associating 
with the Genovese crime family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the power of organized crime to control Local  
560 has been broken,'' Stier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, Ackerman retained jurisdiction over the union for  
four years, past its next election, in 2001, and enjoined its 
leaders from any actions or associations that could harm the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the spectators in the courtroom were a dozen rank-and-file  
Teamsters, including trucker William Scheeler of Livingston, 
wearing the union's familiar black satin jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	A Teamster for 35 years, including the last 17 at Local 560,  
Scheeler said he was not surprised the government needed so long to 
cleanse the union, recalling how members were intimidated from 
speaking out and lulled by good wages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made decent money,'' said Scheeler, 61, who put his two  
children through college. ``But now it comes time to retire, and 
(all) the pension money isn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mob's tainted investments and dishonest loans cost members  
hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits, Stier estimated. He 
said the takeover exposed that one pension fund was heading for 
bankruptcy, and eventually members realized the price of mob 
exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pension funds are now fully funded, at about $550 million  
compared with $100 million in the 1980s. But pensions are not as 
high as they could have been, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 1950s, Local 560 became a ``cash cow'' for mobsters  
under the thumb of the late Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, a 
convicted captain in the Genovese crime family, said Robert 
Stewart, a retired federal prosecutor who was among the original 
investigators of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted for Ackerman how Mafia chiefs of several families  
turned to Provenzano to arrange the elimination of Hoffa, who had 
been making anti-mob speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa disappeared from Detroit in 1975. He is presumed dead. No  
one was ever charged. 
</P>
<P>
	His son was recently elected president of the international  
union in December, and Ackerman said it was ``ironic'' that the 
younger Hoffa would soon be swearing in Brown as Local 560 
president.

<HEADLINE> `Smiling Assassin' Brought Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Golf's ``Smiling Assassin'' finally got  
in someone else's crosshairs. 
</P>
<P>
	But what a ride it was for Japan's Shigeki Maruyama, whose 8-0  
run in match play dating to the Presidents Cup in December ended in 
the quarterfinals of the Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even Andrew Magee's 1-up victory Friday afternoon at La  
Costa Resort could wipe the big smile off Maruyama's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very good experience for me,'' Maruyama said. ``I  
lost, but I learned a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama was one of the least-known players on the International  
team in December's Presidents Cup, but he stole the show and earned 
his nickname by being the only player to win all five of his 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he came to La Costa and won his first three matches.  
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to make one thing clear about his nickname.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not like, you know, a bad guy,'' he said through an  
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	He proved that by the way he played and by his cool demeanor in  
a tournament in which some pretty big names -- Fred Couples and Phil 
Mickelson to name two -- admitted to feeling the pressure of match 
play. They folded one round before Maruyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama smiled after good shots and after bad ones, whether  
they went into the water, a trap or, like in Friday morning's third 
round against Loren Roberts, under a portable restroom on No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem. He took a drop, and went on to save par, winning the  
match 2 and 1 when Roberts missed a short putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pressure, but it's a reverse way of thinking,  
excitement, to me,'' Maruyama said. ``That's what I need, very much 
all the time. Actually the profession needs that excitement, 
otherwise I cannot play good golf in front of the audience. 
Excitement is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was exciting when he won the 16th hole to even the match with  
Magee. But the kind of excitement Maruyama didn't need came one 
hole later, when he hit an iron shot into the water en route to a 
bogey while Magee won the hole with a par to go 1-up. Magee won the 
match when they halved the 18th. It was the first time this 
tournament that Maruyama played the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama took off his hat, bowed to Magee, shook his hand and  
bowed again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great guy,'' said Magee, who has played in Japan  
before. ``I like him. He's a nice dude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maruyama said he'd have to win big-time in the United States for  
his countrymen to really take notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows my name since the Presidents Cup, but if I go  
to McDonald's, nobody recognizes me, so that's very good,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Rules on Internet Dial-Up Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Telephone calls by a computer user to connect  
to the Internet no longer are considered local after federal 
regulators classified the dial-ups as interstate communications, 
subject to federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission insists Thursday's action  
merely resolves a dispute among phone companies over how to 
compensate each other for Internet connections and to clarify the 
role of state and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the decision will not affect how consumers tap into the  
Internet or how much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups and FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth,  
who protested by not participating in the vote, believe the action 
could inadvertently open the door to higher future charges for 
Internet access by computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's Washington  
office, said the decision eventually could lead to people paying 
per-minute rates for using the Internet, just as they now do with 
long-distance phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FCC said its decision preserves an existing provision  
that exempts Internet service providers, such as America Online, 
from paying per-minute ``access'' charges to local telephone 
companies. Long-distance companies now pay these fees, which they 
pass on to their customers. They account for about 30 cents of 
every $1 of a long-distance bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are used to dialing a local phone number to get  
access to the Internet, and they are used to paying that access as 
a local call,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``Nothing that we 
are doing in this item will change that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Vradenburg, a senior vice president at AOL, agreed that  
the decision will have ``no effect on Internet charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the critics worry that local Bell telephone companies and  
GTE might use the decision as legal basis to getting a court to 
overturn the provision that exempts Internet service providers from 
paying access fees to local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials believed nothing in the decision would help the  
Bells make such a legal case. AOL's Vradenburg said he's not 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	Also as part of the decision, the FCC agreed to phase out, after  
current contracts expire, hefty fees the Bells and GTE pay smaller 
local phone companies to route customers' calls to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC proposed letting states and companies decide how  
carriers compensate each other in the future. The Bells and GTE 
praised the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC agreed to release an audit of the five Bell  
telephone companies showing that $5 billion in equipment can't be 
accounted for. However, the full results won't be released for at 
least 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bells contend the audit, which was conducted in 1997, is  
flawed and overestimates missing equipment. FCC officials dispute 
this. 
</P>
<P>
	Audit results, the Bells say, won't effect rates directly, but  
they may have an indirect effect: consumer groups and AT&AMP;T are 
already using the audit to press for lower local and long-distance 
rates. House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., said 
``consumers may be paying more on their phone bills'' than they 
should. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC intends to seek public comments on the audit, its  
ramifications and what action, if any, the commission should take. 
FCC staff recommended, however, that the Bells be required to take 
write-offs and making accounting corrections.

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Thierry, Make Him LB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Browns are convinced John Thierry has spent  
his entire NFL career playing the wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry, a converted defensive end for the Chicago Bears the  
past five years, was signed Friday by Cleveland, which plans to use 
the 27-year-old free agent at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thierry has the opportunity to become an important piece of  
our defensive unit with his movement to the linebacker spot,'' said 
Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry was capable of wreaking havoc on college quarterbacks at  
Alcorn State. Using his 4.5 speed in the 40 to rush quarterbacks 
from his outside linebacker/standup end position, Thierry earned 
All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
	But after being drafted by the Bears with the No. 11 pick in the  
first round in 1994, Thierry bulked up from 248 pounds to 265 and 
was moved to right defensive end. He struggled against 300-pound 
offensive tackles and recorded just 12 1/2 sacks in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his coaches in Chicago, including Bob Slowik, the Browns  
defensive coordinator, thought Thierry was out of position but 
couldn't convince head coach Dave Wannstedt to make a switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that I did hear the past five years,'' said  
Thierry's agent, Richard DeLuca. ``He was a coverage guy in 
college. He should have been playing linebacker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns signed Thierry to a one-year contract for $1 million  
with ``a nice incentive package,'' said DeLuca. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLuca said Thierry made only one demand before he began  
negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get him a 50-something on his back,'' said DeLuca,  
referring to the numbers given to linebackers. ``And that's what I 
did. He'll wear 53 for the Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry will be reunited with two former Chicago coaches who are  
now with the Browns, Slowik and defensive line coach Clarence 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry's signing was the only official announcement this week  
by the Browns, who earlier this week landed quarterback Ty Detmer 
in a trade with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, who was hunting cougar in Utah with friends when the  
deal was finalized, is expected to sign the waiver to his no-trade 
clause when he visits Cleveland on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Group Files Complaint Against Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Internet civil liberties group asked the  
Federal Trade Commission on Friday to prohibit Intel Corp. from 
selling its latest Pentium computer processors because of privacy 
concerns over new technology in the chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology said  
Intel used ``unfair and deceptive trade practices'' in describing 
the new chip's technology as a security feature but never 
mentioning its privacy ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
	An FTC spokeswoman, Vicki Streitfeld, said the agency will  
``seriously review'' the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel designed its new Pentium III chips to transmit a unique  
serial number internally -- and to Web sites that request it -- to 
help verify the identity of consumers. It argues that the feature 
will help eliminate online fraud and control access to sensitive 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Some privacy groups, however, contend that the so-called  
tracking technology will give companies unprecedented ability to 
trace consumers' moves as they navigate the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The democracy and technology center's formal complaint Friday  
asked the FTC to enjoin Intel from selling its Pentium III chips 
with the tracking technology. It also asked the FTC to prohibit 
computer makers from selling machines with the chips unless the 
technology is turned off ``in a secure manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint didn't specify what computer makers could do to  
satisfy its concerns. A few companies have already indicated they 
plan to disable the technology in each computer's system settings, 
called its Bios. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturers are in this difficult situation, where Intel  
has thrown this issue in their lap,'' said Ari Schwartz, a policy 
analyst for the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said the complaint appears similar  
to previous appeals to the FTC from other privacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly don't think we've done anything deceptive or  
unfair,'' Waldrop said. ``We really don't see anything new. We have 
talked in the past with (privacy groups) and we realize we have a 
difference of opinion.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Organizing Gives Unions Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The biggest union organizing victory in more  
than half a century -- 74,000 Los Angeles County home care workers -- 
could be the start of a national resurgence by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizing drive by the Service Employees International  
Union highlights the shift in labor's focus away from high-paid 
manufacturing jobs like autoworkers and toward the low-paying 
service sector, especially health care where just 1 million of 12 
million workers nationally are union members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awfully important victory for the symbolism it  
represents. This vote shows labor has huge success in the service 
sector and with women and minorities,'' said Harley Shaiken, a 
University of California, Berkeley, professor specializing in labor 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a world that is an information and service  
economy,'' said Andrew L. Stern, national president of the 1.3 
million-member SEIU. ``Our goal is to make sure workers in the 
service economy have a choice, not only about the quality of their 
own jobs, but the quality of service,'' said Stern whose union is 
the third-largest and fastest growing affiliate of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County's home care providers -- many earning $5.75 an  
hour to feed and bathe 80,000 elderly and disabled -- voted 16,200 
to 1,925 to unionize, according to the final tally Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was labor's biggest organizing victory since 1937 when  
112,000 General Motors employees joined the United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the history books will show that their triumph  
today will play as important a role in American history as the mass 
organizing drives in the 1930s,'' said John Sweeney, president of 
the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO is the umbrella organization for 72 unions  
representing about 13 million workers, including the SEIU. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaiken, Berkeley's labor specialist, said the impact of the  
California vote extends beyond homecare workers to organizing ``the 
new face of labor'' such as fast-food employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future of labor is inextricably tied up with organizing  
women and minority workers. Both are vital to labor's survival and 
growth. This is a campaign that represents a new vitality for 
labor,'' Shaiken said. 
</P>
<P>
	Janitors, hotel workers and now unionized health care workers.  
Who's next for the union? 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing the day where unions refocus themselves in a way  
to be attractive to those in historically high-turnover and 
low-wage jobs,'' Stern said. ``In Seattle, we have a major, 
groundbreaking campaign among daycare workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside of the movement is the increased cost, said Rick  
Gundling, technical director of the Westchester, Ill.-based 
nonprofit Healthcare Financial Management Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The homecare industry has been under pressure to cut expenses  
and unionizing might threaten its survival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that adds to a more costly system is not to the best  
advantage for health plans and the desire to keep health care costs 
down,'' said Gundling, whose 35,000-member group includes financial 
management professionals employed by managed-care groups, 
hospitals, nursing homes and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Union advocates expect organizing the health field to remain a  
tough battle. The Los Angeles County home care worker campaign 
lasted 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers don't want advocates for patients at the bedside.  
They will continue to resist giving health care workers a voice. 
But workers know it's time to be heard in this new health care 
industry,'' Stern said.

<HEADLINE> Report on Guatemala War Blames U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A truth commission set up to seek  
reconciliation after Guatemala's 36-year civil war has blamed the 
U.S.-backed army for most of the 200,000 deaths and disappearances 
that occurred during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, created under 1996 peace accords, criticized  
U.S. aid to the army and called on both the government and former 
leftist rebels to ask the public for forgiveness for the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released Thursday, found the army responsible for 93  
percent of the deaths. The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
was blamed for 3 percent, while 4 percent remain unsolved. The 
commission looked into about 42,000 deaths from the war. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150,000 people were killed in the decades of fighting, and  
50,000 disappeared -- many of whom are presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Commission for Historical Clarification was  
Guatemala's first major step in healing the division in a country 
split since a U.S.-backed coup toppled the Marxist government of 
President Jacobo Arbenz and put rightists in power in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted that ``the government of the United  
States, through various agencies including the CIA, provided direct 
and indirect support for some state operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That support helped Guatemalan military and paramilitary units  
take part in executions as well as kidnapping and torture, The New 
York Times quoted a staff member of the commission as saying in 
today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also found evidence that the United States had  
knowledge of the genocide, the aide told the Times on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	By lending support to ``some illegal operations,'' the CIA and  
other U.S. agencies encouraged the government to commit genocide 
against the Indian population, The Miami Herald quoted commission 
member Christian Tomuschat as saying in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, American Ambassador Donald Planty downplayed the U.S.  
role, saying the abuses were ``committed by Guatemalans against 
other Guatemalans ... (as a) result of an internal conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the commission's work was financed with a $1.5 million  
donation from the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Some accused the Guatemalans of trying to absolve themselves of  
guilt by saying the government was doing the United States' bidding 
in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blaming the U.S. is a national pastime here,'' The Herald  
quoted David Holiday, an American political consultant based in 
Guatemala, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has no power to bring those responsible for the  
killings to trial or impose sanctions. But the report recommended 
the government begin a formal investigation into the army's actions 
and remove military officers found to have participated in the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, protesters outside Guatemala City's National  
Theater jeered army officers who arrived to hear the presentation 
of the report with chants of ``Killers, killers! We want justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Gen. Hector Barrios Celada refused to comment  
on the commission's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Former guerrilla leader Jose Ismael Soto said the rebels wished  
to reiterate that ``we are ready to take responsibility for our 
actions in the armed conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Roman Catholic Church report released in April 1998 blamed the  
army for 80 percent of the killings. The bishop who headed the 
church investigation was bludgeoned to death at his home in 
Guatemala City two days after its release. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth commission's report, based on testimony from 9,200  
people from all sides in the conflict, found that most of the war's 
victims were civilians and Mayan Indians, whom the army considered 
``natural allies'' of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They completely exterminated Mayan communities, destroyed  
their dwellings, livestock and crops,'' the report said. It 
recorded 626 massacres, of which 32 were the fault of the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomuschat, a German citizen who heads the three-member  
commission, said it was ``clearly genocide and a planned strategy 
against the civilian population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rigoberta Menchu, the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said she  
was satisfied with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, she would not forgive those responsible for the  
killings until the army concedes that such massacres were part of a 
planned strategy of intimidation. Army officials have said the 
massacres were excesses on the part of individual officers.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly against the yen Friday,  
turning downward after an early rally that had been lit by a U.S. 
Treasury official's criticism of the Japanese government's economic 
recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar narrowly rose against the euro during a day when the  
yen was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been quiet on all other fronts. The story is the  
dollar/yen (transactions) getting whipped around,'' said Jay 
Bryson, an international economist at First Union Capital Markets 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.17  
Japanese yen, down from 119.63 on Thursday. Also in late trading, 
the euro was quoted at $1.1026, down from $1.1032. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders dumped yen and bought dollars, sending the dollar up  
about 2 yen, during the Asian trading session. That followed 
reports concerning Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' tone 
during meetings with Japanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukihiko Ikeda, a top official in the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party, told reporters that Summers had urged Japan to take greater 
action in fighting its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Ikeda said Summers told him that ``the Bank of Japan's monetary  
steps so far may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. has been pressuring the Bank of Japan to expand money  
supply. That would push down the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders rode the dollar higher on expectations the Bank of Japan  
would take immediate action in response. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thought this is the pressure that is going to do  
it,'' Bryson said. But after a while, investors put the dollar into 
a tailspin, sending the U.S. currency and the euro falling by 2 1/2 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a rethink on how quick the bank is going to  
start'' its work, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro ``tried to stage a bounce off the bottom and  
didn't get anywhere,'' said Kathy Jones, a currency analyst at 
Prudential Securities. Investors are expecting that higher interest 
rates in the United States will weaken the euro in comparison to 
the dollar, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4469 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4485, and 1.5101 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4979. The British 
pound fell to $1.6026, down from $1.6033. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7737 German 
marks, up from 1.7727; 5.9488 French francs, up from 5.9453; and 
Italian lire, 1,757.47, up from 1,754.39.

	GDP Grows at 6.1 Pct. Annual Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the global financial crisis, the U.S.  
economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly 15 years in the last 
quarter, closing out a year in which Americans enjoyed the best 
combination of rapid growth, low unemployment and low inflation in 
at least three decades. The nation's gross domestic product, the 
total output of goods and services, shot up at a sizzling annual 
rate of 6.1 percent from October through December, the Commerce 
Department said today.

	Stocks End Down; Dow Off 59.76  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes fell today, led by a selloff in  
technology shares, after Compaq Computer's warning of soft sales 
raised concerns of slowdown in the computer market. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 59.76 at 9,306.58, expanding 
yesterday's 33.33-point decline. Most broader stock indicators were 
lower as well. The Nasdaq composite index with its many tech stocks 
was down 38.81 at 2,288.01. Compaq, the world's biggest maker of 
personal computers, warned analysts that sales in its small- and 
medium- business market have slowed this quarter. That prompted 
Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston to cut its 
first-quarter earnings projection for Compaq, whose shares fell 5 
11/16 to 35 5/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Other 
computer-makers, including IBM, Gateway and Dell, also fell sharply 
today on concerns that their sales may also slow in coming months.

	Feds Still Working On Y2K Bug  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite progress with the year 2000 computer  
problem, serious concerns remain about the ability of the agency 
that handles billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid payments 
to be problem-free by Jan. 1, a government auditor said today. The 
Health Care Financing Administration still must perform a 
tremendous amount of testing on its computer systems before the end 
of the year, Joel Willemssen, director of civil agencies 
information systems at the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, told a House panel. But Nancy-Ann 
DeParle, the agency's administrator, said that while there was 
still a lot of work to be done, its systems would be repaired in 
time.

bid to acquire AMP Inc., will get to vote on Tyco International 
Ltd.'s $11.3 billion agreement to buy the maker of electrical 
components, a federal appeals court has ruled. AlliedSignal already 
owns 200 million shares, or 9.1 percent, of AMP, that it purchased 
before making a $10 billion bid for Harrisburg, Pa.-based company. 
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that 
AlliedSignal could not vote as a shareholder because of a 1990

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Shareholders of Kerr-McGee Corp. and Oryx  
Energy Co. approved the merger of the two energy companies, a deal 
that will mean the loss of about 500 jobs. About 40 percent of the 
combined oil and gas workforce will be reduced as a result of the 
merger, which will create the country's fourth-largest independent 
energy exploration and production company. Debbie Schramm, 
spokeswoman for Kerr-McGee, said the two companies had about 1,300 
employees in oil and gas in November. The count will be reduced to

Evista is not approved as a breast cancer drug in the United 
States, though early tests look promising. Zeneca makes Nolvadex, 
which in October became the first drug approved by the Food and

cookie dough ice cream that failed to list eggs on the ingredient 
labels. Dean officials said today the recall would amount to less 
than 10,000 gallons of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream sold 
under the Dean and Reiter brand and produced at the company's plant 
in Belvidere, Ill. The egg ingredient in the cookie dough pieces 
could cause a life threatening reaction in people allergic or

infamous prison where American POWs were kept during the Vietnam 
War. The Hilton Hotel Opera is just a few blocks from the old 
prison, which was mostly destroyed in 1995, leaving only a wing for 
a museum. The $64 million hotel sits adjacent to Hanoi's newly 
renovated Opera House. The opening comes at a time of economic 
crisis for Asia and drooping tourism. High-end hotel occupancy

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Gretzky Out Up to a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky, who has complained of neck pain  
for most of the season and recently of numbness and weakness in an 
arm, will be sidelined for two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gretzky is suffering from a disc protrusion in his cervical  
spine,'' New York Rangers general manager Neil Smith said before 
Friday night's game against Phoenix. ``It is not a serious disc 
problem. Surgery is not even an issue at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's career scoring leader, who had played in 223  
consecutive games, was told Friday by Dr. Patrick O'Leary to rest 
for 10 days and take anti-inflammatory medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'll be up and skating in a few weeks,'' Gretzky  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said the injury was probably an accumulation of all the  
hits he had taken during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I've had two back injuries (in the last seven years) and I  
have proof that I have been hit over the years,'' said Gretzky, 
disputing the myth that he is never hit hard on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky had a serious back injury that kept him out during most  
of the 1992-93 season. He had not missed a game since signing with 
the Rangers as a free agent in the summer of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He first complained about neck pains last month after a game in  
Washington and was later knocked to the ice against Carolina and 
complained about his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had a stiff neck,'' Gretzky said, ``and we just  
treated it with heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the condition worsened when the Rangers went on a  
two-game road trip to Edmonton and Calgary this week. Gretzky said 
he had to turn his body completely around to look to his right. He 
said there was also some numbness in one of his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury ``definitely peaked in Edmonton and Calgary, but I  
was not going to'' sit out, said Gretzky, who had spent the early 
part of his career with the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he missed practice, saying he was unable to grip  
his stick because of pain in his arms. He underwent an MRI on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third straight year, Gretzky led the Rangers in scoring.  
After 58 games this season, Gretzky had eight goals and 49 assists 
for 57 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he was sorry to see his consecutive-games streak  
end, but was more concerned with getting himself ready to play 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to follow what I've been told,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Unlikely To Rule on Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mark McGwire can probably take all the andro pills he wants this  
season because baseball is unlikely to ban the muscle-building 
supplement any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of a baseball-commissioned Harvard study on  
androstenedione, which are not expected until after opening day, 
will not be enough to warrant a ban, even if they show that andro 
raises testosterone levels, according to the No. 2 official of the 
players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, whose agreement is needed for any ban, want much  
stronger proof that andro enhances performance before they agree to 
a ban and random testing to enforce it, said Gene Orza, the union's 
associate general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a while,'' Orza said. ``No one should  
expect that somehow this study at Harvard is going to definitively 
resolve the question that has to be answered, which is: Does the 
use of a perfectly legal substance somehow give a player a 
competitive advantage? If it doesn't, we don't care what the 
Olympics thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety of andro, which is sold over-the-counter at nutrition  
stores and on the Internet, is not an issue baseball is even 
considering at the moment, despite numerous warnings from steroid 
experts about the hazards of testosterone-boosting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I assume the drug is safe,'' Orza said. ``The United States  
government chooses not to regulate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard study by endocrinologist Joel Finkelstein and fellow  
researcher Benjamin Leder is just phase one of baseball's inquiry 
into the effects of andro, Orza said. That study is designed to 
determine simply whether andro converts in the body to 
testosterone, as it is purported to do by manufacturers, and, if 
so, to what degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get that question answered,'' Orza said, ``the next  
question we will decide is: To what degree and what extent does 
androstenedione contribute to muscle mass in the body? 
</P>
<P>
	``The third question is going to be: Does muscle mass in the  
body necessarily constitute a performance-enhancing opportunity for 
players?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separate studies on andro's effect on muscle mass or performance  
enhancement could take months, if not years, and baseball has set 
no deadline on when a decision would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a timetable on it,'' Orza said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The players share our internal view, which is that nobody  
really knows anything about androstenedione, and until we do we're 
going to reserve judgment on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if andro is proven to boost testosterone and bulk up  
muscles, that would not necessarily mean players would agree that 
it enhances performance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four years ago, I used to have discussions with general  
managers about how weight training was bad for baseball players,'' 
Orza said. ``The best, most competitive baseball players were seen 
as those guys who stayed sinewy and lithe, and the ones with more 
mass were winding up on the disabled list. Now, all of a sudden 
because of the current fashion, no one talks about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's record 70 homers last season focused attention on his  
bulging muscles, which he said benefited from using andro for more 
than a year to enhance his weightlifting and his recovery between 
workouts. When he arrived at spring training for the St. Louis 
Cardinals this week, he said he's still using andro. 
</P>
<P>
	Classified as a dietary supplement, andro is permitted in  
baseball but is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL, and the 
men's and women's tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's revelation that he used andro sparked a tenfold  
increase in sales of the supplement last fall, much of it through 
the Internet, and led many steroid experts to warn of serious 
health consequences for teen-agers who take it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues, however, will not enter into the union's decision  
about whether to agree on a ban of andro, Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if andro is determined to give some players a competitive  
advantage over others, then the union would consider a ban and, for 
the first time, random testing. At the moment, baseball does not 
have a random drug testing program, as do the Olympics, the NFL, 
and the tennis tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we opposed random drug testing, we were opposing the  
clubs' request to test for substances that were illegal, and our 
objection to that was a philosophical one,'' Orza said. ``We don't 
believe that in America people are required to give evidence of 
wrongdoing to their employers. Testing for illegal drugs and 
testing for performance-enhancing drugs are quite different.''

<HEADLINE> It's a New Season for Braves' Weiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Walt Weiss would like nothing better than  
a nice, normal season. No surprises this time. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Weiss was forced into the leadoff role for the  
Atlanta Braves and wound up playing in his first All-Star game at 
age 34. But he also nursed his son through a potentially fatal 
illness and struggled to run on a sore leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a strange year,'' he said, relaxing at his locker prior  
to a spring training workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Brody Weiss, now 4, has recovered from an E. coli infection that  
shut down his kidneys last summer, though his weakened immune 
system still leaves him susceptible to illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a couple of weeks ago, his parents rushed the youngster to  
a hospital emergency room when he was stricken with the flu, 
suffering from many of the same symptoms that marked his previous 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try not to be too paranoid '' his father said. ``He's able  
to do all the things he could before, but there have been times 
when we got nervous. ... There's always a little reminder here and 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, meanwhile, spent the first part of the offseason resting  
his ailing left quadriceps muscle, then began a running program 
that he hopes will prevent the same thing from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't run all year,'' Weiss said. ``There was  
probably three weeks where I was running at full speed. It was so 
frustrating to hit balls in the hole to the shortstop -- the guy 
having to dive for them -- and you can't beat it out. It takes a lot 
of the fun out of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brody's illness gave his father a new perspective on life.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I look at things a lot differently,'' Weiss said.  
``When you're out there playing, it doesn't change anything. But 
after the fact, I'm able to turn the page a lot easier. When we got 
beat in the playoffs, it was disappointing. At the same time, it 
was time to get home and take care of my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through all the pain and family anguish, Weiss still managed to  
put together one of the best seasons of his 11-year career. With no 
one else to fill the leadoff role, he willingly moved to that spot 
in the order and batted .280 -- 20 points above his career average -- 
with a .386 on-base percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weiss doesn't have the speed that typifies most leadoff  
hitters -- even healthy -- so he likely will move to a lower spot in 
the order now that Otis Nixon is back with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss would prefer to bat second in the lineup, ahead of Chipper  
Jones, but doesn't mind going back to the eighth spot, where he has 
spent most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighth is the exact opposite of second. You don't get a lot of  
pitches, especially with a runner in scoring position,'' Weiss 
said. ``The thing I do like about the eighth spot is there is 
always something to think about every at-bat. You have to have a 
game plan, and it changes a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss' defense has always been a no-brainer. This season, he  
will team with second baseman Bret Boone, acquired in a trade from 
Cincinnati, to give the Braves one of the best double-play duos in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was over on that other field,'' said infield coach  
Glenn Hubbard, pointing to the minor-league complex where he worked 
last year, ``I would tell my guys to watch Walt Weiss. Just watch 
what he does out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The double-play combination no longer includes first baseman  
Andres Galarraga, who is out for the season after being diagnosed 
with cancer. Weiss, who has played with the Big Cat since 1994 -- 
first in Colorado, then in Atlanta -- was especially devastated by 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was driving around Denver the day before I came down here  
and I heard it on the radio,'' he said. ``Something like that makes 
you realize how fragile we all are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, sitting beside Galarraga's empty locker, plans to write  
his old friend a letter to express his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so easy to get consumed by this game,'' Weiss said.  
``We've all done it. We need little reminders that it shouldn't be 
that way.''

	McCain: Avoid Negative Campaigning  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Casting himself as the conscience of  
the GOP presidential field, Sen. John McCain on Friday promised 
``not to stoop to negative campaigning against fellow Republicans'' 
and challenged his rivals to take a similar pledge. ``Scorched 
earth Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore 
presidency,'' the Arizona senator warned in a speech to the 
California Republican Party. Four other GOP presidential prospects 
addressing the same group Saturday have been highly critical of 
front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush. They are former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, businessman Steve Forbes, activist Gary Bauer 
and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Outlines Foreign Policy  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a sweeping review of world problems,  
President Clinton warned Friday that NATO is ``prepared to act'' in 
Kosovo, pledged to redouble his efforts for peace in the Middle 
East and offered encouragement to Russia and China in their 
struggle for prosperous stability. Laying out his foreign policy 
hopes for the final two years of his presidency, Clinton said, 
``For our nation to be strong, we must maintain a consensus that 
seemingly distant problems can come home if they are not addressed 
and addressed promptly.'' 

</P>
<P>
	China Criticized on Human Rights  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's human rights record deteriorated  
sharply late last year with a crackdown on political dissent that 
reversed recent signs of improvement, the Clinton administration 
said Friday. The administration's critical assessment of China's 
human rights performance came on the eve of Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright's departure for Beijing.

	Serb Border Police Detain Monitors  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb border police detained  
diplomatic observers and forcibly searched their cars in an 
incident the chief monitor called ``ominous.'' Police told the 
monitors they were ``suspicious'' about the contents of the 
vehicles. William Walker, head of Kosovo monitors for the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said a 
cease-fire between Yugoslav and ethnic Albanian forces was 
``non-existent'' despite NATO warnings for both sides to abstain 
from violence during a 2 1/2-week suspension of peace talks.

	Iraq Contacts U.N. Weapons Panel  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq has contacted an expert panel that is  
exploring ways to restart U.N. weapons inspections, the panel's 
chairman said Friday. The Iraqi government invited the chairman, 
Brazilian U.N. Ambassador Celso Amorim, to visit Baghdad. The 
disarmament panel is holding its first meeting this week and will 
initially assess the state of the eight-year U.N. effort to rid 
Iraq of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range 
missiles.

	Group Files Complaint Against Intel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Internet civil liberties group asked the  
Federal Trade Commission on Friday to prohibit Intel Corp. from 
selling its latest Pentium computer processors because of privacy 
concerns over new technology in the chips. The Washington-based 
Center for Democracy and Technology said Intel used ``unfair and 
deceptive trade practices'' in describing the new chip's technology 
as a security feature but never mentioning its privacy 
ramifications. An FTC spokeswoman said the agency will ``seriously 
review'' the complaint.

	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Donyell Marshall scored 15 points,  
including a pair of free throws with 4.6 seconds remaining, as the 
Golden State Warriors beat the Phoenix Suns 94-90 Friday night. 
Golden State ended an eight-game losing streak to the Suns and won 
for the sixth time in seven games to reach .500 (6-6). It's the 
first time the Warriors have been a .500 team this deep into a 
season since they were 8-8 in December 1994.

<P>
	Lightning Stun Flyers 4-1  
</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Stephane Richer scored two first-period goals  
and goaltender Corey Schwab stopped 36 shots as the Tampa Bay 
Lightning surprised the Philadelphia Flyers 4-1 on Friday night. 
Richer, who ended a 17-game goal-scoring drought, gave the 
Lightning -- the NHL's worst team -- a quick 2-0 lead with goals at 
9:44 and 15:23 of the opening period. The Flyers, who sit atop the 
Atlantic Division, are 2-6-2 in their last 10 games after putting 
together a 16-1-6 run.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Seek Budget Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans remain undecided about which taxes  
to cut and how much money to spend next year, but their leaders 
agree they want Congress to produce a fiscal 2000 budget -- and 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed-door meeting Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told their 
budget committee chairmen to work together and produce a fiscal 
blueprint, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 
hope is to push it through Congress by April. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders pointedly told the two chairmen -- Sen. Pete  
Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio -- to avoid the 
disputes that blocked Congress last year from producing a spending 
blueprint for the first time since the current budget process began 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans haven't decided which taxes to cut, precisely how  
much money to set aside for Social Security and whether to honor 
spending caps set in the 1997 budget-balancing deal between 
Congress and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Hastert told reporters the meeting featured  
``positive first steps.'' The group plans to meet again next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich told reporters afterward there was a consensus to produce  
10-year tax cuts totaling $800 billion to $900 billion, far more 
than Clinton wants. Participants said the numbers mean any tax cut 
would be phased in gradually, rather than beginning next year in 
full force, but they have not yet agreed when the tax cuts would 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich also said there was general agreement to set aside about  
$1.5 trillion for Social Security, roughly what Clinton wants to 
use to buttress the program for the baby boomers' retirements 
beginning in a decade. But Domenici wants to set aside more than 
that, and that issue is unresolved, said one official. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are intent on producing a budget to show the  
public that the GOP has moved past Clinton's impeachment trial and 
to avoid giving Democrats fodder for their familiar accusation that 
the GOP is running a ``do-nothing Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget is also important because it will be a road map for  
several high-profile measures Republicans want to produce this 
year. These include tax cuts, spending increases for defense and 
education and possible overhauls of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending the session Thursday was House Majority Leader  
Dick Armey, R-Texas.

	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Arnold Palmer is cutting back his Senior PGA  
Tour schedule. 
</P>

	``I played last week, I'm playing this week ... and that could  
be it probably for a long time,'' Palmer said Thursday as he 
prepared for today's opening round in the ACE Group Classic. ``If 
my golf game continues to be as poor as it is, I won't play at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who will turn 70 in September, said he has fully  
recovered from prostate cancer and has no other serious ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm playing in Naples because my sister lives here and I'm  
doing a golf course here,'' he said. ``But I'm not happy with my 
game. My iron play is atrocious and it has not been good for a long 
time.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G Says Diaper Prevents Rash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble says it has developed the  
first diaper medically proven to prevent and treat rashes, and the 
company figures parents are willing to pay 50 percent more than 
they do for regular Pampers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pampers Rash Guard began arriving at some stores last week.  
They contain strips treated with petrolatum, found in petroleum 
jelly, and stearate, a skin conditioner. The diaper can still 
absorb waste because not all areas are treated with the 
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G hopes the diapers will be good not only for the bottom, but  
for the bottom line. A jumbo package of 36 Rash Guard diapers costs 
about $13.25, the same as the average price of a package of 56 
basic diapers. That works out to about 37 cents for each Rash Guard 
diaper compared with 24 cents for the standard product. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our consumer research has shown us not only that diaper rash  
is a painful and common ailment for children, but it causes a 
genuine misery for parents, who feel guilty over not being able to 
prevent their children's suffering,'' P&AMP;G spokesman Scott Stewart 
said Friday. ``This is a way to help both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dena Smith, the mother of a 6-month-old girl and an aide at Hope  
Early Childhood Center in Cincinnati, said she is interested, but 
might try to save money by limiting use of the new diapers to 
nights, when changes are less frequent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be willing to try anything I thought would help, but  
the added expense may keep some people from trying it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anita Sheth, who has three children, including an  
8-month-old, isn't ready to recommend Rash Guard, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a skeptic. My first impression is that I'm not sure I  
would be willing to pay the price for the product,'' said Dr. 
Sheth, director of pediatric dermatology at Children's Hospital in 
Cincinnati. ``The primary thing for prevention is really good 
hygiene and changing diapers frequently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diaper rash is caused partly by wetness, which causes irritation  
and abrasion of the baby's skin, leading sometimes to sores that 
require medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	About two out of three babies suffer a rash monthly and at least  
one-third of parents think their babies get the ailment frequently, 
according to Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies, the nation's most  
popular diapers, said it is considering its options and monitoring 
P&AMP;G's product. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing difficult about coating a diaper with  
petrolatum and stearate, but we welcome competitiveness,'' 
spokeswoman Wendy Strong said.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Town Reeling After Girl's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC, Mo. (AP) -- Police have two suspects in the death of a  
3-year-old girl left in a cold field while her mother was passed 
out drunk at home: an 8-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Ronald Reed would not provide any more details or  
say Friday whether the two children would face charges. There are 
no other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The story began in this small community a half-hour west of St.  
Louis on the afternoon of Feb. 19, when Butch Horner returned home 
from work. According to Reed, Horner found Billie Karns, 42, the 
mother of his daughter, passed out drunk on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	Their daughter, Ciara Horner, couldn't be found.  
</P>
<P>
	Horner flagged down officers and after an hour's search, Ciara  
was found naked and unconscious in a soggy field near a drainage 
ditch, about a quarter-mile from her home. Her clothes were found 
nearby. She died a short time later of hypothermia. The temperature 
was in the 40s that day. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted. Reed said  
interviews and other physical evidence led him to conclude that the 
two neighborhood children were responsible for Ciara's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody Hicks, whose husband runs a resale shop across the street  
from the trailer park where Ciara lived, smiled as she recalled the 
quiet little mop-haired blonde in Teletubbies sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shy little girl -- a little bitty thing. Cute as a bug,'' she  
said, her smile turning to a gentle sob. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner has moved out of the trailer and couldn't be reached  
Friday. But on Thursday, he said the children should not be blamed 
for Ciara's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who they are, and I don't want to know,'' he told  
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``I'm sure whatever happened was an 
accident. I'm sure those young kids couldn't have wanted to hurt 
Ciara.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karns was arrested on suspicion of child endangerment. She is  
being held in jail on $2,500 bond.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Executive Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A tobacco company executive was charged  
with helping smugglers scheme to sell nearly $700 million worth of 
cigarettes on the Canadian black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Thompson, a former R.J. Reynolds executive, was arrested  
this week in Detroit on money laundering charges. He is the first 
tobacco industry executive charged in the federal government's 
investigation into tobacco and alcohol smuggling through the St. 
Regis Mohawk Reservation in northern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers told U.S. customs agents that the Canadian  
cigarettes they were carrying were being brought to the United 
States, prior to being exported to Russia. Instead, they were 
shipped to the St. Regis reservation, and smuggled across the St. 
Lawrence River back into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers avoided paying excise taxes to the United States  
and then cheated the Canadian government out of millions of dollars 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory West said Friday that it  
appeared Thompson was preparing to flee the country when arrested. 
Thompson, 51, of Harper Woods, Mich., was ordered held without bail 
and will be returned to Syracuse for prosecution, West said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of money laundering, Thompson could face up to 20  
years in prison. The government also is seeking to seize $87 
million in illicit assets from Thompson, West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen people have already been convicted in the case and are  
awaiting sentencing. In December, Northern Brands International, an 
R.J. Reynolds subsidiary, admitted helping the smuggling ring and 
paid $15 million in fines and forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was an R.J. Reynolds marketing executive in 1992 when  
he allegedly met Larry V. Miller and Lewis and Robert Tavano of 
Niagara Falls, the men convicted of masterminding the smuggling 
operation. Thompson arranged to have the company's Canadian-brand 
cigarettes, Export A's, exported to the smugglers in the United 
States, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators first linked Thompson to Miller and the  
Tavanos through their meetings at Sonora Island Lodge in British 
Columbia in 1995. A witness, Michael Mangan, a truck driver for the 
smuggling ring, testified about the meetings to a federal grand 
jury in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sat around this big fireplace, and there was a big  
discussion about smuggling of the cigarettes, and Les Thompson was 
present at this meeting,'' Mangan testified in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for R.J. Reynolds International said the allegations  
against Thompson run ``completely contrary'' to corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious matter for the company and it's to the  
detriment of the company,'' spokesman Adam Bryan-Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was placed on administrative leave after the company  
began an internal investigation into the allegations of Northern 
Brands' complicity with smugglers, said C. Stephen Heard, the 
company 's lawyer.

<HEADLINE> New Papa Bonds Reports to Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Some say Barry Bonds was late. He says  
he's early. 
</P>
<P>
	The sometimes temperamental outfielder made his grand entrance  
at spring training, full of chatter about his new baby daughter and 
what he says is a misunderstood public persona. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds showed up to camp late Thursday, after the team's first  
full-squad workout. On Friday, the only major league player to hit 
400 homers and steal 400 bases was ready to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not late, I'm early,'' he said. ``Mandatory spring  
training is March 5th. We're all early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Barry, the mandatory reporting date is Tuesday, 33  
days before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' reason for missing Thursday's voluntary reporting date  
was he wanted to stay home to spend a little more time with his 
second wife, Liz, and their child, Aisha Lynn Bonds, born Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants were more than willing to cut their star some slack  
for his tardiness. Giants manager Dusty Baker was especially 
sympathetic because he is a new father, too. Darren John Baker was 
born Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds did show flashes of temper when he refused to talk to a  
reporter late Thursday, claiming he had been misquoted about his 
desire for a contract extension. But on Friday, he was mostly 
smiles: Talk about his new daughter seemed to soften him. 
</P>
<P>
	He joked about a suggestion that someday Aisha Bonds and Darren  
Baker might be an item. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't date younger men,'' the proud father quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	He was even talkative about his offseason press, although he  
clearly didn't agree with a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star, seven-time Gold Glove and  
three-time MVP, was quoted as saying he wanted the Giants to extend 
his contract. Two years ago, he signed a $22.9 million extension 
that pays him $9.7 million this year and $10.7 million in 2000, and 
gives the Giants a $10.3 million option for 2001 with a $2.5 
million buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question that was posed to me was `What would be your  
ideal situation?' '' he said. ``My ideal situation would be to 
retire at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to clarify that it was only natural to want the  
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I did want a long-term contract, So?'' he said. ``I  
don't see what's wrong with wanting to stay in my hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other talk swirled around Bonds, including reports that the  
Atlanta Braves had contacted the Giants about him after Andres 
Galarraga was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his lower back. 
Giants general manager Brian Sabean quickly shot down the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was the suggestion last summer that Bonds wouldn't  
mind a trade to a World Series contender. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Bonds expressed his loyalty to the Giants,  
reminiscing about the days he spent at the team's windy bayside 
ballpark trailing his father, Bobby Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unconcerned that some Giants fans do not view him with  
the same warm sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to me. As long as I can pay my bills and  
take care of my children,'' he said, ``I don't need to be an 
icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds appeared healthier and a bit bulkier than in previous  
years. He explained that following offseason surgery on his knee, 
he concentrated on his lower body strength, something he hadn't 
done before. The training, he said, eased pain in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants second baseman Jeff Kent said he recently was watching  
television and saw Bonds working out. He said Bonds looked great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I watched it from the couch,'' Kent laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Although dogged by questions that, at nearly 35, he might be  
nearing the end of his career, Bonds often made light of his age. 
He said it might finally work to his advantage, after years of 
trying to get pitches to hit from wary opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope people think I'm getting a little older, a little  
slower and they give me a few more chances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker thinks Bonds is still in his prime, not just because of  
his toned physique, but because of his mental attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he continues to love the game,'' Baker said. ``I  
believe as most guys get older, it's not the body, it's if you 
continue to love the game the same. I do believe he loves the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this point in his career, Bonds said his only real goal is  
winning the World Series. He's already reached individual 
milestones: Last season, he became the lone member of the 400-400 
club. He enters this season with 411 homers and 445 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds hit .303 last year with 37 homers and 122 RBIs. He didn't  
bristle at comments that he carries the Giants, something that has 
raised his ire before. He calmly explained that no one player can 
carry a team, and certainly not to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still expressed weariness with constantly having to  
explain himself. He was more comfortable talking about his three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spotlight is on me,'' he sighed, ``all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Witnesses Being Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Sealed court records in a criminal case  
involving presidential accuser Kathleen Willey contain evidence 
that some of prosecutor Kenneth Starr's witnesses ran into problems 
when they took lie detector tests, a defense lawyer said today in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Dubelier made the assertion twice during a court hearing in  
arguing unsuccessfully that Starr improperly assembled an 
obstruction indictment against Julie Hiatt Steele after she 
contradicted part of Mrs. Willey's allegations of an unwelcome 
sexual advance in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubelier did not say how many of Starr's witnesses in the Steele  
case, scheduled to be tried March 30, were affected by the 
polygraph issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a substantial polygraph issue with regard to their  
own witnesses,'' Dubelier said. At another point, he said that 
``results of polygraph examinations'' are ``an issue for some of 
their own witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is part of a sealed submission to the judge, Dubelier  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Polygraph test results are not ordinarily admissible in court,  
but Mrs. Steele's lawyers could argue that they are entitled to use 
results to call into question the credibility of a prosecution 
witness who testifies against Mrs. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	At Starr's request, some of the evidence that prosecutors are  
turning over to Mrs. Steele before her trial is being filed in 
secret with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the secrecy, Starr says, is that he is still  
investigating allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice in 
connection with the Willey matter. Clinton testified that Mrs. 
Willey's story was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton, Dubelier, a  
former prosecutor on Starr's staff who recently joined Mrs. 
Steele's legal team, denied that legal assistance to the Virginia 
woman is ``part of some vast White House conspiracy to interfere 
with'' Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubelier said Mrs. Steele's lawyers are serving her free of  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubelier, a prosecutor for 17 years, left the U.S. attorney's  
office in Washington to join a law firm. While working for Starr's 
office in 1996, he investigated White House use of FBI files. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele has undercut Mrs. Willey's account alleging that  
Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in 1993. Mrs. Steele said 
Mrs. Willey tried to get her to lie, asking her friend in 1997 to 
back up Mrs. Willey's story to a Newsweek reporter. Mrs. Steele 
said she had never heard of Mrs. Willey's accusation before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele said she was acting on Mrs. Willey's instructions in  
telling a Newsweek reporter that Mrs. Willey had confided the 
alleged Clinton advance immediately after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steele subsequently signed an affidavit saying that Mrs.  
Willey had asked her to lie to the Newsweek reporter. Mrs. Steele 
repeated the information from the affidavit in an FBI interview 
last March and in grand jury testimony.

	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka trailed by 334 runs in its  
first innings at lunch Friday, the third day of its match against 
India in the Asian Test Cricket Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Resuming with the overnight total of 121 for two, the hosts went  
for lunch on 184 for four. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahela Jayawardena, overnight 59, was batting on 89 with 16  
boundaries and one six. Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga was the other not 
out batsman on one. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Sri Lankan wicket to fall Friday morning was of  
Chandika Hathurusinge (14) when Venkatesh Prasad trapped him leg 
before wicket. 
</P>
<P>
	Next man, Aravinda de Silva, of whom much was expected, was  
bowled round his legs by off-spinner Harbhajan Singh for 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The current match is part of a three-nation championship. India  
lost to Pakistan in the opening test of the series. Sri Lanka and

<HEADLINE> Spy Sentenced to 24 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A former National Security Agency  
intelligence analyst was sentenced Friday to 24 years in prison for 
selling top-secret documents to the Soviet KGB for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sheldon Boone, 46, pleaded guilty in federal court in  
December to conspiracy to commit espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was arrested in a sting operation in which a former FBI  
agent posing as a KGB representative asked him to resume his 
spying, most of which was carried out while he was posted in 
Germany from 1988 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents included material on tactical nuclear weapons  
targeting the Soviet bloc and a 300- to 400-page handbook listing 
reconnaissance and intelligence-collection systems used by the U.S. 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone put American pilots' lives in danger by selling the  
documents, prosecutor Thomas Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret the actions I took. They were wrong. They  
overshadowed anything good I've done in my life before and after,'' 
Boone told Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. ``I'm glad it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boone was trained in cryptoanalysis and Russian and had been  
assigned to an Army field station in Augsburg, Germany. The former 
Army sergeant also worked at NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.

<HEADLINE> Marine Pilot: I Was Looking at Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot whose jet sliced  
through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps, killing 20 people, 
testified at his court-martial Friday that he was engrossed in a 
map strapped to his navigator's knee in the seconds before the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Capt. Richard Ashby had ever testified  
about the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler that clipped the cable on  
Feb. 3, 1998, grasped a model of the jet mounted on a stick as he 
explained to the military jury how he lowered his plane into the 
valley where the ski lift was situated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said that he wanted to make sure he was in the right  
valley because he had missed its entrance a short time earlier. 
When he looked up from the map, the yellow gondola car and the 
cable loomed before him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this wire was going to go through the canopy. I  
thought we're all dead,'' Ashby said. He said he instinctively 
ducked and pushed his stick forward, causing the plane to descend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched this wire go over the canopy and nothing happened,  
and I started to recover. Then at some point between nothing and 
recovering, there's a thump like that,'' he said, knocking the 
witness box rail. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable damaged a wing and electronics gear in the tail, but  
Ashby managed to fly the jet back to the NATO air base at Aviano, 
where he and his three crewmates were stationed for possible duty 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is being court-martialed on  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and other charges and could 
get more than 200 years in prison. The defense is expected to wrap 
up its case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby also said that at the outset of the flight, he set the  
radar low-altitude alarm to go off at 800 feet -- 200 feet below the 
minimum prescribed altitude and about 430 feet higher than where 
the plane struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want the thing going off continuously,'' he  
testified. ``You want that tone to mean something to you. It means, 
`I've got to do something with the aircraft now or I'm going to 
die.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was not asked whether the alarm went off before the  
accident. However, other witnesses, including the backseat crewmen, 
have testified that the alarm did not sound as it should have after 
the jet descended into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident caused an uproar in Europe and strained relations  
between Italy and the United States. People living in the Alpine 
ski area said they had long complained about jets from Aviano and 
their low-flying, ``Top Gun''-style antics. 
</P>
<P>
	Italians demanded that the crew be tried in that country and  
that U.S. landing rights at Italian bases be revoked. The officers' 
lawyers had argued that the aviators were charged because of 
political pressure that went as high as the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby was intentionally flying too low and too  
fast when his jet hit the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said his altimeter alarm malfunctioned; his  
government-issue map didn't show the ski lift; and he suffered from 
an optical illusion that made him think he was flying higher than 
he really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby appeared nervous when he first took the stand, and his  
voice cracked when he told how he learned that people in the 
gondola had died. But otherwise he was composed during his 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mistakes were made on this flight -- and any flight, any  
mission you fly, mistakes are made,'' he said. ``We never 
intentionally did anything outside the scope of this mission, which 
was to try to maintain 1,000 feet'' and use terrain features to 
practice avoiding enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in Ashby's testimony, relatives of the victims  
appeared upset as they emerged from the courtroom. One woman was 
crying; other relatives had their arms around one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified he was initially trained to fly at 500 feet.  
Once, while serving in Italy in 1996, he was flying at that 
altitude in the mountains when he encountered a paraglider. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared the hell out of me,'' Ashby said. ``I could see the  
whites of his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, will be tried next  
month on similar charges.

<HEADLINE> Ship Line Accused of Falsification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal grand jury has accused Royal  
Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of falsifying oil discharge records on a 
ship that stopped at California ports in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Records for the Nordic Prince were falsified to show that  
pollution prevention equipment was working properly during several 
excursions, according to the indictment returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The equipment, designed to separate oil from wastewater being  
dumped into the sea, was inoperative, the indictment charged. It 
does not accuse the cruise line of actually dumping oil. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean said the  
allegations appear to duplicate charges to which the company 
pleaded guilty last year in Miami and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, this has already been acknowledged  
and apologized for -- totally inexcusable -- and we've already paid a 
fine and implemented a compliance plan,'' spokeswoman Lynn 
Martenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Caribbean paid $9 million in fines, but the deal did not  
insulate the company from other charges. Prosecutors said Royal 
Caribbean had not cooperated fully, The New York Times reported 
today, and that indictments were also expected in Alaska and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The new indictment stems from Coast Guard inspections of Nordic  
Prince records between January and October of 1994, according to a 
statement issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Oil at 11-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures extended a week-long skid on the Chicago Board  
of Trade, this time undercut as soybean oil prices tumbled Friday 
to an 11-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar and orange juice futures also fell  
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean oil futures fell amid concern that China would join a  
list of countries canceling orders for the food ingredient while 
waiting for the market to settle. China is one of the largest 
customers for U.S. soybean oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of soybean oil and Malaysian palm oil have plunged after  
India and Pakistan recently canceled orders made when prices were 
20 percent higher. Analysts say importing countries, some of whom 
are strapped for cash, now appear content to wait for prices to 
bottom before stepping back into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	With soybean prices at their lowest point in more than two  
decades, traders are concerned there could be a surge in processing 
the crop, something that will increase soybean oil inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Brazil, the world's second-largest grower behind the  
United States, is set to harvest a near-record competing soybean 
crop. It also is in the midst of a currency crisis that is making 
Brazilian commodities cheaper on world markets, helping its sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for March delivery fell 4 3/4 cents to $4.49 3/4 a bushel;  
March soybean oil fell 0.37 cent to 17.62 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	March sugar futures tumbled nearly 8 percent in heavy selling on  
the Board of Trade of the City of New York as the monthly 
contract's last day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures have been on the defensive for months, pressured  
by bumper world supplies and fears Brazil, the world's largest 
grower, would export large amounts of its crop to help ease 
economic problems and bring in hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
	March sugar fell 0.53 cent to 6.34 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures retreated on the Board  
of Trade of the City of New York amid concern about weak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were concerned that with the peak winter consumption  
period winding down, there will be fewer takers of orange juice, in 
which there were record inventories last week, according to the 
USDA. While Florida, the nation's biggest grower, is expected to 
produce a smaller crop this year, ample supplies remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice inventories are expected to continue to grow even  
further. The U.S. Agriculture Department's recent monthly update on 
supply and demand said the Florida crop will be 2 percent, or 4 
million boxes, larger than an earlier estimate of 194 million 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	May orange juice fell 2.35 cents to 80.95 cents a pound.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is  
certifying that Mexico is a fully cooperating partner in the fight 
against drug trafficking. In a foreign policy address, he praised 
Mexican efforts to fight drugs. Clinton praised President Ernesto 
Zedillo of Mexico for ``working hard to tackle the corruption 
traffickers headlong.'' ``He cannot win this battle alone,'' 
Clinton said. ``And neither can we.''

``must embrace the inexorable logic of globalization.'' Speaking to 
business and policy leaders, he outlined his foreign policy for the 
final two years of his administration. Clinton faced criticism over 
the standoff with Iraq and peace talks on Kosovo. He defended China 
on the same day that the State Department reported a sharp erosion 
of human rights in that country.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts announced today  
he won't enter the 2000 presidential race. The three-term 
Democratic senator said: ``I have concluded that to raise the 
necessary amount of money with only 10 months to do so, compounded 
by the newly accelerated primary schedule, is simply impossible at 
this time.'' Kerry also said that pulling out of the race could 
help Vice President Al Gore win the Democratic nomination, which 
``may be more helpful to our party's efforts.''

20 people. At his court martial, Ashby said: ``We never 
intentionally did anything outside the scope of this mission, which 
was to try to maintain 1,000 feet'' and use terrain to practice 
avoiding enemy radar. But he admitted: ``Mistakes were made on this 
flight -- and any flight, any mission you fly, mistakes are made.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigars are as deadly as cigarettes yet face  
virtually no federal regulation, government health officials said

<HEADLINE> Expos Denied Extension on Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chances of the Montreal Expos eventually  
moving have increased, with commissioner Bud Selig denying a 
request to put off a March 6 deadline for having a new ownership 
group and stadium financing in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a lack of support from Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard,  
baseball's chief legal officer, Robert DuPuy, said the sport is 
committed to keeping the Expos in Montreal but that a solution was 
needed ``to plan with respect to the 2000 season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To date, there has been no commitment for government support  
to keep the Expos in Montreal,'' DuPuy wrote Thursday to Expos 
chairman Jacques Menard in a letter obtained by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the contrary, Premier Bouchard has reiterated publicly his  
strong opposition to public financing for a new stadium, and there 
was no mention of stadium financing in either the national or the 
provincial budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos say they can't survive in Olympic Stadium and need a  
new ballpark. But the team has struggled to raise the money, and 
Washington and Northern Virginia groups are interested in obtaining 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plans for the construction of the stadium remain  
indefinite, and there appears to be no workable solution to the 
coverage of the shortfall in the event that the seat license 
program is not as successful as you have projected,'' DuPuy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard, speaking Friday at a political meeting in  
Ville-d'Esterel, Quebec, called the decision ``particularly 
unpleasant'' and said the Expos should have been given another year 
to get their finances in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were ready to continue working,'' he said. ``I see  
people are throwing the ball at one another. They're playing ball, 
not baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball also is uncomfortable with the fighting in the Expos'  
ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Claude Brochu is considered by baseball in  
control of the team but after a stadium financing plan failed last 
year, he said he was willing to sell his 7.6 percent stake in the 
team. He has rejected an offer of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said Feb. 18 that new investors led by New York art  
dealer Jeffrey Loria are prepared to buy into the team, but said 
Brochu was an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeffrey Loria was not approved by is to come in and replace  
Claude,'' DuPuy wrote. ``We have received no written understanding 
from Mr. Loria regarding either his financing or his commitment to 
keeping the team in Montreal. To leave the impression that we 
support the ouster of Claude in favor of a new control person is 
most unfortunate. ... The disparaging remarks made with respect to 
Claude were absolutely counter to all of our discussions and 
violated the integrity of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said Friday that Expos investors were ``pleased with the  
interest major league baseball is taking in doing everything 
possible to keep the Expos in Montreal and in continuing to work 
closely with us over the coming weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard reiterated on Friday that his government can't spend  
money on a baseball team at a time when hospitals and schools face 
cutbacks. But Menard said that stance may change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has clearly expressed its willingness to  
eventually consider a new proposal,'' Menard said. ``We have agreed 
with the premier to meet with government representatives in the 
next few weeks, as soon as all aspects of the plan have been 
completed.''

<HEADLINE> AMD Chips Knock Intel From Top Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY RACHEL BECK   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tarnishing the launch of Intel's newest Pentium  
chips, a report Friday revealed that consumers bought more 
computers in January with semiconductors made by Advanced Micro 
Devices -- knocking Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Intel slid $8, or more than 6 percent, to $119 on Wall  
Street amid news that 43.9 percent of all desktop PCs sold in 
January were equipped with AMD-K6 processors, according to the 
research firm PC Data. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's chips powered 40.3 percent of the machines sold, while  
National Semiconductor's Cyrix chips came in third at 15.8 percent, 
the monthly report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major milestone for AMD,'' said Stephen Baker, the  
senior hardware analyst at PC Data, which bases its figures on unit 
sales, not dollar volume. ``This is the first time that a processor 
family, other than one manufactured by Intel, led the U.S. retail 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as Intel unveiled the Pentium III, a new line of  
microprocessors with graphic and video capabilities that are far 
faster and clearer than anything else available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But like its predecessors, the Pentium III is also far more  
pricey than most chips, and it was clear from Friday's report that 
Intel has been hurt by its limited exposure to the sub-$1,000 PC 
market -- which accounted for a record 65.6 percent January's retail 
sales, up from 51 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the average selling price of a PC fell to $953 in  
January, a 6 percent decline from December, said PC Data, which is 
based in Reston, Va. By contrast, computers powered with the 
Pentium III are selling for about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sub-$1,000 market, AMD-powered machines captured more  
than 50 percent of the sales -- doubling Intel's 25.4 percent share. 
Of those selling below $800, AMD chips were in 45.1 percent of the 
computers, while Intel chips were in 14.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, however, maintained its leadership in the above-$1,000  
market, with its chips powering more than two-thirds of the 
machines sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel is taking us to a new power level with its new line  
processors,'' namely the Pentium III, said Tim Bajarin, president 
of Creative Strategies Research International in San Jose, Calif. 
``But they aren't as aggressive in the low end of the market where 
they need to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having recognized the boom in the sub-$1,000 market, Intel is  
spending $300 million on marketing to entice consumers to buy 
pricier, Penium-powered computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Intel has lost market share at the retail level, it's  
important to note that its microprocessors still power more than 80 
percent of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Intel's profits remain quite healthy, although much of  
that strength actually comes from the company's most expensive 
chips -- like the Xeon -- which are used as the brainpower in desktop 
machines bought by businesses.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Sign Free Agent Harry Swayne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Offensive tackle Harry Swayne, who started for  
Denver in last two Super Bowls, was signed by the Baltimore Ravens 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens, who lost starting right tackle Orlando Brown to  
expansion Cleveland, also signed tight ends Frank Wainright of the 
Miami Dolphins and Greg DeLong of Minnesota, and re-signed wide 
receiver Floyd Turner, who had 32 receptions and five touchdowns 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne, 34, has appeared in three of the last four Super Bowls,  
twice on the winning side with the Broncos, and with San Diego in 
its loss in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most important signing we'll have this offseason  
in terms of what it represents to the stability of the offense,'' 
coach Brian Billick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne, 6-foot-5 and 293 pounds, plays both right and left  
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a player we targeted in free agency from the start, and  
we're pleased he's made the commitment to join us,'' said Ozzie 
Newsome, the Browns' personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
	Swayne, who played at Rutgers, was a seventh-round pick of Tampa  
Bay in 1987 as a defensive end. He was shifted to offense in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Brown, the Ravens have lost guard Wally Williams  
to New Orleans, tight end Eric Green and defensive lineman Mike 
Fredrick to the New York Jets and defensive end James Jones to 
Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Darryl Strawberry might not be ready to head north with the New  
York Yankees at the end of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	With four candidates to start in left field and Strawberry still  
recovering from colon cancer, New York manager Joe Torre said 
Thursday that Strawberry could stay in Florida after the team 
leaves to open the season in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not surprise me at all that by the time we're ready  
to leave, he would not be physically ready,'' Torre said in Tampa, 
Fla. ``I could be wrong, but again, if he needs another week or 
whatever it is, that's the most important thing, to make sure he 
gets ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, competing with Ricky Ledee, Shane Spencer and Chad  
Curtis in left field, underwent colon cancer surgery last October. 
He had a second procedure in January to remove scar tissue and will 
undergo chemotherapy once a week through at least April. 
</P>
<P>
	Also of concern is Strawberry's previously injured left knee,  
which has slowed him the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two recent surgeries prevented Strawberry from his offseason  
running program, affecting his overall conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be ready by opening day. We'll see how things work  
out,'' Strawberry said. ``If they work out fine, if they don't, 
fine. That's the way I look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who plans on beginning a light running program next  
week, will not play in the early exhibition games. Torre also 
indicated Strawberry might not make an outfield appearance until 
late in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned about his playing the outfield until he's  
ready to physically. It may turn out to the last two or three games 
of spring training, if then,'' Torre said. ``He feels better today 
than he has the last couple days in the fatigue area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling and Brian McRae each were slowed Thursday by  
bizarre injuries, but should have no problem being healthy by 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling got back spasms doing one of the favorite spring  
training pastimes -- doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stand around a lot,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona  
said at Clearwater, Fla. ``I even told them they'd be standing 
around a lot. You get stiff when you do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling does not expect to miss his regular turn to throw  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would kind of heat up and get loose, but it never  
did,'' he said. ``Maybe we should check my mattress. Maybe that's 
the culprit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae missed part of the Mets' first full workout because of an  
odd occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke a tooth when he was running,'' manager Bobby  
Valentine said at Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``It was cracked and 
sensitive, but it didn't go into the root.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood, meanwhile, went home early from  
the hospital after being slowed by an upper respiratory infection. 
He is scheduled to return to camp in Mesa, Ariz., today. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dr. John Marquardt said the NL Rookie of the Year  
will continue to take medication and will work on his conditioning 
slowly. The 21-year-old right-hander hasn't participated in spring 
training since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll probably be a week to 10 days before he is operating on  
all cylinders,'' Marquardt said. ``He's had an unlucky spring in 
that he's had three sort of distinct illnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood came down with a bronchial infection in January, and that  
was followed a week ago by a bout of viral gastroenteritis that 
forced him to enter the hospital because was dehydrated. He lost 12 
pounds as a result, but has since gained some back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last weekend, Wood began coughing, and the bronchial  
problems had returned, along with chills, fever and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	In other baseball news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- J.T. Snow plans to bat exclusively left-handed this season  
after struggling from the other side of the plate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow's move was prompted, in part, by concerns he could be  
benched against left-handed pitchers in favor of Charlie Hayes. 
Snow will face left-handers as a lefty, something he tried last 
September because of a shoulder injury. He went 1-for-4. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Padres closer Trevor Hoffman has set the end of spring  
training as a deadline for signing a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is 100 percent in their court,'' agent Rick Thurman  
said. ``He doesn't want to take it into the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers declined to comment on whether the  
club is preparing a new offer for Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 
saves last season and finished second in the Cy Young voting to Tom 
Glavine.

contract.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs Mexico Antidrug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today that he is  
certifying Mexico as a fully cooperating partner in the fight 
against drug trafficking. ``Mexico is cooperating with us in the 
battle for our lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement set up a potential battle with Republicans in  
Congress who cite Mexico's drop in narcotics seizures and 
disappointing record of extraditions in arguing for sanctions 
against America's southern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a foreign policy address to California business leaders,  
Clinton credited Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he was 
``working hard to tackle the corruption traffickers headlong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He cannot win this battle alone,'' Clinton said. ``And neither  
can we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two presidents met on the Yucatan peninsula just two weeks  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and top administration officials had leaned toward  
certifying Mexico as the annual, March 1 deadline mandated by 
Congress approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1986 law, the president must judge the performance of  
all foreign drug-producing and transiting countries. Countries not 
certified as fully cooperating -- and not given a national security 
waiver -- would be hit with economic penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I certify to Congress today, Mexico is cooperating with us  
in the battle for our lives. And I believe the American people will 
be safer in this -- and in so many other ways -- if we fight drugs 
with Mexico,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton's chief drug policy director, Barry  
McCaffrey, testified to Congress that refusing to certify Mexico 
would send an unwise and wrongheaded political message. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., expressed disappointment with the  
expected certification. ``Why is this administration rewarding 
Mexico with U.S. trade and foreign aid when they are dramatically 
increasing their heroin production and significantly lowering their 
seizures of illegal drugs?'' he asked in a written statement. He is 
chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's panel on 
criminal justice, drug policy and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have expressed doubt about Mexico's  
commitment to stop narcotics trafficking. But McCaffrey said 
Thursday the country is struggling to rid itself of drug-related 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to work in practical cooperation with men and  
women of good will who share our view that this drug threat is a 
terrible menace to their own political institutions and their own 
children,'' he told Mica's subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who contend Mexico has failed to meet its  
responsibilities may move to block its certification. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to ask the Senate, 'Is it time to say no,  
you do not get recertified?''' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said Thursday. ``They're not doing what they're supposed 
to be doing on the drug wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert criticized McCaffrey's  
goal of reducing U.S. illegal drug use and availability by 50 
percent by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Republicans, we have insisted that the nation's drug czar  
meet achievable performance standards by 2003,'' said Hastert, 
R-Ill. ``Moreover, we need the Clinton-Gore administration to share 
our commitment to fight to win the war on drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also announced that Mica and Reps. Rob Portman, R-Ohio,  
and Bill McCollum, R-Fla., would lead the new Drug-Free America 
Working Group, a task force of House Republicans working on the 
drug issue.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants $153M for Farm Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress for $153  
million to make emergency loans to farmers and hire additional 
employees to process requests for disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal would provide $1.1 billion in direct or guaranteed  
loans for an estimated 10,000 producers who can't get credit from 
private sources. The Agriculture Department is running out of money 
to make loans because of the heavy demand for credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic turmoil in the Pacific Rim countries and around the  
world continue to make it difficult for American farmers and 
ranchers to export their goods overseas,'' Clinton said Friday. 
``More and more farmers need loans to see them through to better 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the gloomy farm economy, many bankers are skittish  
about lending money to marginal farmers unless the government 
guarantees the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without this help many farmers simply would not be able to put  
in their spring crops,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, USDA officials have come under criticism as they  
struggle to keep up with requests from farmers for $6 billion in 
disaster assistance approved by Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request earmarks $43 million for hiring temporary  
staff in USDA's county offices. 
</P>

	``To date the vast majority of farmers haven't been signed up to  
receive relief,'' said House Agriculture Committee Chairman, Larry 
Combest, R-Texas. ``I don't know what's going on down at the 
department, but I do know that our farmers can't wait forever for 
this money.''

<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman predicted earlier this week  
that farmers will face another year of lagging exports and low 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has lowered farm export projections to $49 billion -- down  
from last year's $53.6 billion. Farm income could fall at least $3 
billion, according to the agency.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Seeks First Pac-10 Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Cardinal and white banners hanging from  
the rafters at Maples Pavilion celebrate the greatness of Stanford 
women's basketball and volleyball teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And now the Stanford men are within one win of hanging a  
conference basketball championship banner up there for the first 
time in more than a third of a century. 
</P>
<P>
	With a win Saturday night against defending Pac-10 champion  
Arizona, the sixth-ranked Cardinal would clinch their first title 
since the conference expanded to 10 teams in 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 20 years, only UCLA, Arizona, Washington and Oregon  
State have won the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you haven't done something, it's important,''  
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. ``If you look at the Pac-10, 
it's been incredibly hard for other teams to break through and win 
this thing. The conference championship obviously is very important 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford (23-5, 13-2 Pac-10) took a two-game lead atop the  
conference by defeating Arizona State 87-77 in overtime Thursday 
night while No. 7 Arizona was losing at California. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Wildcats win Saturday night, the Cardinal still can  
clinch the title by winning at Oregon and Oregon State next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stanford hasn't had a title like this for a long time. It  
would mean a great deal to us,'' point guard Arthur Lee said. ``The 
ball is now in our court. We have an opportunity to lock it down 
Saturday, and if not we'll go up to Oregon and get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford has not finished first in its league since the 1962-63  
season, when it shared the title with UCLA with a record of 7-5 in 
the AAWU -- the five-team predecessor of the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	And Stanford has not won a league title outright since 1941-42,  
when it won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and went on 
to capture the NCAA crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Cardinal are starting to do the things that got them  
to the Final Four last year -- hitting key free throws, falling 
behind but then rallying by wearing down teams -- there still are 
reasons for concern as the NCAA tournament approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Tim Young did have a season-high 14 rebounds against  
Arizona State, but he was 3-for-13 from the field and has struggled 
offensively all season. His shooting percentage is below .500 for 
the first time in his college career, and he is averaging career 
lows in points, rebounds and blocks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, too, is struggling with his shooting. He also was 3-for-13  
on field goals Thursday, and has not hit half his shots in a game 
since Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	But such statistics have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of  
Stanford students. There were three tents set up Thursday night, 
before the win over Arizona State was completed, with students 
waiting for prime seats for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Lute Olson also pointed to the significance of  
Saturday night's contest, saying that winning the Pac-10 title can 
be a better indication of a team's greatness than a national title. 
</P>
<P>
	`When you play 18 games and you play everybody home and away,  
that's indicative of who the best team is,'' Olson said. ``When you 
get into the tournament, it's if you get on a roll and who gets the 
luck. In a way it's unfortunate that a whole lot of people don't 
realize how important the conference title is.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Chief Expresses Interest in NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS would eye a takeover of NBC if television  
network ownership rules change. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Corp. chief executive Mel Karmazin told an advertising  
industry conference Thursday that his company would be interested 
in buying NBC if the government eased rules that prevent one 
company from owning two networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin said the Peacock network would be a better fit with his  
company than NBC parent General Electric Co. And he said that if 
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. -- the nation's biggest oil companies -- 
could merge, then CBS and NBC should be allowed to combine. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said Karmazin's remarks came in  
response to a question during the American Association of 
Advertising Agencies conference in New Orleans. McClintock declined 
to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Karmazin's remarks, GE spokesman Bruce Bunch  
said: ``NBC's strong earnings ... make it a perfect fit with GE's 
business model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin has often said he wishes regulators would relax rules  
that limit the number of TV stations, radio stations and broadcast 
networks one company can own. Last month, he told Electronic Media 
magazine that he would especially covet NBC if CBS were allowed to 
buy a second network. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is considering loosening  
rules that limit the number of local TV and radio stations that a 
single company can control. But the issue of owning multiple TV 
networks is not a priority for regulators, said Vinton Vickers, a 
broadcasting analyst with ING Barings Furman Selz 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the likelihood of that happening is fairly remote  
right now,'' Vickers said.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Said Preparing Navistar Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo AB is preparing to make a bid of  
as much as $3.35 billion for the U.S. truck and bus manufacturer 
Navistar, a Swedish business newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's shares dipped about 0.7 percent Friday on the Stockholm  
exchange, while shares of Navistar International Corp. surged 9 
percent, or by $3.66 1/4 a share to $43 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo spokesmen did not return calls for comment on the report  
in the newspaper Dagens Industri, which did not cite sources for 
its information. It said the offer could be in the range of $48-50 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	That would value Navistar, which has about 67 million shares, at  
about $3.2 billion to $3.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't comment on rumors or respond to speculation,'' said  
Roy Wiley, a spokesman for the Chicago-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Navistar was the market leader in medium and heavy trucks and  
school buses in North America last year with about 29 percent of 
them market, Wiley said. It also makes engines. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Volvo acquired 13 percent of the shares in rival  
Swedish heavy vehicle-maker Scania and declared its intent to 
acquire the company. 
</P>
<P>
	However, talks between Volvo and Investor AB, which owns 45  
percent of the shares in Scania, ended this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's shareholders are to meet March 8 to vote on the proposed  
sale of Volvo's passenger-car division to Ford Motor Co. for $6.45 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson had said the car division  
thatb makes about 400,000 vehicles a year was too small to survive 
without the resources of a larger company and that Volvo wanted to 
shed it to concentrate on building up its other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo also makes trucks, buses, heavy equipment and marine and  
aircraft engines.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign Willie Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Wide receiver Willie Green, owner of two  
Super Bowl rings as Denver's third wide receiver, has signed a 
three-year contract with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed. The sides initially were  
discussing an incentive-laden deal worth up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could not have gotten on a team with playoff potential, I  
would have walked away from football,'' Green said. ``I could have 
done that with no remorse or regret. This isn't about money. It's 
about me having a chance to win a third consecutive Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who turns 33 in April, caught just 16 passes for 194  
yards and one touchdown last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Broncos, Green was a two-year starter as one  
of the original Carolina Panthers. He caught 47 passes for 882 
yards and six TDs in 1995, following that with 46 catches in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Green began his career with Detroit and spent one year in Tampa  
Bay before going to the Panthers.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Tame Inflation Data / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rallied Friday, ending a three-day  
slump, after a report of tame inflation eased worries that the 
Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to cool inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32  
points, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.57 percent after climbing to a 
six-month high of 5.65 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge came after the Commerce Department reported that  
inflation rose just 1 percent last year -- the slowest pace since a 
0.9 percent rise in 1949 -- despite healthy economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as a relief to bond investors who had been  
worried that rapid economic expansion would force the Fed to raise 
interest rates to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were up between 9/32 point to 7/16 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.2 
points to 1,281.98 from Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.66 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point to 4.55 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.70 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.54 percent. One-year yields were 4.84 percent as the 
discount fell 0.01 percentage point fell to 4.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.88 percent from 5.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 17/32 point to 124 5/8. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.17 percent from 5.20 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	A storm that pounded New England coastal areas with more than a  
foot of snow was easing a bit early today as it headed back toward 
the Atlantic. Unsettled weather was spreading rain and 
thunderstorms into the nation's midsection. 
</P>
<P>
	A few more inches of snow was expected over eastern  
Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, but heavy snowfall was 
possible in eastern Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Much quieter weather should return to inland areas of the  
Northeast, with partly cloudy skies likely from the Ohio Valley 
into the Southeast. Gulf Coast thunderstorms were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A developing storm system threatened to spread rain and isolated  
heavy storms from the eastern Dakotas and western Great Lakes to 
the southern Plains, and then deep into the Mississippi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the far northern Plains, rain could switch over to light  
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow also was moving toward the Rockies, with accumulations of  
up to 6 inches possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Another storm system was taking aim at the Pacific Northwest.  
Rain and snow was possible from western Washington into 
northwestern California. Locally heavy rainfall over coastal 
Washington and Oregon could produce flooding, and up to a foot of 
Cascades snow was possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly fair conditions should prevail across southern California  
and the desert Southwest. 
</P>

	The nation's hot spot Thursday in the Lower 48 states was  
McAllen, Texas, with a high reading of 82 degrees. The coldest 
place was Clayton Lake, Maine, with a low of 16 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's temperatures should range from the 30s in New England,  
the far northern Plains and the Great Lakes to the 80s along the 
Gulf Coast, with readings into the 40s in the Northeast and upper

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Woods Works Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood's first workout in five days  
wasn't a taxing one. Some long tosses, some stretching, some 
limited running. The NL Rookie of the Year, slowed by illness, 
admitted he has a way to go to get in game shape. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Friday he'll ready for the start of the season that  
is still five weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt in my mind,'' Wood said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized briefly this week for tests for an upper  
respiratory infection, his second of the spring. He was also 
hospitalized a week ago with an intestinal virus, meaning he's been 
feeling poorly for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm behind a little bit,'' Wood said. ``But I got plenty of  
time to be where I need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he lost 14 pounds at one point, gained some back and  
then lost some more. At 6-foot-5, he's now at 233 pounds, about 
where he wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was surprised by the attention his illness received.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got sick. Everybody gets sick,'' he said. ``We've got four  
or five guys in the clubhouse with the same thing. That's what is 
going around down here. Unfortunately, I had it for a while and 
couldn't get rid of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch this week said he expects the Cubs  
to have a contract worked out with Wood's agent before the start of 
exhibition games next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he hadn't given it any thought.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been too sick to think,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Outfielder Lance Johnson and catcher Benito Santiago are  
also ill. The Cubs had 48 of their 52 players on the spring 
training roster at the first full-squad workout. Santiago skipped 
the drills, and catcher Pat Cline was excused because of a death in 
the family. Manny Alexander and Sammy Sosa had not arrived at camp.

<HEADLINE> China Able To Attack Taiwan by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By 2005, China will have the capability to  
attack Taiwan with highly effective air and missile strikes and to 
blockade Taiwan's main ports, the Pentagon has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report to Congress released Friday, the Pentagon did not  
predict a Chinese attack on Taiwan but painted a picture of the 2.5 
million-man People's Liberation Army growing more modern and 
effective even as it shrinks in numbers and struggles with morale 
problems and weaknesses in air transport. 
</P>
<P>
	For a Chinese invasion of Taiwan to succeed it would have to  
conduct a multifaceted campaign involving air assault, amphibious 
landings, a naval blockade, sustained conventional missile strikes 
and other support actions -- a feat it could achieve only with 
``great difficulty'' by 2005, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, the campaign likely would succeed,'' it said,  
unless the United States intervened to aid Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The communist government in Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade  
province and insists it not seek international recognition as a 
separate state. It has refused to renounce the option of using 
force against Taiwan and has stated that it might do so under any 
of three circumstances: If Taiwan declared independence, if a 
foreign power intervened to stop reunification or if Taiwan gained 
nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. policy is to view Taiwan as part of China, although it  
sells defensive arms to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon report said China is ``still decades'' away from  
possessing the capability to defeat a modern military force beyond 
China's borders. Its emphasis has been on developing innovative 
ways of using its strengths -- such as advanced cruise missiles and 
ballistic missiles -- to exploit an enemy's weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach potentially will give Beijing the `credible  
intimidation' needed to accomplish political and military goals 
without having to rely on overwhelming force-on-force 
superiority,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's main focus now is on improving its ability to fight near  
its borders, including Taiwan and the South China Sea, it said. 
China views its growing force of ballistic missiles as ``a potent 
military and political weapon'' to influence Taiwan's people and 
their leaders, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that if China were to invade Taiwan it probably  
would begin by blockading ports with mines laid by submarines and 
channeling Taiwan naval vessels into areas where they would be 
vulnerable to anti-ship missiles. Without outside help, Taiwan 
probably would not be able to keep the island's key ports and sea 
lines of communication open. Taiwan's merchant ships and warships 
would be a ``serious risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From that point, China likely would follow quickly with  
``massive missile strikes'' and then an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2005, the People's Liberation Army will have deployed two  
types of shorter-range ballistic missiles and a first-generation 
land-attack cruise missile, the Pentagon predicted. This expanded 
arsenal of missiles targeted against key airfields and 
communications links will constrain Taiwan's military operations. 
</P>
<P>
	China is giving high priority to development of land-attack  
cruise missiles and is aggressively acquiring foreign technology 
for these weapons, particularly from Russia, the report said. The 
first land-attack cruise missile to enter production probably will 
be air-launched and could be operational shortly after the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis on offensive missiles has given rise to talk of the  
United States developing an anti-missile defense for Taiwan -- an 
idea that has angered China and complicated already strained 
relations with Washington. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is 
visiting Beijing next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon report said China is focused on other areas where  
its adversaries might be vulnerable, such as space. It already has 
the capability, for example, to detect and track most satellites. 
Beijing apparently is researching anti-satellite laser weaponry and 
``already may possess the capability to damage, under specific 
conditions, optical sensors'' on certain kinds of satellites, it 
said.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox To Settle Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox agreed to settle a harassment  
case brought by a former employee who said he was the victim of 
racially motivated threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Sneed, who worked for the Red Sox for seven years, left  
the organization amid allegations the team failed to thoroughly 
investigate racial harassment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Sneed, who is black, said a photograph of  
himself and his white fiancee was defaced with a racial epithet. 
</P>
<P>
	In another incident, a picture of the woman was covered over  
with one of a nanny whose mutilated body was found near the 
baseball park last year. Sneed said he interpreted that act as a 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement agreement between Sneed and the team,  
the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination withdrew its 
earlier finding that Sneed had probable cause to move forward with 
his complaint against the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's announcement, club officials reported they have  
hired someone to consult on diversity and discrimination issues, 
but didn't reveal whether there was a financial settlement with 
Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sneed, now with Bell Atlantic Corp., was first hired by the club  
as a part-time security guard while a student at Northeastern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	He later became sales manager of the team's ``600 Club,''  
managing, he said, annual sales of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sneed has previously said team officials told him to keep quiet  
about the allegations of harassment, and urged him not to tell his 
fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox denied, however, that their investigation of the  
events was halfhearted. Officials said they hired outside lawyers, 
and a private investigation agency and cooperated with police and 
the telephone company in their inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials did not immediately return telephone messages  
left Friday evening at their Boston offices and their spring 
training headquarters in Fort Myers, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Nichols' Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday upheld Terry  
Nichols' conspiracy conviction and life sentence in the Oklahoma 
City bombing, rejecting a defense claim that the trial judge had 
erred in his instructions to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols was sentenced to life and ordered to pay $14.5 million  
in restitution to victims of the April 19, 1995 bombing, which 
killed 168 people and injured 500 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of first-degree  
murder, conspiracy and weapons-related charges and sentenced to 
death. His lawyers have appealed his sentence and conviction to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols' lawyers argued there were 11 grounds for dismissal of  
his conviction and life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a defense claim  
that U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch should have told the jury 
that Nichols could not be sentenced to life imprisonment unless he 
had ``a specific intent to kill.'' The jury acquitted Nichols on 
charges of first-degree murder and using a weapon of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The court rejected a claim that Matsch should have barred  
testimony from a British forensic expert who testified that a bomb 
in the cargo compartment of a Ryder truck allegedly rented by 
McVeigh was the source of the explosion. The defense claimed she 
exceeded her level of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also rejected Nichols' claim that he should  
have been allowed to introduce a former FBI agent as an expert 
witness. Dr. Frederick Whitehurst had evidence questioning 
prosecutors' claims that fertilizer crystals found on truck pieces 
could have survived a night in the rain, defense lawyer Michael 
Tigar said.

<P>
	Also, the court rejected claims that the judge should have  
refused to admit the testimony of informant Michael Fortier, who 
testified in exchange for a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities to the  
bomb plot and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> FAA Probes Marine Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is looking  
into what caused a pair of Marine Corps fighter jets to diverge 
from their flight pattern and pass within a mile of a commuter 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said the incident occurred Thursday when two  
F/A-18 Hornet fighters came too close to a United Express commuter 
plane about 35 miles from its destination -- Dulles International 
Airport outside of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The two jets out of Andrews Air Force Base violated regulations  
by coming within 300 feet in altitude and a mile in horizontal 
distance from the plane, FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said Friday. 
The aircraft should have been at least 1000 feet apart in vertical 
distance and three miles horizontally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary review attributed the incident to an error by the  
fighter pilots, who had been awaiting approval from air traffic 
controllers to maneuver over Quantico Marine Corps Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rinaldi, president of the Air Traffic Control Association  
at Dulles, said the jets were 20 seconds away from striking the 
commuter plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps said the fighters never endangered the computer  
plane and were on course to pass behind the flight. ``They were 
never on a collision course,'' said Sgt. Jeffrey Foster.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Executive Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A tobacco company executive was charged  
with helping smugglers scheme to sell nearly $700 million worth of 
cigarettes on the Canadian black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Thompson, a former R.J. Reynolds executive, was arrested  
this week in Detroit on money laundering charges. He is the first 
tobacco industry executive charged in the federal government's 
investigation into tobacco and alcohol smuggling through the St. 
Regis Mohawk Reservation in northern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers told U.S. customs agents that the Canadian  
cigarettes they were carrying were being brought to the United 
States, prior to being exported to Russia. Instead, they were 
shipped to the St. Regis reservation, and smuggled across the St. 
Lawrence River back into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers avoided paying excise taxes to the United States  
and then cheated the Canadian government out of millions of dollars 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory West said Friday that it  
appeared Thompson was preparing to flee the country when arrested. 
Thompson, 51, of Harper Woods, Mich., was ordered held without bail 
and will be returned to Syracuse for prosecution, West said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of money laundering, Thompson could face up to 20  
years in prison. The government also is seeking to seize $87 
million in illicit assets from Thompson, West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen people have already been convicted in the case and are  
awaiting sentencing. In December, Northern Brands International, an 
R.J. Reynolds subsidiary, admitted helping the smuggling ring and 
paid $15 million in fines and forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was an R.J. Reynolds marketing executive in 1992 when  
he allegedly met Larry V. Miller and Lewis and Robert Tavano of 
Niagara Falls, the men convicted of masterminding the smuggling 
operation. Thompson arranged to have the company's Canadian-brand 
cigarettes, Export A's, exported to the smugglers in the United 
States, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators first linked Thompson to Miller and the  
Tavanos through their meetings at Sonora Island Lodge in British 
Columbia in 1995. A witness, Michael Mangan, a truck driver for the 
smuggling ring, testified about the meetings to a federal grand 
jury in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sat around this big fireplace, and there was a big  
discussion about smuggling of the cigarettes, and Les Thompson was 
present at this meeting,'' Mangan testified in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for R.J. Reynolds International said the allegations  
against Thompson run ``completely contrary'' to corporate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious matter for the company and it's to the  
detriment of the company,'' spokesman Adam Bryan-Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was placed on administrative leave after the company  
began an internal investigation into the allegations of Northern 
Brands' complicity with smugglers, said C. Stephen Heard, the 
company 's lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Baby Sitter To Get $1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A couple who accused their baby  
sitter of stealing $752 while they cruised the Bahamas in their 
yacht have agreed to pay the woman $1 million for causing her 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement Thursday ends a seven-year battle between Charles  
and Bonnie Abel and Beth Cunningham, who lived down the street from 
the Abels when she began baby-sitting for their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham, 34, was acquitted in 1994 of grand theft for  
allegedly stealing from the couple's bank account with their ATM 
card. She then turned around and sued the Abels. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury took only 45 minutes to decide the couple owed Ms.  
Cunningham $787,800 in compensatory damages. The jury was about to 
consider punitive damages when the two sides reached an settlement 
of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Cunningham, the Abels asked her in 1992 to stay  
with their 7-year-old daughter for a week while they went on a 
cruise on their 52-foot yacht and gave her $100 for expenses. Then, 
she said, they called to say they were extending their trip by 
three weeks and gave Ms. Cunningham their ATM number. She withdrew 
$952 from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	After the couple's return, they accused her of stealing.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal To Start in 3-5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's first permanent war crimes  
tribunal will probably start operating in three to five years, the 
key organizer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over U.S. objections, 120 countries approved the treaty  
establishing the International Criminal Court last July. It has 
since been signed by 76 nations, most recently Haiti, and ratified 
by one, Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, which will prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes  
against humanity, war crimes, and aggression, will begin operating 
when 60 countries have ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States voted against the treaty because U.S.  
officials felt it yielded too much prosecutorial power to the new 
court, leaving U.S. troops and citizens vulnerable to politically 
motivated prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Preparatory Commission for the tribunal ended two weeks of  
meetings here Friday, and the United States participated. Philippe 
Kirsch, the commission's chairman, said the tribunal should begin 
operations in three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some human rights groups accused the United States of trying to  
weaken the court's clout or possibly destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kirsch called the conclusions ``premature.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere is very good,'' he said. ``After two weeks, all  
indications are all parties involved in those discussions are 
trying to make progress and to reach a general agreement. But it is 
very slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsch said he intends to appoint an individual to explore with  
all delegations over the next few months the U.S. objections to the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that most countries consider that a court with  
United States support would obviously be stronger,'' he said. ``I 
think the general intention is to talk to the United States to see 
whether and how the U.S. concerns could be accommodated.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out Teen Sex Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A judge has thrown out a teen-age sex  
lawsuit, apologizing to jurors as he dismissed a couple's claim 
that another parent was to blame for their daughter's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In more than 25 years as a judge, this is one of the weakest,  
if not most frivolous cases I've ever been involved in,'' Lancaster 
County District Judge Jeffre Cheuvront said Thursday. ``I'm 
embarrassed that the jury has been exposed to, in my opinion, 
blatantly mendacious testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug and Sharon Detmer of Lincoln had sued Dawn Bixler, alleging  
she was negligent because she knew their daughter and her son were 
having sex and condoned it. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was believed to be the first of its kind in the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer said he and his wife were unaware their daughter, Leanne,  
was having sex with the boy, Dallas Mills, after the two 
16-year-olds began dating in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl told them she was pregnant in April 1997 and had an  
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills refused to comment after the trial, but his mother said  
she was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad that it's over,'' Ms. Bixler said. ``I just wish  
I could have told my side of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Detmers declined to comment. Their lawyer, D. Kirk  
Wolgamott, said he was considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bixler's lawyer, Susan Strong, maintained from the start  
that the lawsuit was frivolous because the sex was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish this would've been thrown out a long time ago,'' she  
said. ``It's too bad these people had to go through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leanne Detmer testified she that she had sex at her boyfriend's  
house because his mother condoned the activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked being at their house because we could do what we  
wanted. There were no rules over there,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also testified there was little her parents could have done  
to stop her from having sex with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detmers had asked for more than $11,000 in medical expenses  
to pay for the abortion and an unspecified amount of general 
damages. The medical expenses also included cost of the treating 
the girl's depression, which they said was worsened by the 
pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Gold Medalist Lewis Shines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Three years ago, Steve Lewis had a cyst on his  
lower back that was ``as big as a sausage,'' and if he didn't have 
surgery he might not have been able to walk again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Lewis, winner of three Olympic gold medals and one silver  
medal, again appears to be among the world's fastest 
quarter-milers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not finished making history yet,'' Lewis said Friday after  
winning his section of the 400 meters in 46.38 seconds in the USA 
Indoor Track and Field Championships at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning, the 29-year-old Lewis advanced to Saturday's final  
against a field that will include Milt Campbell, who qualified in 
45.75, the fastest by an American this year, and Angelo Taylor 
(45.91), the 1998 NCAA 400-meter hurdles champion from Georgia 
Tech. Derek Mills, the 1997 USA indoor champion, won his heat but 
didn't advance because his time of 46.70 wasn't among the six 
fastest. 
</P>
<P>
	While Campbell, Taylor and Mills have been running without much  
interruption in recent years, Lewis' career was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday, he ran his first indoor race in five years and  
ran under control, winning a low-key event in 46.48. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, there was a lot more at stake -- and Lewis was ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good,'' he said, after easing up at the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	His two performances within a week are a testament to his strong  
determination. He thought about quitting running before his 
operation because ``I was so weak,'' he said, ``I couldn't even 
work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had a virus,'' Lewis said. ``Then, I had an MRI.''  
</P>
<P>
	The test showed the huge cyst that was affecting nerves in his  
body and legs, weakening him completely. Because of the way it was 
situated, Lewis said he could not feel the cyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was embedded in my spine, and it was expanding,'' he said.  
``I couldn't even jog a mile because I was in such pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed in April 1996 and Lewis was  
incapacitated for a year, unable to work out, train or exercise. He 
resumed training in April 1997, competed sporadically that year and 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is pain free and coming back full time in a quest to  
regain the stature he held in 1988 when he won gold medals in the 
400 and 1,600 relay, and in 1992, when he was the silver medalist 
in the 400 and earned another relay gold. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins or finishes second in Saturday's final, he would earn  
a place on the U.S. team for next week's World Indoor Championships 
at Maebashi, Japan. His last international team appearance was at 
the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said that if hadn't been injured, he might have quit after  
a possible third Olympics in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't feel I've reached my potential,'' he said. ``I  
don't feel too old to accomplish things. I feel I have a lot more 
in me. I feel I still have it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a runner, it's hard to stop because of injuries.''  
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there's no quit in Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to find the old Steve Lewis,'' he said. ``That will  
save the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still there.''  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the trials in the men's 400, trials were held in  
the women's 400 and the men's and women's 200 and 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Little, the 1997 world champion in the men's 200, won his  
heat comfortably in 20.59. Tyree Washington, the 1997 world outdoor 
bronze medalist in the 400, also qualified for Saturday's final in 
the 200, finishing second in his heat in 20.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the defending world champion in the women's  
400, easily won her heat in 53.12 and advanced to Saturday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister-in-law, Joetta Clark, the defending U.S. champion in  
the women's 800, and Meredith Valmon, the 1991 national champion, 
won their heats. Clark was timed in 2:05.15 and Valmon in 2:06.45. 
</P>
<P>
	While Valmon was running, her 19-month-old son Travis was asleep  
in the stands with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a little distressed when I run,'' Valmon said,  
``especially when he can see that I'm tired. He doesn't always like 
it. So it's better that he slept through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Kenah, the 1997 world indoor and outdoor bronze medalist in  
the men's 800, also qualified for Saturday's final, finishing 
second in his heat in 1:49.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine championship finals will be held Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Expos Denied Extension on Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The chances of the Montreal Expos eventually  
moving have increased, with commissioner Bud Selig denying a 
request to put off a March 6 deadline for having a new ownership 
group and stadium financing in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a lack of support from Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard,  
baseball's chief legal officer, Robert DuPuy, said the sport is 
committed to keeping the Expos in Montreal but that a solution was 
needed ``to plan with respect to the 2000 season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To date, there has been no commitment for government support  
to keep the Expos in Montreal,'' DuPuy wrote Thursday to Expos 
chairman Jacques Menard in a letter obtained by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the contrary, Premier Bouchard has reiterated publicly his  
strong opposition to public financing for a new stadium, and there 
was no mention of stadium financing in either the national or the 
provincial budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos say they can't survive in Olympic Stadium and need a  
new ballpark. But the team has struggled to raise the money, and 
Washington and Northern Virginia groups are interested in obtaining 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plans for the construction of the stadium remain  
indefinite, and there appears to be no workable solution to the 
coverage of the shortfall in the event that the seat license 
program is not as successful as you have projected,'' DuPuy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard, speaking Friday at a political meeting in  
Ville-d'Esterel, Quebec, called the decision ``particularly 
unpleasant'' and said the Expos should have been given another year 
to get their finances in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were ready to continue working,'' he said. ``I see  
people are throwing the ball at one another. They're playing ball, 
not baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball also is uncomfortable with the fighting in the Expos'  
ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Claude Brochu is considered by baseball in  
control of the team but after a stadium financing plan failed last 
year, he said he was willing to sell his 7.6 percent stake in the 
team. He has rejected an offer of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said Feb. 18 that new investors led by New York art  
dealer Jeffrey Loria are prepared to buy into the team, but said 
Brochu was an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeffrey Loria was not approved by is to come in and replace  
Claude,'' DuPuy wrote. ``We have received no written understanding 
from Mr. Loria regarding either his financing or his commitment to 
keeping the team in Montreal. To leave the impression that we 
support the ouster of Claude in favor of a new control person is 
most unfortunate. ... The disparaging remarks made with respect to 
Claude were absolutely counter to all of our discussions and 
violated the integrity of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menard said Friday that Expos investors were ``pleased with the  
interest major league baseball is taking in doing everything 
possible to keep the Expos in Montreal and in continuing to work 
closely with us over the coming weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard reiterated on Friday that his government can't spend  
money on a baseball team at a time when hospitals and schools face 
cutbacks. But Menard said that stance may change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has clearly expressed its willingness to  
eventually consider a new proposal,'' Menard said. ``We have agreed 
with the premier to meet with government representatives in the 
next few weeks, as soon as all aspects of the plan have been 
completed.''

<HEADLINE> Nuggets' LaFrentz Done for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The MRI performed Friday on the left knee of  
Denver Nuggets rookie Raef LaFrentz revealed what the team already 
knew -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets were aware LaFrentz tore the anterior cruciate  
ligament in his left knee on Thursday night against Dallas, and 
knew he would miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The MRI revealed a small tear of the lateral meniscus in the  
same knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Traina, the team's orthopedic surgeon, will operate to  
repair the knee, but no date has been set. Traina ruled LaFrentz 
out for the season, but estimated he could return to basketball in 
6-8 months. 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz tore the ligament on a drive to the basket in the first  
quarter of Denver's 90-81 loss to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed for myself and for the team,'' LaFrentz said  
Friday. ``It is my first major injury. I have to remain positive 
and do the rehab so I can come back strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaFrentz, the third pick in last June's NBA draft, averaged 14.9  
points and 8.1 rebounds in his first 11 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Reno Meeting Eyes Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno plans to meet with  
civil rights representatives concerned about police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno told reporters at her weekly news conference Thursday that  
she would hold such a meeting after she returns from a scheduled 
trip to South America next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a very serious problem,'' Reno said. ``There  
are so many good police officers in this country ... but there are 
some bad police officers, like there are bad people in every walk 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, black, Asian, Latino and Jewish civil rights  
advocates called for a meeting with President Clinton to help 
``stem this national epidemic of brutality and abuse,'' Hugh B. 
Price, president of the National Urban League, said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was accompanied by NAACP President Kweisi Mfume; Jesse  
Jackson; civil rights attorney Johnnie Cochran; Abraham Foxman, 
national director of the Anti-Defamation League; Raul Yzaguirre, 
president of National Council of La Raza; Karen Narasaki, executive 
director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium; 
and Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Danny Davis, D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need President Clinton to step up to the plate and provide  
leadership. We seek a meeting and concrete plans on how to deal 
with this problem,'' Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent fatal shootings of young blacks by police under  
questionable circumstances in New York, Pittsburgh and Riverside, 
Calif., have focused attention on confrontations that pit 
minorities against white officers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the coalition members said they want authorities to curb  
other types of police harassment, including the targeting of black 
motorists without proper cause, abuse against Latinos by U.S. 
border agents and racial profiling, the practice of singling out 
minorities for questioning at airports, on highways and on streets. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the meeting with Clinton, coalition members  
called for withholding federal funds from local departments with 
numerous brutality charges, thorough background checks of police 
recruits and the mandatory establishment of police review boards 
with subpoena powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Henderson, director of the Leadership Council on Civil  
Rights, said he hoped the group's diversity could help push Clinton 
to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, many national organizations are speaking with one voice  
in hopes of (Clinton) moving immediately to address this growing 
crisis,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foxman said he wanted Clinton to understand the problem of  
police brutality isn't isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is most necessary, Mr. President, for you not to see this  
as a New York problem or a Pittsburgh problem or a Los Angeles 
problem, but as a national problem,'' Foxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, four plainclothes police officers fired 41 bullets  
at Amadou Diallo, 22 and unarmed, as he stood in the vestibule of 
his apartment house in the Bronx on Feb. 4. Demonstrators have 
questioned why so many shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riverside, the December shooting by police of Tyisha Miller,  
19, who was hit with 12 bullets in the back as she sat in her car, 
has sparked protests by some claiming the shooting was racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pittsburgh, Deron S. Grimmitt Sr., 32, was shot to death  
after a police chase Dec. 21. Officer Jeffrey Cooperstein says he 
feared Grimmitt would run him over, but testimony showed Grimmitt 
was shot through the driver's side window, not head-on as might be 
expected if he were driving toward Cooperstein.

<HEADLINE> Child Internet-Sex Charge Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Charges against an Eau Claire man have been  
thrown out by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in a ruling that struck 
down part of the state's anti-pornography law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court dismissed two counts of sexual exploitation of a child  
against Joel Zarnke, 59, who was accused of downloading Internet 
pictures of naked boys and distributing them in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 6-1 ruling Friday, the justices struck down the portion of  
a 1987 law used to charge Zarnke, ruling it unconstitutional 
because it requires the defendant to prove his or her lack of 
knowledge of the child's age and violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarnke, who is out of jail on bond, will still be prosecuted on  
charges of child enticement and possession of child pornography, 
prosecutor Raymond Pelrine said. A trial has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarnke has pleaded innocent. If convicted of both charges, he  
faces up to 12 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ruling, it is still against federal law to  
distribute child pornography, said Jim Haney, spokesman for state 
Attorney General James Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state Legislature needs to repair the state statute,''  
Haney said. ``The most important message is that distribution of 
child pornography remains a crime.''

<HEADLINE> Testing Begins on Kennewick Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Scientists have embarked on an ancestral quest in  
examining Kennewick Man, one of North America's oldest skeletons 
found along the Columbia River nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly-complete, 9,300-year-old skeleton is considered the  
oldest and most complete specimen of human remains found in the 
Northwest. It was found in July 1996 containing all major bones 
except the sternum, dispersed over a 300-square-yard area in 
Kennewick's Columbia Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-member team of anthropologists and archaeologists began  
their work Thursday. Their first focus is to determine whether the 
bones are of Indian origin as defined by federal law, said team 
leader Francis McManamon, chief archaeologist for the National Park 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	If they are, the Department of the Interior will decide if there  
is a modern tribe to which the remains ought to be given. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal wrangling had kept the bones from being studied.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers, which took custody of the bones  
from the Benton County sheriff's office, had planned to turn them 
over to tribal representatives; five Northwest tribes have claimed 
the remains as an ancestor and wish to rebury them. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists later sued in federal court for the right to  
study Kennewick Man because he reportedly has non-Indian features. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Trimble, the head curator for the Corps of  
Engineers, said the bones, more than 350 pieces, were filled with 
water and were held together with sediment when they were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will analyze those soil samples for links to soil  
layers near the discovery site. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists also will measure the shape and width of the  
skeleton's face, dental remains and a stone point embedded in the 
pelvic bone, said Joseph Powell, a physical anthropologist from the 
University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists will also observe any inflammation, trauma or  
toxins that could be indications of health and way of life of the 
Kennewick Man, who is believed to have been in his 40s or 50s when 
he died. 
</P>
<P>
	If the analysis isn't enough to determine whether the remains  
are Indian, the team may use radiocarbon dating, DNA analysis or 
other tests that could destroy small amounts of bone.

<HEADLINE> Defense Phase Ends for Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge hearing the Microsoft antitrust trial  
concluded the defense phase of the lengthy proceeding Friday, 
rebuking the software giant's last witness. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will render a  
verdict later this year, on Friday finished hearing 17 weeks of 
highly charged allegations from government attorneys, courtroom 
concessions -- and some extraordinary goofups, particularly by 
Microsoft's witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	After at least a six-week break, the trial is scheduled to  
resume in April with Microsoft and the government presenting 
rebuttal arguments. Each side can then use testimony from three 
more witnesses. Jackson is expected to return a verdict over the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The central questions Friday were largely the same as outlined  
by the Justice Department and 19 states during the trial's opening 
days last October: Did Microsoft illegally use its influence in the 
technology industry to crush its software rivals and maintain its 
lucrative Windows dominance? 
</P>
<P>
	The government has identified Microsoft's victims as Netscape  
Communications Corp., whose Internet software has fallen from 
prominence since 1995, as well as Intel Corp., Apple Computer Inc., 
Sun Microsystems Inc., America Online Inc. and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has steadfastly denied that it possess monopoly power  
and argued that it fought tough but fairly. In his opening 
arguments, Microsoft lawyer John Warden reminded the judge, 
``Antitrust laws are not a code of civility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial's outcome could dramatically affect the computer  
industry during a period when it's making huge technology strides 
and helping drive the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And a verdict could come during a period of remarkable change:  
Weeks after the trial began, America Online agreed to buy Netscape 
for $4.2 billion in a deal that also included Sun Microsystems. 
Even the judge pondered publicly that it ``might be a very 
significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson agreed to allow Microsoft to investigate the impact of  
the purchase during the lengthy upcoming recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The final Microsoft witness Friday was Robert Muglia, a senior  
vice president who refuted earlier testimony that the company 
sought to undermine Sun Microsystems' rival Java technology, which 
allows software to run on a variety of computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Muglia, however, acknowledged that Microsoft encouraged software  
developers to use Windows-only features that effectively prevent 
their Java programs from running with other operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies confronted Muglia on with  
e-mail from Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in May 1997 saying he was 
``hardcore'' about not supporting Sun's then-upcoming version of 
Java. 
</P>
<P>
	Muglia noted that Gates also wrote: ``If you think we should  
support (the technology) it's OK, but you will really have to 
explain why and where it stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as Muglia argued over Gates' intentions, the judge tried to  
cut him off: ``There's no question'' that Gates opposed it, the 
judge told Muglia. ``Let's not argue about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muglia continued offering his interpretation of the Gates  
e-mail, but the judge then rebuked him sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``No!'' the judge shouted, dropping his head in his hands.  
``Stop! There is no question pending!''

<HEADLINE> Timber Co. Rejects Forest Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The timber company that owns the  
ancient Headwaters Forest rejected a $480 million plan Friday to 
turn majestic redwood groves 250 miles north of San Francisco into 
a public preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The state and federal governments had approved the proposal  
after lengthy negotiations, pleasing environmentalists by demanding 
tough protections of streams and wildlife habitats throughout the 
logging company's property in California. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Lumber Co. turned it down, contending the deal could  
financially cripple the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not agree to a deal that would have made our company  
uncompetitive and uneconomic,'' Pacific Lumber President John 
Campbell said. ``We had an obligation to our investors, to the men 
and women who work for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sierra Club was sharply critical of the company's action.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're very surprised by the level of corporate greed displayed  
by Pacific Lumber's refusal to accept what was an extraordinarily 
generous offer,'' Sierra Club state director Bill Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes a day after California made its final offer.  
On Monday, the federal money disappears unless all sides agree to 
the plan. No new negotiations are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have had Pacific Lumber and an allied logging  
firm sell 10,000 acres of forest -- including about 5,000 acres of 
old-growth redwoods -- to the United States and California. Some of 
the trees are 1,500 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	The new preserve would have ranked ``with the establishment of  
Yosemite and Sequoia national parks over 100 years ago,'' Pacific 
Lumber President John Campbell said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacific Lumber vigorously opposed a list of stringent  
environmental rules California wanted it to follow on the rest of 
its 211,000 acres in Humboldt County as a condition of the sale. 
The rules would be locked in for at least 50 years and remain in 
effect even if the company sells the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists also weren't entirely pleased with the deal.  
They said their central demand was not addressed by the agreement -- 
that the entire 94-square-mile Headwaters Forest Complex should be 
protected, a total of 66,000 acres, not just the 10,000 acres in 
the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber, a 130-year-old logging company based on the  
Northern California coast, has been the subject of a decade of 
court fights and demonstrations -- including the nation's largest 
forest rally, a 1996 environmental protest in which more than 1,000 
people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Headwaters Forest has pitted environmentalists against Texas  
financier Charles Hurwitz, who controls Pacific Lumber through his 
Houston-based Maxxam Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurwitz purchased Pacific Lumber in 1985. Logging increased  
under his ownership, prompting several protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Woody Harrelson and eight others stopped traffic for five  
hours on the Golden Gate Bridge in November 1996 in a 
save-the-redwoods protest. Singers Don Henley and Bonnie Raitt also 
campaigned against logging in the Headwaters Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Humboldt County sheriff deputies dabbed pepper  
spray directly into the eyes of demonstrators at Pacific Lumber's 
Scotia headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, a protester has sat on top of an old-growth  
redwood on Pacific Lumber land outside the Headwaters area and 
refused to come down in protest of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, a 24-year-old Earth First! activist named David  
Chain was killed when he was struck in the head by a falling tree 
while trying to block logging in the Headwaters. Investigators said 
a logger sent the tree crashing down, though authorities said his 
death was an accident.

<HEADLINE> PBS Removes Bode As Moderator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ken Bode was abruptly removed as moderator of  
PBS's ``Washington Week in Review'' in a public battle with 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Roberts, a New York Daily News columnist, replaced Bode on  
the political roundtable show Friday night. Paul Duke, the show's 
moderator for 20 years through 1994, will return for three months 
as a fill-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Bode said WETA-TV in Washington, which  
produces the show, wanted ``more attitude'' on the air and had 
decided to replace him. He said he had agreed to stay for four more 
months, and then leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was abruptly replaced this week.  
</P>
<P>
	WETA had accused Bode of misrepresenting management and was  
angry that he had taken the battle public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken has not been fired,'' said Elise Adde, a WETA spokeswoman.  
``Our conversations with Ken are ongoing.'' 
</P>

Northwestern University.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Executive Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A former R.J. Reynolds marketing executive  
has been charged with helping smugglers scheme to sell nearly $700 
million worth of cigarettes on the Canadian black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Thompson, 51, was arrested this week in Detroit on money  
laundering charges. If convicted, he could get 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the first tobacco industry executive charged in the  
federal government's investigation into tobacco and alcohol 
smuggling through the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in northern New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers avoided paying excise taxes to the United States  
by telling customs agents that the Canadian cigarettes they were 
carrying were being brought into the country for export to Russia. 
Instead, they were shipped to the St. Regis reservation and 
smuggled across the St. Lawrence River back into Canada, thus 
cheating the Canadian government of taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Thompson was preparing to flee the country when  
arrested, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory West said Friday. 
Thompson was ordered held without bail. The government also is 
seeking to seize $87 million in illicit assets from Thompson, West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen people have been convicted in the case and are  
awaiting sentencing. In December, Northern Brands International, an 
R.J. Reynolds subsidiary, admitted helping the smuggling ring and 
paid $15 million in fines and forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was placed on leave after the company began an internal  
investigation into Northern Brands. Adam Bryan-Brown, a spokesman 
for R.J. Reynolds, said the allegations against Thompson run 
``completely contrary'' to corporate policy.

<HEADLINE> Feds Still Working On Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite recent progress with the year 2000  
computer problem, serious concerns remain about the ability of the 
agency that handles billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid 
payments to be problem-free by Jan. 1, a government auditor said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration still must perform a  
tremendous amount of testing on its computer systems before the end 
of the year, Joel Willemssen, director of civil agencies 
information systems at the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, told a House panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they're not doing what they can,'' Willemssen  
told the House Government Reform government management, information 
and technology subcommittee. ``It's that there's a limited amount 
of time left to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nancy-Ann DeParle, the agency's administrator, said that  
while there was still a lot of work to be done, its systems would 
be repaired in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be ready well before Jan. 1, 2000,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since many computers use two digits to recognize years, the fear  
is that they will confuse 2000 with 1900, causing widespread 
malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has set a March 31 deadline for most federal  
agencies to upgrade their systems to avoid breakdowns in basic 
public services on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But what's become known as the ``Y2K'' problem is particularly  
vexing for HCFA because it depends on many players, including 
states, doctors, hospitals and other providers over which the 
agency has no direct authority, DeParle said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the agency's 25 most critical internal computer systems  
have been certified as Year 2000 compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	But DeParle and the GAO disagreed over HCFA's external systems.  
</P>
<P>
	DeParle said 54 of those 78 systems were compliant; Willemssen  
said none of them were and said he doubted the agency would be able 
to ready them by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Willemssen said it was ``crucial'' that HCFA  
finalize contingency plans to ensure that its operations remain 
uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	DeParle said the agency has gone through a third draft of its  
contingency plan, which it expects to finalize by June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to doing everything we have to do'' to fix  
the problem, DeParle said. ``This is our No. 1 priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., the  
subcommittee's chairman, released his seventh quarterly ``report 
card'' on the status of federal efforts to resolve the glitch. The 
report said federal agencies have belatedly responded to the 
problem but that some of the biggest departments, including Defense 
and State, continue to lag behind others.

<HEADLINE> Baby Sitter To Get $1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A couple who accused their baby  
sitter of stealing $752 while they cruised the Bahamas in their 
yacht have agreed to pay the woman $1 million for causing her 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement Thursday ends a seven-year battle between Charles  
and Bonnie Abel and Beth Cunningham, who lived down the street from 
the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham, 34, was acquitted in 1994 of grand theft for  
allegedly stealing from the couple's bank account with their ATM 
card. She then sued the Abels. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury took only 45 minutes to decide the couple owed Ms.  
Cunningham $787,800 in compensatory damages. The jury was about to 
consider punitive damages when the two sides reached an settlement 
of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ms. Cunningham, the Abels asked her in 1992 to stay  
with their 7-year-old daughter for a week while they went on a 
cruise on their 52-foot yacht and gave her $100 for expenses. Then, 
she said, they called to say they were extending their trip by 
three weeks and gave Ms. Cunningham their ATM number. She withdrew 
$952 from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	After the couple's return, they accused her of stealing.

<HEADLINE> Inmate in Solitary Wins Jury Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A jury has ordered prison officials to  
pay $660,000 in damages to an inmate who was locked in solitary 
confinement for 23 hours a day for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury found that David McClary, convicted of killing a  
police officer, was subjected to mental distress and his civil 
rights were violated by state prison officials who kept him 
confined to a small cell from late 1989 through early 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state said they will ask U.S. Magistrate  
Jonathan Feldman to set aside the verdict and are considering an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	McClary, 33, is serving 25 years to life for killing an officer  
who was guarding the home of a witness in a drug case in 1988. 
Prison officials said the notoriety of McClary's crime put him at 
risk in the general prison population. 
</P>
<P>
	But after hearing two weeks of testimony, a jury on Tuesday  
night found former state prisons Commissioner Thomas Coughlin III 
and three former superintendents at Attica and Wende prisons in 
western New York liable for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were within their rights for initially putting McClary  
in a 23-hour-a-day lockup but they violated his rights by his 
continued confinement there, the jury decided. There is no law in 
New York state on how long prisoners can be held in solitary.

<HEADLINE> Online Co. Pursues Free-Stock Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buy our beer and get free shares of our stock,  
a brewing company wanted to beckon on the Internet. The brewer put 
off the plan after federal regulators said the stock wouldn't 
really be free, but at least one other company is pursuing this new 
type of giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators will be challenged by Simplystocks.com, which  
provides research data for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get people attracted to our Web site,'' Jay Lacny,  
the owner and president of Simplystocks.com, said Friday in a 
telephone interview from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacny said he disagrees when regulators contend that people make  
a form of payment when they visit a firm's Web site and provide 
their name and other personal data. 
</P>
<P>
	If someone receives stock in exchange for providing personal  
data to a company, the Securities and Exchange Commission figures, 
the person is actually buying the stock. That means the company has 
to register the giveaway with the SEC as a stock sale or 
demonstrate why it should be exempt from registering, the agency 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not free,'' Brian Lane, director of the SEC's  
division of corporation finance, told an audience of securities 
lawyers Friday. He likened the idea to giving a Caribbean vacation 
to someone who provided his income data and other personal 
information that is valuable to a company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacny said he planned to go through regulatory channels and  
contest that view, maintaining there's no payment involved in 
giving personal data to a company Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	If it prevails, Simplystocks.com should be able to launch its  
stock giveaway sweepstakes in about a month, Lacny said. The 
company wants to offer the possibility of getting free stock to 
people who visit its Web site during a six-month period and give

	A computer-generated formula overseen by an independent party  
would be used to select the recipients of the stock. The total 
stock given away would represent 10 percent of Simplystocks.com's

	But American Brewing Co. recently dropped its plan to give  
consumers one free share of nonvoting stock for every 24 bottles of 
its ``Hard Hat'' beer they bought. The company, a small brewery 
based in Lake Park, Fla., had envisioned distributing some 400,000 
shares that way, or 20 percent of the total, and had sought an 
opinion from the SEC last month.

	George Poncy, the company's president and sole owner, said  
Friday he had just decided to take the business public, in which 
case a sale of shares would have to be registered with the SEC 
anyway. After that, American Brewing could do the same kind of 
promotion.

	Poncy described ``Hard Hat'' as ``a middle-of-the-road, true  
American lager.'' The label on the bottle cautions that it's ``not 
recommended for ladies of refinement and gentle manners.''

	Three companies, Travelzoo.com, E-Compare and Exit23b.com,  
offered free stock on the Internet in recent months but recently 
stopped doing so, according to Simplystocks.com's Lacny. The 
companies couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

	Exit23b.com, which describes itself as a Web site for buying  
electronics, interactive games and other entertainment products, 
has a notice on its site thanking customers for their interest in 
its stock giveaway, which it says has ended. ``We have reached our 
goal and will not be accepting any more entries,'' the notice says. 
</P>
<P>
	E-Compare, an online company providing comparison-shopping  
information for books, has a posting saying its ``free stock 
distribution has been voluntarily suspended pending clarification 
of SEC ... rules on the matter. ... We will notify you as soon as 
we resume giving away E-Compare stock.''
