<HEADLINE> Singapore Seeking to Improve Energy Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has mounted efforts to
improve its energy efficiency in a bid to achieve its development
and environmental objectives, a senior Singapore official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, we have developed policies and implemented
many measures to improve the energy efficiency in the different
sectors," Koo Tsai Kee, senior parliamentary secretary of the
Ministry of National Development, said at the opening of the "
Germany-Singapore Environmental Technology Agency: Asia-Pacific
Regional Workshop on Energy Efficiency."
</P>
<P>
He said that in the industrial and transport sectors as well
as residential and commercial buildings, the three main sectors
for energy consumption in Singapore, energy-saving programs have
been undertaken in each sector. They include setting up the Public
Utility Board to provide services and advice on energy
conservation, adopting an energy auditing system, offering tax
incentives, replacing older energy inefficient equipment,
improving public housing designs and managing the growth and usage
of private vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's current efforts are not enough, he said, noting
that Singapore's average GDP growth was about 7.6 percent per
annum during the 1980 to 1995 period while energy demand over the
same period grew at an average 11.9 percent and Singapore ranked
the 25th out of 45 countries in energy intensity or the amount of
commercial energy consumed per dollar GDP.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, there is ample room for Singapore to improve on
its energy efficiency performance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from a study by the ministry show that by installing
energy efficient refrigerators and air conditioning units,
respective 26 percent and 8 percent energy savings can be achieved,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said energy savings of similar magnitudes can also be
achieved in commercial, institutional and industrial buildings.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the manufacturing sector where motors are
estimated to use three-quarters of the industry's electricity, he
said a 12-fold energy saving could be achieved after some of its
processes are re-engineered.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's overall electricity consumption is projected to
increase at an average of 5.3 percent per annum and the country
needs to boost its generating capacity by 60 percent before 2007,
Koo said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next 40 years, he added, an estimated 570 to 720
hectares of land will have to be set aside for power plants and
transmission stations.

JERUSALEM -- Hundreds of Israeli troops left south Lebanon under
the cover of darkness early Tuesday morning amid reports that
Israel will end its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon within
days.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Lebanon said the predawn withdrawal involved
some three-quarters of the Israeli forces in the security zone in
south Lebanon, which Israel set up in 1985 with a self-claimed
purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) cleared the Bint Jubeil outpost,
the second largest outpost in the zone, and around 120 IDF officers
and soldiers have withdrawn to Israel overnight, an army statement
said. (Israel-Lebanon)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Tuesday
that Israel would complete its accelerated troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon within a few days.
</P>
<P>
"We will redeploy in the next few days on the international
border," Barak told the army radio, hours after his security
cabinet empowered him to speed up the pullout from Israel's
occupation zone in south Lebanon. (Israel-Barak-Withdrawal)
</P>

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Three quarters of the Israeli occupation troops have
withdrawn from south Lebanon and the remaining quarter is expected
to leave within this week, Voice of Lebanon radio reported Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The larger part of south Lebanon has been freed, including the
border towns of Bint Jebeil and Sweida, both of which were vacated
by Israeli troops overnight, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The main Israeli concentrations are now in the Beaufort Castle
and the town of Marjeyoun in the eastern sector of south Lebanon.

BEIRUT -- The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) released 144
Lebanese detainees from the notorious Khiam prison Tuesday
afternoon, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The detainees, including five women, held uprising in the prison
on Monday when SLA collapsed after Israel began its full scale,
unexpectedly swift withdrawal from the occupied zone this week.
</P>
<P>
The prison, run by the militia in cooperation with Israeli
occupation troops, has been repeatedly accused of human rights
violations including torture. (Lebanon-Khiam Prison)

JERUSALEM -- Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon early
Tuesday sparked mixed reactions in the country with the government
defending its decision and the opposition accusing it of stirring
up chaos inside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said earlier Tuesday the withdrawal
from south Lebanon is a right decision that the government has
made.
</P>
<P>
The government did the right thing in deciding to bring the
Israeli troops back from south Lebanon, Barak said, adding that by
implementing the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425,
Israel will receive extensive international backing. (Israel-

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Israeli Pullout From Lebanon as Victory of Lebanese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Wednesday hailed the Israeli troop pullout from southern Lebanon as
a victory of the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
In congratulatory cables sent to Lebanese leaders, Mubarak
termed the end of Israel's occupation of south Lebanon as "a great
victory" for the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
It was also "a great achievement" of the international
legitimacy and "a great step for the realization of a just and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East" under the United Nations
Security Council resolutions 425 and 426 and the land-for-peace
principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and carved up a border strip as a
so-called "security zone" in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern
area from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas. The
U.N. Security Council adopted the two resolutions after the Israeli
invasion, demanding immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state decided earlier this year that it would pull
out from Lebanon by July 7. However, it completed withdrawal of
troops from south Lebanon at early hours on Wednesday, ending its
22-year occupation of the area.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Israeli Troop Withdrawal from All Arab Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said on Wednesday that he hopes the Israeli troop withdrawal from
Lebanon will pave the way for an overall Israeli pullout from all
occupied Arab lands and for a comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with Israeli Minister of Public
Security Shlom Ben-Ami, who arrived here earlier in the day to
brief the monarch on the situation on the Israeli-Lebanese border
after the pullout as well as developments of Israel's peace talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister said his country will adhere to its
commitments to the peace process and will strive to strike a
framework agreement of final peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed the need for a just, durable and comprehensive
peace in the region and called on the parties concerned to overcome
all obstacles standing in the peace talks and to work on peace,
stability and prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Jordanian house of deputies (lower house
of parliament) hailed the Israeli troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon as a liberation of Lebanese territories and a logical
result of 22 years of anti-aggression efforts by the Lebanese
people.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the Jordanian house also called on the
world community to pressure Israel to withdraw its troops from all
occupied Arab territories, including Palestinian lands and the
Golan Heights it captured from Syria during the 1967 Middle East
war, and to recognize an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel
and its Arab neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994, the second Arab country after Egypt to reach a peace deal
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces invaded and occupied southern Lebanon in 1978 to
prevent cross-border attacks and installed a 850-square-kilometer
security zone in south Lebanon for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Upon an order from Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the Jewish state
pulled out all its soldiers peacefully from south Lebanon by
Wednesday morning ahead of its self-imposed deadline in July.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that dramatic Israeli troop withdrawal is
partly due to mounting casualties under guerrilla attacks. Seven
Israeli soldiers died in the security zone this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Morocco Reiterate Support for Palestinians, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Morocco underlined their
full support on Wednesday to the Palestinian people's rights,
including their right to establish an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after a meeting of the Egyptian-
Moroccan Joint Higher Committee said the two countries oppose and
reject Israel's settlement policies in the occupied Palestinian
territories and its attempts to judaize Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that Israel's policies hinder the way to
the realization of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East, which the peoples in the region aspire for.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Moroccan King Mohammad VI
co-chaired the fourth session of the two countries' joint committee
on regional issues and ways of further promoting political and
economic cooperation. The Moroccan monarch wrapped up a three-day
official visit earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state. But Israel, which occupied that
part of the holy city in the 1967 Mideast War, has claimed
Jerusalem as its "undivided and eternal capital." The two sides are
working to solve the dispute, among other thorny issues, in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, Egypt and Morocco also voiced support
for Syria's legitimate right to recover the Golan Heights that
Israel occupied from Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel broke off their peace talks in January due to
disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the strategic plateau and
control of water resource.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Morocco called for adherence to the relevant United
Nations Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle by concerned parties in seeking peaceful settlement of
the decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> Upgrading of Proximity Talks on Cyprus Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cypriot AKEL party and Turkish
Cypriot Republic Party (TRP) Wednesday noted the need to upgrade
the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, AKEL leader Demetris
Christofias and TRP leader Ali Talat Wednesday held a three-hour
meeting at the AKEL headquarters in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued after the meeting warned that the loss
of time for a solution in Cyprus might pose serious dangers for
both communities.
</P>
<P>
It urged the present procedure of proximity talks to be upgraded
so that the talks become a substantive direct dialogue between the
leaders of the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two
communities have been held, with an aim to prepare the ground for
substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive solution of the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides put forward their positions and
gave clarifications, but there has been no negotiation as such.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks is scheduled to begin in Geneva on July
5.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique of AKEL and TRP called on the leaders of
the two communities to come to the negotiating table without any
conditions and to work decisively for a solution.
</P>
<P>
The two parties expressed their support to a peaceful solution
that will safeguard the independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty of the bizonal, bicommunal federal Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to continue working toward promoting contact
and restoration of trust between the two communities.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Says Priority Remains Unchanged on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday said that the priority remained unchanged to secure the
release of remaining U.N. peacekeepers, held by rebels in Sierra
Leone, and called on the rebels "immediately and unconditionally"
release all the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement prepared for the press by
the president of the Security Council, Wang Yingfan of China,
after the 15-nation Council met in a closed-door session to
discuss the latest developments in Sierra Leone, where hundreds of
U.N. soldiers are still being held by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
"Council members stressed that the clear priority continues to
be the release of the U.N. peacekeepers detained by the RUF," the
statement said. "Council members demand that the RUF release,
immediately and unconditionally, all remaining detainees."
</P>
<P>
"Council members expressed their grave concern at the reports
of the discovery of the bodies, possibly of U.N. peacekeepers, at
Rogberi junction, emphasized that the RUF is responsible for the
fate of these U.N. personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members call on all those with influence with the RUF
including (Liberian) President (Charles) Taylor to insist that
this take place forthwith," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members expressed their deep concern over the
humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone," the statement said. "
Council members reminded all States their obligations to implement
the arms embargo against the RUF and expressed their willingness
to consider further measures to strengthen the sanctions regime."
</P>
<P>
Council members were briefed on the latest developments in the
West African country by U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Hedi
Annabi, and the meeting was held shortly after U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan promised efforts to get the rest of the
detainees into freedom.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. Headquarters in New York
Wednesday, Annan told reporters, "We are all working hard."
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor, who mediated the release of
the detainees, said Wednesday that RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who
currently remains in the custody, needs to be involved in any
negotiation for the release of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that I did speak to President Taylor myself on the
release of the remaining detainees, and we are all working hard,
and, of course, he expects to be able to see some more of the
detainees released before the end of the week," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a meeting in Abuja -- West African heads
of state -- on Saturday," he said. "And of course, I would hope
that, by the time they meet, most of the peacekeepers will be in
freedom."
</P>
<P>
On the bodies that were found in U.N. uniform in bushes in
Sierra Leone, Annan said, "I have not gotten a detailed analysis
as to whether they are really some of our peacekeepers and what
they are, so I would prefer not to comment on that at this stage."
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his written report to the Security Council Monday,
called on the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to be
increased by 3,500 to 16,500 military personnel. This is the first
report by Annan on the situation in Sierra Leone since rebels took
U.N. peacekeepers hostage in early May.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to
increase personnel to 13,000.
</P>
<P>
The RUF abducted more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers and civilians
in early May. About 250 U.N. personnel are still being held
hostage in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Not to Play Role in Negotiating With Hostage Takers in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said Wednesday that U.N. Special Envoy Sergio de Mello would not
play any role in negotiating with the hostage takers in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
De Mello, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and
emergency relief coordinator and special envoy to East Timor, was
sent to Fiji by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
De Mello Wednesday visited Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and other senior officials who have been held captive
following the coup Friday.
</P>
<P>
De Mello also met George Speight, a businessmen, who leads the
hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
De Mello has asserted that the hostages should be released as
soon as possible and that Fiji should be returned to
constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Indians make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population of
813,000 while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry is Fuji's first ethnic Indian prime minister. Speight,
who launched his coup attempt Friday, accuses him of favoring the
country's economically dominant Indian minority.

<HEADLINE> Two Major U.S. Airlines to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, May 24 (Xinhua) -- UAL Corp., the largest airline
in the United States, has agreed to buy US Airways, the nation's
sixth-largest airline, for 4.3 billion U.S. dollars in cash, the
companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal would give the UAL Corp., parent company of the United
Airlines, vastly larger operations along the East Coast and nearly
triple its daily flights to more than 6,400 a day.
</P>
<P>
UAL will pay 60 dollars in cash for each US Airways share, a
131 percent premium over US Airways' closing price in trading
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cash, UAL Corp. will assume 7.3 billion
dollars in debt and aircraft operating leases as part of the deal.
A combined company would have more than 25 billion dollars in
annual revenue and more than 145,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The companies said their frequent-flier programs will be
consolidated, and will offer more destinations than any other
airline. United is part of the international Star Alliance, which
includes Air Canada and Lufthansa among others, and has a separate
mileage-sharing deal with Delta Airlines. US Airways and American
Airlines, the world's second-largest airline, have their own
mileage partnership.
</P>
<P>
With about 2,300 flights a day, United flies more than 570 jets
to more than 130 destinations in the United States and 25 other
countries. US Airways and the regional carrier US Airways Express
offer about 4,100 flights daily in 38 states and 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the deal, United said it would offer 64 new daily
nonstop domestic flights and 29 overseas flights.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines tried to merge in 1995, but failed after
United's powerful pilots' lobby exerted pressure. United is 55
percent owned by its employees; their approval will be necessary
for any deal to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Antitrust regulators may not let the acquisition go through
unscathed. The Justice Department has sued to challenge Northwest
Airlines' acquisition of a controlling stake in Continental
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, UAL will sell some operations in
Washington, D.C., to entrepreneur Robert L. Johnson, who will form
DC Air, the nation's first black-owned airline.

<HEADLINE> Nurses Stage Biggest Strike in Alberta, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of nurses Wednesday staged
the biggest strike across Canada's western province of Alberta to
press for a wage increase of at least 15 percent over two years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 licensed practical nurses, nursing attendants and
other support staff went off work at 159 hospitals and long-term
care facilities in the province following overnight negotiations
without results.
</P>
<P>
The local court termed the strike as illegal, saying the
Alberta Labor Relations Board filed a ruling Tuesday in the Court
of Queen's Bench ordering the union to stop planning or
threatening a strike.
</P>
<P>
A union leader was served a summons Wednesday morning for
disobeying the court order.
</P>
<P>
One of the parties involved in the negotiations, the Alberta
Union of Provincial Employees, vowed to go on striking for both
wages and job security.
</P>
<P>
The union asked for a wage increase of between 15 percent and
23 percent over two years, while management offered 12.2 percent
over three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contingency is being managed for urgent surgeries
including cancer and cardiac operations, local health officials
say.
</P>
<P>
The union has also promised to continue providing some
essential services to minimize the danger to patients.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A winter wave affecting Colombia,
mainly in its southern part, has caused 32 dead, according to a
report from rescue organizations released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and
Environmental Studies (IHMES) forecasted the reactivation of rains
all over the national territory.
</P>
<P>
Intense raining since last weekend affected the provinces of
Narino, Putumayo and Santander, and in the last hours Tolima and
other regions in the country as well, causing many casualties,
with 49 disappearing and 17,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
In Putumayo ,in the border with Peru and Ecuador, authorities
confirmed 14 people died and 18 disappeared. An initial balance
shows there are 2,4000 families affected and a surface of 1,900
hectares of cropland lost.
</P>
<P>
At Pasto, capital of Narino, other seven people lost their
lives because of the rain in the last hours. Last Sunday there
were 11 casualties.
</P>
<P>
The IHMES warned that the mathematical simulation models allow
to establish the increase in downpour in the departments of Nario,
Caldas, Quindio, Risaralda, Tolima, Antioquia, Choco, Santander,
North Santander, North Cundinamarca, West Boyaco and in the Valley
of Cauca.
</P>
<P>
The climate variations will bring with them the increase in
river flows of high slope, landslides, and debris accumulation in
some river basins.
</P>
<P>
Also, there are reports of high increases in the rivers Coello,
Luisa, Medina and Combeima (Tolima), in which there could be,
according to forecasts, floodings.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the level of the rivers Pasto, Narino,
Putumayo, Caqueta (south) and Catatumbo in North Santander
continues to rise.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dismisses Attacks on Its Coming Elections  </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling party Wednesday
dismissed as wild allegation a criticism by a U.S.-based
organization describing the election environment in the southern
African country unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
The National Chairman of the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) John Nkomo said the report
released last week by the U.S.- based National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs (NDI) was geared to smear the
Zimbabwean government and Zanu-pf.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo, also minister of the Local Government and National
Housing, said in a statement that the ruling party welcomed
impartial observers to oversees the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
He said it was however unfortunate that some pre-election
observers had rushed to blame Zimbabwe basing on the recent
negative reports by some foreign press units.
</P>
<P>
He said the NDI statement was not substantiated because it only
relied on information from the opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Environment Ministers Sign Biosafety Protocol in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Up to 50 environment ministers from
around the world signed here Wednesday at the headquarters of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) the Cartagena Protocol
on Biosafety.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Environment Minister Juan Mayr, who chaired the
Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties that finalized and adopted
the protocol in January 2000 in Montreal, was the first official
to sign the treaty on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The participation of ministers at the biodiversity conference
gives a strong political signal that governments are serious about
the conservation and sustainable use of the Earth's species,
ecosystems and genetic resources," said Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer of UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"By signing the Biosafety Protocol, the ministers will further
demonstrate that an effective regime for minimizing the potential
risks posed by the trade or accidental release of agricultural and
food products that have been genetically modified should soon
become a reality."
</P>
<P>
The goal of the protocol is to promote the safe transfer,
handling and use of living modified organisms resulting from
modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on the
conservation and potential risks to human health.
</P>
<P>
The protocol stipulates that the exporter must provide detailed
 information to each importing country about genetically modified
food in advance of the first shipment.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the current meeting, governments can sign the
protocol at the U.N. headquarters in New York between June 5 of
this year and June 4 of 2001. The protocol will enter into force
90 days after it has received 50 ratifications.
</P>
<P>
The international conference is being attended by some 1,500
delegates from 150 governments and 250 non-governmental
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Expansion of Trade Relations With Iran Proper: Turkish Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the tension in political
relations with Iran, Sermet Atacanli, deputy spokesman of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday that the forthcoming
visit of a Turkish trade delegation to Iran would be "appropriate".
</P>
<P>
A delegation of 100 businessmen headed by Undersecretary of
Foreign Trade Office Kursad Tuzmen will go to Iran on Saturday to
explore bilateral economic cooperation and attend a meeting of the
Border Trade Joint Committee which held a meeting in Turkey in last
May.
</P>
<P>
Due to the allegations about Iranian involvement in murders of
Turkish journalists and intellectuals, the Turkey Foreign Ministry
had earlier asked Tuzmen to review the decision to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry made the statement on the visit following
the Foreign Trade Office asked it to assess the political and trade
ties with Iran separately.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should develop trade relations with its neighbors
independent from its political relations," the Foreign Ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said, however, that they have not issued an official
statement over whether President Ahmet Sezer will attend the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) meeting to be held in
Tehran on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Both countries will benefit from good bilateral relations, the
spokesman said, adding that "certainly there are some issues which
are sensitive for Turkey. We expect the Iranian side to show the
same sensitivity towards them."
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Turkish police had arrested nine Islamic
activists recently, and some Turkish press accused Iran of being
involved in the killing of two Turkish journalists in 1993 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said that detained Iranians who entered Turkey
did not have passports, denying that they were implicated in the
murder cases.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry Sunday strongly condemned the arrests of
some Iranian nationals by Turkish police.

<HEADLINE> More Iraqi POWs Return Home From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of 460 Iraqi prisoners
of war (POWs), freed by Iran on Tuesday, have arrived in Iraq,
following the release of 480 Iraqi POWs on May 4, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the Iraqi-Iranian border, hundreds of people, most of them
family members of the POWs, waited to welcome the home-coming POWs.
</P>
<P>
Upon setting foot on the Iraqi soil, many POWs knelt down on the
ground and kissed the soil. They seemed exhausted, but the joyful
reunion with their family members made them in high spirits, the
INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government is making its best efforts to take care of
the returned POWs. After a medical examination, each POW will be
given daily necessities including food and a sum of money for
resettlement, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Iran will repatriate some 1,000 Iraqi
POWs, in two waves, at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expressed hope that the unilateral move will help solve
the POWs issue, one of the major hurdles on the way of
normalization of the Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
Iran released a total of 2,479 Iraqi POWs between April 8 and
May 4, but Iraq says almost 9,000 more are still being held in
Iran, apart from almost 20,000 not registered with the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
According to Baghdad, it holds no more Iranian POWs, but Tehran
says 3,206 Iranian POWs are still held in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs is a key stumbling block on the way of the
normalization of ties between the two former foes which fought a
bloody war from 1980 to 1988.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian House Welcomes "Liberation" of South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's House of Representatives
(lower house of parliament) on Wednesday extended its warmest
congratulations to Lebanon after Israel completely withdrew its
troops from south Lebanon earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
It termed the withdrawal as a liberation of Lebanese territories
and a logical result of the 22-year-long efforts by the Lebanese
people against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the house also called on the international
community to pressure Israel to withdraw its troops from all
occupied Arab territories, including Palestinian lands and the
Golan Heights it captured from Syria during the 1967 Middle East
war, and to recognize an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The statement also reaffirmed Jordan's support for Lebanon to
regain its territories in accordance with U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, which calls for an immediate and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces invaded and occupied southern Lebanon in 1978 and
set up a 850-square-kilometer security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a self-proclaimed aim to protect its northern borders
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Upon an order from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the Jewish
state pulled out all its soldiers peacefully from south Lebanon by
Wednesday morning, ahead of its self-imposed deadline of July 7.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here believe that such an unexpectedly hasty
Israeli troop withdrawal was partly due to mounting casualties
inflicted on Israeli soldiers by guerrilla attacks. Seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed this year during clashes with Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The statement also voiced the 80-member house's support for the
efforts by Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein to work on a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
For years, the kingdom has been a major peace broker between
Israel and its Arab neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with
Israel in 1994, the second Arab country reaching a peace deal with
the Jewish state.

CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan King Mohammed VI left Cairo
for the Tunisian capital of Tunis on Wednesday, winding up a three-
day official visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mohammed VI held talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on regional issues, particularly Arab cooperation and
solidarity in political and economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders co-chaired the fourth session of the Egyptian-
Moroccan Joint Higher Committee, which discussed ways of dealing
with basic shortcomings regarding the balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders expressed their countries' readiness to step up
efforts to further enhance bilateral economic and trade cooperation
in a bid to promote the annual trade volume to 100 million U.S.
dollars from the current 37 million dollars, especially after the
signing of the free trade agreement in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Mohammed VI witnessed the signing of six cooperation
agreements Tuesday on the sidelines of the committee meeting. One
of the agreements committed the two countries to expanding the list
of tariff-free goods exchanged within the framework of the free
trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rest five agreements cover bilateral cooperation in housing,
environment, quality specifications and other fields.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Receives Letter From Russia on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
received a letter from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about
the relations between Russia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The letter was conveyed to the Iraqi president by Nikolai
Khorotzeiv, the visiting special envoy of Russian President
Vladimir Putin, during their meeting held here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter touched upon ways to develop the bilateral relations
and promote the long-term friendship between the two countries, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Putin expressed Russia's stance to continue to
call for the lifting of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq since
1990, and extended his personal thanks to the Iraqi president for
congratulating his victory in the Russian presidential election in
March.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, Saddam sent a congratulatory telegram to Vladimir
Putin on his election as the new Russian President, and expressed
the hope that Iraq and Russia can strengthen the existing mutual
friendship and fruitful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saddam thanked the Russian president for the
letter, saying Iraq has long been looking for establishing strong
strategic ties with Russia as well as bilateral cooperation in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Saddam wished Putin success in leading Russia, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a close ally and important trade partner of Iraq, has
been calling for the lifting of the embargo on Iraq and the end to
the almost-daily aggressions by U.S. and British warplanes over
northern and southern Iraq since December 1998, when the U.S. and
Britain launched the Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Qatar to Resume Work of Joint Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain and Qatar agreed in the
Bahraini capital of Manama on Wednesday to resume the work of a
joint committee formed late last year to deal with bilateral issues
including the border dispute between the two Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
"Work of the Joint Supreme Committee will be resumed after the
International Court of Justice made a final ruling over the border
dispute," said a communique issued after talks between Bahraini
Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Issa Al-Khalifa and his visiting Qatari
counterpart Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani in Manama.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Al-Thani went to Bahrain earlier Wednesday, perhaps
in response to calls by Gulf mediators Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) to restore peaceful cooperation in solving
their dispute.
</P>
<P>
Doha and Manama are at present locked in a dispute over several
small but potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf isles, including the
Hawar islands, which are controlled by Bahrain since 1930s but also
claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been taken to the International Court of Justice
in Hague, the Netherlands, pending a verdict.
</P>
<P>
During the Qatari emir's last visit to Manama in December 1999,
the two Gulf neighbors agreed to set up the supreme committee to
try to settle the border dispute through cordial means.
</P>
<P>
They agreed the case will be withdrawn if an "acceptable
solution is reached by the joint committee before the court's
verdict."
</P>
<P>
But Bahrain announced last Friday that the "work of the
committee has been suspended after Qatar referred the issue to the
Hague international court and that it did not receive any positive
response from Qatar over the recommendations made to solve the
border dispute."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, which prefers a bilateral compromise solution,
considered the Qatar's reference to the court as stepping over the
mediation efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
</P>
<P>
However, a statement by Qatari Foreign Ministry said on Monday
that its demand for the court to resolve the dispute "did not
jeopardize the mediations by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to the International Court of Justice was in line
with the agreements of 1987 and 1990, which was signed by the two
countries as part of the Saudi mediation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Doha insisted that the "major objective of the committee was not
to solve the border dispute, but really managed to realize many
achievements."
</P>
<P>
Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have expressed concern over the
new quarrel between Qatar and Bahrain and urged the two small
emirates to resort to peaceful means to overcome their differences.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that during the meeting, the two
emirs discussed ways of maintaining their solid bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad Al-Thani also invited the Bahraini emir to visit
Qatar.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Woos Russia As Strategic Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) are "strategic partners, not enemies," NATO
Secretary-General George Robertson told a leading Russian
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance are
steaming ahead and the two sides will continue developing ties
step by step," said Robertson in an exclusive interview with the
Russian newspaper Izvestia on the eve of a meeting of the Russia-
NATO Permanent Joint Council, which started in Italy's resort-city
of Florence Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the work of the council would bring substantial
results of peace and opening a NATO information center in Moscow
will be a very important step for normalizing relations between
Russia and the alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO adopted a new strategic concept last year and Russia
ratified a new military doctrine early this year. This has caused
some misunderstandings between the two sides, said Robertson,
noting that it makes sense for the two sides to conduct a dialogue,
putting questions to each other.
</P>
<P>
"The more we explain these 'misunderstandings' to each other,
the better we shall strengthen security," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, before attending the Russia-NATO Council
meeting in Florence, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Moscow will gradually unfreeze its ties with NATO under the U.N.
Charter and the Russia-NATO Founding Act tenets.
</P>
<P>
Russia's decision to unfreeze relations with NATO coincides
with the interests of European security, he said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in principle on the opening of a NATO information
bureau in Moscow will be announced at the end of the Russia-NATO
Permanent Council session, the Interfax news agency cited sources
close to Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO have thus far been at odds over the future
center's status and its tasks. NATO had suggested granting the
center the status of a diplomatic mission, but Russia insists that
its opening be legitimized by letter exchanges between the sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian and NATO experts had conducted consultations
on the issue in the run-up to the council session, and a
compromise has probably been reached, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
After NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia last year, Moscow froze
contacts with the alliance and the council sessions have been
suspended for 17 months.

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Killed, 10 Wounded in Chechnya: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 rebels and at least one
Russian serviceman were killed with another ten federal solders
wounded Wednesday in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya,
according to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 militants were killed and their six motor vehicles were
destroyed in the Sharoi-Argun Gorge in southern Chechnya during a
special operation by the Russian forces at around 2 p.m. (1100 GMT)
Wednesday, said Col.Gen. Gennady Troshev, commander of the Russian
forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
A federal reconnaissance group spotted a convoy of 13 trucks of
Chechen rebels advancing toward the gorge on an alpine road from
the west to the east, and launched an attack on the convoy. Twenty-
plus rebels were killed, and a truck and five cars were destroyed,
Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, a federal paratrooper was killed and another
10 were wounded when their army vehicle belonging to the 104th
airborne regiment struck a landmine near the town of Engenoi in
Chechnya, said the Russian forces' headquarters in the North
Caucasus.

<HEADLINE> Annan Backs OAU Efforts to Bring Peace to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday voiced his "strong support" for the diplomatic
efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to end the
current fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and restore peace
in the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by Annan's spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General wishes to state his strong support for the
efforts of the Chairman of the OAU, (Algerian) President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, who is currently in Addis Ababa," capital of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"He hopes that President Bouteflika's initiative will swiftly
lead to an end to the fighting, the restoration of the status quo
ante of May 6, 1998, and the resumption of a process which will
bring a lasting end by peaceful means to the current dispute
between Eritrea and Ethiopia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts to end the border war in the region
intensified Wednesday with both sides urged to withdraw from all
the land seized in two years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to increase the diplomatic pressure on both sides,
Bouteflika flew to Addis Ababa Wednesday and officials said he
might travel to Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have previously agreed to the idea
of withdrawing troops from occupied territories, declaring a cease-
fire and opening formal talks on fixing their border.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries resumed fighting on May 12 after the
collapse of peace talks in Algeria under the OAU auspices. The two-
year border war has already claimed tens of thousands of lives and
famine threats a combined nine million people in both countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends UNDOF Mandate Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday recommended the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a further
period of six months until November 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the United Nations Security Council,
Annan said the situation in the Golan heights continued to be "
potentially dangerous" and would likely remain so until a
comprehensive settlement was reached on all aspects of the Middle
East problems.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the situation in the Force's area of operations
remained quiet over the past six months, although minefields
continue to pose a threat to U.N. personnel and local inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire in the Israeli-Syrian sector held during the
reporting period and the parties continued to cooperate with the
UNDOF, but both sides still denied U.N. inspection teams to some
positions and have restricted the Force's freedom of movement,
Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to the shortfall of some 17 million U.S.
dollars in funding for the Force, Annan appealed to Member States
to pay their assessments and arrears promptly.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF, which was established in May 1974 to supervise the
cease-fire called for by the Security Council and the agreement on
disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces of May 31, 1974,
has continued to perform its function effectively, with the
cooperation of the parties.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Have Frank, Rich Dialogue: Ivanov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov described Wednesday's dialogue with his counterparts
from NATO nations as "frank and rich."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who was attending the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council (PJC) at ministerial level, told the press after the
meeting that Wednesday's meeting confirmed the preparedness of
both sides to implement the Founding Act that is of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat disclosed that almost all at the table of
Wednesday's PJC spoke in favor of dialogue between NATO and Russia
and of concerted efforts to normalize relations.
</P>
<P>
When asked what can be regarded as a normalized relationship
between the Western military alliance and its former Cold War foe ,
NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that a progress in
the exchange of information for the people on the two sides can be
considered as normal.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia discussed and agreed Wednesday to open a NATO
liaison office in Moscow. The opening of the liaison office was
required by the Founding Act that was signed in October 1997 in
Paris. Russia has set up a permanent presence in Brussels, where
the NATO has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that the NATO-Russia relations are the
important core of the Founding Act though the two sides
experienced a "tough year."
</P>
<P>
NATO-Russian ties broke down after the Western military
alliance brushed aside Russian opposition to air strike the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia last year. Russia recalled its
Brussels-based diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to re-establish relations, Robertson went to
Moscow in February this year and tried to talk Russia back into
dialogue with his institution.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister, who remained in the government of
newly elected President Vladimir Putin, attributed Russia's slight
of duty to detain the visiting Yugoslav defense minister to a
technical glitch among different government departments.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had already notified the Hague-based
International Tribunal for War Criminals of the former Yugoslavia
and the tribunal had already accepted the explanation.
</P>
<P>
But Ivanov said that he was not satisfied with the performance
of the tribunal and planned to bring the issue up to the United
Nations Security Council for discussion.
</P>
<P>
When asked to pinpoint his dissatisfaction, the Russian foreign
minister said that the tribunal had rather become a political tool
and was not acting objectively in indicting war criminals and even
went it alone in striking a deal with NATO in 1996 on arresting
the indicted.
</P>
<P>
"I do not rule out the possibility of bringing the issue to the
United Nations Security Council," said the Russian through an
interpreter. He cited as examples of prejudice against the Serbs
facts that the lion's share of the indicted war criminals from the
Balkans are Serbs and that most sitting on the Hague tribunal are
from the West and the United States.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the planned communal elections should be
postponed in Kosovo due to the slow return of ethnic Serbs, Ivanov
said that it was a matter of serious concern in that there was not
too much return of non-Albanian refugees to the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are now below 100,000 Kosovo Serbs whereas
formally there had been more than 250,000 Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov accused NATO of lacking the interest in safeguarding the
return of Serbs to Kosovo though NATO foreign ministers promised
Wednesday to act to safeguard the ethnic groups from acts of
violence by Kosovo Albanian extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister urged full implementation of
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 that requires
respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Portugal Decision to Extradite Serial Killer Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- France hailed the decision made by
the Supreme Court of Portugal Wednesday to confirm the extradition
toward France of a 20-year-old Frenchman suspect of having killed
three women.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Portugal confirmed Wednesday the decision
by an appeal court to extradite Sid Ahmed Rezala, who is suspected
to have killed a British student, a French student and a young
mother from October to December 1999 in France.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Justice Elisabeth Guigou said that she was
delighted at the decision of the Portuguese Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
However, the extradition can still be delayed by an appeal by
Rezala's lawyer to the Constitutional Tribune of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Rezala, a French citizen of Algerian origin, is the number one
suspect in the murders of Isabel Peake, Corinne Cailaux and Emilie
Bazin.
</P>
<P>
The body of Peake, a 20-year-old British student, was found by
the side of a railway linking Paris with the central city of
Limoges on October 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, Caillaux, 36, was found killed in the toilet of
a night train when it stopped at the city of Dijon in eastern
France. She was traveling with her four-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
The body of Bazin, a 20-year-old French student, was found in
the cave of a house in Amiens, northern France, on December 17,
after she disappeared for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The robot-portrait of the suspect made by police corresponds to
the same man who was identified as Rezala by police.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with the Figaro Magazine earlier this
month, Rezala admitted having killed the three women.

military exercise in Portugal this October or November.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shamuyarira, who is also Secretary for Information and
Publicity of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf), was responding to a recent report published in a
London newspaper which said a group of British and American
politicians and businessmen were funding the opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) to topple President Mugabe' s
government from power.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the information being spread to other western
 countries by Britain was biased against Zimbabwe and Zanu-pf in
particular.
</P>
<P>
"These countries preach democracy but they take a position
before gathering facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Zimbabwe and Britain were at their lowest ebb
because of the controversial land redistribution program in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has said despite international
criticisms of the program, his government would go ahead and
compulsorily acquire land from the country's 4,500 white-owned
commercial farmers to resettle landless Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The white farmers own 70 percent of fertile land in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Britain has warned Mugabe to carry out the program fairly or
else risk losing critical foreign aid.

JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Police
Commissioner Jackie Selebi Wednesday said implementing section 49
of the Criminal Procedure Act, which restricts the police's rights
in making arrests, was not suitable for his country on the current
stage.
</P>
<P>
Briefing South African Parliament's select committee on
security, Selebi said section 49 restricted police officers from
defending themselves against armed attacks.
</P>
<P>
Selebi said the fact that a large number of police members had
been killed in the line of duty this year showed the country was
not yet ready for such measures.
</P>
<P>
It was inappropriate to compare South Africa with countries
such as Canada and Sweden, where the rate of violent crime was far
lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has
been calling for the promptly taking into effect of the new
section 49.

MAPUTO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- French Cooperation Minister Charles
Josselin said in Maputo on Wednesday that France will make efforts
to revive the agreement between the European Union and the ACP
(Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) group countries when it takes over
the EU rotating presidency from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of a two day visit
to Mozambique, Josselin said that France would try to persuade
other European countries to take an interest in the southern
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that all European countries should concern
themselves with Africa", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was great lack of trust between the north
and the south, as exemplified by recent demonstrations in Seattle
and in Washington, against such northern-dominated institutions as
the World Trade Organization, the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Europe "has a role to play in restoring this
trust".
</P>
<P>
Josselin also met with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano,
with whom he discussed bilateral cooperation, the conflicts in the
Great Lakes region, and the situation in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chissano had assured him that the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), which Chissano is currently
chairing, will play an important role in solving the Zimbabwean
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Josselin hoped there would be a speedy return to stability and
peace in Zimbabwe, since the conflict there would also affect its
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets Up Land Compensation Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government on
Wednesday amended the Land Acquisition Act and established a
Compensation Committee to determine the compensation for land
acquired for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The government said in an extraordinary gazette that the
compensation would be paid for improvements on or to the land.
</P>
<P>
The compensation could be paid in a lump sum, in installments,
in cash, in bonds or other securities issued by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Committee will take into account the age, nature and
condition of the improvements on or to the land, in assessing the
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"Compensation shall be payable for dams, dips, fencing, bore
holes, irrigation equipment," said the government, adding, "in
valuing perennial or plantation crops, regard shall be made to the
potential yield of such crops and their marketability."
</P>
<P>
The compensation will also be paid for any other improvements
on or to the land that have enhanced its value for agricultural
purposes, according to the gazette.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government is under great pressure recently to
start redistributing the land following invasions into white-owned
commercial farms by war veterans during the past months.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe government had already announced that the land
redistribution program would kick off before the country's
parliamentary elections to be held at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
At least 4,500 white farmers own more than 70 percent of arable
land in the southern African country, while majority of the
country's 12.5 million people squashing in other unproductive
land.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday met in a closed-door session to discuss the latest
developments in Sierra Leone, where hundreds of U.N. soldiers are
still being held by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The meeting came shortly after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan promised efforts to get the rest of the detainees into
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, Annan
told reporters, "We are all working hard."
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor, who mediated the release of
the detainees, said Wednesday that RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who
currently remains in the custody, needs to be involved in any
negotiation for the release of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that I did speak to President Taylor myself on the
release of the remaining detainees, and we are all working hard,
and, of course, he expects to be able to see some more of the
detainees released before the end of the week," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a meeting in Abuja -- West African heads
of state -- on Saturday," he said. "And of course, I would hope
that, by the time they meet, most of the peacekeepers will be in
freedom."
</P>
<P>
On the bodies that were found in U.N. uniform in bushes in
Sierra Leone, Annan said, "I have not gotten a detailed analysis
as to whether they are really some of our peacekeepers and what
they are, so I would prefer not to comment on that at this stage."
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his written report to the Security Council Monday,
called on the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to be
increased by 3,500 to 16,500 military personnel. This is the first
report by Annan on the situation in Sierra Leone since rebels took
U.N. peacekeepers hostage in early May.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to
increase personnel to 13,000.
</P>
<P>
The RUF abducted more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers and civilians
in early May. About 250 U.N. personnel are still being held
hostage in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> Sensex Down on Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index (Sensex)
dropped slightly on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Wednesday as a
late selling spree cut short an attempted brief rally in share
value.
</P>
<P>
The BSE 30-share Sensitive Index opened sharply down at 3,872.7
from Tuesday's close of 3,943.54 and declined to an intra-day low
of 3,840.11. However, emergence of buying in traditional companies
from domestic institutions later pushed up the Sensex to the day's
high of 3,981.46, before ending at 3,933.65, netting a moderate
loss of 9.89 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index eased by 2.19 points to 1,943.69.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 index and the Dollex were quoted at 422.09 and 159.
42, little changed from Tuesday's close of 422.6 and 159.98
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-500 index, however, edged up by 0.57 points to 1,281.61.

<HEADLINE> Norway, India Discuss Sri Lankan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Norway, which is playing the role
of a facilitator to broker peace in strife-torn Sri Lanka,
discussed Wednesday with India various options for the solution of
the current crisis in the Jaffna peninsula, including New Delhi's
evacuation of Sri Lankan troops from Jaffna and extending of
humanitarian assistance to the island nation, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
"All different options are there," Norwegian special envoy Eric
Solheim was quoted as saying after his hour-long meeting with
Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Solheim, who has visited Sri Lanka and India twice recently,
said the Norwegian and Indian sides exchanged views on the
evolving situation in Sri Lanka, but declined to elaborate on what
transpired at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have informed India what we are doing and they have
informed us about their planning and thinking," he simply said.
</P>
<P>
However, Solheim said he believed that India's importance in
the solution of the Sri Lankan crisis was "paramount," and that
India has given "most positive encouragement" to Norway's role of
a low-key facilitator.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was carrying any formal message from Colombo
to New Delhi, Solheim said: "We have no formal request to hand
over. Governments of India and Sri Lanka are closely in touch all
the time and there is no need for them to communicate through
Norway."
</P>
<P>
While declining to make any specific comment on whether there
had been any substantial breakthrough for a cease-fire to end the
conflict between Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Solheim told the reporters that a lot of "
different options" have been discussed.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever we can to find a solution in the peninsula
and also to find a long-term settlement of Tamil aspirations," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> India, U.S. Oppose Change in Fiji Government Through Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States said
Wednesday that they categorically oppose any change in the
government of Fiji through violence, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Fijian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry being
taken hostage by businessman George Speight was discussed during
wide-ranging talks between Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh
and visiting U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
Thomas Pickering here Wednesday, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi and Washington maintained that the democratically-
elected government in Fiji should be supported and "changes in
government through violence was no solution of problems," the PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
Mansingh and Pickering were quoted as saying after their
meeting that both of them were in principle against "individuals
being held hostage at gun-point."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore Shares Dip Further on Bleak Prospects  by Wang Xiangjiang, Zhu Changdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore technology shares
Wednesday further dragged down the broad market for the fifth
consecutive day under double pressure from U.S. interest rates
worries and slack regional markets.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) slipped
33.84 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,871.94, the lowest in 13 months
and below the 1,900-point psychological barrier.
</P>
<P>
Most other key Asian markets such as Tokyo, South Korea and
Taiwan also retreated after the Dow Jones Average tumbled 120.28
points overnight while the tech-laden Nasdaq fell 5.93 percent to
its lowest level this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the region will not see a soothing nerve in the
near term as investors are taking cue more from the direction of U.
S.interest rates than from their local economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"The regional sentiment will not possibly be warmed up if there
are no comforting signals coming from the U.S. Federal Reserve,"
said an analyst with a local brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Upcoming U.S. indicators such as average hourly earnings and
payrolls to be released next month are believed to be able to shed
light on the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee's
meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors should not worry too much about the
prospect of global stock markets on the back of strong U.S.
economic fundamentals and recovery in European and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Investors, however, should not expect an excellent performance
on the broad market before 2001, they added.
</P>
<P>
On the Singapore stock market, the electronics index was among
the hardest hit -- down about 15 points in the last five weeks --
as fund managers are retreating from technology counters to blue
chips with strong underlying fundamentals such as Singapore
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that if the U.S. stock market does not regain at
least some ground, the STI will likely slip further under fund
selling.
</P>
<P>
The STI has shed more than 600 points from the 2,479.58-point
level at the end of 1999 when many analysts predicted a rosy
outlook for Singapore shares to reach a peak as high as 3,000.
</P>
<P>
At present, however, some market watchers began to strike a
relatively pessimistic note, saying the broad market may end up
hovering around the 1,700-point and a major recovery may be seen
not until early next year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Southern Air Command on Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Air Command of the
Indian Air Force (IAF) is in full alert and preparedness to meet
any eventuality arising out of the Sri Lankan crisis, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) quoted IAF sources as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources were quoted as saying preparations were in full
swing as Sri Lanka was barely 30 minutes by air from
Thiruvananthapuram, a major IAF air-base in South India's Kerala
State.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government announced Tuesday that it was ready to
help evacuate an estimated 30,000 Sri Lankan troops trapped in
Jaffna peninsula provided there was a formal request from the Sri
Lankan government under some "proper conditions."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government troops have been fighting rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who launched attacks to take
back Jaffna, their former stronghold.
</P>
<P>
A PTI report Tuesday said ships of India's Eastern Naval
Command and transport planes of the IAF would be involved in any
possible evacuation missions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian Navy and Air Force Wednesday continued
their joint surveillance of the coastal areas of two southern
states, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
Indian Air Chief Marshal A. Y. Tipnis also arrived in
Thiruvananthapuram Wednesday to inaugurate a three-day conference
of station commanders under the Southern Air Command.
</P>
<P>
Although the air chief's visit was claimed to be "long planned
and scheduled" and have nothing to do with the Sri Lankan crisis,
it assumed significance against the backdrop of the current
situation in Sri Lanka, the PTI asserted.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the conference, Tipnis asked
the staff of the Southern Air Command to be on full alert to face
any eventuality and threat.
</P>
<P>
The general expressed concern over the increasing threat of
terrorism and stressed the vital role of the air force in meeting
various security challenges, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
He also assured total support for all projects initiated by the
Southern Air Command to upgrade infrastructure facilities to meet
operational challenges, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says His Recommendations on Lebanon Stand on Their Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Wednesday that his recommendations on reinforcing U.N.
forces in southern Lebanon stand on their own and the work the
United Nations did with the parties concerned in the Middle East
prior to Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon is still useful
for what is happening in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to the conclusion of Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon. According to reports reaching here, the
last of Israel's soldiers in southern Lebanon returned to home
Wednesday, ending a military occupation that spanned 22 years.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the Israeli withdrawal will be to the line that
we have indicated, so that in itself will be useful," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to work with the Lebanese Government in assuring
their own control over the territory and maintain peace in that
part of the region," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the law and order functions belong to the
Government of Lebanon, not to us," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is quite possible that we will still put in additional
peacekeepers to calm the situation for a while, once we have the
assurances that I've asked for from all the parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And then, of course, once the situation is settled and
Lebanon has assumed its full territorial responsibility, the
peacekeepers will withdraw, our work would have been done," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in touch with the troop contributors about deploying. We
still first have to certify the withdrawal of Israeli troops to
the international border, or the line as determined by us, and
then work with the member states to get the reinforcements in,"
Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Annan submitted a report to the Security Council Monday,
recommending that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (
UNIFIL) be reinforced in order to carry out its responsibilities
under Resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the total troop strength for carrying out the tasks
related to confirming the withdrawal of Israeli troops would thus
increase from the present Level of 4,513 to approximately 5,600.
</P>
<P>
Once the Israeli withdrawal is confirmed and if the security
situation permits, the force of the UNIFIL would have to be
immediately increased to 7,935 personnel.
</P>
<P>
The report also contains the minimum conditions and
requirements which must be met if Resolution 425 is to be
implemented fully and without conditions and if the United Nations
is to be in a position to fulfill its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Israel informed the United Nations in April that it would
complete withdrawal of all its troops from southern Lebanon by
July.

<HEADLINE> Senegal to Continue Cooperation With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade
said here on Wednesday that the new government of Senegal will
maintain its traditional cooperation with France.
</P>
<P>
Wade, who is on a visit to France until May 28, made the
remarks after a dinner with French President Jacques Chirac at the
Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit is to seek more efficient cooperation
between Senegal and France in all fields as well as more private
investment by French enterprises in Senegal, said Senegalese
officials.
</P>
<P>
Wade took over power in Senegal on March 19 after defeating his
rival, President Abdou Diouf, in the elections.
</P>
<P>
France, which is the biggest donor country of Senegal with an
annual public aid package of 840 million francs (110 million U.S.
dollars), is bidding for new projects in Senegal, including the
construction of a new international airport in Dakar, the
repairing of the railway between Dakar and Bamako in Mali and the
building of new hospitals.
</P>
<P>
France is also the biggest trade partner of Senegal, with the
export to the country reaching 2.9 billion francs (310 million U.S.
dollars) and the import from it hitting 791 million francs (110
million U.S. dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Join U.N. Peacekeeping in Lebanon: Jospin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said on Wednesday that France is ready to take its responsibility
in the United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Jospin said that the U.N. must obtain "concrete commitment"
from all the three countries involved in the conflict -- Israel,
Syria and Lebanon -- on providing indispensable security
guarantees for the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
When answering questions at the National Assembly, Jospin said
that if the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFL) is to
be re-deployed, it should be done in a very short period of time.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the ultimate objective of the mission will be
to help the Lebanese government restore its authority in the
former Israeli-imposed security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced on Wednesday that its troops have completed
pullout from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France has 250 soldiers participating in the UNIFL, which is
expected to be reinforced from the present 4,500 men to 7,935 when
it is re-deployed.
</P>
<P>
"If all the conditions are met, (U.N. Secretary-General) Kofi
Annan knows that he can count on the determination of France to
engage itself in serving the cause of a lasting peace in the
region," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
He said that Annan should first "certify" that Israel has
pulled out of troops in conformity with the U.N. Resolution 425,
before the UNIFL is re-deployed.
</P>
<P>
"Before engaging ourselves on this road, we will study the
situation in the field and the guarantees that all the sides are
ready to give," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Minority Groups Vulnerable to Violence: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, May 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Wednesday admitted
that minority groups in Kosovo remain vulnerable to acts of
violence by Albanian extremists.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 19 NATO member states concluded
after their council meeting that the protection of ethnic groups
and minorities in the Yugoslav province is still the most
challenging issue for the NATO-led peacekeeping force (KFOR) and
the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 Kosovo Serbs
stayed in Kosovo after the 78-day NATO air strikes last year that
aimed at forcing the Serbian security forces out of the province.
Kosovo Albanians have been the ethnic majority in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn all acts of violence, be they ethnically,
politically or criminally motivated," the NATO foreign ministers
concluded.
</P>
<P>
"We commend KFOR's robust actions to deal with extremists from
all sides and provide security and protection to members of all
ethnic groups and minorities," the ministers added.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance also expressed support for the U.
N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to intensify its fight against
organized crimes, arms trafficking, illegal possession of weapons
and trafficking in women.
</P>
<P>
Most of these crimes are reported to be linked with Albanian
extremists.
</P>
<P>
"We commend KFOR and UNMIK for progress achieved in their joint
efforts to promote co-existence in a united and secure Mitrovica,"
said the foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, was once a flare-up point
of inter-ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
NATO also expressed concerns about continued violence and
instability in the area adjacent to the internal boundary between
Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers said that KFOR will act firmly against
those who wish to use Kosovo as a base from which to export
violence.
</P>
<P>
"We regard any unrest or instability in these areas as a threat
to our efforts to establish peace and stability throughout the
region," it said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians have allegedly sneaked across the internal
boundary into Serbia to stir instability on the other side by
fermenting ethnic hatred among local Albanian residents and by
smuggling weapons there.

<HEADLINE> Missile System More for American Dominance: Canadian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The controversial ballistic missile
defense system being proposed by the United State is more about
solidifying American power than about protecting against "rogue
nations," Canadian military planners say.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported Wednesday that the
country's Department of National Defense policy officials believe
the threat posed by the so-called "rogue nations" is secondary to
the main aim of ballistic missile defense.
</P>
<P>
"Arguably (it is) more in order to preserve U.S./NATO freedom
of action," the newspaper quoted briefing documents prepared for a
closed-door military meeting in November in Ottawa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The briefing notes also point out that the U.S. will have
trouble getting all its allies on side to support a missile system
to protect North America, as there is concern that the shield will
violate existing arms treaties with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The documents suggest that Canadian participation in the
national missile shield is more about maintaining good relations
with the U.S. than it is about protecting Canada.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way to assign senior Canadian officers
to the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in Washington,
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Art Eggleton and military officials continue
to hold that the Canadian forces is doing no work, beyond basic
research and information gathering, on the American missile shield.
</P>
<P>
They insist no decision has been officially made by the
Canadian government about whether to sign on to the American
scheme, the newspaper said.

<P>
WUHAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred delegates from United
Nations organizations, foreign government missions, international
consortia and multinationals today attended a fund-raiser here to
secure funding for sustainable development projects.
</P>
<P>
The event is part of the ongoing sustainable development
management program in Wuhan, in central China's Hubei province,
which receives aid from United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The scheme has been implemented in this central China city for
three years.
</P>
<P>
Today's gathering was designed to raise 8.3 billion yuan (about
one billion U.S. dollars) for building in the city 27 major
sustainable development projects in four areas -- environmental
protection, harnessing of ground water pollution, air pollution,
and garbage treatment.
</P>
<P>
Douglas McCallum, an expert with U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (UNCHS), said he was pleased to see Wuhan's
development project had matured so well in the three years it has
been in effect.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sustainable Cities Program (SCP), a program for
demonstrating technical aid, jointly promoted by UNCHS and the U.N.
Environmental Program (UNEP) since 1996, has been carried out in
more than 30 cities around the world, including Wuhan and Shenyang
of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
SCP wants to put sustainable development strategy in place in
cities worldwide by stepping up environmental control, and
coordinating the relationship between environmental and economic
development in these places.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Natural Gas Development in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese oil expert has
predicted China's proven gas reserve will increase by an annual
average of 120 billion cu m between 2001 and 2020, with gas
utilization accounting for eight percent of China's energy
consumption instead of the present two percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yaowen, vice-president of the China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC), said here today that the country's annual gas output will
hit anything between 110 billion cu m and 130 billion cu m in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
And by 2020, China will produce 100 billion cubic meters of gas,
equivalent to 100 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going seminar on China's energy development
strategy in the 21st century, Wu said that China will give
priority to the development of natural gas in its energy strategy
in the 21st century, which will be concentrated in the rich gas-
bearing regions in the western parts of the country, including the
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, Sichuan province and the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin in northwest China, the site of
China's largest gas field, has so far verified gas reserves of
nearly 309.8 billion cu, ranking among the world's 80 largest gas
fields.
</P>
<P>
About 100 billion cubic meters of gas reserves have been proven
in the eastern part of southwest China's Sichuan province, which
shows the enormous potential for further gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
And large gas production bases are taking shape in the basins
of Turpan-Hami, Junggar and Tarim in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, China will speed up construction of gas
pipelines in both western and eastern China, which extend from gas
production bases in western China to the economically developed
regions of North China, Northeast China, and the delta areas of
the Yangtze River and the Pearl River.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands to Aid Nature Reserve at Mt.Qomolangma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Netherlands' ambassador to China Aer
Ooster said here today that his government has approved 2.5
million US dollars in funding for a nature reserve project at Mt.
Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
The project proposal was submitted to the Netherlands'
government four years ago by an American institute which
researches mountain ecology. The plan is to help local people
protect the environment and raise their living standard.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, a group of experts in resource management
and forestry will be trained for work in the reserve, and a public
awareness campaign on environmental protection will be launched.
In addition, local enterprises will get financial and technical
support for their development.
</P>
<P>
The national nature reserve at Mt. Qomolangma covers an area of
more than 33,000 square kilometers on the north slope of the
Himalayas. Of the 82,000 residents in the region, over 95 percent
are Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
After years of continuous protection work in the reserve, the
area has seen increased natural vegetation and a rise in wild
animal populations.
</P>
<P>
So far, six international organizations and countries have
joined the project.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley: Cheung Kong Represents Outstanding Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Leading global investment bank
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Wednesday reiterated its positive view
on Cheung Kong Holdings as a high-value stock, despite the company
's recent removal from the MSCI Hong Kong Index.
</P>
<P>
Peter Churchouse, managing director and co-head of Asian
Research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said: "MSCI's decision to
drop Cheung Kong from its Hong Kong index was a surprise to many
investors and observes, including ourselves."
</P>
<P>
"In our view the company represents an excellent value
opportunity and should remain a core holding for fund managers in
its own right, not least because of Cheung Kong's outstanding
management, excellent growth prospects, leadership in the property
industry and its exposure to Hutchison," said Churchouse.
</P>
<P>
"Cheung Kong makes real money and has consistently delivered
outstanding shareholder value. At the same time its stock is among
the most liquid in the Hong Kong market. For all these reasons we
retain our market 'outperform' rating on Cheung Kong with a target
price for the stock of 110 HK dollars (14.1 U.S. dollars) on a 12-
month time horizon," he said.
</P>
<P>
John W. Wadsworth, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Asia,
echoed Churchouse's view. He said Cheung Kong Chairman Li Ka-shing
is clearly among the world's outstanding business leaders and an
increasingly powerful force in business globally who has created
enormous value for shareholders over the years.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to remember that MSCI's role as an index
provider is categorically not to make qualitative judgments on
companies. MSCI's removal of Cheung Kong from its Hong Kong index
is in no way a comment on its quality as a company, which, clearly
is one of Asia's leaders," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Top Prosecutor Closes Weizman's File </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's top prosecutor decided
Wednesday not to file criminal charges against President Ezer
Weizman for accepting cash gifts from a French businessman.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman had clearly committed violations of ethical rules
applying to senior civil servants which could, in the future cases,
be considered as criminal acts, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
said in a broadcast statement.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited decision was contained in a 60-page document
which included Rubinstein's formal decision and State Attorney Edna
Arbel's examination of the allegations and the reasoning behind her
decision to close the file.
</P>
<P>
"The opinion focuses on the question of whether there is room to
establish a criminal trial, and at this level our response is
negative," the decision added.
</P>
<P>
Police launched investigations against Weizman in January after
local media disclosed that Weizman, while serving as a lawmaker and
cabinet minister from 1988 to 1993, had accepted more than 300,000
U.S. dollars from French millionaire Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
Police investigated Weizman on allegations of bribery taking,
fraud and breach of faith, breaking the law barring civil servants
from accepting gifts and income tax violations.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said there was no doubt Weizman had broken the rules
banning senior public servants from receiving income other than
their salaries and stipulating that they must report their income
to the State Comptroller.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's violation of these rules fell short of a criminal act,
Rubinstein said, but he warned that such a behavior in the future
by a senior civil servant could warrant criminal prosecution on
charges of breach of faith.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Weizman said he was pleased that the case had
been closed and that as far as he was concerned, "the matter is
finished and done with."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he planned to step down by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
"I will consult with my family and the prime minister and decide
on the exact date," he added.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 76 and in failing health, is serving his second five-
year term, due to expire in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Israeli Pullout From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Wednesday welcomed the
just-completed Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying it has
been following the movement with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait welcomes this withdrawal and calls for Israel to
complete the pullback from all Lebanese territories to the
internationally recognized border," said Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah,
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in a
statement to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He praised the efforts exerted by United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan in securing the Israeli withdrawal on the basis
of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
immediate and unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese
territory and for a return of full sovereignty to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
so-called security zone there in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of
protecting its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel began to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon earlier
this month. It had promised to complete the military pullback by
July.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official voiced hope for the "continuation of
efforts aimed at making the Middle East peace process a success on
all tracks and at attaining complete Israeli withdrawal from all
Arab territories including Syria's Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to cease attacks on Lebanese civilians and
release all Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Israel concluded its hasty full-scale withdrawal from south
Lebanon early Wednesday, ending its 22 years of occupation of the
Lebanese territory.

</P>
<P>
It also noted that this most recent issue will further develop
ADB's yield curve in U.S. dollar global bonds and further enhance
secondary market liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966 to promote economic growth in the Asia and

Rejecting the possibility of any military solution, Pickering
said Washington supports any constructive role by India in Sri
Lanka, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Pickering, the United States is watching the
situation in Sri Lanka carefully and supporting the Norwegian role

Everything must be done to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in
Jaffna peninsula, said Pickering, who stressed, "Humanitarian
considerations are paramount in the current situation to avoid

Both New Delhi and Washington made it clear that they favor a
peaceful settlement in Jaffna keeping in view the aspirations of
all communities on the island, the PTI said.
</P>

The LTTE has been fighting for an independent Tamil state in
the east and north of Sri Lanka.

"would be willing to extend humanitarian aid if sought" by Colombo,
adding that so far there has been no request from Colombo in this
regard.

He also parried all questions on preparations by the Indian
Armed Forces regarding possible evacuation of Sri Lankan troops

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Statistics indicate that malaria has
led to between 12 and 20 percent of health facility deaths in
Zambia, health minister David Mpamba said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba told Roll Back Malaria Stakeholders Meeting that in
Zambia malaria is the leading cause of ill health and death. It
accounts for 30 percent of all health centre and hospital

</P>
<P>
He demanded new, cost-effective strategies to fight the scourge
in his country where the resources for malaria prevention and
control have unfortunately dwindled.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants of the meeting to identify and put
into place innovative, promotive, preventive and curative
strategies to effectively reduce the impact of the malaria on
Zambians.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is committed to the globally recognized
initiative for rolling back malaria by significantly reducing

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, has agreed to
acquire U.S. Airways for 11.6 billion U.S. dollars in a deal that
would create a giant airline with nearly twice as many flights as
its nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
-- More than two decades of Israeli occupation evaporated from
southern Lebanon Tuesday amid a chaotic and hurried withdrawal
that sent thousands of Israel's local militia allies and their
families fleeing in panic across the border in search of asylum.
</P>
<P>
-- Supporters of normal U.S. trade ties with China picked up
the backing of at least 10 more Democrats and four additional
Republicans Tuesday, moving President Clinton to within striking
distance of achieving the major foreign policy goal of his second
term.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House opened debate Tuesday on the China trade bill,
as a furious final round of horse-trading with undecided members
demanding everything from gas pipelines to a weather station left
supporters confident that they would eke out a victory on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- The world's largest airline, United, said Tuesday that it
had agreed to acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, U.S.
Airways.

measure granting Beijing permanent normal trade relations with the

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Resumes After 24-hour Pause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 24 (Xinhua) -- After a 12-day
adjournment and then a 24-hour pause, prosecutors Wednesday
resumed to build their case against two Libyans suspected in the
bombing of a Pan Am flight in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Testimony on Wednesday morning focused on how aircraft debris
had been found, collected and labeled at a purpose-built warehouse
near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
In cross examination, the defense team got policemen witnesses
to admit that labels on various pieces of evidence had been
changed from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The defense team was trying to cast doubt on the case the
prosecution was trying to build. Under Scottish Law, the
prosecution bears the burden of proof and has to prove its case "
beyond reasonable doubt" before the judges give their verdict.
</P>
<P>
Libyans Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima were
accused of conspiracy to murder and breaching the international
aircraft safety act.
</P>
<P>
The court, which was built in a former United States air force
base in central Netherlands, had to be adjourned for 12 days after
an out-of-the-court agreement was struck between the prosecution
and the defense team to skip time-consuming court hearings on
undisputed facts.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors were given extra time to reorganize their case
so that the court upon resumption could focus directly on the
cause of the mid-air explosion that killed 259 people aboard the
Boeing-747 jet airliner and another 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A technical glitch Tuesday, however, on the in-court
computerized stenography system forced the Scottish judges to
adjourn the trial for another 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day court adjournment allowed prosecutors time to cancel
as many as 230 witnesses scheduled to testify about the recovery
of some 40,000 pieces of evidence from around 1,200 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lockerbie trial is now expected to last up to
a year's time.

<HEADLINE> Construction at Three Gorges Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials with China Yangtze Three
Gorges Project Development Co. said today that the construction of
the Three Gorges project is running smoothly as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, who were present at today's signing

entered its second phase, following the seven-year first phase.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project, which started seven years ago, has so
far received about 49.7 billion yuan (5.9 billion US dollars) of
investment on capital assets. So far, 168,822,900 cubic meters of
earth and stone have been dug, and 12,520,200 cubic meters of

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Comprehensive Development of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy of developing
agriculture in a comprehensive way has proved successful, with the
pilot zones of the project recording far higher development than
other areas, according to officials and experts attending an on-
going national conference on the matter here today.
</P>
<P>
China launched the project to boost agricultural development
in 1988, when the country was facing a serious shortage of
farmland and water resources, and its middle- and low-yield land
accounted for two-thirds of the country's total. Meanwhile, the
country had a weak agricultural infrastructure and no means of
popularizing agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 years, China has spent huge sums on the
project, which focused on improving the middle- and low-yield
farmland, spreading information on agricultural technology, and
building up the agricultural infrastructure, and established pilot
zones in more than 1,500 counties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 20 million hectares of farmland had been
improved and 28 million hectares of improved irrigated land added,
which increased grain production capacity by more than 53 million
tons a year. Added to that, farmers in the pilot zones saw their
annual net income grow by 260 yuan, a significant rise over
earnings in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project has come mainly from the central and
local governments, who have divided their investment equally,
along with some bank loans and overseas contributions.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goals for Comprehensive Development of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's comprehensive agricultural
development must now focus on improving the efficiency of
agriculture and raising farmers' income, Minister of Finance Xiang
Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
The tasks for the current growth stage include continuing to
improve agricultural infrastructure, supporting agriculture
restructuring, promoting agro-technology and ecology, Xiang said
at a National Work Conference on Agricultural Comprehensive
Development.
</P>
<P>
China has been successful with its wide-ranging agro-
development project launched in 1988. Statistics show that the
pilot zones of the project, involving some 1,500 counties, have
increased grain production capacity by over 53 million tons
annually, with their farmers' annual income 260 yuan higher than
in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that agricultural production should be market-
oriented, and efforts should be made to develop quality and high-
efficient agriculture by relying on agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of environmental protection, saying
that it is closely related to the sustained development of
agriculture. He asked all pilot zones to protect natural forests
and wetlands, and improve farmland ecological protection systems.

Chi, who is also a vice-chairman of the Central Military

supported each other since they forged diplomatic ties 50 years
ago, and Sino-Myanmar relations of cooperation between the armed
forces of the two countries are firmly rooted.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted that "we not only should keep the old friends, but
also make new friends, so that the Sino-Myanmar friendship will be
passed on from generation to generation."
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Chi said that "peaceful reunification, and
'one country, two systems'" is the Chinese government's guideline
in resolving the Taiwan issue. However, he noted, the new leader
in the Taiwan region recently adopted an evasive and vague
attitude towards the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will not
allow the realization of any attempt to split state sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Chi briefed the guests on China's domestic situation, and
expressed his gratitude for the support of Myanmar to China on the
issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
</P>

friendship, and he hoped that his current visit would further the

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Democratic Self-

Compatriots held a forum here today, at which Taiwan compatriots
voiced their strong support for the recent statement on the issue
of Taiwan jointly issued on May 20 by the Taiwan Work Office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement reflects the basic stand of the CPC and the
government in regard to the inauguration speech made by the new
leader of Taiwan, and the common wishes of the Chinese people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, said Yang Guoqing, president of
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"We, the Taiwan compatriots living on the mainland, express our
strong support for the statement," said Yang, who chaired today's
forum.

Chen Guizhou, vice-president of the All-China Federation of

the Taiwan new leader evaded the major issues and described one-
China as something that would happen in the future.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that the new leader is willing to accept
the one-China principle and that he sincerely wants to ease the
cross-Straits relations, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Honorary Chairman Cai Zimin of the Central Committee of Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League said that if the new leader of
Taiwan is sincere in adopting a conciliatory stance in regard to
the cross-Straits relations, he should recognize the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum also noted that the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits have been separated for 50 years and that the issue
of Taiwan should not drag on forever.
</P>
<P>
If the new leader of Taiwan is serious about maintaining the
happiness of people on both sides of the Straits, and the peace
and stability of the cross-Straits relations, he should revert to
the one-China stance.
</P>
<P>
Issues of democracy, freedom and human rights are excuses used
by the Taiwan leaders to block the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, they said, adding that recognition of the one-China
principle and peaceful reunification are the only way out for the
island of Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says to Hit Syrian Targets in Lebanon if Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metulla, Israel, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the General Staff
of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) warned Wednesday that Israel will
strike Syrian targets in Lebanon if northern Israel comes under
attack following its troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
If there is an attempt to hit the northern residents or Israeli
soldiers we will hit all the power-holding elements in Lebanon
including Syrian targets in Lebanon," Shaul Mofaz told a news
conference at this border city.
</P>
<P>
"The pilots are in a heightened state of readiness and their
quality is known," Mofaz added.
</P>
<P>
This was the most direct warning to date that Israel would hold
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, responsible for any
attacks on its northern territory from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military officially announced earlier that it had
completed troops withdrawal from south Lebanon, ending 22 years of
its presence there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops poured out of south Lebanon into Israel under the
cover of darkness on Wednesday, as ordered by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers loaded with soldiers
entered Israel through various border crossings.
</P>
<P>
The military said all of the outposts belonging to the Israeli
army and its South Lebanon Army (SLA) allies in the security zone
had been abandoned and most were blown up.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the pullout operations, the sound of heavy shelling
could be heard, the sky was lit by by flares Israeli aircraft
launched to show the way out. But no one was hurt, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, accusing Syria of doing all it could to sabotage the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, it has been preparing the ground for violent acts
against Israel" after its withdrawal was completed, Barak said in
the letter, urging the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces
into south Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
While the withdrawal was going on, thousands of SLA and their
family members sought refugee in Israel and nearly 4,000 of them
have already entered Israel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran's Conservative Parliament Bids Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's fifth Majlis (parliament),
dominated by the right wing conservatives, was officially concluded
on Wednesday after closing its last session.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri presented a full report on the
performance of the fifth parliament before ringing a bell to
announce the end of its term.
</P>
<P>
The sixth parliament, elected in February with reformers seizing
most of the 290 seats, is scheduled to convene on Saturday, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
With reformers controlling the new parliament, it is expected
that President Mohammad Khatami's social and political reform
programs, mostly stymied by the fifth parliament, will be given a
powerful push.
</P>
<P>
For the reformers, however, the victory has been costly. They
had to see their activists being summoned by court and imprisoned
and their newspapers banned in the months following the February
elections.
</P>
<P>
As the top supervisor of the election, the conservative
Guardians Council only approved the election result in the Tehran
constituency last Saturday, after a delay of nearly three months.
Tehran is the reformists' most important political base, where
reformers won at least 26 of the 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians deprived some reformist winners of their victory,
transferring their seats to conservative opponents. Even now, only
a few days ahead of the inauguration of the new parliament, it is
still holding up the election results in a number of
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Facing the relentless conservative crackdown, Khatami, who
launched the country's reformist campaign after he took up the
presidency in 1997, has told his allies to keep calm and be
tolerant.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing was to guarantee the opening of the
news parliament in due time, he said, warning that radical moves by
the reformers might spark tougher crackdown by the conservatives
hardliners, who still have grip of most of the state powers.
</P>
<P>
With the reformers starting to carry out their duties in the new
parliament, and the next presidential election to be held in 2001,
the political struggle between conservatives and reformists enters
a new phase yet to be defined.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Court Grants Bail to Renamo Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The court in the northern Mozambican
province of Nampula has granted bail to Alvaro Chale, the
political delegate of the former rebel movement Renamo in the
district of Angoche, who has been in detention since Monday last
week.
</P>
<P>
Chale is accused of involvement in the May 5 attack on the
police station in Aube, in which the police commander was
seriously injured, and four of the attackers were shot dead in
what the police described as legitimate self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Cited in Wednesday's issue of the daily paper "Noticias", one
of Chale's lawyers, Antonio Feliciano, said that his client has
only to pay the bail determined by the court to await trial in
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the court's decision, another of Chale's defense
team, Maximo Dias, who is also a parliamentary deputy for the
Renamo-Electoral Union coalition, said that the judge "was right"
to grant bail to Chale and let him await trial in provisional
freedom while the Criminal Investigation Police is still doing its
job.
</P>
<P>
Dias said that Chale will continue to lead his normal life,
and will maintain his post as Renamo political delegate in
Angoche.
</P>
<P>
Chale is accused of participation in incitement to violence and
public disorder on May 5.
</P>
<P>
He denies all the accusations, arguing that on that date he was
in Maputo, on holiday.
</P>
<P>
A team of high ranking Renamo officials, led by Ossufo Quitine,
head of the Renamo parliamentary group, is to visit Aube to learn
at first hand what led to the detention of their delegate.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed
the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon on Wednesday at a meeting
of NATO foreign ministers in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that Vedrine explained to Albright the conditions needed for
France to join such a mission.
</P>
<P>
France and other countries which are expected to join the
mission must have the full support from four other permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force in Lebanon should not be condemned to "a passive
and impotent witness" in the face of a deteriorating situation,
and its organizational and commanding structure as well as its
mandate must be clear, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three countries involved in the conflict in
Lebanon -- Israel, Syria and Lebanon -- should behave in a
responsible way in a new situation after the pullout of Israeli
troops, she added.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and Albright also agreed to reinforce cooperation
between France and the United States in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday that France
will study in "an open and comprehensive way" any demand for its
contribution to the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France has 250 soldiers in the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (
UNIFL), which has been deployed there since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested that UNIFL
be reinforced from 4,500 members to 7,935 when it is redeployed in
the areas of Lebanon evacuated by the Israelis.

clearly essential that the enhancements provided by the
manufacturers and funded by the operators are matched in tandem by
air traffic control authorities through the timely provision of up-
to-date air route systems, associated infrastructure and the
corresponding ground elements of CNS/ATM," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the strenuous efforts of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (ICAO), IATA, the airline operators and air
traffic services providers, various trials on the CNS/ATM systems
have been conducted." Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The CNS/ATM systems will minimize airspace constraints and
reduce traffic congestion, which will enable aircraft to operate
within their most optimum flight envelope, commensurate with
achieving a marked increase in flight safety.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by operating on more direct routes, a reduction in
aircraft fuel consumption is also feasible.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department is now conducting a study
and trial of the system for implementation and transition in 2003-
2016, according to Lam.
</P>
<P>
Lam also urged the attendees of the conference to give support
and encouragement in maintaining the present momentum to achieve a
safe, economic and expeditious movement of aircraft around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"We will fully support this aim and are committed to maintain
Hong Kong as a regional and international aviation center," he
added.
</P>
<P>
IATA requires that technical conference are held at two yearly
intervals.

<HEADLINE> HK Awards Quality Taxi Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Ten Hong Kong taxi drivers were
awarded the title of "Outstanding Quality Taxi Drivers" and other
20 awarded the title of "Hong Kong Tourists Association Quality
Taxi Drivers" at a ceremony here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the award campaign is very encouraging and it
indicates that both local passengers and overseas tourists think
high of the taxi service quality in Hong Kong," said Jeffrey Lam,
chairman of the Quality Taxi Services Steering Committee of Hong
Kong, after presenting the prizes to award winners.
</P>
<P>
"The award may serve to recognize the endless efforts made by
the taxi drivers who provide professional service to passengers on
the one hand and contribute to a better image of Hong Kong on the
other," Lam said, adding "We shall continue our effort to
encourage taxi drivers to keep on their good work and help improve
the general service quality of the trade."
</P>
<P>
The nomination for the award took two months and taxi drivers
were assessed in accordance with criteria including reliability,
safety, customer service and overall passenger satisfactions, by a
working group consisting of transport officials, taxi trade
representatives and sponsors of the award.
</P>
<P>
The Outstanding Quality Taxi Drivers are the top ten drivers
who have obtained full marks from their nominators and they will
be presented "Outstanding Quality Taxi Driver" Certificate and
identity cards as well as some other prizes and oil coupons.

<P>
Jointly organized by the Steering Committee, the Transport
Department and taxi associations, the award is one of the series
of projects launched to help improve the taxi service quality.
</P>
<P>
The award campaign was launched last January and passengers
were given a nomination form for them to nominate drivers
providing quality service. A total of 1,200 nominees were received
when the campaign closed on March 26.

Wednesday with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>

Mongolian Minister of Infrastructure Development G. Batkhuu signed
on behalf of the government of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to closer links between Hong Kong and Mongolia.
I am encouraged by the fact that bilateral trade between Hong Kong
and Mongolia has increased by more than 80 percent in 1999, and
the number of Mongolian visitors coming to Hong Kong in the first
three months of this year has more than doubled," said Ip at the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The Air Services Agreement provides a legal framework for the
establishment and future expansion of our bilateral air links. I
hope that with the conclusion of the agreement, there will soon be
direct air services between Hong Kong and Mongolia," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Makes Efforts to Raise Teachers' Professionalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is making efforts to
raise teachers' professionalism and students' language standards.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to all Hong Kong teachers on Wednesday, Joseph W P
Wong, secretary for education and manpower of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), explained the rationale for
the Government's language benchmarking initiative and sought their
support to make the initiative a success.
</P>
<P>
Wong also explained in detail the background leading to the
benchmarking initiative, addressed teachers' key concerns on the
issue and set out the implementation arrangements for benchmarking
the language proficiency of English and Putonghua teachers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are many factors which may influence the
language proficiency of students, he said that language
benchmarking was one of the key elements of the HKSAR government's
comprehensive strategy in tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that teachers' language proficiency has
a direct bearing on students' language proficiency because of
teachers' unique position in the education process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From the 2000-01 school year onward, new teachers teaching
English or Putonghua will have to be benchmarked through
examinations, mostly within one year after they have started
teaching the relevant subjects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, for serving teachers, they will have five years until
2005, to attain the benchmarks and will have two options to do so,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Wong stressed that each serving teacher had total discretion to
decide for himself or herself whether to take the examination
route or the training route and could, if they chose the training
option, decide for themselves which recognized training courses to
attend.
</P>
<P>
"The government has set aside about 240 million HK dollars (30.
8 million U.S. dollars) in the next five years to ensure that all
serving English and Putonghua teachers will have the opportunity
to attend training courses if they so wish," Wong noted.

<HEADLINE> Intel Chief Sees Rosy Future of Asia's Digital Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation's President and
CEO Craig R. Barrett said here Wednesday that China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) is good for U.S. companies to
continue their business in China.
</P>
<P>
"China's becoming a member of the WTO and being granted the
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status mean that we will
continue to do business in China as we have," he told the press.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the PNTR
issue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barrett expected China to overtake Japan to become the second
largest PC consumer nation later this year or earlier next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to continuing stronger growth in China,
" said the head of the world's largest chip maker.
</P>
<P>
Barrett also foresaw an enormous growth in digital economy in
Asia as a whole, quoting the figures provided by the Garner Group
in January 2000 that the Asian market is expected to account for
14 percent of the world's business-to-business e-commerce, growing
at an estimated rate of 150 percent through 2004.
</P>
<P>
The business-to-business e-commerce worldwide is expected to
grow to 7 trillion U.S. dollars in the next four years and the
business-to-business sales in Asia, excluding Japan, will reach 1
trillion U.S. dollars within the next five years, said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
Barrett is in Hong Kong, Intel's Asia Pacific headquarters, for
the Third Digital Economy Forum and the signing of a memorandum of
understanding with Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT on accelerating e-business
in Hong Kong and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's session of the forum, Barrett called on
businesses to increase efficiency through the use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Successful companies will be the ones who become 100 percent e-
business by integrating all aspects of their business from
internal customers, external customers and suppliers, partners and
affiliates in an e-business environment," Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
He thought more electronic transactions equal more business
advantages.
</P>
<P>
"By converting more interactions with your customers, suppliers,
employees and partners into electronic business transactions, you
can build a more efficient and competitive business," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the Internet as the driving force
behind the dramatic changes in business today, Hong Kong will see
an exponential growth in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
"Backed by strong infrastructure investments, low connection
costs and government support to boost PC and Internet penetration,
Hong Kong can become the Internet leader in Asia Pacific," Barrett
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Firms Urged to Take Lead in Digital Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in Asia were urged to
be bold in decision-making and responsive to the fast-moving
opportunities ahead as the Internet is now reshaping and
redefining virtually every aspect of communications and
transactions in the region, participants in a forum on the digital
economy said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 top corporate executives in Asia gathered in Hong
Kong from May 22-24 for the third annual digital economy forum in
an attempt to find answers to how to cope with the bewildered e-
commerce and its rampant development.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the three-day event with the theme of "
Convergent Leadership: Putting Ideas to Work" focused their
discussions on prevailing and developing business issues Asian
companies must consider in meeting the challenges of competing in
the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Charles Wang, chairman and CEO of the U.
S. Computer Association International Inc. and honorary chairman
of the forum, said, "The Internet has captured our imagination by
transforming monumentally challenging tasks that were costly and
difficult to implement into an ubiquitous medium that is easily
accessible by anyone at anytime."
</P>
<P>
Competing in the digital economy involves more than having a
functional and engaging website, Wang stressed. "It involves
developing and creating value for business through developing
strategic networks and partnerships previously thought
unimaginable."
</P>
<P>
Participants believed that the Internet is one of the greatest
opportunities and one of the greatest threats to established
business. As a result, it is vital to establish a strong, quality
presence and it is no longer a "wait and see" approach, because
another site will start filling the needs of your customers with
the click of a mouse, they said.

<P>
They also believed that Asian businesses are lagging in
developing their approaches to the Internet and early movers have
the chance to capture a disproportionate share of the future
profits. However, the Internet opportunity is so large and complex
for most businesses that it should be on the CEO's list of top
priorities, they said.
</P>
<P>
Todd Bradley, executive vice-president of the U.S. Gateway for
global operations, expressed his great concern over the issue of
the so-called "digital divide" opening up between the technology
haves and have-nots and called for information technology
companies throughout the world to shoulder special responsibility
to bridge the digital gap through humanizing the digital
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Intel Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer Craig
Barrett also delivered an hour-long speech to elaborate on the
race for Internet leadership in Asia, and his speech brought the
discussion to a climax.
</P>
<P>
"The race is on for Internet leadership in Asia and the country
which embraces the Internet fastest will hold the leadership
position in the region," Barrett said, adding that he was
optimistic that Hong Kong will become the Internet hub of Asia
Pacific
</P>
<P>
Barrett predicted that China will overtake Japan to become the
second largest personal computer consumer nation with its
accession to the World Trade Organization, and he also expressed
his wish for expanding Intel's cooperation with Chinese companies
in the Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Barrett, successful companies in the future will
be the ones which become 100 percent e-business by integrating all
aspects of their business from internal customers, external
customers and suppliers, partners and affiliates in an e-business
environment.
</P>
<P>
Participants also argued that e-business in the United States
may be a good applicable bellwether for what may happen in Asia
and what Asian businesses should learn from the U.S. curve.
However, they said, it also makes sense that e-business in Asia
may develop within a uniquely Asian framework.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Welcomes Israeli Pullout From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
expressed here Wednesday his welcome of the just-completed Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Arafat said "We have been stressing since
the very beginning that Israel has to implement U.N. Resolution 425
which is related to our people and land in Lebanon, which is proud
today to have every inch of its territories liberated."
</P>
<P>
Arafat voiced hope that the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon
would push forward the Mideast peace process and enhance Israel's
withdrawal from the Palestinian territories as well.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdeineh said: "The Israeli pullout
from south Lebanon marks a necessary step that should be followed
with more steps in order to reach a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations resolutions demanding Israel's pullout from
all occupied Arab territories must be implemented, he noted, adding
that this is the essence of real peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Parliament Affairs Nabil Amr described
the Israeli withdrawal from south lebanon as a great victory for
the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
"People are more powerful in their determination and endurance
than the armies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel concluded its hasty full-scale withdrawal from south
lebanon early Wednesday, ending 22 years of occupation of the
Lebanese territory.

<HEADLINE> Prices Take Battering on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The slump came in line with the trend in many other Asian
markets which were broadly badly hit by the technology-led sell-
off on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) suffered a loss of 33.
84 points to end at 1,871.94 points in light trading and at one
point the fall in the broad market put Singapore stocks at a 13
month low of 1,828.79 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 321.68 million shares valued at
619.18 million Singapore dollars (356.57 million U.S. dollars).
There were just 42 advances compared to 314 losers by the close of
the session.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 37.75 million parcel of Trek which was
transacted at 0.365 Singapore dollars per share. Ipco was the
second most heavily-traded stock which had 17.54 million units
done. NatElec was the next with 17.24 million counters changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
SIA led gainers of the day rising by 60 cents to close at 16.80
Singapore dollars. SIA 200 climbed by 50 cents to finish at 16.70
Singapore dollars. SembLog moved up 20 cents to end at 10.40
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Venture topped the decliners of the day plunging by 120 cents
to close at 14.80 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 and PacCent sank
70 cents each to finish at 43.30 and 12.00 Singapore dollars,
respectively. NatElec incurred a loss of 59 cents to end at 4.76
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the technology-led sell-off on Wall Street
overnight weighed heavily on the market sentiment and dragged down
the share prices.
</P>
<P>
They noted that banking stocks accounted for nearly half of the
index decline and electronics stocks also fell after the news of a
pause in the record-breaking pace of orders for computer chip
equipment sparked a sell-off in the U.S. technology sector.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Fiji coup crisis would not be
resolved quickly, Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon said
Wednesday after meeting with Fiji's coup leader George Speight.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is still fairly protracted," McKinnon told the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV's 7.30 Report from Suva.
</P>
<P>
"We -- myself and the representative of the United Nations
secretary-general -- were really here to listen, to be able to
convey messages about what our concerns were of our respective
organizations, the fact that the illegal overthrow of the
government is totally intolerant and shouldn't be accepted," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not convinced that this is going to be resolved very
rapidly but it is certainly moving and I believe that a lot of
people fully understand what we're saying," he said.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon and U.N. envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello Wednesday met
Fiji's coup leader Speight for talks in the country's besieged
parliament house.
</P>
<P>
But Speight remained defiant, refusing to release his hostages.
</P>
<P>
The envoys had also met briefly with Fiji's Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry who has been held captive for five days with 34
other hostages in the Fijian parliament.

<HEADLINE> Guinea-Bissau's President, Military Leader Meet to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- President of Guinea-Bissau Kumba
Iala has met with the country's military leader Ansumane Mane in a
bid to seek ways for easing the tension between the civil and the
military authorities, a report reaching here said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held on Tuesday when Luis Amado, representative
of the Portuguese and the European Union (EU) aid institutions,
was paying his visit to Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Amado called for an end to the tension and making preparations
for development plans to ensure continued foreign support for the
West African nation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that this is the second meeting in five days
between the civil and the military leaders. No more details were
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Guinea-Bissau is mainly due to the civil
authorities' recent dismissal of the navy commander Lamine Sanha
without prior consultation with the military leadership.
</P>
<P>
Sanha was accused of freeing a Korean ship caught fishing
illegally in the Guinea-Bissau waters.
</P>
<P>
Iala said that he followed the government's recommendation and
has promised to maintain open channels of communication with the
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mane led the victorious Military Junta rebels who toppled the
then President Nino Vieira in May 1999. The post-conflict
transition period ended last February, when Iala, along with a new
government and parliament, took office following general
elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Europeans to Send More Police to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged its European allies to send more police to Kosovo
as a proof of their fair share in the mission.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said, "I ask that you do all you can to
meet your pledges there to help fill any remaining gaps that may
exist."
</P>
<P>
The presence of an international police task force in Kosovo
under the U.N. requirement is still below half of its proposed
strength, which is supposed to have 6,000 people in the Yugoslav
province to restore order and enforce law.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Europeans need to prove their fair share in
Kosovo as the U.S. Congress has recently threatened withdrawing U.
S. troops from Kosovo in July next year if the Europeans make no
more contributions to the mission.
</P>
<P>
The United States has deployed 3,700 troops in Kosovo, while
other NATO member states and non-NATO countries combined have
contributed more than 32,000 troops to the multinational
peacekeeping force KFOR.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people held demonstrations outside the meeting
place of NATO foreign ministers to protest against NATO meetings
in their city.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Interested in Celtic Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Leicester manager Martin O'Neill has
admitted his interest in the vacant manager's job at Celtic - but
insisted he has not been approached by the Glasgow giants.
</P>
<P>
Celtic are expected to step up their approach to try to lure O'
Neill in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said: "Anyone would have to be interested in a club
like them. Celtic are absolutely massive, one of the biggest clubs
in Europe and would interest most managers."
</P>
<P>
But he told the Daily Mail: "I haven't been offered, or
accepted, a job by them."
</P>
<P>
Celtic have targeted O'Neill after being rejected by former
Holland coach Guus Hiddink.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who steered Leicester to the Worthington Cup last
season, has two years left of his current deal and earlier in the
campaign pledged to see out that contract.
</P>
<P>
But the contract does have a clause which allows the former
Northern Ireland midfielder to talk to any interested clubs in the
close season.
</P>
<P>
However Leicester's plc chairman Sir Rodney Walker insisted the
Foxes were not worried by the latest apparent attempt to lure O'
Neill away from Filbert Street.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no formal approach by Celtic to Leicester, a
fact related to the plc board by club chairman John Elsom during a
meeting yesterday," Walker told The Express.
</P>
<P>
"I am very relaxed despite this speculation which doesn't
surprise us. We don't believe this is a job in any case in which
Martin would be interested," he said.

<HEADLINE> McAllister Anfield-Bound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool have signed Coventry
skipper Gary McAllister on a one-year deal, according to local
reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old midfielder is believed to have had talks with
Reds boss Gerard Houllier at Anfield this week. His contract with
the Sky Blues runs out on June 30, and McAllister will be
available for free under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Coventry veteran was top scorer at the midlands club with
13 goals last season and was voted Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
Highfield Road chairman Bryan Richardson, however, denied any
knowledge of McAllister agreeing a move to Merseyside.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I've absolutely no knowledge whatsoever that that
decision has been made by him. I think there's no doubt at all
that the first people that will be informed will be Gordon
Strachan and myself," he told Coventry's official web site.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool press officer Ian Cotton remained tight-lipped over
the reports.

1911 -- the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution led by Sun
which overthrew the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Some of the objects on display include Sun's name card, seal
and envelopes, a walking stick, and a telescope used by Sun.

<HEADLINE> Most Crumbled Proxy Lebanese Militiamen Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,500 militiamen, or nearly two-
thirds, of the 2,400-member pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA)
have surrendered to Lebanese authorities or anti-Israel Muslim
guerrillas by Wednesday morning, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Of the SLA men who have surrendered since early May, 325 are
Druze, 220 are Christian and 1,010 are Shiite Muslims, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 5,000 SLA members and their relatives have fled
into Israel following the SLA collapse and Israeli pullout from
south Lebanon in fear of reprisal from Lebanese guerrillas now
taking over the region.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, which had acted as Israel's proxy in patrolling the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon for the past two
decades, collapsed in days, which forced Israel to accelerate its
withdrawal, six-weeks ahead of its self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
By early Wednesday, the Israeli troops have already completed
their hasty pullout from south Lebanon, ending 22 years of
occupation in the region, where it set up a self-styled "security
zone" in 1985 with the aim to guarantee its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss said Wednesday morning he
hoped Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon would lead to calm on
the border with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"History will record that on this day the will of the Lebanese
and the sacrifices of their resistance have defeated the strongest
military force in the region," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hoss added Lebanon would continue to struggle for the release of
Lebanese prisoners still held in Israel and the disputed Shebaa
Farms which Israeli said it seized from Syria in 1967 but both
Lebanon and Syria said Beirut has the ownership.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to struggle to regain our other rights from
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah, the main Shiite Muslim guerrilla group
fighting to end Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, said their
guerrillas would continue fighting for the release of their
Israeli-held members and the return of Shebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God backed by Iran and Syria, has
virtually taken full control of south Lebanon after the hurried
Israeli evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The border area with Israel has been relatively quiet since
dawn. Jubilant civilians returned to their home villages they had
not been able to visit for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
With Hezbollah insisting on continued fighting to win over the
Shebaa region and release of more Lebanese detainees in Israel, and
Israel threatening serious reprisal once attacked, no one knows
what is in store after the liberation of the occupied lands.

<HEADLINE> Iran Congratulates Lebanon on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Wednesday congratulated his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud over
the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying it was a result
of the Lebanese struggles against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Lahoud, Khatami said "the
government and people of Lebanon and their heroic resistance was a
symbol of the honor and dignity of the Arab and Islamic nations."
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that the future developments after the
just-concluded Israeli withdrawal should be watched "carefully and
vigilantly," the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops completed their withdrawal from south Lebanon in
the small hours of Wednesday, ending a 22-year occupation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that establishment of stability would be
witnessed in Lebanon and the liberation of more occupied lands
would be observed in future.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Lahoud said the Israeli withdrawal was in fact a
victory for both Iran and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran nurtured and is the backer of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
guerrilla group, the most prominent Lebanese resistance force
fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Iran supplies Hezbollah, or Party of God, with weapons
transported through Syria, which is the main power broker in
Lebanon where it deploys 35,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon would be
registered as a national day of resistance in the history of
Lebanon and "be honored forever."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that withdrawal would be launched from
other occupied territories as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Although the people in south Lebanon are happy with the
withdrawal, "we have the same concern as the Islamic Republic of
Iran has that Israel has withdrawn from our soil today and it will
embark on occupation of Lebanese territory again," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government and Hezbollah have said they would continue
to fight for the release of Lebanese prisoners still held in Israel
and the disputed Shebaa Farms which Israeli said it seized from
Syria in 1967 but both Lebanon and Syria said Beirut has the
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened harsh reprisal once attacked after its
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Envoys Meet Fiji Coup Leader, PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior United Nations and
Commonwealth envoys Wednesday met Fiji's coup leader George
Speight for talks in the country's besieged parliament house.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and Commonwealth Secretary
General Don McKinnon were also allowed to see Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry, who has been held captive since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
As he left, McKinnon said Chaudhry "looked quite well," despite
reports that Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister had been
beaten by his captors.
</P>
<P>
"I felt that they were all in reasonably good spirits
considering the obvious pressure they are under," McKinnon said
and urged the coup leaders to back down.
</P>
<P>
"One really hopes these people are prepared to step back from
the brink, realizing that there has already been damage to the
international reputation of Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speight remained defiant on Wednesday, refusing to release his
hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to Speight said he is expected to make "
his most significant announcement to date" later Wednesday night,
prompting speculation he may accept a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the international envoys to visit Speight came
on a day of shuttle diplomacy, in which McKinnon and de Mello also
met Fiji's President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, crisis mediator and
former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, and the Great Council of
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs met for a second day on Wednesday
to try to resolve the crisis and decide on the political future of
Chaudhry's government.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs have called for Chaudhry's release and backed Mara,
who wants to solve the crisis without breaching Fiji's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Australia and New Zealand have condemned
Speight and warned of tough diplomatic and economic sanctions
against Fiji if he succeeds in his push to topple Fiji's
democratically-elected government.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Center for Study of Ancient Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The substantial progress made by
China in the study of ancient birds has made the country one of
the world's centers for this research, according to a noted expert
on ancient vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
Hou Lianhai, a scientist specializing in ancient birds at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that China did not begin this
research until the 1970s, but has made significant headway due to
the large amount of fossilized ancient birds found across the
nation during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the geological location, number of species, and
number of findings of ancient birds, China ranks first in the
world," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As an acknowledgment of the progress China has made in the
field, the world association for the study of ancient birds and
their evolution has decided to hold their fifth international
conference in Beijing in the near future.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Union Leader Calls for Factory Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, president of the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, has urged the serious study
of Jiang Zemin's important instructions on the Party's role, and
the promotion of democracy in factories.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau, made the call
during his tour of Hebei Province on May 21-24.
</P>
<P>
Wei was in the province to inspect the "opening-up of factory
affairs," that is, the participation of factory workers in
democratic decision-making, management, and enterprise supervision.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang's instruction made during his south China
tour earlier this year, the working class is the political base of
the Party, and the Party must always maintain its nature as the
pioneer of the working class and adhere to the principal guideline
of depending on the working class wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
"Opening-up of factory affairs" should be practiced with a
focus on the general situation of enterprise reform, development,
and stability, Wei said, noting that the key is whether the
workers' democratic supervisory rights are ensured.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Wei visited a dozen local factories and held
talks with employee representatives.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Grows by 11.7 Pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy recorded a
growth of 11.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, the
highest quarterly expansion since the regional crisis of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The growth is broad-based with all sectors in the economy
registering positive output growth, Bank Negara (State Bank)
Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz told a press conference here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the quarter under review, the manufacturing sector grew
by 27.3 percent, services sector by 6.3 percent, agriculture by 2.
9 percent, and both the construction and the mining sectors which
contracted by 5.6 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, in the
last quarter of 1999 turned around to grow by 1.2 percent and 0.8
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Zeti said the 11.7 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth
raised the GDP to 49.9 billion ringgit (13.131 billion U.S.
dollars), only marginally lower than the 50.3 billion ringgit (13.
236 billion dollars) recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
She said that the aggregate domestic demand expanded further,
recording a stronger growth of 12.2 percent in the first quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The external sector continued to remain favorable with the
trade surplus for the 11th consecutive quarter standing at 16.2
billion ringgit (4.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Strong trade surplus and portfolio capital inflows raised the
international reserves of Bank Negara Malaysia by 11.6 billion
ringgit (3.052 billion dollars) in the first quarter to 128.9
billion ringgit (33.9 billion dollars) at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's external debt position improved in the first quarter
of this year with total external debt declining by 3.4 percent to
1,545.3 billion ringgit (40.9 billion dollars) at the end of March
2000, equivalent to about 52 percent of gross national product (
GNP).
</P>
<P>
The governor said the higher growth was achieved under an
environment of low inflation with the annual rate of inflation as
measured by the consumer price index being lower at 1.5 percent
against 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy which contracted by 7.5 percent in 1998
registered a 10.6 percent GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1999
and recorded a 5.4 percent GDP growth for the whole of that year.

<HEADLINE> Tension in Indonesia's Aceh to Quiet Down, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Minister of Defense
Juwono Sudarsono Wednesday said he is optimistic that tension and
armed conflict in Aceh province will soon quiet down.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that slowly but surely, tension and conflict in Aceh
will be quieting down within next one or two months," Sudarsono
told reporters here, citing that most of Aceh people want peace.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government representatives and the Free Aceh
Movement (GAM) -- an underground armed movement in Aceh province --
signed a Joint Understanding on Humanitarian Pause in Davos,
Switzerland, in mid-May under which both sides agreed to reduce
tension and violent actions in the territory.
</P>
<P>
But the three-month accord is not due to come into force until
June 2.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the accord, at least 15 people were killed
in clashes in the western-most province of Aceh. The Indonesian
Observer newspaper said the renewed violence raised fears that the
accord could be derailed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Abdurrahman Wahid said that there are "
certain parties" attempting to disrupt the government peace
efforts in Aceh.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Thailand and
Laos have agreed to forge closer cooperation to prevent and handle
problems along the border, the official Thai News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted as saying that the
agreement was reached at the ninth meeting of the Thai-Lao General
Committee on Peace and Order along the Border, which was held here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came out with resolutions that the joint committee
will meet at least twice a year, and a joint inspection will be
conducted by authorities concerned along the border once a year,
and regular surveillance conducted by security officers will be
limited in the internal areas of the countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border actions by security officers of the two countries
were allowed only when they are needed to assist or rescue
troubling people along the Mekong River, based on the humanitarian
reason, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If there is any urgent incident, an emergent meeting of the
Joint Committee would be called and a joint inspection would be
conducted immediately, said Chuan, who chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the two countries also agreed to exchange useful
information, and to jointly prevent and decisively crack down
drugs trade and trafficking along the border.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee (IOC)
top official Jacques Rogge believes doping controls to detect the
banned hormone erythropoietin (EPO) were "almost certain" to be
ready for the Sydney Olympics starting in September.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the year, the IOC, because of past
disappointments, did not believe that such a test could be
completed before Sydney," he told the French sports daily l'Equipe.
</P>
<P>
"A month ago, it was fifty-fifty. Today, it is almost certain,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
An Australian laboratory and a French research center will soon
publish their results in scientific magazines. Publication is the
first stage for a doping test to be validated and accepted legally,
Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
Rogge said that the process of validation of the new EPO test
should be completed before the Olympics, which start on September
15.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Welcomes Troop Withdrawal From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
expressed welcome to the troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, which
was completed at predawn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The completion of Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon
was a very special movement because we have ended 22 years of
presence in south lebanon," said Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal will make the resumption of Israel's peace talks
with Syria and Lebanon more likely, he said during a meeting with
Shao Huaze, president of China's People's Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli pullout was carried out without agreement with Syria
or Lebanon, Weizman said, adding that Israel would fight back if
any military actions are taken against Israel after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He urged Syria to take concrete actions for a resumption of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks came to a halt in January after
two rounds in the United States, due to Israel's refusal to promise
the full return of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Israel will continue to push the Middle East peace
process ahead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli president said his country is trying to
find solutions to all issues in the final-status talks with
Palestinians, among the toughest of which are Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security
arrangement and water.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli-Chinese relations, Weizman expressed the belief that
China will play a more active role in world affairs in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Israel in
April as a "historic event" that strengthens the relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Shao and his party arrived here on Sunday for a five-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Up Anti-Corruption Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Wednesday installed an anti-corruption team to back the
government's program in eradicating rampant corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The team consists of 25 members and is chaired by former chief
justice of the Supreme Court Adi Andojo Sutjipto.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the team must investigate anyone who is
suspected to be involved in corruption practices, and the members
of the team also must be free from any link to corruption.
</P>
<P>
The team was set up based on a decree issued by Attorney
General Marzuki Darusman on May 23. The decree states that the
attorney general is the coordinator of the team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in regard to the case of former President Soeharto
who has been facing corruption charges, Wahid reiterated that the
government will pardon him for the sake of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Forgiving former President Soeharto is one of the conditions
under which national reconciliation process can be carried out,"
Wahid said, adding that the forgiveness will be granted to the
former president only after the court declares him guilty in
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
He urged Western countries to understand the idea of
forgiveness in Soeharto's case.
</P>
<P>
"We only need to get the good things from the West and maintain
(the good things) in our country," Wahid said, noting that Western
countries prefer to use confrontational ways rather than reach
reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> SAARC ENT Congress Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The second SAARC ENT (ear, nose
and throat) Congress kicked off here Wednesday with the theme of "
extending ENT services to the community" of the countries in the
South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day meeting, about 500 participants from the SAARC
(South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation ) countries and
some 100 doctors and specialists from other regions are discussing
at the four-day meeting the prevention and cure of ENT diseases in
the SAARC countries, especially in villages and communities where
such diseases are pervasive.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we will acquire knowledge of current issues
affecting the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of
otolaryngological and related disorders," said professor M.
Alauddin, president of the SAARC Association of Otolaryngologists,
at the inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Alauddin suggested the arrangement of short and long term
fellowship programs for the otolaryngologists in SAARC countries
to promote the training and exchange of information and expertise
among them.
</P>
<P>
Hearing impairment is a major disease leading to physical
disability in the SAARC countries, with India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Nepal being the worst-affected. SAARC also includes
Bhutan,the Maldives and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic constraint and lack of human resources
development, ENT services are not available to the peripheral
areas of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The current congress is co-organized by the Society of
Otolaryngologists of Nepal and the SAARC Otolaryngologists
Association, which was formed at the first SAARC ENT congress held
at Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the association is to promote the
exchange of scientific views and transfer of technology regionally
and globally.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Problem Only Temporary, Says Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday that the problems spawned by the conflict in
Mindanao are only temporary, and that he is doing his best to
exhaust all possible means to resolve them, the Philippine News
Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in Guimaras province in the Visayas,
Estrada said the resolution of these problems will bring about
true peace and progress in Mindanao and the entire country.
</P>
<P>
"We have a minor problem in Mindanao, but this is temporary.
Once this is resolved, we can have true peace and progress,"
Estrada was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, the president arrived at Guimaras
Wednesday morning from Bacolod city with some members of his
cabinet to inaugurate some projects. He will be back in Bacolod
City prior to his trip to Metro Manila in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada asked the people to help resolve these
problems by rallying behind his administration.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked insurgent groups to lay down their
arms and help him instead in transforming the nation into a land
of total peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We must resolve these problems. We cannot progress as a nation
if we don't unite. All I ask is a little sacrifice so we can
overcome these problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
and Abu Sayyaf extremists in some parts of Mindanao have
challenged government authority by attacking state-owned
installations and civilian-populated areas, and taking hostage
innocent civilians and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, after engaging government troops in weeks of fighting,
has agreed to resume peace talks with the government in Cotabato
City on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Government troops, meanwhile, continue to work for the safe
release of the remaining two teachers and five schoolchildren who
were among the 31 civilians taken hostage in Basilan in March.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are also preparing to secure the freedom of 21
tourists abducted from Malaysia last month and later taken to Jolo
island by Abu Sayyaf extremists.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Revenue Collection Short of Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority
collected 40.4 billion shillings (538.6 million U.S. dollars) in
the first quarter of the current financial year, about two billion
shillings short of the target, newspapers here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner General John Msafari attributed the shortfall to
the unfavorable economic conditions as the overall growth in Gross
Domestic Product stood at 1.3 percent, significantly lower than
the same period of the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the performance of some tax heads such as the
Road Maintenance Levy Funds and air passenger service charges
recorded a phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
The road levy increased by 23 percent to 1.98 billion shillings
(26.5 million dollars) in the quarter from 1.61 billion shillings
(22.3 million dollars) over the same period last year, Msafari
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the air passenger service charges rose by 240
percent to 500 million shillings (6.67 million dollars) in the
first three months from 230 million shillings (3.06 million
dollars) over the same period in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Rent Generators to Avert Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will spend
9.1 billion shillings (121 million U.S. dollars) in the next four
months to avert a looming power shortage in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia said Tuesday the
government would rent an emergency diesel power plant at a cost of
30 million dollars per month, including generators and fuel,
newspapers here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Generator leasing is one of the few options to solve the power
shortages as a result of a fall in national production after a
long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
A two-year continuous drought, the harshest in 40 years, has
led to an electricity shortfall of between 154 and 360 megawatt in
the off-peak and peak hours respectively.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia said a 12-hour power rationing schedule is to be
introduced across the country starting Monday, with industrial and
commercial consumers having power between 6:30 am and 6:30 pm
everyday except Sundays.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels have turned over the
five Russian aviators held captive last year to the Zambian
authorities, informed source said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) said the five Russians, pilots of
two planes shot down in northeast Angola respectively on May 12
and June 30 last year, were handed over to the authorities in the
Zambian village of Hangana on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release, long sought by Moscow, was "a gesture of pure
humanism in response to appeals by the aviators families and
prestigious personalities and statesmen," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The source declining to be identified said that UNITA thanked
the Zambian government for its guarantee to take the released
captives to Russia in safety.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan rebels also warned in the statement that all
nations with citizens in Angola "under any pretext" did not have
"minimum guarantees of security" in the country's war zones, which
it claimed embraced all the Angolan territory.

TOKYO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell further in Tokyo
Wednesday, with the benchmark Nikkei hitting a new closing low for
the year after dipping below 16,000 several times for the first
time in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged 274.29 points, or 1.68
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 16,044.44 for the sixth

also a closing low for this year.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 662.31 million shares
from Tuesday's 614.59 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's decline on Wall Street, particularly that of the
technology-heavy NASDAQ composite index, weighed on Japanese
information and high-tech issues Wednesday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Mining, textile and wholesale issues also faced strong selling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, brokerages were the biggest winners, rising 3.84
percent as a group, following their recent decline.

<HEADLINE> Deaf Child Receives US$100,000 in Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Zou Weiyi, a seven-year-old boy who
became deaf due to medical negligence, has received over 830,000
yuan (some 100,000 US dollars) in compensation in northeast China'
s Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court announced a final
judgment requiring the Dandong Railway Hospital, the defendant in
the case, to pay 838,764 yuan to the child, who suffered from an
overdose of gentamycin when he was five months old.
</P>
<P>
Zou's family brought charges against the hospital in June 1998,
asking for 1.2 million yuan in compensation. The judgment made by
the Intermediate People's Court of Dandong City said that the
hospital must pay 460,000 yuan to the boy.
</P>
<P>
Both the family and defendant appealed to the Provincial Higher
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
As there are no laws on physical injuries caused by medical
malpractice in China, the judges reviewed numerous files and
consulted experts in Beijing before making their final judgment.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that such a law is a must, so that Chinese
judges can deal with the increasing number of disputes between
doctors and patients.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Grain Base Focuses on Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China, a major grain
production base in China, is shifting from quantity to quality in
order to make grain production more profitable.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province plans to establish a quality seed base with
400,000 yuan (48,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey, maize with rich oil, lysine, and
starch will be widely planted in the province. The acreage for soy
beans and potatoes will increase by 666,700 hectares, to account
for one fifth of cultivated land in the province.
</P>
<P>
Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces will practice crop rotation in
planting soy beans and maize.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China yields the best soy beans in the country.
However, the output of soy beans does not exceed various kinds of
grains. Consequently, China had to import more than three million
tons of soy beans each year.
</P>
<P>
Jilin will subsidize soy bean planters with 138 million yuan (
16.6 million U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesspeople are welcomed to join agricultural
reforms in Liaoning Province. The provincial government hopes to
invite foreign partners to invest in the processing of farm
products, crop planting, environmental protection, and the
agriculture high-tech sector.

<HEADLINE> More Ibises Born in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A baby crested ibis was recently born
at the Shaanxi Ibis Protection Center on the Qinling Ranges in
northwest China, and it is the 52nd ibis born there this year.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the center, this year saw a record
number of newly-born ibises. Twenty-eight were born naturally
while 24 were bred artificially.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the higher birth rate to better environment and
effective protection measures taken by the center which monitors
them 24 hours every day.
</P>
<P>
In general, reproduction and survival rates of ibises in
captivity are declining, they noted, adding that setting them free
is the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
Ibises are endangered species distinguished by its red crest,
gray plumage and hooked beak. Population has grown from merely
seven in 1981, when it was first found in northwest China, to 200
as a result of environmental protection measures adopted by the
local government. The measures include a ban on fertilizer
application and lumbering in areas close to the species natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the endangered species has been traced back to
over 60 million years ago, with large flocks formerly existing in
most of China, Japan and Germany. But now the species is found
only in China, mostly in mountainous areas in the Qinling Ranges
in northwest China.

<HEADLINE> Four Chinese Sites Apply for World Heritage Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is considering
placing four more Chinese sites in its World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO representative office in Beijing said today that the
world organization will in June examine the four sites.
</P>
<P>
The sites include the Mount Qingcheng and Dujiangyan ancient
irrigation project in southwest Sichuan Province, villages with
ancient architecture in east Anhui Province, the Longmen Grottos
in Henan Province, and the imperial mausoleums of the Ming (1368-
1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties in northern Hebei Province
outside of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee under UNESCO plans to decide on
approval of the four sites at a December conference.
</P>
<P>
Ranking fourth in the world, China has a total of 23 cultural
and natural sites included on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee established a fund for protecting
cultural and natural sites around the world in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Cultural sites are required to have historic, artistic,
archeological, scientific and anthropological value, while natural
sites must offer distinct ecological and geographical features.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Protection of World Cultural and Natural
Heritage, which UNESCO adopted in 1972, requires that all its
members preserve and safeguard the listed sites, which must be
protected during times of war.
</P>
<P>
China joined the convention in 1985, and filed an application
to join the Convention the following year. Six Chinese sites were
added to the list in 1987 -- Mount Taishan in Shandong Province,
the Great Wall and the Palace Museum in Beijing, the Mogao Grottos
in Dunhuang in Gansu Province, the Tomb of Qinshihuang in Xi'an,
capital of Shaanxi Province, and the Peking Man site near
Zhoukoudian in southwest Beijing.

METULLA, Israel, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after completing its
troop withdrawal from south Lebanon early Wednesday, Israel closed
all crossings along the Israeli-Lebanese border, announcing that
there is no single Israeli left in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Fatma Gate, the main border access the Israeli troops and
its Lebanese allies South Lebanon Army (SLA) used in the
withdrawal, was also closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Lebanese working in Israel's sea port city of Haifa
gathered at the crossing, waiting for Israel's permission to return
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that south Lebanon is now in our hands after the
Israeli withdrawal and we don't want to continue our work in
Israel, we want to return home," a young man told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't know how long we will wait here, because Israel
has closed this crossing we used to pass," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the gate is a large Israeli military base named
Good Fence. Inside the base, several military tents were set up to
temporarily house the returned Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to return home from south Lebanon," a young

<HEADLINE> 24 Abu Sayyaf Rebels Captured in Basilan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Abu Sayyaf Group has
been further decimated with the capture of 24 terrorists by the
military in southern Philippine island of Basilan during the past
few days, a military report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Canatoy, chief of the army Public Affairs Service (PAS),
said it was the biggest haul by government troops against the Abu
Sayyaf since April 22 wen they fled their mountain lair in Sumisip
Complex.
</P>
<P>
Military statistics show that more than 70 Abu Sayyaf rebels
have been neutralized since the military launched an all-out war
against the terrorist group last month.
</P>
<P>
Before the attack on Mt. Mohadji, the military estimated there
were 250 Abu Sayyaf terrorists under the leadership of Khaddafy
Janjalani.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 12 Abu Sayyaf members were captured during a
mopping-up operation by government forces. Seized from them were
seven high-powered firearms and over a thousand rounds of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Canatoy said 10 Abu Sayyaf terrorists were earlier captured on
May 20 and two others last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 members of the extremist group were killed when
government troops attacked Mt. Mohadji last month to rescue 29
civilians they took hostage on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Four of the hostages, including a priest, were executed by the
Abu Sayyaf when the soldiers were closing in.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen others were rescued and two others escaped, but the Abu
Sayyaf kidnapped a son of a slain soldier during an encounter in
Isabela last week.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, the terrorist group is holding eight hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to Canatoy, the 24 captured Abu Sayyaf members will
be charged with kidnapping-for-ransom and murder.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Govt Encourages Export Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government will
fund a new export education strategy, according to a press release
issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the release, New Zealand Associate Education Minister Steve
Maharey and Trade Negotiation Minister Jim Sutton said foreign fee-
paying students injected about 200 million U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange into the New Zealand economy last year.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Government is making available new funding in
the budget to help grow the industry and to develop a long-term
strategy to secure New Zealand's place in the increasingly
competitive global market for education services.
</P>
<P>
"The government is backing export education because we see it
as a key sunrise industry. The rapid growth of international
education during the past decade means we must treat it as an
export sector in its own right if New Zealand education providers
are to realize the potential of this market," the two ministers
said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted New Zealand export education sector can double
its annual earnings within four years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Continues to Weaken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency continued
its weakening trend on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah traded at 8,495 (buying) and 8,515 (selling) per U.S.
dollar on Wednesday morning session, compared with 8,420 and 8,450
per dollar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the PT. Central Intervest Corporation
Handoyo said the weakening of the rupiah was caused by the strong
demand for dollar in local market and other places such as Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rupiah plunged into a six-month low level of 8,
500 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said the government wants the rupiah to
strengthen back to 7,000 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank Indonesia (the
central bank) said the rupiah will continue to weaken if political
conflicts and lawlessness continued in the country.

<HEADLINE> EU to Fund COMESA Small, Medium Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has agreed
to assist in establishing a fund for Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) region, Zambia Daily Mail reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This responded a proposal that COMESA assistant secretary
general Sindiso Ngwenya put forward early this month that it was
working on the establishment of the fund for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Jochen Krebs, head of the EU delegation to Zambia, said in an
interview with the newspaper that creating centers for industrial
development in COMESA would significantly promote industrial
growth in the region that would launch a Free Trade Area (FTA) at
the end of October this year.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said that Zambia and Egypt would host the initial two
centers that would work towards the promotion of the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the onset of the FTA may create some
problems for a number of SMEs, and the fund and development
centers will be expected to provide cushion to the growing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA centers in Egypt and Zambia are expected to take off
in the next six months, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Starvation Looming In Cyclone-Hit Areas In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Starvation is looming in the Cyclone
Eline- ravaged districts in Zimbabwe as food reserves have sunk to
dangerously low levels, the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Tuesday, Red Cross Society Secretary
General Bongayi Mundeta said her organization which is actively
involved in mobilizing relief goods for flood victims is left with
only two months' food supply.
</P>
<P>
Other main actor, the Civil Protection Department, is also
running out of food.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people were left homeless and without food
when Cyclone Eline-induced floods hit the country in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mundeta said while the situation was still manageable, it was
evident that food supplies will soon run out as the number of
people in need of relief aid continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Civil Protection Department Madzudzo Pawadyira
also confirmed that food supplies will soon come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Mundeta also expressed concern over the number of children
suffering from malnutrition, which has shot up to 10,000 over the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Signs and symptoms of malnutrition are very evident in the
majority of children in the affected areas. We have started a
food supplementary program in Manicaland province and plans are
afoot to extend it to other areas hit by the floods," she said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Farmers to Lose 110 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Farm occupations by war veterans and
landless blacks in Zimbabwe have inflicted an estimated 110
million U.S. dollar damages of crops and livestock on white
commercial farmers, the Commercial Farmers' Union of Zimbabwe has
said.
</P>
<P>
Livestock losses have been estimated to be 65 million U.S.
dollars while crop losses stand at 50 million U.S. dollars, the
daily Herald quoted Vice- President of the union Collin Cloete as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cloete said the forecast of the wheat crop was down by 30
percent from last year's 325,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He said if the farm occupations continue, there would be a
further decrease in the commodity.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of soya bean farms had been occupied by war
veterans. The quality of the crop had been affected by delays in
harvesting and additional exposure to rain.
</P>
<P>
Cloete said farm occupations had also affected cotton
production as there is now a shortage of casual cotton pickers.
</P>
<P>
There is an estimated five percent or 40,000 tons loss of grain
due to increased theft, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The late announcement of this year's maize producer price,
coupled with the uncertainty in the industry relating to maize
marketing and the current environment of farm invasions, could
result in a reduction of 15 percent in the 2000/2001 production
season," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other major losses have been forecast in horticulture, coffee,
the dairy sector, beef and poultry sectors.
</P>
<P>
War veterans have occupied about 1,000 white farms since
February to press for an equitable redistribution of land.
Negotiations are going on between the government, farmers and war
veterans to resolve the matter.

MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia has not changed and will not
change its stand on the Taiwan issue after the new leadership of
China's Taiwan province came into office on May 20, said the
Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moscow proceeds from the fact that there is only one China in
the world, while the government of the People's Republic of China
is its only legitimate government, the ministry stressed in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It notes that Moscow does not maintain any interstate relations
with Taiwan and develops with it mutually advantageous trade,
economic, scientific, cultural and sport ties on a strictly
informal basis.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation regards relations between the PRC and
Taiwan as China's internal affair, the ministry stated.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Meet in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from 19
member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
met here Wednesday to discuss a whole range of issues including
the U.S. national missile defense system (NMD), Russia as well as
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General George Robertson said at the opening
session of the two-day meeting that these issues are key to
guarding the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and making the
military alliance ready to face the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright brought to
Florence an American initiative of trading weapons within NATO so
as to help patrol the exports of high-technology weaponry to non-
NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the American initiative was also aimed at
promoting the interoperability, a NATO jargon for weaponry
standardization. The 78-day NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia
last year exposed problems in weaponry standardization among its
member states.
</P>
<P>
The European allies, however, expressed their worries about the
NMD which may only cover North America. They warned that the
project could provoke another round of arms race.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is joining the meeting
later Wednesday. It will be the first time that the Russian
foreign affairs chief meets with NATO counterparts after the
western military alliance slighted Russian opposition to air
strikes against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
NATO is trying to amend its relations with Russia and was
persuading the Russians to allow it to open, as planned, a liaison
office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers are expected to take stock of their
Kosovo peacekeeping mission as NATO-led multinational troops have
been stationed in the Yugoslav province for almost a year by now.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Rises 10.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
rose 10.3 percent in April from a year earlier to 1,143.9 billion
yen (10.7 billion U.S. dollars) as an upsurge in exports
outperformed an increase in imports, the Finance Ministry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The double-digit growth, which follows a 14.9 percent decline
in the surplus in March, is attributed to increasing shipments to
Asia and the United States, the ministry said in a preliminary
report.
</P>
<P>
Overall exports in April totaled 4,376.6 billion yen (40.9
billion dollars), up 8.8 percent, while imports came to 3,232.8
billion yen (30.2 billion dollars), up 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew as shipments of semiconductors and other
electronic parts, autos and optical equipment for scientific use
gained 21.6 percent, 7.7 percent, and 17.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Imports were also up, helped by a 68.5 percent jump in crude
oil purchases, a 46.9 percent rise in liquefied natural gas
imports and a 16.3 percent gain in office equipment procurement.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S.
climbed 26.2 percent to 725.3 billion yen (6.8 billion dollars),
marking the third consecutive month of growth.
</P>
<P>
With other Asian countries, Japan's trade surplus jumped 55.4
percent to 443.9 billion yen (4.1 billion dollars) on the back of
a recovering trend in the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the 15-member European
Union (EU) decreased 2.6 percent to 347.1 billion yen (3.2 billion
dollars), posting the first decline in three months.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustments for
seasonal variations.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Step up Anti-doping Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A top world soccer official on
Wednesday announced plans to step up anti-doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Michel D'Hooghe, president of FIFA's medical commission, said
the world body and UEFA's medical commission had decided to
conduct out-of-competition testing for the first time during the
run-up to the Euro 2000 finals, which start on June 10.
</P>
<P>
"We have the conviction that some athletes take some products,
namely anabolic steroids, during the preparation period," he said
in a keynote address at the Second Asian Congress on Science and
Football.
</P>
<P>
"If doping tests are done only during the games, the
metabolites of these products have disappeared from the urine," he
said.
</P>
<P>
D'Hooghe said random tests would be conducted on four of the 16
teams in the tournament. In the 2002 World Cup six to eight teams
would be tested.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference later that doping in soccer was now
"relatively under control. Let's keep it that way. But we should
continue to be vigilant by conducting random checks."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA medical chief said in the last six months only two to
three cases were reported worldwide but the world body views the
battle seriously.

In his speech at the congress, organized by the Asian Football
Confederation, D'Hooghe said FIFA gave great attention to fighting
doping because the effects on athletes in general can be
catastrophical.
</P>
<P>
"Amphetamines caused the deaths of many young athletes.
Combination of many products such as cocaine and anabolic hormones
led to irreversible psychotic reactions," he said
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the use of performance-enhancing drugs such
as EPO, somatotropic hormones and perfluorocarbons.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that we will never win the fight against doping
-- new products will continue to enter the scene and we will
always be behind the detection.
</P>
<P>
"There is an important parallel market (the doping industry)
providing young athletes with forbidden and dangerous products," D
'Hooghe said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest study of the origins
of major Chinese surnames shows that 73 of the 100 most common
Chinese surnames originated in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has just received a delegation of business people
from Taiwan who came to the province in search of their roots.
Clansmen of several major surnames in Taiwan, such as Chen, Lin,
Ye, Huang, Zheng, Li, Xu, and Cai, have been coming to Henan for
the past several years to take part in ancestor worship activities
in the provincial hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the four biggest names in Taiwan, Chen,
Lin, Huang, and Zheng, are all rooted in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics indicate that arrivals of people from the
island province of Taiwan to visit their relatives and friends in
Henan have totaled more than one million since 1987, and 40
percent of them held memorial ceremonies for their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over 20 organizations and 100 scholars
devoted to the study of Chinese surnames in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Henan was once the center of ancient China, and its cities of
Luoyang and Kaifeng were the capitals of many dynasties.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that as high as
90 percent of obese children in this north China's port city
suffer from fatty liver disease.
</P>
<P>
The survey on the relationship between blood pressure, blood
fat and fatty liver was carried out by the Tianjin Aimin Weight
Reduction Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The survey on 1,200-plus obese children revealed that the blood
fat level in these children is much higher than other children of
the same age. Thirty-five percent of the rather fat children
suffer from high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
In China, incidence of animal fat stored in the fatty tissue of
the body among Chinese children is on rise. Experts said most
parents think that the more their children eat the better. However,
they do not realize what harm this is doing on their children,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Experts concluded that the children's liver cells become fatty
because they absorb too much nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Experts also warned that high blood pressure and blood fat are
dangerous signals of fatty liver among obese children.

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Of all the counties and county-

government judicial departments for the promotion of legal
services, the Ministry of Justice said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the ministry said that the country's
grassroots legal service framework is comprehensive, and is
playing an important role in maintaining social stability and
social order.
</P>
<P>
The services of the judicial administrative bodies now have
been extended to towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the 2,640 county-level judicial
administrative bodies nationwide, there are more than 3,000 law
firms, 2,793 notary offices, and one million legal mediation
centers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 million legal mediators have handled 130 million
civil disputes over the past 20 years, preventing these disputes
from escalating into criminal cases, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the services of grassroots legal professionals and
government bodies, the ministry has issued regulations on the
operations of government-funded grassroots legal service agencies,
and on the qualifications for their employees.

<P>
Grassroots legal service agencies are operated by judicial
departments across the country to provide both paid and free legal
services to the public, including legal aid for the poor.
</P>
<P>
There are 119,000 legal service workers in 35,000 grassroots
agencies located in 74 percent of the country's rural towns and in
neighborhood communities in cities. In 1999, these people served
as regular legal consultants for 400,000 enterprises, institutions,
and individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, last year, these
legal service workers handled 1.86 million cases, mediated in 1.06
million disputes, notarized 2.75 million legal documents, provided
legal consultations to 11.83 million, and avoided or recovered
economic losses of 14 billion yuan for the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has mapped out rules for the establishment,
operating mechanism, and management of grassroots legal service
agencies, and qualifications for legal service workers, their
rights and responsibilities, as well as methods of management and
supervision of their work.
</P>
<P>
To maintain social justice, the ministry has said that special
centers for legal aid to the poor should be set up in all the
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities by the end of
this year, and two-thirds of all counties should be equipped with
such centers. In two to three years, each county and town with a
People's Court should be accompanied by at least one legal aid
center, according to ministerial plan.
</P>

Legal service hotlines with the uniform number "148" have been
opened across the nation, and their services will be further
improved in the years to come, the ministry pledged.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension in Bangladeshi Enclave in India Worsens  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The tension in a Bangladeshi enclave
inside Indian territory has worsened following a fresh report that
India's Border Security Force (BSF) personnel abducted 11
Bangladeshis from the enclave early Tuesday Morning.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Bangladeshi citizens were abducted from the Mashaldanga
enclave under the district of Kurigram, about 400 kilometers
northwest of Dhaka, while Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and BSF held a
Company Commander-level flag meeting to settle the Mashaldanga
enclave incident which took place last Thursday, The Independent
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Indians, allegedly supported by BSF personnel,
intruded into the Bangladeshi enclave of Mashaldanga, and abducted
Bangladesh nationals, set ablaze 55 houses and looted valuables
and cattle.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi nationals were, however, released later, while
more than 10 women and children reportedly received injuries
during the attack lasting at least one hour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enclave is reported to be in acute shortage of
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its more than 2,
000 inhabitants, who are now virtually confined in the Indian
territory since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government is closely watching the situation in
Mashaldanga enclave. When asked if the government has any plan to
lodge official protest with the Indian government, Syed Moudud Ali,
a director general of the Foreign office, said they are waiting
for latest development over there.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Secretary General of main opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan on Tuesday
expressed grave concern over the continued attack by Indian
terrorists backed by Indian border guards in Mashaldanga enclave.
He demanded the government to take immediate steps to stop such
attacks from across the border.
</P>
<P>
During the company commander-level flag meeting Tuesday, the
BDR and the BSF agreed to conduct a joint inquiry into the
Mashaldanga enclave incident which took place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, "BSF took responsibilities" for
the incident and assured their BDR counterpart of taking pragmatic
steps to stem recurrence of such incidents in the future. They
also agreed to ensure security to more than 2,000 people of the
517-acre enclave.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked about the abduction of the 11 persons from
the enclave, the BSF did not admit the allegation, saying those
people might be picked up by Central Reserve Police of India.
</P>
<P>
Since the company commander-level meeting was not productive as
expected, sources said a battalion commander-level meeting between
the two border forces is likely to take place within a couple of
days, at which all enclave issues will be discussed and the
proposed high-level joint inquiry committee will be formed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Welcomes India's Offer to Evacuate Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If the situation arises and India can help, we will welcome it,
but I don't know if the ground situation is such that we need to
evacuate the troops immediately," Sri Lankan Deputy Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kiriella was quoted as saying in the port city
of Chennai in south India on Wednesday morning before leaving for
Colombo. Kiriella was said to have been in Chennai and Bangalore
on a "private visit" since May 20.
</P>
<P>
India decided on Tuesday that it would help evacuate Sri Lankan
armymen trapped in Jaffna peninsula provided the Sri Lankan
government raised a formal request under some "proper conditions."
</P>
<P>
The next four or five days would be very crucial, as it would
then be known whether the situation requires measures like
evacuation, Kiriella told the press in Chennai. "It all depends on
the ground situation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the Sri Lankan government would "do
anything to create a peaceful environment in Jaffna" for the
safety of any Indian evacuation mission, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on New Delhi's overall approach to the present
situation in Sri Lanka, the minister said his country understood
India's limitations, given the fact that there is a coalition
regime now, whereas in 1987, when India intervened in the ethnic
crisis in Sri Lanka, the Congress government under Rajiv Gandhi
was "all powerful."
</P>
<P>
He said that prospects for peace are better now as, unlike in
1987 when India alone was involved, several other countries like
Norway and the United States are now eager to resolve the problem.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Unrest Affects Philippine Economy (Part 1)  By Chen Zhanjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of 2000, the
escalating fighting between government troops and Moro rebels, the
long-running hostage saga, and the bombings incidents across the
country are affecting the Philippines' economy.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the political unrest has turned the local stock market
to the worst-performing one in Asia marked by the continued free-
fall.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 33-share main index in the Philippine Stock
Exchange plunged to a new 19-month low at 1,421.09 due to broad-
based selloff. On Tuesday, the index lost a further 7.42 points to
1,404.67, which is nearly off 35 percent from the close of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the stock market, the Philippine peso breached the
support level of 42 pesos against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, also
hitting a 19-month low.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 42.37 pesos against the U.S. dollar
at the Philippine Dealing System, shedding an additional 45.5
centavos from Monday's 41.915 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the heightened political risk arising out of the
intensified Moro insurgency in Mindanao and the dragging-on of a
foreign-hostage crisis in Jolo island would further depress
markets already hurt by prospects of slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of two shopping malls in Metro Manila, including
the largest one in the country, sparked concern that the military
conflict in Mindanao may be spilling over into the national
capital region, they said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attacks followed a flare up in fighting between
government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) members
in Mindanao which has left 113 government soldiers dead and nearly
500 wounded so far.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides have principally agreed to resume peace
talks on May 30, the conflict in Mindanao is far from over. The 15,
000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent Islamic state
in the south for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has warned that negotiations with the
1,000-man Abu Sayyaf which is holding 21 hostages in Jolo island
could last for "months." The hostages, including 10 western
tourists, were seized from a Malaysian resort on April 23.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Begins Debate on PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives began debate Tuesday on a landmark legislation to
grant China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status, one
day before its vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the passage of the bill would spur reform in
China and benefit U.S. companies eager to enter the vast Chinese
market while opponents argued that it would harm employment in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In the two-hour debate, Representative David Dreier, chairman
of the House Rules Committee, said that the trade bill before the
House was "the single most important vote this session."
</P>
<P>
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer called it "the
most important vote we will make, not only in this Congress, but
perhaps in our total careers."
</P>
<P>
"China represents over one-quarter of the world's population,"
said the Republican representative form Texas. "Over one billion
people will not be ignored in the international marketplace."
</P>
<P>
As the debate opened in the House, President Bill Clinton sent
a letter to all members of Congress, urging them to vote for the
bill.
</P>
<P>
"If we want prosperity for our people, if we want to stand for
freedom, if we want peace and security for our nation and the
world, I believe the choice is clear: We must extend permanent
normal trade relations for China," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Supporters seemed to be more optimistic about the passage of
the bill after 11 Democrats in the House announced their support
for PNTR with China Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders said they would hopefully deliver about 150
votes, and possibly more, in favor of the bill while California
Representative Robert Matsui, the top Democratic vote-counter,
said his goal of 70 to 80 Democratic supporters was finally within
reach.
</P>
<P>
So far 68 Democrats have publicly announced their support for
the trade bill. The House needs a support of 218 Congressmen to
pass the Bill.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to win tomorrow. I am convinced we are on track
for victory," said Dreier.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also sounded more optimistic Tuesday, saying, "I think
we're going to make it."

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Construction of Flood-Control System Along Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The flood-control system along the
Yangtze River, China's longest river, is scheduled to be completed
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Li Antian, executive deputy general commander of the Yangtze
River Flood Control General Headquarters said here recently that
by 2010, the river valley will be well protected from severe
floods.
</P>
<P>
China began constructing the anti-flood system decades ago and
has since built a great number of reservoirs, floodwater-storing
areas as well as 30,000 km of embankments along the river.
</P>
<P>
The country has accelerated construction of the system since
1998, when it suffered its worst flood on the Yangtze in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The largest water conservancy project currently under
construction is the Three Gorges Project in Yichang, a city in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, as the project will be operational by 2009, it
will be able to store 22.15 billion cubic meters of floodwater,
greatly alleviating the pressure of floods on cities located on
the riverside.
</P>
<P>
More dam-reinforcing projects will be launched this year, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> China Simplifies Procedures For Chinese Going Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 11,736 individuals in
north China's Tianjin municipality went abroad on private business
in the first quarter of the year, a rise of 50 percent over that
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Tianjin Bureau in charge of entry and exit
visas attributed this to the simplified application procedures
issued at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new amendments, 4,000 U.S. dollars is all that
a local citizen needs to apply for a passport to travel or study
abroad. Those who want to go abroad self-funded just need to show
their acceptance notices from a foreign university when applying
for a passport.
</P>
<P>
Procedures for working and doing business in foreign countries
have also been simplified.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 2,414 Tianjiners went abroad for travel, and 1,373
to Macao and Hong Kong, four times more than during the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter, 2,024 Tianjiners went overseas for
business and seventy-six left China for jobs in other countries.
There were also 522 people who went abroad to study, 70 percent
more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The new amendments also saw a 78 percent of increase in
applicants visiting friends and family members abroad, totaling 4,
618 in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Actively Tap New Energy Sources in 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China is working out a plan to
actively develop various new and renewable energy sources in the
21st century, focusing on water, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal
resources, in a bid to make up for the declining production of
traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Chengchun, deputy director in charge of the
energy development committee under the China Energy Research
Society (CERS), China is very rich in new and renewable energy
sources. He cited statistics showing that China has recoverable
wind energy sources of 254 million kw, geothermal sources of 3.5
million kw, and tidal energy sources of more than 20 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing seminar on China's energy development
strategy for the 21st century, the senior energy expert said that
China's vast rural areas have nearly 300 million tons of
biological materials for developing methane gas.
</P>
<P>
To date, China's annual utilization rate of new and renewable
energy has reached 300 million tons of standard coal.

<HEADLINE> China To Launch Massive Hydropower Construction in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China expects to see a booming
development of hydropower in the 21st century, with total
hydropower capacity reaching 125 million kw by 2010, or 33.1
percent of the country's exploitable hydropower resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Pan Jiazheng, deputy president of the China
Engineering Academy, China is has some of the richest hydropower
resources in the world, with exploitable water energy resources
estimated at 378 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Hydropower projects at Three Gorges, Xiaolangdi, and Ertan in
Sichuan Province are the largest such projects in the world, the
senior expert said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing seminar on China's energy development
strategy for 21st century, Pan said that China aims to develop
additional hydropower capacity ranging between 80 million kw and
100 million kw in the first 20 years in the 21st century, and
hydropower generating units with capacity totaling four to five
million kw on average to be put into operation annually.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in developing its
hydropower industry since the founding of New China in 1949,
particularly since the launching of the reform and opening-up
policy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Total generating capacity and annual electricity output have
risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh in 1949 to the present
53 million kw and 190 billion kwh, respectively. As a result,
China now ranks third in the world in hydropower generating
capacity and production.
</P>
<P>
However, much needs to be done to exploit the country's
enormous hydropower resources, Pan said, adding that the country's
total hydropower generating capacity accounts for only 13.8
percent of the exploitable potential, a figure lower than the
world average.

<HEADLINE> Israel Completes Withdrawal from South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops poured out of south
Lebanon into Israel under the cover of darkness on Wednesday,
ending 22 years of occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is also defense
minister, ordered in small hours of Wednesday all the Israeli
troops to quit south Lebanon. He also appealed to all sides to show
restraint.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the decision of the security cabinet on
Monday, May 22, 2000, which empowers the prime minister and defense
minister, in consultation with the chief of general staff, to
decide on the date of the withdrawal from Lebanon, the prime
minister and defense minister ordered the withdrawal of the Israel
Defense Forces from Lebanon," Barak's order said.
</P>
<P>
While issuing the order, Barak also calls on the power factors
in Lebanon to exercise restraint and responsibility, and says that
Israel will react severely to any attack on its sovereignty, its
civilians and its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Israeli-Lebanese border said during the
withdrawal, tanks and armoured personnel carriers loaded with
soldiers entered Israel through various border crossings. The
armoured cars kicked up dust as they rumbled across the border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military said all of the outposts belonging to the
Israeli army and its South Lebanon Army (SLA) allies in the
security zone had been abandoned and most were blown up.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the pullout operations, the sound of heavy shelling
could be heard, the sky dyed red by flares Israeli aircraft
launched to light the way out. But no one was hurt, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, accusing Syria of doing all it could to sabotage the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, it has been preparing the ground for violent acts
against Israel" after its withdrawal was completed, Barak said in
the letter, urging the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces
into south Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
While the withdrawal was going on, thousands of SLA and their
family members sought refugee in Israel and nearly 4,000 of them
have already entered Israel during the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Official announcement of the completion of withdrawal is
expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Israel deployed in south Lebanon from 1978 with the self-
declared purpose of halting cross-border attacks and set up the
security zone in 1985 for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates Says "Yes, More Trade With China" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. president Bill
Gates wrote in Tuesday's Washington Post calling U.S. Congress to
grant China the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status.
</P>
<P>
In an article titled "Yes, More Trade With China," Gates said
he could not agree more with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's recent comment that the outcome of the PNTR vote
outcome will have profound implications for the free trading
system and the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
"What the vote on PNTR really comes down to is whether the
United States is going to join with other major countries in
Europe, Asia and elsewhere in creating open global markets or is
going to forgo the opportunity to benefit from a fast-growing
Chinese marketplace," Gates wrote.
</P>
<P>
Although only a small percentage of Microsoft's revenues come
from China today, Bill Gates, the company's chief software
architect said, "we are making large investments there because we
believe in its future."
</P>
<P>
The reason is that not only Chinese market is a place for
Microsoft to do business but also a fertile source of new ideas
about how technology can improve people's lives, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gates said that the investments they are making today will have
a direct, beneficial impact on Microsoft and many other U.S.
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities are virtually limitless as the Chinese
market for software grows, as China expands its information
technology infrastructure, as intellectual property protections
continue to advance and as U.S. companies develop new products for
the most populous nation in the world," said Gates.
</P>
<P>
The vote for PNTR is a vote for American jobs and trade
opportunities in today's competitive global economy, and "a vote
for a closer and more secure world," Gates concluded.

<HEADLINE> Further U.S. Rate Hike to Threaten Thai Recovery: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arporn Chewakrengkai, economic adviser to Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, was quoted by Wednesday's the Nation newspaper as
saying that a half-point hike would be acceptable for the country,
which still has enough liquidity of capital in the economic system.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, if the United States tightens the screws on
interest rates more than expected, say by one percent, it could
start creating problems for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Arporn explained that a wider rate gap between the U.S. and
Thailand will result in more foreign capital flowing out of the
latter as investors sought higher gains for parking money in the
former.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. decided to nudge up its short-term interest
by half percentage point, and signaled that more increase is
likely after the five rate hikes in the past 10 months had done
little to slow down the over-heated U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Thai financial markets as well as the neighboring markets saw a
heavy sell-off driven by offshore investors after the U.S. rate
hike last week. The Thai stock market plunged to a 15-month low,
and the baht broke through its psychological level of 39 against
the US dollar.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Five Challenges in New Millennium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua)-- China is facing five challenges in
the next century, which will bring about significant social
demands for science technology, said Zhou Guangzhao, chairman of
the China Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The first challenge is the aging population. China's population
will reach 1.3 billion by the end of this century and is expected
to top 1.6 billion by the middle of next century, Zhou said at the
on-going 2000 Beijing Science Week.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the second challenge. One quarter of the country
's land is dry and its arable land is decreasing.
</P>
<P>
Energy is the third challenge. Since 1993, China has become a
net importer of petroleum. However, China still needs petroleum,
with the gap estimated at 100 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Environment is the fourth challenge. Drying lakes and rivers,
desertification, salinization and deterioration of grasslands. Of
the world's first 10 air-polluted cities listed by the World
Health Organization (WHO), seven are in China.
</P>
<P>
The last challenge facing China lies in the information sector.
The core of the information industry, such as CPU chips and
computer operating systems are dominated by foreign companies.
Some important computer and network accessories, sensors and
applied software are not protected by intellectual property rights,
Zhou warned.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Industry Meets Challenges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- As China's entry into the WTO
approaches, the country's insurance sector will face fierce
competition from its overseas counterparts, according to industry
insiders.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance businesses are run by more than twenty
insurance companies including state-owned, share-holding as well
as joint-ventures.
</P>
<P>
The sector's total assets has reached 230 billion yuan, and
annual insurance premiums have exceeded 120 billion yuan, a rise
of 270 times compared with 1980.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance companies used to get their business mainly
from state-owned enterprises, but now they have turned to family
insurance.
</P>
<P>
There are now tens of thousands of people engaged in family
insurance marketing which is now viewed as the foundation of China
's insurance.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Sheng, an official of the insurance company in
Jilin Province, China will shift its focus from group insurance to
family insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will allow more room to develop the
insurance market. Approved by the State Council, insurance capital
can be used to buy and sell securities. The China Life Insurance
Co. is now leading the sector in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that incentives should be introduced to increase
efficiency.

<HEADLINE> More Legal Aid Provided for Disabled People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- As many as 2,642 law firms across
the country have been designated by the China Disabled Persons
Federation to provide legal aid for the disabled, an official from
the federation disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 251 prefectures and cities and 1,273
counties have established Legal Aid Centers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Other legal institutions such as notary offices, legal-aid
volunteers organizations have also offered legal counseling, legal
aid and other legal services to protect the legitimate rights of
handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
Providing aid for the disabled has become a hot topic of
concern after U.S. movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger began his
Special Olympics China Millennium March on May 18.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, the State Council held a gathering to award
outstanding aid-the-disabled volunteers across the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Launches New Farming Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
designed a new farming concept to help boost efficiency in the
agricultural sector, according to Minister of Agriculture M.
Prakosa.
</P>
<P>
Under the corporate farming concept, small farm areas of
between 0.3 of a hectare and 0.4 of a hectare would be
consolidated into a corporate farming unit with a land size of
between 100 hectares and 150 hectares for efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"This will help improve the welfare of the farmers," the
minister was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the new concept, each owner of small farmland would
become "shareholders" in the corporate farming unit. The corporate
farming unit would be managed by a professional farm manager
appointed by the shareholders. A corporate farming unit with
greater land size would encourage the use of modern farming
technology and a better marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
Prakosa said several pilot projects in Central Java, West Java,
South Sulawesi and Sumatera were recently implemented.
</P>
<P>
The new concept was expected to become a national program at
the upcoming 2001 planting season, he said, adding that the new
concept would not be limited to rice farming but was open to other
commodities depending on the farming condition of each area.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the agricultural sector was the backbone of
the country's economy, contributing a third to the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five years, the agricultural sector will remain
the prime mover of our economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prakosa said the new corporate farming unit was expected to be
able to boost domestic rice production by about 20 percent once it
was fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rice production this year is expected to reach 51
million tons of unhusked rice, compared to 49.9 million tons last
year.

<HEADLINE> June 7 Declared As S. Lankan War Heroes Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a special message to the nation Tuesday night, the President
called for the eschewing of all party considerations and to unite
to safeguard the nation, join hands and fight together to achieve
victory.
</P>
<P>
She has called for the observation of two minutes silence in
honor of the war heroes.
</P>
<P>
The President said that the security forces were leading the
forefront of the battle in a fearless and courageous manner to
prevent a division of the country. They had deep resolve to
achieve victory.
</P>
<P>
She added that not only the war heroes but their parents
spouses.children, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends were
acting with a great sense of dedication.
</P>
<P>
The whole nation's gratitude was due to the parents and
relatives for sending their youthful sons to the battlefront.
</P>
<P>
She said the people of Sri Lanka in their entirety are today
facing a most decisive moment in their history.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that "The whole nation is facing a
grave crisis as regards national security. We have to face the
battle of protecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
unity of the country and safeguarding the people".
</P>
<P>
It is heartening that most people have volunteered to make
lavish contributions towards the battle against terrorism. However,
when the soldiers are engaged in battle sacrificing their own
lives it will be morally wrong for others to conduct various
celebrations and rejoice,she added in her message.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government troops are fighting in north of the
country with the Tamil rebels, which are fighting for a separate
state in the island country and recently launched fierce attacks

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slaps West for Barring It From Dayton Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday strongly
condemned the U.S.-led West for blocking it from attending the
Dayton meeting, which is being held in Brussels on Tuesday and
Wednesday to review the Dayton peace accord's implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said the West's act to bar Yugoslavia's
participation in the gathering of foreign ministers from the
countries that signed the 1995 peace accord has violated the
Dayton treaty and undermined peace and stability in the region,
the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the West has also grossly violated U.N. Security
Council Resolutions 1022 and 1031, under which Yugoslavia, one of
the parties that signed the peace agreement, has the equal right
to see to it that the agreement is implemented, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnia peace agreement, reached in Dayton, Ohio, the
United States, in November 1995 by leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and
Croatia, under the mediation of Russia and major Western countries
including the United States, Britain, Germany and France, put an
end to the three-and-a-half-year war in the former Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditional ally of Yugoslavia, has boycotted the
Brussels meeting by not sending representatives.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia warned the United States and its European followers
that they must take full responsibility for all the consequences
resulting from the violations of the Dayton peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Stocks Down Below 9,000 Points Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada's benchmark Toronto Stock
Exchange (TSE) 300 Index closed down 306.56 points Tuesday to 8,
986.60, the biggest single-day drop for the month.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time for TSE to be dragged down below 9,
000 this month after the main stock index recovered from its
record losing week in mid-April, when the stocks tumbled more than
1,000 points below 9,000 from eye-popping highs of up to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's plunge resulted from concerns about uncertainties of
technology stocks and, particularly, interest rates, which were
feared to be raised again to affect the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The index, however, is still up 573 points for this year.
</P>
<P>
Leading the way down was 724 Solutions Inc. (SVN-T), which lost
12.70 Canadian dollars (about 8.49 U.S. dollars) to sit at 50
dollars (about 33.42 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another falling tech heavyweight is Nortel Networks Corp. (NT-T)
, which was off 5.90 dollars (about 3.94 U.S. dollars) at 72.95 (
about 48.75 U.S. dollars).

CANBERRA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government
Wednesday said the Sydney International Airport was well equipped
to handle an expected rush leading into the September 15-October 1
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic control had altered landing schedules to allow the
airport to process an average of 4,000 passengers per hour, which

</P>
<P>
Federal Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said: "We'll be
ready to handle it even if there are variations to the slot times
that have been identified."
</P>
<P>
Ruddock noted that the first of an estimated 50,000 electronic

would also reduce queuing times for customs and immigration
processing.
</P>
<P>
He said the peak time for arrivals was expected to be two to
three days before the Opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Fund Industry Welcomes Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China is wrapping up co-operation
with foreign fund management companies to promote reform in its
fund industry and facilitate the introduction of open-ended fund,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"We need reform that brings renovation and a more diversified
structure of the stock market to feed different direct financing
requirements," said Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the securities
watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the fund industry plays a pivotal role in
the reform. It should be bold and creative, and based on
experience from abroad," Zhou said while addressing an
international seminar on fund management in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment managers are welcome to provide technical
assistance to help China design a feasible growing mode for the
funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign experience will also make China
better prepared for the opening of the stock market after its
expected entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). "When time
is ripe, I mean, after China's accession to WTO, we will set up a
jointly-invested fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
Top legislators confirmed recently that China will allow
foreign investors to set up jointly invested fund management firms
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Through professional investment management and concrete
information sources, the fund will help upgrade investment
efficiency and lower the cost of trading in China's stock market,
which is still dominated by retailers and calls for more
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
It needs enhanced confidence among the public in fund
management and a clearer legal framework, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 10 fund management companies and 25 funds
operating 51.1 billion yuan (about 16 billion US dollars), all of
them belonging to a close-ended securities investment fund."

<P>
While the chiefs were meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II army
barracks on a hill 6 km outside Suva, the capital itself was
becoming increasingly tense.
</P>
<P>
A chicken factory was burnt down overnight, there were reports
of outlying villages being pillaged and torched, and the general
mood was tense after the chiefs Tuesday threw their support behind
Ratu Mara and not the coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists Wednesday morning began leaving the
parliamentary compound in central Suva where coup leader George
Speight is holding Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and
several ministers hostage.
</P>
<P>
Reporters left about 8 a.m. Fiji time Wednesday after becoming
concerned for their safety when Speight angrily accused the
international media of portraying him as a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
Speight rejected Tuesday's decision by the nation's Great
Council of Chiefs to support Ratu Mara.
</P>
<P>
As members of the Great Council of Chiefs met, United Nations
and Commonwealth representatives arrived to try to help resolve
the Pacific Island nation's crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UN's East Timor representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello,
arrived along with Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon and
both went into talks with Mara.
</P>
<P>
Vieira de Mello said he hoped there would be a role for the U.N.
to play in a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the secretary general sent me here," he said,
adding it was too early to say if he would meet Speight.

MADRID, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Spanish and French leaders held a
summit meeting Tuesday in Santander, a city in northern Spain, to
exchange views on cracking down on terrorist activities,
structural reform of the European Union (EU), and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Attending the summit were Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, French President Jacques Chirac, Primer Minister Lionel
Jospin, and 13 ministers from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Spain and France are satisfied with what they have
achieved in bilateral cooperation, especially in cracking down on
terrorist activities. They also admitted however that more
efforts should be made to improve work in this regard, and
coordinate with local police and judicial departments in a bid to
weaken and eventually smash the terrorist organization ETA.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac said at the meeting that more measures should
be adopted to reform the structure of the EU when France takes
over its office. Both sides agreed that a decision should be made
without delay on the expansion of the EU, supporting the euro
dollar, and developing the local economy.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, they also exchanged views on improving the
prospects of economic situations in Europe and Latin America,
cooperation between Europe and Mediterranean countries, the
situation in the Middle East, as well as transportation and
economic cooperation between Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
The first summit meeting between Spain and France occurred in
Madrid in 1987. Since then, a meeting has been held annually in
both countries in turn. Spain and France maintain good economic
relations and trade. France is Spain's largest trade partner. In
1999, trade between the two countries amounted to 7,000 billion
Pesetas (about 38.88 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tories File Suit over Party Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Progressive Conservative Party
of Canada filed suit Tuesday against the newly formed Canadian
Reform Conservative Alliance for using the word "Conservative."
</P>
<P>
The federal Tories, who hold 20 seats in parliament, accused
the Alliance of violating the Trademarks Act by stealing their
party name.
</P>
<P>
"The basis of the lawsuit is that the PC party has continuously
used the word Conservative since the formation of the party before
confederation" and "the name is something that we have to actively
protect," said a Conservative party statement.
</P>
<P>
The Tories brought the case to the Federal Court before the
leadership vote next month by the alliance, which was formed in
March by the former official opposition Reform Party and
provincial Conservatives mainly from Alberta and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the alliance was reported to cause an exodus
from the federal Tories, who prefer to remain independent and
believe the defection is rooted in a "calculated and deliberate
attempt" by the alliance to give the false impression the two
parties have formed a political alliance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Canada's chief electoral officer, Jean-Pierre
Kingsley, rejected a Tory objection by ruling that the name of the
alliance "does not so resemble" other party names in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the Tories vowed to fight on for the exclusive use of the
party label "Conservative." The newly filed suit could take six
months to two years, according to the Conservative party.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Operate Licensing System for European Clubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- European soccer clubs will soon have
to gain a UEFA license if they want to compete in UEFA's club
competitions, its executive committee agreed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The licenses will be issued only if a club satisfies four
criteria regarding infrastructure and administration, and
financial, legal and sporting matters.
</P>
<P>
A working party chaired by UEFA vice president Senes Erzik of
Turkey has been looking into licensing clubs, and the new system
could start in 2002.
</P>
<P>
One of the innovations is that a club will not gain a license
unless it operates a youth development system which UEFA hopes in
time to see encompass youngsters from the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
Countries like Spain and Germany already operate a licensing
system for their senior clubs.
</P>
<P>
Studer said it would be up to UEFA's 51 national associations
to monitor the system on behalf of the ruling body.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Confront Psychological Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese today are
paying attention to psychological health thanks to better
standards of life and higher levels of education.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows an increasing numbers of Chinese aged
between 20 to 40 are turning to psychologists for help and
guidance.
</P>
<P>
Psychological problems such as anxiety and depression are the
greatest threat to the health of Chinese people, said
psychologists in north China's Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Too much concern for material gain and fierce competition in
the job market have contributed to the increasing anxiety and
depression among the younger generation, said medical experts.
</P>
<P>
As for children, they are all doted upon by family members.
Their demands are invariably answered by parents or grandparents.
This will make it difficult for them to accept rejection in the
future. These children should not have unrealistic expectations
from their parents. They are required to be top students and win
contests and games at school.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, many hospitals in China have opened
psychological consultation centers. Some 30 percent of the Tianjin
universities have set up such centers to help students. The
Ministry of Education is planning to include psychological health
as a subject in primary schooling programs.
</P>
<P>
Psychological illnesses may also cause physical problems such
as high blood pressure, cancer, and coronary heart disease, said
medical experts, adding that today more young people are diagnosed
with tumors which may be linked to their unhealthy psychological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 to 30 percent of Chinese students are found to suffer
from various psychological problems. A document issued at a recent
seminar among Chinese and American psychiatrists in Tianjin show
that depression is ranked first among all the psychological
illnesses. Suicide is the most serious problem affecting people
aged between 15 and 35.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the feasibility
study for building a 351-km-long railway in the Yangtze River
delta.
</P>
<P>
The new railway will run from Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, through Yangzhou and Taizhou to Nantong, all
booming cities in the same province.
</P>
<P>
Capital needed for the construction of the railway line, which
is estimated at about 3.76 billion yuan (about 453 million US
dollars), will be provided by China's Ministry of Railways and the
Jiangsu Provincial Government.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River delta is well-known for its prosperous
industries of petro-chemicals, iron and steel, home electrical
appliances, shipbuilding, textile, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the new railway will help accelerate the
development of the regional economy.

<P>
CHONGQING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The county of Dazu in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality will host an international art
festival from June 5 to 10.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day event, business, trade and tourism promotion
activities and cultural exchanges will also be held. Meanwhile,
the county will open a group of new scenic spots and three new
tourism routes.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies will be worked out to encourage domestic

local senior official.
</P>
<P>
Dazu, well known for more than 50,000 stone sculptures in
northwestern Chongqing, was put on the World Heritage List in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the sculptures were carved during the late Tang
Dynasty (618-907) and the Song Dynasty (960-1279). And the Dazu
sculptures marked the second consummate level of carving arts in
Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> New Hope for Curing Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's medical scientists have
discovered genetic changes during the development of lung cancer
and expressed such changes in gene profiles, providing clues for
possible cure for the mortal disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers based their study on 588 human genes which are
widely held to be closely related with occurrence and development
of lung cancer and discovered obvious changes in 43 of the genes.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time for such changes to be discovered and
expressed in gene profiles, which may provide some important clues
for curing the mortal disease someday," said Liu Lianxin, medical
expert with the Harbin Medical Sciences University who headed the
gene research of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 320,000 people are discovered to
contract lung cancer annually around the globe, 43 percent of them
being Chinese. The mortality rate of lung cancer patients are the
second highest among all cancer patients in China, since the
disease is difficult to discover until into an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Since every human body comprises of tens of thousands of genes,
Doctor Liu said he will next study the role other human genes may
play in the development of a lung cancer.

<HEADLINE> Bar Coding System Used More in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's bar code identification
system has been used to label more than 600,000 varieties of goods,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A bar code, a series of parallel vertical lines or bars used to
assign a unique identification code to an item, are widely sued in
supermarkets, warehouses and libraries.
</P>
<P>
With the country's likely entry into the World Trade
Organization, China will focus on research and application of
automatic identification technology, especially highlighting the
use of the bar code system in the health care and textile sectors,
according to the Article Numbering Center of China.
</P>
<P>
The center, a member of European Article Numbering (EAN)
international, is currently participating in the EAN General
Assembly Meeting, which began yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1988, the center is a special agency which conducts
research and development and popularizes bar code technology in
China. Since its establishment, bar code use has been extended
from the trade sector to the health care, manufacturing and
textile sectors.

<HEADLINE> Most Beijingers Go to Court Without Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite Beijingers' increasing
awareness of the law, most of them still choose to go to court
without a legal counsel, statistics from the Beijing Higher People
's Court said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, only 40,000 out of 200,000-odd lawsuits involved
lawyers, which means that 80 percent of Beijingers prefer to
standing their lawsuits alone, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rather than the scarcity of lawyer in Beijing, a city
possessing a modest pool of over 3,800 registered lawyers, the
phenomenon results from Beijingers' deficient knowledge of the
importance of lawyer and their worry about the possible big cost
of a lawyer, experts said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of legal reform, Chinese court judges no longer
act as interrogators and investigators, and all these work is left
to attorneys of parties involved.
</P>
<P>
These changes will make the role of lawyer more important,
because non-professionals are hardly knowledgeable enough to win
their cases without the help of legal counsel.

BERLIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Germany captain Lothar
Matthaeus denied to play for another Munich club, first division
SpVgg Unterhaching.
</P>
<P>
The former Bayern Munich star, in U.S. Major League Soccer for
the last two months, was quoted as saying that he refused a
potentially lucrative offer from club sponsor Erich Lejeune, chief
executive of CE Computer Electronic to work as a consultant for
his firm.
</P>
<P>
Unterhaching shocked Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen for a
2-0 home win on Saturday to help neighbouring giants Bayern snatch
a record 16th crown.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus, 39 and holder of a record 146 caps, was named in

<HEADLINE> Inter Milan Qualifies for European Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Roberto Baggio scored twice for Inter
Milan as his side defeated Parma 3-1 in Verona on Tuesday to
clinch a place in next season's European Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Baggio, widely expected to leave Inter after spending much of
this year on the bench, curled a free kick inside Gianluigi Buffon
's near post after 35 minutes to give Inter the lead in the end-of-
season play-off.
</P>
<P>
Parma levelled the score after 70 minutes through Croatian
midfielder and second half substitute Mario Stanic.
</P>
<P>
But 13 minutes later Baggio sealed Inter's win with a fine
strike from the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Ivan Zamorano added a third goal in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan will join champions Lazio, Juventus and AC Milan in
the Champions League. Parma will contest the UEFA Cup for the
third year running alongside AS Roma and Fiorentina.
</P>
<P>
Inter and Parma finished the season level on points in fourth
and fifth place respectively.
</P>
<P>
Baggio's double strike will inevitably fuel speculation about
his future at Inter.
</P>
<P>
Baggio has played 24 times for Inter in all competitions this
term but has been used for the full 90 minutes only occasionally,
all in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Baggio's took his goals tally for the season to five and put
Inter back in Europe's premier competition after a one-year
absence.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Ask FIFA to Ban Young Players from International Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Young soccer players under the age of
18 will be banned from moving abroad if a decision taken by UEFA's
executive committee on Tuesday is accepted by FIFA, world soccer's
governing body.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to ask FIFA, which has ultimate control
over transfers, to impose an international ban to stop young
players being exploited or put at risk.
</P>
<P>
Markus Studer, UEFA's deputy chief executive, said too many
players aged as young as 14 or 15 were moving abroad and there was
absolutely no guarantees about their safety, especially if the
move was not successful.
</P>
<P>
UEFA is also concerned about the number of young players from
around the world who are being transferred into Europe at a very
young age with little chance of them making the success.
</P>
<P>
UEFA is powerless to stop the international transfers of
players, even between its own 51 member nations while FIFA is the
legally empowered football authority to deal with this matter.

<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Andy Cole could miss out on England'
s Euro 2000 bid due to a nagging toe injury.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester United striker has been given three days to
prove his fitness by England coach Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Cole has already been ruled out of England's friendly with
Brazil on Saturday but is still hoping to get the nod when Keegan
names his 22 for Holland and Belgium on May 31.
</P>
<P>
The injury is another blow to Keegan, who has already lost
Jason Wilcox with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
But Liverpool striker Michael Owen has declared himself fit at
the end of an injury-riddled domestic season.
</P>
<P>
England boss Keegan confirmed: "I have told Andy Cole not to
worry about getting fit for Brazil on Saturday, just to make sure
that when I name my 22 he is fit and ready."
</P>
<P>
"I've asked Andy to train flat out for three days and then go
for a verdict. I want him to be fit, contrary to what some people
think," added the England coach.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Whitewashes Wales in Soccer Friendly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil proved too strong for the
Welsh soccer team when the visitors scored three goals in a spell
of 10 minutes in the second half of a friendly match in Cardiff
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 3-0 win was Brazil's first in Cardiff. A draw on their
first visit in 1983 was followed by a 1-0 defeat in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Elber opened the floodgates in the 62nd minute after a young
Wales side had largely held their own against the beaten World Cup

finalists in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The Bayern Munich striker was left with a simple tap-in after
goalkeeper Roger Freestone had made fine saves with his feet from
Franca and Ze Roberto.
</P>
<P>
John Robinson came close to equalising two minutes later with a
raking, left-foot shot which came back off the inside of the post.
But from then on Brazil stepped up a gear and turned on the style.
</P>
<P>
Cafu made it 2-0 with a superb, dipping volley and World Player
of the Year Rivaldo, who had orchestrated much of the Brazilian
build-up, added the third in the 72nd minute with a fierce header
from Denilson's exquisite cross.
</P>
<P>
A largely uninspiring first half had come to life in the final
few minutes when first Wales and then Brazil came close to
breaking the deadlock from deadball situations.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Dida was surprised by a fiercely struck Gary Speed
free kick. He spilled the the ball and it had to be hooked away to
safety.
</P>
<P>
Then Cesar Sampaio was left unmarked to power in a header from
Rivaldo's corner but his effort was well saved by Freestone.
</P>
<P>
Brazil complete their short tour with another friendly against
England at Wembley on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Sheffield Wednesday Close in on Kinnear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday are focusing on
"one individual" in their search for a new manager, with Joe
Kinnear believed to be their prime target.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday need an experienced man at the helm for a rebuilding
job at Hillsborough following the club's relegation to Division
One.
</P>
<P>
And the 53-year-old former Wimbledon manager has the right
credentials for the job.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday chairman Howard Culley told the Sheffield Star: "We
still have a number of candidates. We are looking down the road
with one particular individual but there is no firm deal with
anyone. We are not there. Until a deal is done we are not going to
make any announcement."
</P>
<P>
Peter Shreeves took over as Wednesday's caretaker manager after
the sacking of Danny Wilson in March following the 1-0 Premiership
defeat at Watford.
</P>
<P>
Kinnear took over as Wimbledon boss in 1992 and took the club
to the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the Coca-Cola Cup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He had to stand down in June of last year after suffering a
mild heart attack before the Dons' match against Wednesday at
Hillsborough in March 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- English football team manager Kevin
Keegan has admitted the excitement is beginning to build as he
begins his final preparations to lead England into Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
The England coach conceded expectations were "realistically"
low after an unconvincing performance in qualifying for the
championships in Holland and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
But, speaking ahead of the forthcoming friendlies against
Brazil and the Ukraine, he insisted England do have the quality to
win Euro 2000 this summer.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very, very excited," Keegan said. "The downside of that
is you probably will get nervous towards the start of a
competition because you realise what is at stake."
</P>
<P>
"You know that the nation are behind you and they expect so,
you feel all those things. I think any manager who sits in front
of you, he may well pretend he does not but I think you need to
feel all those things. I think players need to feel tensions and
nervous before they go out," he said.

<HEADLINE> More Doublts over Charleroi Match Safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More concerns have been raised over
the venue for England's match with Germany at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two teams meet at Charleroi on 17 June but a Belgian MP
believes the 30,000 capacity stadium is not safe, according to the
BBC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Van Parys, a Christian Democrat (CVP) member of the
parliamentary home affairs committee, said the stands were
unusually steep and questioned evacuation procedures because the
stadium is in a built-up, residential area.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed an inspection of the stadium with
security and town officials.
</P>
<P>
"The difference is not great but one had always told us the
norm (for sloping stands) had been respected. I would not like to
find myself on the stands if there was a crush," he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been concerns from many corners of the footballing
world, particularly considering the potential for trouble between
English and German fans.
</P>
<P>
Two other Euro 2000 matches are due to be played at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan gave his full backing to the stadium
after a visit in April and Euro 2000 officials say security
measures are adequate.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Border Residents Calmly Accept Army Pullout From Lebanon By Lou Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel, May 24 (Xinhua) -- After the last
Israeli soldier withdrew from south Lebanon early Wednesday
morning, residents in Israel's northern border town of Kiryat
Shemona calmly accepted the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The populous town along the border between Israel and Lebanon
had been a major target of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas' Katyusha
rocket attacks in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and set up a security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting its
northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since
then, Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, has been spearheading a
war of attrition to oust the Israeli occupation forces and launched
rocket attacks on northern Israel off and on.
</P>
<P>
The Shemona residents traditionally adopted a negative attitude
toward Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to pull Israeli
troops out of Lebanon by July because the move will endanger their
normal lives and harm their economic interests. In April and In
early May, these residents also announced a strike against the
withdrawal which was approved by Israeli cabinet in March.
</P>
<P>
However, most residents interviewed by Xinhua on Wednesday
termed the withdrawal as a positive step and supported Barak's
policy toward Lebanon, including his remarks that if Israel is
attacked after its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, the Israeli
military will launch reprisals not to be limited to the border
area.
</P>
<P>
The pullout was accelerated in the past 48 hours after the pro-
Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the so-called security zone
collapsed suddenly under the pressure of Hezbollah. More and more
SLA militiamen surrendered to Hezbollah guerrillas who sped up
their move to take over strongholds gradually abandoned by Israelis
recently.
</P>
<P>
Zievi Edna, a shopkeeper, said she suffered great economic loss
because she had to close her shop in recent days in fear of the
chaos in the town. However, she believed Israel should pull its
troops out of south Lebanon as the territory is not Israel's soil.
</P>
<P>
A senior resident named Mike said he congratulated Israel
Defense Forces officers on the successful withdrawal as it caused
no Israeli casualties during the move, adding that Israelis should
no more shed their blood in other countries' territories. He said
he agrees to Barak's opinion on the Lebanon issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the withdrawal posed threats to his life,
Yakov Schwartz, a young worker, said it was the same security
expectation before and after the withdrawal and the former security
zone no longer helps protect the lives in Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Naor, a bank staff, agreed with Schwartz, but she stressed
that if Israelis were again under Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets'
attack after the pullout, the Israeli government should surely
take "strong steps" to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Mike, held the same view on the issue, but added the strikes
against Lebanese should only be limited to infrastructure sites,
such as power stations, bridges, and should not cause any civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
A volunteer working for Magen David, or Israel's Red Cross
organization, said Barak could do better than what he did today,
but he believed the withdrawal is still good. The man, who rejected
to reveal his name, was among the volunteering doctors and nurses
sent from Israeli port city of Haifa to reinforce the northern
border areas.
</P>
<P>
Timna Orland, a 15-year-old student, said she and her family
members totally support the withdrawal and if a general election is
held three years later when she can vote, she will surely choose
Barak as prime minister because of his brave move regarding
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's sundown, the center of Kiryat Shemona
returned to normal life again and most people moved out of the bomb
shelters where they had spent two nights.
</P>
<P>
Doddi Orlivy, a young computer specialist, said he believed
peace is the most important thing in the world, and expressed the
hope that Israelis and Lebanese will not point guns at each other
again.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Withdrawal from S. Lebanon Conducive to Advancing Peace Process by Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- As ordered by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Israel early Wednesday conducted an
unexpectedly hasty troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, ending its
22 years of military occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of darkness, some 1,000 Israeli soldiers
streamed out of the security zone into Israel in tanks and armoured
personnel carriers. The withdrawal, six weeks ahead of Barak's
self-imposed July 7 deadline, did engender the sense of a chaotic
retreat which some Israelis did not want to see.
</P>
<P>
The rapid collapse of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army(SLA)
in south Lebanon during the past few days was the main reason which
forced Barak into heeding to the requests of the Israeli military
and ordered the pullout ahead of schedule. Opposition parties and
several local commentators dismissed the pullout as a humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, the withdrawal has also in fact brought about
some structural changes in the regional politics and diplomacy. And
in the long run, the pullout and its impact will be conducive to
moving the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
For Barak, the core of the Middle East issue is Israel's
reconciliation with the neighboring states and all Arab nations as
a whole, through peaceful negotiations. The materialization of this
goal mostly depends on Israel's return of its occupied territories,
such as the West Bank, the Golan Heights and the security zone in
south Lebanon, to the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 with a
self-declared aim of halting cross-border attacks by Palestinian
guerrillas. After its invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Israel set up
the 850-square-kilometer security zone in southern Lebanon in 1985
for protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Till now, at least 900 Israeli soldiers have been killed in
south Lebanon, while tens of thousands of Lebanese lost their lives
in fighting the war of attrition, which the Israelis know they can
not win.
</P>
<P>
Barak's decision to end this tragedy was mostly viewed as the
right one, and the withdrawal could help pave the way for an
earlier realization of reconciliation between the Israelis and the
Lebanese in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal is closely related to Israel's difficult peace
talks with Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon. Israeli
leaders have long contended that Syria has been trying to pressure
Israel into peace concessions by supporting Lebanese guerrilla
group Hezbollah, or Party of God, to launch attacks on Israeli
outposts in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Israel has also tried to use the withdrawal as a
pressure card to force Syria back to the negotiating table and
soften its positions concerning the return to Syria of the Golan
Heights which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which deploys about 30,000 troops in Lebanon
as peacekeepers, have insisted on the integration of their talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Now both Israel and Syria are facing a serious dilemma. Both
sides lost their important pressure cards after Israel's
withdrawal, which could force the two sides to think about how they
could resume the peace talks in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December in
Washington after a nearly four-year-long hiatus, have been
suspended since January after two rounds of talks. A summit meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad in March failed to bring the two sides back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians welcomed the withdrawal, terming it as a great
Arab national victory and a victory for the Palestinians as well.
</P>
<P>
Barak stated that the withdrawal was carried out under the U.N.
Security Council Resolution 425, approved in 1978. The Palestinians
said that it has set a good example which will help Israel solve
its territorial problems with the Palestinians. Moreover, the
withdrawal can make more room for Israel to concentrate on
finishing its final-status talks with Palestinians on time. The two
sides have set a September 13 deadline for reaching a final peace.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal was a big event in the Middle East peace process.
But the situation along the Israeli-Lebanese border is not stable
and nobody knows what could happen there in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, questions remained as to whether Israel can avoid
renewed entanglement in Lebanon. Barak explicitly warned both
Lebanon and Syria that Israel would retaliate harshly if Israel is
attacked after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has not sent more peacekeeping forces right now into
south Lebanon. So, Barak still has a lot of homework to do after
the withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Hail Israeli Pullout from Lebanon as Victory of Lebanese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday hailed Israel's just-completed withdrawal
from south Lebanon as a great victory of the Lebanese resistance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released for the event, Abdel-Meguid praised
Lebanese people's wisdom and strength in ousting the Israeli
occupation troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief called on the United Nations Security
Council to follow up and verify Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese
territories in accordance with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and carved up a border strip in
south Lebanon as a so-called "security zone" in 1985 to allegedly
protect its northern border area from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas. The U.N. Security Council adopted the
two resolutions after Israeli invasion, demanding immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government had decided in March to pull out from Lebanon
by July 7. However, it completed the troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon at early hours on Wednesday, ending its 22-year occupation
of the area.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israelis are really seeking a comprehensive and just
peace (with the Arabs), they should abide by the U.N. resolutions
related to their pullback from the (Syrian) Golan Heights and the
Palestinian occupied lands, including Jerusalem, and give up
intransigence and procrastination on all tracks," Abdel-Meguid
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war. The two countries have yet to resume peace talks on the return
of the strategic plateau. The Palestinians and Israel have been
negotiating for a final peace agreement on the status of the
occupied territories.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rules Out Change in Relations With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said on Wednesday a
handshake between Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Yemen's capital of Sanaa
does not constitute a change in the decade-old icy ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sabah shook hands with Arafat under unavoidable and surprise
conditions, said an official source from the Kuwaiti Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports by two Kuwaiti newspapers said on Tuesday that Sabah,
who is also first deputy prime minister, and Arafat shook hands and
exchanged greetings twice during Yemen's 10th unity anniversary on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The papers speculated that the Kuwaiti-Palestinian embrace "
revealed a major shift by Kuwait after 10 years of icy relations
with Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that "
handshake occurred in a protocol condition that cannot be avoided
as the PNA president (Arafat) surprisingly approached (Sabah),
shaking hands and hugging him."
</P>
<P>
He also denied there was conversation between the two.
</P>
<P>
"This does not constitute a development in relations between
Kuwait and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) as the
newspapers had indicated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait suspended its relations with Palestine after the
Palestinians sided with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war triggered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> EU, Mediterranean States Wind up Second Parliamentary Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The second parliamentary conference of
European Union (EU) members and Mediterranean countries ended on
Wednesday after endorsing a final communique in Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed the necessity for the countries to
respect territorial integrity and seek peaceful settlement of
conflicts instead of resorting to the use of force in dealing with
international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
It called for provision of opportunities and support for the
southern and eastern Mediterranean countries in their economic
reform programs aimed at developing their economies and posing as
equal partners in the Euro-Med cooperation process.
</P>
<P>
It is important to work for democracy, mutual understanding,
transparency and dialog among the 27 participants of the Euro-Med
partnership, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Euro-Med partnership, or Barcelona process,
hinges on the political will of the participants, making each party
shoulder its responsibility in this respect and ensuring the
effectiveness of parliaments' role in the societies, it added.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states and 12 Mediterranean countries launched
the Euro-Med partnership in 1995 during a meeting in Barcelona,
Spain. They have, ever since, been exerting efforts to forge close
cooperation in the political, economic, social and security fields
with a vision to create a free trade area in 2010.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks to be Resumed Soon: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Hassan Asfour hinted on Wednesday that the
final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians will be
resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Asfour, who had also taken part in the back-channel talks in
Stockholm, told reporters here that the Palestinian side is against
any division or postponement of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been holding back-door talks in
the Swedish capital in a bid to forge a framework for a final peace
deal after decades of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the parallel channel was revealed on May 14,
the day just after the two sides missed the second deadline for the
framework deal.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks, halted by Israel after recent shoot-outs
between the Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, deal with the most thorniest issues, including
the status of Jerusalem, borders, water sharing, the fate of the
Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip declared on May 19
and 20 as "Days of Rage," during which they staged large-scale
protests to press Israel to release the 1,650 Palestinian prisoners
held in Israeli jails on security charges.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian prisoners have been on a hunger strike since
early May in protest against inhumane treatment inside the Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned into violent clashes between the
Palestinians and the Israeli army, killing nine Palestinians and
injuring more than 1,000 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The foreign reserves of the
Central Bank of Uruguay (CBU) increased by 29 million U.S. dollars
in April to reach a net reserve level of 2.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This amount represents an increase during the first four months
of the year of 112 million U.S. dollars, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
In the first third of the year, the reserves increase has
happened due to bank deposits in the CBU, amounting to 241 million
U.S. dollars, and in a different sense, due to foreign currency
sales amounting to 112 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This figure differs from what had been previously forecasted in
the monetary program which established foreign currency reserve
earnings for the whole year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) has made an
underlying loss of 244 million pounds in the latest financial
years, its worst showing since it was privatized.
</P>
<P>
Lord Marshall, BA's chairman, blamed the"disappointing" results
on over-capacity on its long-haul routes, cut-price European
competition, fuel prices and the strong pounds.
</P>
<P>
He said expansion by Lufthansa, Air France and American
carriers had led to "a double-figure rise in capacity which was
nowhere near matched by demand levels", causing widespread
discounting.
</P>
<P>
Rod Eddington, the new chief executive who took over from the
ousted Bob Ayling in May, said he expected recovery on the North
Atlantic. "I think we're moving towards a much more rational
balance of supply and demand."
</P>
<P>
Analysts are watching to see whether the new chief executive
will be able to implement the cost-cutting and down-sizing
strategy laid out by his predecessor, who was sacked in March
after a troubled four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
However, Eddington declined to spell out BA's cost-cutting
plans or how many jobs would go, but he said he did not believe
there would be any compulsory redundancies.

BUCHAREST, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A major part of the World Bank's
projects portfolio in Romania addresses social and human
development issues. Two of these projects have been completed and
six are under implementation and making satisfactory progress,
according to the World Bank Office in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Employment and Social Protection Project offered financing
for 700 micro-projects which drew in about 56,000 laid off workers
while 30,000 new jobs have been created. This project also made a
significant contribution to the passing of the law on the new
public pensions system and the drafting of the private pensions
law.
</P>
<P>
The Social Development Fund Project has so far offered 120
grants to poor communities for small scale infrastructure works or
social protection.
</P>
<P>
Under the Education Reform Project over 160 new textbooks were
printed, new curricula and assessment and examination measures
have been developed; the program also financed the creation of
teacher training centers equipped with computers.
</P>
<P>
The Higher Education and Research Reform Project offered over
650 grants for education and research programs. Under the School
Rehabilitation Program, the first three fully rehabilitated
schools were re-opened last month; other 700 schools will be
rehabilitated by the end of this project.
</P>

<P>
"UNIFIL is helping the Lebanese Army collect heavy weapons that
have been left behind all over the vacated areas," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
There had been no reports so far of revenge attacks and "We
are very pleased that they have not occurred and we hope that they
will not occur," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations still intends to take cartographers to the
border area to identify the 1923 border on the ground, and then to
mark a practical line so that it can then confirm Israel's
withdrawal to its side of the border," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cartographers will be deployed soon to the border, once
necessary assurances are received that U.N. helicopters could fly
over the border," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that the "practical line", corresponding to the
border, is not a demarcation of the border, and other elements,
including the disbanding of the South Lebanon Army would also have
to be verified.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the last of Israeli
soldiers in southern Lebanon have returned home today, ending a
military occupation that lasted for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday recommended to
reinforce UNIFIL so as to verify the Israeli withdrawal and to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls on Lebanon Government to Take Charge of Security Near Border with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that all parties concerned should be cooperative on the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the southern Lebanon and Lebanon
's government take charge of security near the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"it's important that everyone cooperate on this," State
Department spokesman Philip Reeker said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's pullout had to be "confirmed" by an emissary
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. And he said a U.N.
peacekeeping force "will assist the government of Lebanon in
assuring its effective control over the area."
</P>
<P>
Reeker said the United States had made it clear that "all
foreign forces should withdraw from Lebanon and that Lebanon
should exercise full sovereignty over all of its territory."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman again called for restraint as Hezbollah
guerrillas rushed in to fill a void as a result of Israel's
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Annan plans to increase the U.N. peacekeeping
force, but the United States has not offered to contribute any
troops.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is in
Florence, Italy, attending a meeting of NATO foreign ministers,
had telephone conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and conferred with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, over
the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary and others have called for restraint and calm,"
Reeker said. "In this regard, the Lebanese government has a
responsibility for security in the south. And it's important that
they move quickly to assume that responsibility."

<HEADLINE> Chile to Announce Pinochet's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Santiago's Court of Appeals
Magistrate Jaime Rodriguez said on Wednesday that the Court's
final resolution on Augusto Pinochet's status as life senator
cancellation, will be made public next week.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was assigned on Tuesday to draft the Chilean court's
extraordinary plenary session's decision on the case to be signed
by all of the members of the plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Appeals court president Ruben Ballesteros said the decision on
immunity would be made public only after it has been signed by all
22 judges and written out, a process that may take up to two weeks.
Government officials and members of congress pressed for a speedy
public announcement.
</P>
<P>
In the plenary session of the court that extraordinarily met on
Tuesday to pass judgment on the petition of privation of
privileges against the former Chilean military ruler, the voting
took place. According to a source, the sentence has 13 votes for
and 9 against the petition.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report compiled by the civilian
government that succeeded Pinochet, 3,191 people died or
disappeared under his 1973-1990 regime. More than 100 lawsuits
have been filed against him stemming from that era.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Pinochet was detained in London on a Spanish judge's
warrant seeking to try him on human rights charges. But he
returned home to Chile in March _ released by Britain after
doctors determined he was physically and mentally unfit to face
trial.
</P>
<P>
Despite his poor health, Pinochet will now have to face the
courts in the country he once ruled. Chilean law does not exempt
sick people from legal penalties except in cases of madness or
dementia.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual Western Premiers
Conference officially opened Wednesday in Brandon, Manitoba, with
leaders expected to coordinate their policies for the regional
development.
</P>
<P>
Premiers of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
as well as Yukon and Northwest Territories converged in Manitoba's
southern town Tuesday night to compare notes on issues ranging
from medicare to highway development.
</P>
<P>
Alberta's Bill 11 on the provincial health policy, which was
passed earlier this month, is one of the hot topics during the two-
day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Klein, the Alberta Premier, told his counterparts upon
his arrival Tuesday that Alberta's legislation is quite consistent
with the legislation that was passed by British Columbia,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to fears expressed by some of his counterparts
that Alberta's Bill 11 will allow operation of privately funded
health clinics, which they believe to be a step toward a two-tier
health-care system, away from the current federal system.
</P>
<P>
Yukon and Northwest Territories are more concerned with their
regional economic development and highway building. Their leaders
urge for more federal support for things "like improving the
national highways system."
</P>
<P>
Canada's western premiers are scheduled to end their
discussions Thursday and travel to the International Peace Gardens
to meet with the governors of Idaho, North Dakota and South Dakota
of the United States on cross-border disputes in trade and
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> CIS States Push on to Strengthen Collective Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of six member
countries of the CIS Collective Security Council decided Wednesday
in Belarus capital of Minsk to unite their efforts to strengthen
regional security and anti-terrorism cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
members that signed the Collective Security Treaty, including
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Armenia,
the participants expressed concern over situation in Central Asia
and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"Serious tasks must be fulfilled by the signatories to the
treaty to eliminate the persisting danger of further tensions in
these regions," urged the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The sides discussed not only cooperation in defense and counter-
terrorist fields, but also ways of adjusting the Collective
Security Treaty to the new geopolitical situation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, they drafted a memorandum on enhancing the efficiency
of the treaty, a provision on the procedure of making and
implementing collective decisions on the use of force and
collective security system means, as well as a provision on the
Council of Defense Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting once again demonstrated that the treaty is very
important and meets the security interests of the member-states,
the participants said.
</P>
<P>
"New hotbeds of tensions have flared up, including near the
borders of the member-states. The threat of international
terrorism has sharply increased and terrorism has merged with
aggressive separatism, religious intolerance and organized crime,"
the participants noted.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to make joint efforts to ensure collective security
and stated that the treaty remains open for all countries
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced that he is extremely
satisfied with the results of the summit, which has just finished
in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The participants have developed a mechanism "that will make the
Collective Security treaty a working instrument responsive to the
changing world and developments related to our countries," he told
journalists after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of the joint statement adopted by
the summit on the initiative of Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, which says the treaty has priority significance in
ensuring the signatory-states' national security.
</P>
<P>
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, host of the summit,
said the amorphous period in the history of the Collective
Security Treaty is over.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the session is to promote cooperation among the
states "not only in theory, but in implementing the military-
technical policy, which is expected to help them prevent and ward
off possible threats," he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, an agreement on the basic principles of military-
technical cooperation among the Collective Security Treaty
signatory-states is to be signed in Moscow on June 22 Lukashenko
said.
</P>
<P>
In the current geopolitical situation, "certain forces are
trying to redraw the borders and create a uni-polar world." The
signatory states must be particularly vigilant and security-minded
in this context, he added.
</P>
<P>
Putin ended his two-day working visit in Minsk and returned to
Moscow on Wednesday evening.

Congress (ANC) Wednesday said it would mark the Africa Day on
Thursday by calling on all South Africans to take part in a
program of solidarity with the suffering people in Angola.

collect blankets, clothes, non-perishable food and other material
for the displaced people in Angola," said the spokesman.

Ngonyama also called upon Africans to face up to the immediate
tasks of ending wars, replacing military rule with democracy and

<HEADLINE> 200 Nigerians Feared Dead in Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 people have been
reportedly killed and hundreds of building have been burned down
in the renewed riots in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna, said a
source reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reinforced military soldiers and police have been sent into
Kaduna, capital of Kaduna State in northern Nigeria, after two
successive days of clashes between Muslims and Christians in the
city, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes broke out on Monday after residents of a
mainly Christian neighborhood blamed Muslims for the killing of a
local man, and the fighting was reported to have quickly spread to
the outlying districts of the city on Tuesday night, according to
local police.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are concerned about the risk of violence
spreading to other parts of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a night-time curfew has been imposed by the police
authorities after the breakout of the clashes, and the police also
issued a warning that anybody found with illegal firearms would
not only face prosecution but would be treated as an armed robber.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clashes came just three months after riots between
Muslims and Christians in the city, in which more than 1,000
people reportedly died, over the proposed implementation of
Islamic law Sharia.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Withdraw Troops From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda are expected to
withdraw their troops on Thursday from Kisangani, a northeastern
city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in line with a
demilitarization order signed by military chiefs of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A timetable has been worked out for the full implementation of
the order, signed on May 21 and coming into effect on Thursday,
said a Ugandan government statement issued on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's State Minister
for Foreign Affairs, said the withdrawal and redeployment of the
forces include those of the rebel forces in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Observer Mission in the Congo would deploy
its force to exercise neutral control over the demilitarized zone
around the city and airports of Kisangani, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
During the process of demilitarization of Kisangani and
thereafter, no party shall use force or threaten to use force
against any other party or parties, said Mbabazi in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops went into clashes on May 5 and May 8
in Kisangani where they had their armies stationed to back rival
rebel factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the Uganda People's Defence Forces and the
Rwanda Patriotic Army in Kisangani were most regrettable and
should never have happened, said Mbabazi.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi also assured that Uganda' s relations with the
government and the people of Rwanda remains firm and that the
Ugandan government will not jeopardize the relationship that has
long existed between the peoples of the two neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Women Call for Ending Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 indigenous women
representatives of 14 of the 22 Guatemalan provinces demanded on
Wednesday during a pacific march for an end to discrimination and
a respect to their rights.
</P>
<P>
Anastasia Pacheco, Secretary of Women Affairs in the Peasant
and Indigenous National Coordination, termed their situation as "
difficult" because, she said, there is no respect neither for
their customs nor for their cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
Maya women and peasants demanded on Wednesday the respect for
their right to organize and for an end to discrimination.
</P>
<P>
They also urged for a reduction in basic food products price,
agricultural inputs, land, decent housing, literacy programs and
the creation of employment sources with fair salaries and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they asked for school support for widows who lost
their husbands during the last armed conflict, and the creation of
the required mechanisms to carry out the Agreement on Identity and
Rights of Indigenous Peoples signed between the Government and the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous women complained for having being left marginalized
in the summons to the "Governing Pact" prepared by the Guatemalan
President despite having been the main victims during the 36-year-
long civil war (1960-1996).
</P>
<P>
The leader said that many women live in extreme poverty and
misery, and that in communities in the interior of the country
they are threatened for demanding their rights.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Asks EBRD to Re-assess Funding Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 24 (Xinhua) - Republic of Moldova asked the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to re-
assess conditions to resume the funding of Moldova, saying the
present conditions "are not the most advantageous" .
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Moldovan Deputy Premier Andrei Cucu,
also the economics and reforms minister, on his return Tuesday
night from an EBRD board of governors meeting in Riga, the
Moldovan news agency Bass-Press reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cucu said the Moldovan delegation met in Riga with EBRD senior
officials who "practically accepted" Chisinau's proposals.
</P>
<P>
So far, the interest rate on EBRD short- and medium-terms
credits was under 5-6 percent. After the inclusion of Moldova in
the category of poor developing countries in 1997, the foreign
lenders -in particular the World Bank - hacked the interest rate
for loans offered to Chisinau down to 0.75 percent. The World Bank
grants 35-year credits under International Development Agency
conditions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 projects worth 145 million euros are being
carried out in Moldova with EBRD support.
</P>
<P>
But Cucu expressed regret that "the projects launched in 1995-
1996 have not been complete yet," said Cucu, adding that there are
"many problems" related to the construction of the Giurgiulesti
oil terminal.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said that the Moldovan authorities asked the
EBRD to re-assess a number of projects due to the severe social
and political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
An EBRD mission is expected in Chisinau after June 5 to discuss
with Moldovan officials every project separately.

<HEADLINE> German Army Chief Quits in Defense Cut Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach,
the general inspector and highest officer of German armed forces
Bundeswehr, announced to resign, the Defense Ministry Wednesday
said in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
It was the general's own decision to quit after 15 months in
office, stressed Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping, declining to
give further explanation.
</P>
<P>
"General von Kirchbah was not sacked,- it was his own decision
to quit," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Harald Kujat has been chosen to replace General von
Kirchbah as chief of staff after July 1, said Scharping.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of General von Kirchbach "is the end of a long
discussion process," said Scharping, referring to the recent
disputes around the "structural reform" for leaner and more
professional German armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Scharping indicated that Germany should
sharply cut the soldiers and defense budget, change its cold-war
era compulsory forces into a professional and flexible one.
</P>
<P>
"The Bundeswehr (German forces) must become more mobile,
flexible" to cope the regional conflicts together with its western
partners, Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
But General von Kirchbach, who became a national hero after
organizing German army to resist a huge flood in year 1997 as a
tank corps commander, was known for his resistance to sharp cuts
in soldier numbers.
</P>
<P>
Scharping's plan has won the back of Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, said Charima Reinhardt, a government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called Scharping's plan "on the right way to
successfully solve the hardest mission" of his coalition cabinet,
according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
And an independent defense panel recommended the cabinet
cutting the number of soldiers to 240,000 from the present 370,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Judge Concludes Hearing on Microsoft Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The federal judge in the
Microsoft antitrust trial raised the dramatic possibility of
splitting the software giant into three pieces on Wednesday and
set the stage for a quick decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concluded the hearing on
proposed remedies in the trial after just one day, and he swept
aside Microsoft's demands for an extensive series of further
hearings, saying there would be no more.
</P>
<P>
Jackson asked the government to submit a revised proposal on
how to remedy Microsoft's monopoly by Friday, directing Microsoft
to respond by Tuesday. Jackson's decision was expected shortly
after that.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's hearing, Jackson's questions focused on the
possibility of breaking up Microsoft into three parts, as proposed
by two outside trade groups made up mainly of Microsoft
competitors, rather than two parts, as called for by the
Department of Justice and 17 states.
</P>
<P>
"A bisection will in effect create two separate monopolies,"
Jackson said in criticizing the government proposal to separate
Microsoft into an operating system company and application
software company.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Jackson praised as an "excellent brief" a 65-page
friend-of-the-court filing submitted by two industry groups
calling for Microsoft's Web browser to be cordoned off into a
third company.
</P>
<P>
The hearing followed Jackson's findings last month that
Microsoft had violated the nation's antitrust laws by abusing its
market power in personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens with possible remedies, Microsoft plans
to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The company believes the government lacks a basis for its
proposed breakup. It has asked Jackson to summarily dismiss the
government proposal, or at least give its attorneys up to six
months to prepare a legal defense against such an "extreme" remedy.
Microsoft also has offered numerous milder penalties in its place.

<HEADLINE> Gates Calls Business Leaders to Prepare for Third Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
said Wednesday that the Internet is rapidly entering a new third
phase, beyond mere connectivity and simple transactions, and
shifts into online services delivered over different devices.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Seattle at Microsoft's fourth annual CEO
Summit which attracts more than 160 business leaders from around
the world. The event was largely closed to the media, but Gates'
speech was released right after the meeting's opening. He did not
mention Microsoft's antitrust battle with the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
Gates described the Internet evolution from a one-way portal
and content-driven entity, where businesses sought an Internet
presence, to a service-oriented, two-way tool for businesses.
</P>
<P>
In the third phase of the Internet, he said, businesses will
utilize tools that enhance relationships, provide interactive
services and expand communication to increase knowledge-sharing
beyond application.
</P>
<P>
"We are transitioning from an off-line economy into an online,
digital economy," Gates said. He shared his belief that the
successful companies in this next generation of the Internet will
be those that renew their customer commitment, strengthen ties
with partners and use the power of leading-edge Internet services
to enable seamless interaction both within their organization and
throughout their business model.
</P>
<P>
Among his predictions, he said mobile devices will go far
beyond their existing functions, e-mail addresses will be unified,
and business supply chains that have been paper-oriented will be
Internet-oriented.
</P>
<P>
"Wireless technologies are really going to change how we think
about the Internet," Gates said. "The fact that you have high-
speed data connectivity will really change things a lot."

<HEADLINE> Colombian Attorney General Recommends to Suspend Neutral Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernal warned that there is not a clear regulation on the norms
that must rule the demilitarized territory, to which peasants
living inside of it, who have not received clear information,
oppose blocking highways in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations with the communities are necessary," said the
Attorney General, who belongs to a civil mediation committee that
seeks to save a peace agenda agreed upon by the National
Liberation Army (ELN), the second most important guerrilla group
in the country, after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (
FARC).
</P>
<P>
Bernal criticized the Government of President Andres Pastrana
for having agreed upon the creation of a buffer zone for the ELN
without consulting beforehand the residents of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General presented his advise when thousands of
peasants of north and northeast Colombia villages completed a two-
week period blocking the main highways communicating the interior
of the country with the Caribbean shores.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the zone protested for a recent decision of the
Government and the ELN to set up a "coexistence zone" in a little
less than 5,000 square kilometers within the municipalities of San
Pablo, Cantagallo and Yondo, the first two in the province of
Bolivar and the other in Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
According to leaders of the regions' communities, these are
afraid of the ELN causing the excessive behavior practiced by the
FARC in the southern zone of distention for the peace talks
between this guerrilla group and the Government.
</P>
<P>
The blocking of road traffic has caused severe losses to the
carriers and a lack in supply of agricultural products to the
markets in northern Colombia.
