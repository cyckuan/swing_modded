<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels freed 139 of more than
500 U.N. personnel held captive into Liberian custody, Liberia's President
Charles Taylor said Sunday, after U.N. officials secured the release of 18
others. Taylor said 15 of the freed captives had been flown by helicopter to
Monrovia, while the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from the Liberian
border town of Foya. There was no immediate U.N. confirmation of the report.

Palestinians Charge Israeli Army Base
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Frustration over stalled negotiations exploded into
violence Sunday as thousands of Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli
troops -- demonstrations that left one Palestinian dead and about 38 people
injured. In the Gaza Strip, more than 500 Palestinians charged an Israeli army
base near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, hurling stones and Molotov
cocktails over the fence. Similar clashes took place in the West Bank cities of
Nablus and Ramallah. Those clashes began as marches marking Monday's 52nd
anniversary of al-Nakba or ''the catastrophe'' -- the term Palestinians use to
refer to Israel's creation.

   SINGAPORE (AP) -- A newspaper report said Sunday nine foreign women married
to Singaporeans have been expelled because they have contracted HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS. The Sunday Times, citing unidentified sources, said that the
women were mainly from Thailand, Indonesia, China and the Philippines. The
women, who are not Singaporean citizens, carry social passes, which allow them
to stay in Singapore for a period of up to a year. The report said another 10
women infected with the virus were expecting to be sent home.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tens of thousands of mothers rallied in sight of the
Capitol Sunday to demand strict control of handguns. Participants in the
''Million Mom March'' aimed to send Congress a ''Mother's Day'' message: A new
movement of mainstream Americans is getting politically active, ready to battle
the gun lobby and to work against lawmakers who oppose gun control. Crowds
ranging from a few hundred to an estimated 4,000 in Chicago and 5,000 in Denver
showed up at similar rallies in dozens of cities across the country -- from
Maine to Michigan to Oregon.

their abandoned town. Families without homes came together in Red Cross shelters
to mark the holiday, while churchgoers mourned their own losses but expressed
relief that nobody was hurt. The 7,000 people of neighboring White Rock,
meanwhile, were allowed to go home. The buses left Santa Fe for Los Alamos

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Venture Capital Fever  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Venture capital isn't just for maverick
financiers anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest display of corporate clout in the venture capital
arena, a division of Chase Manhattan Bank invested the most money
in entrepreneurial companies during the first three months of this
year. New York-based Chase Capital's venture capital investments
totaled $289 million during the three-month period ended March 31,
according to PricewaterhouseCooper's quarterly ''Money Tree''
survey, scheduled to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Capital spread the seed money among 45 different
investments, primarily in companies developing technology for the
Internet, said David Britts, a general partner for the firm. ''The
earlier we can get involved in a company, the better,'' said
Britts, who works in Chase Capital's Mountain View, Calif. office.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital arms of two other big U.S. banks, Wells
Fargo and BancBoston Capital Ventures, also ranked among the 10
most active investors identified in the survey. Norwest Equity
Partners, part of Wells Fargo, invested $119 million during the
quarter and BancBoston placed $115 million, according to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think big banks and companies are here to stay,'' said Tracy
Lefteroff, a PriceWaterhouseCoopers' managing partner specializing
in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and corporations are forming venture capital divisions
because of the huge payoffs generated in recent years by Internet
startups after they sold their stock in initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Established technology giants such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft
Corp. also are providing venture capital to startups.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of a windfall isn't the only draw for corporate
America. Lefteroff said many major companies have realized that
funding technology startups can give them the inside track on new
innovations developed by entrepreneurs
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Alsop, a general partner at New Enterprise Associates in
Menlo Park, said traditional venture capitalists are even facing
competition from entrepreneurs that made a killing in the stock
market on their other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of venture capitalists is making it easier for
startups touting new ideas to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are going through a real renaissance period in
technology and entrepreneurialism,'' Alsop said. ''A guy who drew
up a good idea on a napkin on a coffee table could maybe get $1
million or $2 million in venture capital a couple years ago. Now,
that guy with the napkin is getting $4 million or $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   New Enterprise invested $186 million in the first quarter and
isn't pulling back, despite the choppiness in the stock market
since March 31. ''We feel very confident and are continuing our
pace of investment,'' Alsop said.
</P>
<P>
   The PriceWaterhouseCoopers survey also found that venture
capital is increasingly finding its way in regions outside the
country's technological hubs in the San Francisco Bay area, Los
Angeles, Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, venture capital investment in the Midwest totaled
$982 million in the first quarter, up 69 percent from 1999's final
quarter. The Silicon Valley remained the nation's entrepreneurial
hotbed with $6.1 billion in venture capital investments, a 7
percent increase from the fourth quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse University will spend up to $185 million on improvements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse University is about to enter
uncharted territory: The board of trustees has approved a building
and renovation plan that could amount to as much as $185 million.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the school taken such a comprehensive approach to
building and renovating in such a short period of time, officials
said after approving the spending on Saturday. It will affect
nearly every school and department over the next five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the plan is the expansion of the School of
Management, E.S. Bird Library, S.I. Newhouse School of Public
Communications, more than doubling the space at the Center for
Science and Technology, and finding a home for a new college.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new space is built for those schools and programs, the
focus will shift to modernizing other buildings. The plan would
change 13 buildings and possibly add a building. It would renovate
350,000-square feet and might add at least that much more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to move from planning a building to planning a
campus,'' Chancellor Kenneth Shaw said. ''Historically, we put up
one building at a time. We're no longer in a position to be able to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the university is in a sound financial position with an
endowment of more than $1 billion, it can afford this project, Shaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (the plan) allows us to remain at the cutting edge
with our buildings,'' the chancellor said. ''We want
state-of-the-art, for today and tomorrow's world.''
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, the 57-member board of trustees approved a
bond issue of $180 million, of which $30 million will go to
refinancing old debt. That leaves $150 million to pay for this
project. The balance of $35 million will be paid through fund
raising, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ''hopefully positions us for the next 10 to 15 years
after completing it to better serve the students and the whole
community,'' said Joseph Lampe, chairman of the university's board
of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 months of design and planning are ahead before
construction begins, officials said. And the trustees still must
approve each individual project.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse University has the resources to be ranked among the top
30 research universities in the country, said Deborah Freund, vice
chancellor and provost. To do that, it needs modern facilities, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an integral part of who we know we can be in the
future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   University officials hired the consulting firm of Dober, Lidsky,
Craig &AMP; Associates of Belmont, Mass., to help put the plan
together. The consultant compared Syracuse University to 11
institutions similar in size and structure. Boston College, Brown,
Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Notre Dame universities were among
those on that list.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant found that Syracuse has, on average, about
600,000-square feet less academic space than those universities.
</P>
<P>
   Annual operating costs are expected to increase between $4
million and $5 million. The university will increase enrollment by
about 75 students in each entering class to pay for maintenance of
the new space.
</P>
<P>
   City and economic development officials welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exciting for us,'' said Irwin Davis, executive vice
president of the Metropolitan Development Agency and president of
the University Hill Corp. ''This is a major step for us.''

<HEADLINE> Knight Decision Due Monday  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The investigation of Indiana coach Bob
Knight is over, and whether he keeps his job will be decided Monday
by the university president.
</P>
<P>
   Grimly, university trustees trooped out of a meeting Sunday
after hearing a report from two members and putting the decision in
the hands of school president Myles Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Brand met at his campus home in Bloomington with Knight for two
hours until midnight Saturday in a session a school spokesman
described as ''very vigorous.'' Earlier that day, Knight apologized
for the temper tantrums that led to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Brand called a news conference for 4 p.m. EDT Monday to announce
his decision. Knight was not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Washinton Post, without citing any sources, reported that
Knight would be able to keep coaching at Indiana if he accepts
disciplinary action by the university. The report in the paper's
first edition Monday did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Walda, president of the nine-member board of trustees
and one of the two who investigated the allegations that Knight
choked a former player, looked somber as he left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process has been,'' Walda said, pausing to choose the
right word, ''productive, and we're just about to conclude it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Knight's strongest supporters among the trustees,
attorney Stephen Ferguson, did not attend Sunday's 2-hour,
20-minute meeting. He said he recused himself from the discussion
because he had negotiated Knight's contract with the university.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the report by Walda and fellow investigator
Frederick Eichhorn, the board thrashed through the issues of the
choking allegation and the other accusations of abuse by Knight
that have cropped up, and came to agreement about what should be
done.
</P>
<P>
   No vote was taken, university vice president Christopher Simpson
said, but the wishes of the board were clear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ''They certainly gave him advice and their opinions,'' said
Simpson, who attended the meeting. ''I think the discussions were
candid, they were thorough, and if there was one compelling,
underlying message, that is: What is best for Indiana University.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand's decision, Simpson said, will reflect the sentiments of
the trustees and will not require any further meeting with the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson insisted that ''no decision has been reached'' yet and
that Brand has ''a full range of options.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which began in March after former player Neil
Reed accused Knight of choking him in practice three years ago, was
expected to last until mid-June. That it ended a month sooner, amid
numerous other allegations that Knight physically and verbal abused
students, coaches and school officials, suggested to some faculty
members that the trustees were bothered by the damage being done to
the university.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason to stop the investigation is they can't stand the
pain anymore,'' said Murray Sperber, an English professor, author
of three books on college sports, and Knight's most vocal critic on
campus. ''The way to stop the pain is to get him to resign or fire
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said the investigation, which began in March, was
completed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was comprehensive, it was thorough, and it was
exhaustive,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Knight met with Brand on Saturday night in
Bloomington, shortly after Knight returned from a fishing trip in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees met amid speculation they would consider asking
Knight to resign rather than force a showdown that could lead to
his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has won three national titles, but his temper has fueled
one controversy after another since he became coach at Indiana in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   His contract gives Brand the power to fire him if such action is
recommended by the athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with the trustees and Brand were J. Terry Clapacs, vice
president of administration, and university counsel Dorothy
Frapwell.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana forward junior Tom Geyer showed up for the meeting but
was not allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The players wanted me to come down here and speak for the
players,'' Geyer said. ''We also feel the trustees are going to
make the right decision in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect to get a chance to talk to the trustees. I
just wanted to come down and show support for coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jared Jeffries, the highly touted Bloomington North High School
player who has signed to go to Indiana next year, has indicated he
would reconsider his plans if Knight is forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he would possibly look at the options and it would be
possible he would play this year and then try to transfer, even
though he would have to sit out a year,'' Jeffries' mother,
Cecelia, said. ''But we're praying this doesn't happen. Also it
depends on what some of the other players would do also.''
</P>
<P>
   She said as far as she knows, Jared has not been in contact with
Knight since Knight returned to campus.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Knight released a statement in which he apologized
for his temper and said he understands the need to be more
diplomatic and that he is trying to control his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not very good at just forgetting something and going on,
and I'm truly sorry about that,'' he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention if he would continue as coach, and he did not
apologize for any of the incidents of alleged abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation began, there have been reports Knight
once kicked Brand out of a practice and also showed players a piece
of soiled toilet paper as a way of describing their play.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, reports surfaced of fights involving Knight and a
former assistant coach, the athletic director and the university's
sports information director.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary in the athletic department last week said an enraged
Knight once threw a vase in her direction and more recently stormed
into a waiting area, cursed and came toward her in anger before
athletic director Clarence Doninger restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight around the trustees meeting because of
expectations of large protests, but only two fans showed up to
express their support of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomington, about 50 miles south of Indianapolis, the
streets were quiet and the Indiana campus -- currently between the
spring and summer sessions -- was virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, no one will be satisfied with the outcome,
regardless of what happens,'' said David Pisoni, a psychology
professor. ''The president will come out a loser, no matter what he
does.''

<HEADLINE> Short-staffed Danbury Police Dept. still reeling from recent setbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The town's tainted police department
is not only beleaguered, it's also the walking wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Eight officers currently are either on sick or injury leave,
adding additional pressure to a department already undermanned and
reportedly polarized by the recent criminal convictions of two of
its officers.
</P>
<P>
   The department is slated to have 45 sworn officers, but has only
28 who are active. The shortage has all but stopped a plan to have
one officer stationed at New Milford High School and another at
Schaghticoke Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to deal with the situation the best we can,'' Acting
Police Chief Colin McCormack told the Danbury News-Times. ''We are
still meeting all our staffing requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack acknowledged it's unusual to have eight officers out
on injury or sick leave, but denied the officers are out because of
problems coping with the convictions of former Officer Scott Smith
and Officer William Scribner.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was fired after he was convicted of intentional
manslaughter for shooting a suspect in the back. Last week, he was
sentenced to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner remains on desk duty pending sentencing June 14 after
being convicted this spring of negligent homicide for having killed
a teen-age girl when his cruiser crashed into her car at a New
Milford intersection. He faces six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said his missing officers are out because of injuries
they received in the line of duty. Six officers are out on injury
leave and receiving workers' compensation. Two others are on sick
leave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack currently is trying to recruit new officers but said
it takes five to six months before a recruit is trained to handle
regular patrol duties. Meanwhile, the department has used up its
$81,600 overtime budget and had to get an additional $75,000 to
cover overtime until the end of the fiscal year, June 30.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it received a federal grant for a community
policing initiative that would pay the salary of two officers. That
grant has never also been unused because of staffing woes and it's
not clear if and when it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCormack's fate is uncertain. The department has been
without a permanent police chief since August, and the town's
police search committee hasn't met in months.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack says his officers are doing the best job they can,
under tough circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have worked in a professional manner under obviously very
difficult situations,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Supporters rally around the mayor, but Democrats predict his demise </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- While Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took the weekend to
mull over his future and Republicans remain supportive, Democrats
are predicting that his Senate campaign is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all over but the shouting,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' on Sunday. ''As far as becoming the
next U.S. senator, forget it! He never really wanted the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to withdraw, and it has to be before the end of the
month because the Republican convention is taking place,'' former
Mayor Ed Koch told ABC's ''This Week.'' ''There's no question in my
mind he will drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sources would only say that Giuliani hadn't yet made up his
mind, while Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum,
stated, in a gloomy tone of voice, ''I've got no comment on
anything. I've got nothing to say on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from
Staten Island, told NBC's ''Meet the Press'': ''Nobody knows at
this point. I talked to the mayor's staff as late as yesterday
(Saturday). They are still waiting for him to come to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''If there is one person in the United States of
America who can handle that pressure and rise to the challenge and
in fact may even be spurred on by that pressure, it's Mayor
Giuliani. ... He's tougher and stronger than anyone ever gives him
credit for, so don't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari added that neither she nor her husband, former Rep.
Bill Paxon, R-Buffalo, was interested in running if Giuliani does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has prostate cancer and is seeking a separation from
his wife, Donna Hanover, who publicly accused him of having an
affair with a former City Hall aide. The mayor is also flaunting an
ongoing relationship with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ''Fox News,'' Rep. Vito Fossella, R-Staten Island,
added: ''He needs to take the bullets if he can, and I think there
will be a lot of people in New York who are still very much behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, the GOP's strongest potential candidate, has
said he's not interested in taking Giuliani's place, but Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-Long Island, and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted
Forstmann have expressed interest in running if Giuliani drops out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-Long Island, told ''Meet the Press'' he would
pursue the nomination but said it was too soon to write Giuliani
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was anybody else besides Rudy, he'd be out of it by now,
but he's very unpredictable,'' King said. ''If he can somehow get
this in order, if he can get a clean bill of health from the
doctors, if the marriage problems recede in the background, it's
possible by Labor Day you'll see once again a Rudy vs. Hillary
war.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Sunday's New York Post showed Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Giuliani neck and neck, with 42 percent supporting the
first lady and 40 percent supporting the mayor. Clinton's small
lead is well within the poll's 4.5-point margin of error. Only a
third of voters said Giuliani's troubles ''diminish his stature.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Opposition Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's
government is threatening a major crackdown on government
opponents, blaming them for the recent slaying of a ruling
Socialist Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the first confrontation in a renewed campaign
against the opposition, officials have promised to arrest
participants at a major anti-government rally today in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''All who perform activities against the state will be treated
in accordance with the law and prevented. The time of their street
actions is over,'' Goran Matic, Yugoslavia's information minister
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if opposition activists would face arrest for attending
today's rally, Matic said: ''That is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was scheduled after organizers caved in to government
pressure last week not to hold a protest in Milosevic's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in Serbia have soared following the slaying Saturday of
Bosko Perosevic, 43, the head of the Vojvodina provincial
government and chief of a Socialist party branch there. Milosevic's
top aides said the pro-democracy student group Otpor and the
opposition Serbian Renewal Movement party masterminded the attack
on behalf of NATO and would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Perosevic was touring a trade fair in Novi Sad, the capital of
the northern province, when a guard, identified as 50-year-old
exhibition hall security guard Milan Gutovic, fatally shot him in
the head. Gutovic was immediately arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police said in a statement they found ''beyond doubt'' the
suspect was an activist with Otpor and the Serbian Renewal Movement
and that a search of his home turned up ''posters and propaganda
material'' belonging to the groups, along with ''brochures on
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Both groups have rejected the allegations and denied any
connection with the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government appears ready to seize on the killing to
crack down on dissent, which has been fed by growing poverty and
isolation brought on during Milosevic's more than ten years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Gutovic, a number of other people have also been
detained for interrogation, Matic said. He declined to specify how
many had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Marovic, a top leader of Otpor, which means resistance in
Serbo-Croatian, said several of the group's activists have been
questioned and detained. He called Matic's allegations ''lies'' and
''political marketing'' in an attempt to use the tragedy ''to crack
down on political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The private Beta news agency reported six other arrests, mostly
in Vojvodina, in connection with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Matic also blamed the killing on NATO countries that launched a
78-day air war against Yugoslavia last year to force Milosevic to
abandon a crackdown against Muslims in Kosovo. The attack was
organized ''with a deep political background, with the aim to
destabilize Yugoslavia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NATO aggressors are now putting their weapons in the hands
of their servants here, to do for them the dirty job, to spread
fear and chaos,'' said Gorica Gajevic, secretary general of the
socialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement denied the government allegations
and rejected any connection with Gutovic, calling him ''a
monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the murder has a political background, the real culprits
should be sought within the regime, which is ... instigating bloody
conflicts,'' a statement from the opposition party said.

<HEADLINE> New York chancellor is giving school system a cultured kick  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A tombstone. A jar of Twizzlers. A teetering
tower of playing blocks.
</P>
<P>
   They're just a few of the things Harold Levy moved into his
office when he accepted one of the most challenging jobs in America
-- running the country's largest school system.
</P>
<P>
   The small granite tombstone inscribed ''Levy'' sits on his
windowsill overlooking downtown Brooklyn at Board of Education
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tombstones are what life is about: Do what you can before you
die. And it's entertaining,'' Levy says with an easy smile.
</P>
<P>
   As he sits at his conference table, the 47-year-old lawyer is
wearing an impeccably tailored dark suit -- a leftover from his job
as a Citigroup executive.
</P>
<P>
   He was named interim schools chancellor three months ago,
following the swift departure of Rudy Crew amid policy clashes with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   After a nationwide search for a new chancellor, Levy is now the
sole candidate when the seven-member school board votes this week --
a virtual shoo-in as the permanent head of a system with more than
1.1 million students, 78,000 teachers and 130,000 other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the winter, Levy's first move was as fresh as he was: He
sent three poems by Wallace Stevens to the 43 school
superintendents, with a memo telling them he's interested in ''the
inner souls of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he made the city's school superintendents play -- by
arranging a group violin lesson at Carnegie Hall with virtuoso
Isaac Stern.
</P>
<P>
   And how does one turn such cultured oomph into academic
achievement?
</P>
<P>
   ''From music can come order,'' Stern told the superintendents
last week in a Carnegie studio somewhere above the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Like musical soldiers in formation, 40 black violin cases stood
at the ready, lined with cheap blue velour. Rented at $10 apiece,
they were hardly Stradivaris.
</P>
<P>
   But the fiddles delivered the message.
</P>
<P>
   Just holding the instrument took discipline; one superintendent
put hers on the wrong shoulder -- upside down. Somehow, amid the
cacophony and fits of laughter, the educators managed to accompany
their 79-year-old master as he played ''Did You Ever See a
Lassie.''
</P>
<P>
   Music ''is one of the most disciplined teachers,'' Stern told
them. ''And if it doesn't start with you, who the hell is it going
to start with?''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was not lost on Paula LeCompte Speed, superintendent
of Brooklyn's District 18, which covers the Canarsie and East
Flatbush neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very powerful,'' she said. ''Everything is related. We
need more arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy concedes the half-hour session was ''a marketing ploy -- I
want the kids to be excited, not just treat learning like spinach.
Art and music are the hook by which we get the attention of
students who might otherwise drift away.''
</P>
<P>
   It's his way of tackling his top concerns: ''Can we get good
teachers? Can we get the students to perform on these damned tests?
And if you can't, then everything else doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding brains to the marketing, Levy has a resident intellectual
in the chancellor's office -- his old friend Jonathan Levi, a jazz
violinist, writer and founding editor of the Granta literary
magazine who is overseeing the existing arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   The schools chancellor is pushing music and poetry in a system
plagued with rats, guns and crumbling school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   An earthy New Yorker with a fine-tuned mind, Levy occasionally
targets such problems by softly spitting out four-letter words --
between smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Glee fills his face as he rails against the physical state of
the Board of Education headquarters, a Kafkaesque labyrinth of
rooms connected by long, dreary corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The day Levy first arrived -- exactly 109 days earlier, he
reminds a visitor -- the mammoth edifice at 110 Livingston Street
''was filthy. There was garbage in the halls. The word that leapt
out was Windex!''
</P>
<P>
   With signs warning Board of Ed employees not to bring in guns,
he added, ''this place was more depressing than Attica,'' the state
prison famous for a 1971 riot against the dreadful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On a table outside Levy's office are pamphlets with lists of
weapons prohibited in city schools -- everything from shotguns,
switchblade knives and stilettos to scissors and broken glass. And
there's a list of punishments for students who do bring weapons to
class.
</P>
<P>
   Levy takes on such big issues -- as well as other ''stuff,'' as
he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, with the temperature below freezing, he first walked
into his 10th-floor office and found two air conditioners going
full blast. He was told they were needed to regulate the antiquated
heating system, and the windows had to stay shut.
</P>
<P>
   On this warm spring day, the sun shone through an open window.
And ''open'' is the key word in changing what Levy calls the
board's ''barricade mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Livingston Street was a castle with high walls,'' he says.
''And people couldn't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   He's posted the direct phone numbers of top board officials on
the Internet ''so every parent knows,'' and he's streamlined the
organizational chart, ''which was two years old and looked like
plumbing.''
</P>
<P>
   A human meteor moving through the building, Levy fields urgent
messages from aides who pop up every few minutes, quickly returns
phone calls and pitches jokes -- all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Then he relaxes behind the conference table, shoving his
tasseled corporate shoe under his left leg as he answers a
reporter's questions. Behind him sits the jar of Twizzlers, twisted
red candy sticks, and the alphabet blocks, ''which I put in that
basket and offer to visitors to play with,'' he says jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Working 14-hour days, Levy returns to his Upper West Side home
late each night, seeing little of his wife and two children, a
9-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I answer my e-mail in the middle of the night. I don't need
much sleep,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has no formal background in education, though he belonged
to the city Bar Association's education committee and the state
Board of Regents, which oversees exams required for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   It's his corporate career that honed his skills for handling
problems ranging from violence to an often paralyzed bureaucracy.
From a Park Avenue office, Levy was director of global compliance
for Citigroup, and before that he was the chief litigator at what
was then known as Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, ''I was in charge of screwups,'' he adds, his eyes
twinkling behind wire-rim glasses.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked at a commodities firm, where lucite blocks
marking successful deals were dubbed ''tombstones.'' He had his own
granite slab made ''because I was trying to get the point across
that those lucite blocks are not what life is about.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's obviously not about the $245,000 salary he draws as
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   For him now, it's about injecting some corporate savvy -- ''and
humanity'' -- into a dusty bureaucratic dinosaur with a $10.6
billion annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Levy's 100-plus-day performance has been so
effective that last week, the last rival candidate pulled out of
the race for chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendents -- whose credentials Levy plans to
re-evaluate -- should now get ready for more inspired mail.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he's sending them replicas of a sign he keeps on his
work-littered desk.
</P>
<P>
   It says: ''I'm responsible.''

<HEADLINE> Peach Sculptor Creates Delicate Art  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- Inside every peach is a pit, and inside
each pit is something Alfred LaBrush wants to show you.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a soaring eagle. Or a bear. Or a family of bears,
one with a salmon flapping in its jaws. It might be all these
things, set against a tumbling waterfall, painstakingly carved in a
three-dimensional, inch-high tableau.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have been a surgeon,'' LaBrush says. Instead, the
self-taught artist, 58, has used his steady hands for 46 years to
chip away at the brittle stones, creating delicate, fanciful
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   He has more than 75 of them, but the disabled printer never
exhibited his collection until last summer when he showed it at a
peach festival in nearby Thurmont.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for money -- he won't sell the carvings -- but for
charity. His booth was sponsored by a group opposed to drunken
drivers. Like the driver who smashed into LaBrush's pickup truck in
1996, leaving the artist's left arm and hand partially paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the young people, when they see the collection, say,
'Gee, I thought just about everything had been done that can be
done,''' LaBrush says. ''There's still simple things out there,
just like finding these images in peach pits. You don't have to
drink and do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash, along with injuries from an accident at work in 1992,
have slowed LaBrush's output, but speed isn't a concern. A
sculpture can take three months of work, on-again, off-again. He
finishes just one or two a year.
</P>
<P>
   And he treasures them all: the praying man that was his first
attempt at age 12; the whimsical human figure astride a giraffe;
the red-tailed hawk with paper-thin wings swooping down on a
mallard duck; the waterfall scene with two eagles, three bears and
a freshly caught salmon.
</P>
<P>
   A whittler since boyhood, he studies peach pits for images
outlined by surface ridges and creases -- ''Every one you pick up,
you can find something,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He cleans them in the washing machine and cures them in bleach
and water, a process that takes eight months or more. Then he chips
off everything that isn't part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Some are relief carvings, like the painted climber in green
shirt and red pants crawling up the seed's horny surface. And there
are 3-D works so fragile that LaBrush sometimes snaps the figures
off while carving.
</P>
<P>
   A collector of waterfowl art once offered him $2,000 for one of
his works, LaBrush says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was tempted,'' he admits. ''But I'd never be able to find
another one like that. They're one-of-a-kind and you just can't go
back and duplicate them.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBrush picks up extra cash by selling his more modest peach pit
pendants, engraved with images of flowers or the church spires of
Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   Peach-pit carving originated in China, where the fruit is a
symbol of longevity, according to Tim Hallman of the Asian Art
Museum in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, it flourishes in the South, where peach
orchards are plentiful, says Matt Lippa, a folk-art dealer in
Mentone, Ala. Baskets and monkeys are common themes; nature scenes
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably more detailed than I have ever heard,'' Lippa
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Freeze, manager of the Thurmont peach festival, calls
LaBrush's work amazing. ''I can't even imagine being able to see
that teeny, tiny thing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   LaBrush expects to donate the collection to a museum and hopes
to teach the art to others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be kind of selfish to be able to have all this and
not share it.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Phasing Out 'Scared Straight'  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A kinder, gentler version of ''Scared
Straight?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what New Jersey's Department of Corrections is promoting
these days, much to the dismay of supporters of the landmark,
in-your-face program that gives delinquents a brutal look at prison
life while they still have a chance to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 award-winning television special filmed at East
Jersey State Prison, convicts stripped teens of their shoes, spit
in their faces, threatened to hurt some and told them rape, murder
and lost dreams would await them in prison if they didn't
straighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' won two Emmys and an Oscar and the program,
founded in 1976 at the Rahway prison, went on to reach more than
50,000 troubled young people and has spawned replica programs
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even 20 years later, the words ''Scared Straight'' still recall
the cold stares of convicts, the frightened, tearful expressions of
young delinquents and expletive-filled tirades aimed at keeping
young people out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the state has decided that ''Scared
Straight'' may be better television than it is an effective crime
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Corrections ordered a reevaluation of
the program last fall that led to a slowdown. Only one session has
occurred since December, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it decided to restart a toned-down, less aggressive
version of the program and took control of another program aimed at
high school and college classes from the Lifers, the East Jersey
State inmates who run ''Scared Straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune said independent studies
have shown that scare tactics don't stop juveniles from committing
crime. He touted a program he founded in 1998, Project Pride, which
takes inmates into schools ''to address students in a very positive
and proactive way, as opposed to the foundation of 'Scared
Straight,' which is clearly a negative context.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan August, a retired Corrections officer who founded the
program, said the scare tactics were meant to get the attention of
delinquents who didn't want to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids were real wiseguys, most of them,'' August said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scared Straight'' supporters say they have countless stories
from people who say the in-your-face intimidation of hardened
criminals helped take them off a dangerous path.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Shapiro, who produced the 1979 ''Scared Straight'' film,
a 20-year sequel tracking those in the original, and a 1999 film
about the program for MTV, said 80 percent of the young people who
listened to the convicts in the shows avoided a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   And ''I can't relate to you the number of people over the years
who have said to me that just by watching on television what the
Lifers were doing, it dissuaded them away from the direction
they're heading,'' said Shapiro. ''That's prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Several high school and college officials have written to Gov.
Christie Whitman in recent weeks, saying the Lifers' tour is
unparalleled and shouldn't be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meeting with the Lifers ranks with the finest human
interaction and educational experiences of our lives,'' wrote
Barbara J. Gonos, a Brookdale Community College professor who has
taken students to see the Lifers for a dozen years.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. County Coping With Budget Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- By the time Gov. George Pataki came riding
in last week with a $100 million financial bailout plan for Nassau
County, residents in this New York City bedroom community -- one of
the richest in the nation -- were already coping with the effects of
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this has done to our community is a disaster,'' said Rudy
Vanterpool, administrator of the New Cassel/Westbury Youth Services
Project, one of nearly 100 social service agencies that suffered $8
million in cuts. ''I can't even put into words what has happened to
us, it's so horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The smorgasbord of services provided to Nassau's citizens for
years was part of what brought the county to near bankruptcy.
Nassau's Republican leadership kept adding government programs --
and kept voters happy by not raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to pay the piper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole business community has been very concerned about the
situation,'' said Matt Crosson, president of the Long Island
Association, the island's largest business group. ''It casts a
shadow over the economy of not only Nassau County, but Long Island
in general.''
</P>
<P>
   How exactly did one of the nation's wealthiest counties get into
such a financial mess? Why are lawmakers scrambling to close a $117
million shortfall this year alone?
</P>
<P>
   Fred Parolla, the county comptroller, blames the mess in part on
County Executive Thomas Gulotta, who ''didn't raise the general
property tax for eight of 10 years,'' Parolla said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Parolla said, contracts with the public employee
unions, especially the police unions, have grown ''beyond what the
county can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spending makes up nearly a quarter of the county's $2.2
billion budget and has risen 64 percent since 1989, twice as fast
as county spending overall.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that Nassau employs 230 officers per
100,000 residents, 77 percent higher than the average for suburban
county departments nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta, who is proud of his record of keeping taxes steady, has
said that Nassau consistently fights against police spending
increases, but usually loses in binding arbitration. He recently
threatened to lay off more than 200 officers unless the police
union agrees to a package of contract givebacks.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that despite the fiscal problems, Nassau County
is still rated among the best places in the country to live;
something he sees as a positive reflection of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the mess can be traced to the fact that the
county relied too much on borrowing. Wall Street executive Frank
Zarb, who was appointed by Pataki in March to review Nassau's
financial health, said last week that the county's $2.7 billion
long-term debt was ''extremely high.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the per capita debt in Nassau was $2,210, while
the average amount for residents in neighboring counties, including
New York City, was $311.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the county's precarious financial condition, Standard
&AMP; Poor's has given Nassau a credit rating that is one notch above
junk status, making it much more expensive to borrow. It has
threatened another downgrade unless the county begins to straighten
itself out by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution offered last week by Pataki and Zarb, who
is chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, is
to create a separate bonding agency to refinance some of the
county's long-term debt at lower interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau also is sinking under the burden of an archaic property
tax assessment system unchanged since 1938 -- before the postwar
building boom transformed the rural county into quintessential
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, property owners challenged their assessments so
successfully that the county has run up an $800 million debt to pay
refunds. Also, it takes an average of six years to settle a tax
grievance case because the county doesn't have enough staff to
handle cases.
</P>
<P>
   The county legislature voted in March to overhaul the assessment
system by 2003, spurred by the threat of a lawsuit claiming the
system is discriminatory. The complaint was that homes increased in
value much faster in white neighborhoods than in minority areas,
leaving minority homeowners paying a higher percentage of home
value in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The county's financial troubles have yet to have an impact on
home sales, according Tricia Chirco of the Long Island Board of
Realtors. She said April sales figures put the median price for a
Nassau County home at $254,000, up from $220,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still feeling comfortable about selling and
buying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's rescue plan signaled state Republicans would fight hard
to regain control of a county that could be pivotal in the U.S.
Senate and presidential races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ''carrot-and-stick'' bailout offer requires the
county to cut $50 million from this year's budget, as well as $70
million in each of the next three years. Pataki has offered $100
million in aid over five years, contingent on the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Smith, director of Long Beach Reach, a social service
program, said the deep cuts in funding for youth programs mean
''we're basically throwing away a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to do that as a society,'' he said. ''It's
every bit as important as the police and the other things we take
for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't, Rebels Set Terms  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- The government and Muslim guerrillas
both set new conditions Monday for the start of talks on freeing 21
Western and Asian hostages being held by the rebels in a southern
Philippine jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebel spokesman Abu Ahmad said the military must stop
all operations in the provinces where the rebels are holding
captives and allow the guerrillas to meet face-to-face with the
armed forces chief of staff and the national police chief.
</P>
<P>
   The government must also allow Abu Sayyaf leaders on the island
of Basilan to travel to the nearby island of Jolo, where the 21
hostages are held, so they can join in the talks, Ahmad told DXRZ
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, insisted on receiving a single
written set of demands from the rebels rather than the piecemeal,
informal demands they have been making for the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want them to make collective decisions,'' negotiator Robert
Aventajado said Monday. ''Otherwise, how can we hold negotiations
at all?''
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado, who flew to Manila late Sunday to consult with
President Joseph Estrada, said he planned to return to Jolo on
Tuesday and hoped to begin formal negotiations based on written
demands from the rebels the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without them putting their demands in writing, we'll just be
confused,'' Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage situation is one incident in the widespread rebel
violence -- the worst in years -- that has engulfed the southern
Philippines of late. Rebels and government troops have fought a
number of battles. In Basilan province, where rebels are holding a
separate group of hostages, four captives were shot and killed
during a May 3 firefight between rebels and troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the impoverished southern island of Mindanao on Sunday,
troops rescued 183 villagers who had been captured by the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, the larger Muslim rebel group. Three
rebels died in a gun battle with the troops, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers had been seized Saturday by rebels who went from
house to house stealing food, officials said. They had spent the
night in the mountains in southern Sultan Kudarat province.
</P>
<P>
   A third group fighting the government, the communist insurgents
of the New People's Army, killed five people, including two
civilians, when its fighters ambushed a security patrol Saturday in
Mindanao, the military said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in the region flared last month after the military
attacked MILF rebels occupying a section of highway near their main
camp on Mindanao. The MILF withdrew from peace talks after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels have threatened to retaliate by striking government
targets in Manila, and early Sunday, a rocket-propelled grenade was
fired at national police headquarters in the city. Damage was
limited and no one was injured. A MILF leader would not comment on
whether his group was responsible.

<HEADLINE> Schroeders Party Returns To Power  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's biggest state returned Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats to power despite an attempt by
the scandal-plagued Christian Democrats to win votes by criticizing
the government's plans to import foreign high technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results showed the Social Democrats finishing
Sunday's election in North Rhine-Westphalia with 42.8 percent of
the vote. Though enough to win, that was less than the 46 percent
they received in the western industrial state five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Christian Democrats received 37 percent of the
vote, according to ARD television, slightly less than the 37.7
percent they received in the last election in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Gov. Wolfgang Clement said he would open talks today
with his coalition partners, the Greens, even though they fell from
third-strongest in the statehouse to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens dropped from 10 percent of the vote in 1995 to 7
percent, while the pro-business Free Democrats -- who last time
didn't even clear the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament --
finished as the big gainers with nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''red-green'' coalition mirrors the one in Berlin,
leading many commentators to portray the state vote as a referendum
on the national government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schroeder and Clement have cast themselves as
business-friendly centrists and sharply disagree with some of the
Greens' positions on issues such as energy taxes and transportation
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Moellemann, state chairman of the Free Democrats, called
on Clement to negotiate a coalition with his party rather than
stick with a ''coalition of the losers.'' Clement said he was ''in
principle'' ready to talk to all parties -- possibly a reminder to
the Greens not to overestimate their influence in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Democrats appeared to benefit the most from the slush
fund scandal that has plagued their erstwhile coalition partners,
the conservative Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The state election is the first since the Christian Democrats'
new, untainted leader -- a woman from former East Germany, Angela
Merkel -- took over the party last month with the promise of a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts said exit polls show the scandal over off-the-books
donations, secret bank accounts and possible influence peddling
under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl continued to cost the Christian
Democrats votes.
</P>
<P>
   The party's lead candidate, Juergen Ruettgers, sought to refocus
the campaign by attacking Schroeder's plans to issue 20,000 work
permits to foreigners to fill a critical labor shortage in the
high-tech and software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although his slogan ''Kinder statt Inder'' -- ''children instead
of Indians'' -- was even criticized by some members of his own party
as borderline xenophobic, Ruettgers credited it with helping the
party regain some lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers' position urges better training of German workers
rather than importing high-tech specialists, many of whom would
come from India.
</P>
<P>
   ''That motivated the people,'' he told German television. ''We
were able to focus on education and jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, voter turnout in the election was sharply lower. ARD said
around 56 percent of the state's 13 million eligible voters cast
ballots, down from 64 percent in the last election.

<HEADLINE> Camp Teaches Farm Kids To Beware  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS LEHOURITES
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZARK, Ark. (AP) -- Life on the farm can be fun, especially for a
kid, but an ounce of carelessness can leave a child scarred, maimed
or dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason behind the Farm Safety Day Camp, which farmer
Karen Skeets holds once a year at the Ozark Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need it. You read about too many deaths (of kids) on
farms,'' Skeets said while conducting her most recent camp.
</P>
<P>
   Skeets said she came up with the idea while reading a magazine
at her poultry and cattle farm at Branch one night. She was
pregnant at the time and the message hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ''One hundred thousand kids are injured every year in
agricultural accidents. And those are just the numbers that
required hospitalization or medical care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeets read about the Progressive Farm Safety Day Camp and
called the company to find out how she could start one in Arkansas.
Progressive has been sponsoring camps across the nation since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Ozark camp moves 10 groups of kids through 10 different
classes in a day. The lessons include First Aid,
all-terrain-vehicle safety, PTO, or ''power-take-off,'' safety;
hidden hazards, firearm safety and snakes.
</P>
<P>
   After Skeets completed a training session in Dallas, she was
allowed to open the one-day camp using the Progressive name.
Progressive provides T-shirts, goody-bags and insurance; Skeets
provides the rest through donations.
</P>
<P>
   Her first camp, in 1998, had 118 children and last year's had
190. Her session April 29 drew 208. Nationally, there were 229
camps in 1999 with 40,000 kids attending.
</P>
<P>
   Skeets drew children to the Ozark Fairgrounds this spring from
seven counties in western Arkansas and one county in eastern
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep away from the PTOs (power-take-off). They'll kill you,''
said 12-year-old Nathan Schluterman of Subiaco, Ark. ''If I have a
0.2-second reaction time, I'll just get a goose bump. If not,
you're dead or injured.''
</P>
<P>
   A power-take-off is used to tap the power source of a tractor to
help run other machinery. Resulting accidents can be severe.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Frank, a farmer and one of the PTO instructors, was
speaking from experience when he told the kids to be safe. Frank
lost his right arm in a PTO accident 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are asking the right questions and listening a lot better
than I thought they would,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides listening to stories about horrible accidents, the kids
were taught a new appreciation for snakes -- hands on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people who get bitten by snakes are trying to kill them.
If you get bitten, stay calm, get to a phone and get to a doctor,''
said Millie Phillips, who called herself ''The Snake Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   While walking around the room with a nonpoisonous corn snake,
Phillips told the kids not to kill the snakes they may find on
their farms because they keep down the mice, rat and frog
populations. All but one camper touched the snake.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors at the camp are volunteers, including farmers,
police officers and members of groups such as the Arkansas Farm
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program is important because they (kids) get to realize
farming is work. Driving a tractor is as fun as riding a bicycle,
but they realize it is work and there's some danger in it,'' said
Andy Guffey of the Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Skeets knew her camp was doing some good when she got a card
from a 16-year-old who attended her camp last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wrote, 'I thought I knew everything and found out I
didn't.' If you can get a 16-year-old to admit that, that's
great,'' Skeets said.
</P>
<P>
   Success for the camp is tough to measure, but Skeets has a
method.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way I know if this camp is successful is if I don't
read about the kids (having accidents) in the paper,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> He's on trial, she's under microscope  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Westchester County's district
attorney, Jeanine Pirro, has not been accused of anything, but she
still finds herself embroiled in a $1 million tax fraud case that
begins this week against her husband.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six weeks or so, journalists and spectators will be
camped out at the federal courthouse, just outside Mrs. Pirro's
office, straining to hear any mention of her as testimony about
household expenses, family relationships and joint tax returns go
into the public record.
</P>
<P>
   With prosecutors already alleging that an auto loan she took out
was a sham used by her husband to cover tax fraud, there's a good
chance the trial will amount to another in a series of spousal
roadblocks that have limited Mrs. Pirro's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Albert Pirro, and his brother and accountant,
Anthony, are accused of claiming business write-offs for
nondeductible expenses ranging from baby sitters to family
vacations to the investigators Albert hired during his unsuccessful
fight against a paternity suit.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' defense is to blame each other, with cutthroat
tactics that make it seem as if Cain and Abel had run afoul of the
Internal Revenue Service. Each has aired embarrassing family
laundry, and Albert, a top Republican fund-raiser and one of the
state's leading lobbyists, even hid a camcorder in his office and
tried to wheedle an unwitting Anthony into clearing him.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Albert Pirro blames the feds, claiming his troubles
are part of a Clinton administration plan to hold down potential
GOP stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows that my wife could have been and should have
been a statewide candidate for political office by now,'' he said
in his office last month, with pictures of his wife arrayed behind
him. ''The only thing that has held her back is the fact that her
husband ... has been subjected to constant spotlight, scrutiny and
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White refused to comment on his
allegations, although the assistants who are prosecuting the case,
Elliott Jacobson and Cathy Seibel, requested a gag order after
Pirro made his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro also would not comment on her husband's claims --
or any other questions about the trial or her relationship with her
husband. Defense attorneys have asked her not to comment, and she
fears anything she says might be misconstrued, her office says.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband was indicted in February 1999, however, Mrs.
Pirro expressed confidence he would be exonerated, providing the
rare sight of a top prosecutor predicting an acquittal. She also
said the federal investigation had been ''a very invasive and
hostile process for my husband and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would say whether Mrs. Pirro is to be called as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Now 48, the district attorney has been mentioned time and again
as a likely candidate for higher office, having won national
attention with appearances on ''Geraldo,'' ''Larry King Live'' and
People magazine's ''50 Most Beautiful People'' list. She has
specialized in prosecuting domestic violence and Internet
pedophilia cases and is Westchester's leading vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   But her husband keeps getting in the way, politically:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1986, she withdrew as the Republican nominee for lieutenant
governor because he refused to divulge information about his law
practice.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1995, the paternity suit was filed and Albert Pirro
eventually acknowledged he is the father of an Indiana teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1997, a federal bribery investigation was launched after a
Yonkers official claimed Albert Pirro bribed him to expedite the
approval of a 10-screen theater. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   During that investigation, Jeanine Pirro angrily said,
''Whenever I run, there will be questions about my husband. That's
not only holding women to a different standard, that's saying,
'We're not looking at you as a person on your own.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, Albert Pirro, 52, acknowledges problems
with his tax returns but notes they were prepared by his brother.
He blames the errors on ''Anthony's incompetence and his personal,
psychological and legal problems,'' including a 1992 cocaine
possession conviction in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In the camcorder escapade, which Judge Barrington Parker ruled
inadmissible, Pirro recorded his brother admitting that he prepared
the tax returns negligently and that Albert never asked him to do
anything illegal. Anthony, 45, also said investigators are ''trying
to put heat on me to come in and roll on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, in turn, revealed that Albert Pirro was admitted to a
psychiatric hospital in 1986 and has been treated with
anti-depressants and mood-stabilizing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gustave Newman, one of Albert Pirro's six defense lawyers, said
the hospitalization was for ''situational depression ... related to
the scrutiny that he experienced as the spouse of a person seeking
statewide elected office.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Drafts Social Security Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- With the Social Security system now as old
as the retirees eligible to reap its benefits, George W. Bush today
was outlining his principles for reform -- including allowing
younger workers to privately invest some of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The principles, many of which have already trickled into stump
speeches by the Republican presidential contender, could present
one of the defining issues of the general election campaign.
Traditionally, touching the 65-year-old system has been considered
akin to grabbing a political third rail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said, 'Why are you bringing up such a touchy
issue?''' the Texas governor said Friday. ''I said, 'Because I'm
running to lead, is why.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was outlining his plan during a speech at a senior citizens
center outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pushing for private accounts, Bush is expected to pledge
to maintain current benefits for those at or near retirement; to
''lockbox'' payroll taxes to prevent borrowing against the Social
Security trust fund; and to refuse to increase the current 12.4
percent payroll tax used to fill the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, calls Bush's
plans ''vague'' and has warned against privately managed Social
Security investments, labeling the idea ''stock market Roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that Bush cannot afford his reforms because he
wants to use some of the projected federal budget surplus to
finance a five-year, $460 billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore favors paying down the national debt and using the savings
in interest payments to shore up the existing Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, delivering his own speech Social Security
today at Beaver College in Amber, Pa., said last week: ''Think
about what happens when that first generation of Americans retires
in a bear market. They would be left trying to live on worthless
paper and we as a nation could be left stuck with sky-high bailout
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of Social Security reform is driven by several
factors: an increase in life expectancy, the impending retirement
of the 77-million strong baby boom generation and the resulting
decline in the number of workers to support the retirees' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is funded through a ''tax-and-transfer''
method, in which benefits are paid directly with money collected
from payroll taxes. That leaves it vulnerable to a declining work
force and an increasing number of dependents. The existing system
is now projected to become insolvent in 2037.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues that private investment accounts are a necessary and
cost-effective way to keep the system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The private investment accounts he wants would be voluntary.
Although Bush has not specified how they would be funded, the most
commonly discussed method is diverting 2 percent of the
12.4-percent payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts would face some regulation to guard against
speculation, but Bush argues that if the money is invested over
time, retirees will get the long-term benefits of compounding
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a 22-year-old earning $20,000 per year were
allowed to invest 2 percent of his payroll tax at the relatively
modest rate of return of 5.5 percent, by the time he retired at age
67, his account would be worth $101,775 -- plus his remaining Social
Security benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A person the same age earning $30,000 would be left with an
account of $152,675.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the existing system pays benefits derived from a
variety of factors, including a worker's former salary. The average
monthly check is $660, or about $8,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is betting his proposal will be embraced by the new class
of investors and e-traders who have propelled the stock market to
unprecedented heights.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Gore's criticism, Bush told a group of senior
citizens in Davenport, Iowa, last week: ''It's become part of the
political process to say, 'OK, George Bush, don't vote for him,
he's going to take away your Social Security check.' People, I
think, in America are more sophisticated than that now.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Convention To Face Protests  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- When Republicans come to town this summer
for their national convention, protesters will be ready with picket
signs and chants to attract the attention of the thousands of
delegates and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What will they say?
</P>
<P>
   ''In Philadelphia, there is no common goal,'' said Kristen
Bricker, who started a youth activist group on the Internet to
bring people to the city on July 30, the eve of the four-day
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Though no unifying issue has emerged, ''we have a common bond,''
said Bricker, 17, of Wilmington, Del. ''We feel that something
isn't right. There are things that need to be changed and we need
to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention protesters haven't united behind a cause since 1972
when anti-Vietnam War demonstrations rocked both parties' meetings
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   This year, plenty of issues are being talked about:
anti-capitalism, women's rights, gay rights, animal rights, human
rights in China, campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Several protests are planned to coincide with the convention.
Organizers of Unity 2000 hope to draw as many as 100,000 people for
the July 30 rally and march downtown. Leaders from at least 100
different groups will be invited to speak.
</P>
<P>
   And groups will also use paid TV and radio commercials to
promote their causes. Republicans for Choice already has released a
radio spot it plans to run during the convention urging the GOP to
heed former first lady Barbara Bush's position supporting abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Listen to your mama,'' an announcer says. ''That's a family
value we can all agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted a city permit last month, Unity 2000 is intended as a
peaceful parade and has been called the ''family protest'' by
groups planning other events during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   No civil disobedience or police confrontations are planned, and
organizers have taken pains to be sure participants do not march
solely against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just about fighting either party,'' said lead
organizer Michael Morrill of the Pennsylvania Consumer Action
Network. ''I really do feel there is a sense of discontent in this
country on a lot of different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   He also believes limiting the rally to a single theme could
attract fewer participants.
</P>
<P>
   But meetings and e-mail postings for the event have been
conflicting, with many participants urging a single message.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Conti, 53, of Philadelphia, plans to protest Lockheed
Martin's weapons contracts. But he supports choosing a unifying
message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the issue should be democracy. I'm not sure what it will
be,'' Conti said.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker said she plans to demonstrate for animal rights and
against police brutality and U.S. involvement with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause -- or causes -- expected demonstrators say
there is a political-action fever sweeping the country. Tens of
thousands of people rallied in Seattle against the World Trade
Organization talks last fall, and thousands protested IMF meetings
in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that there has been a synergy that is happened among
different movements,'' said John Sellers of the California-based
Ruckus Society, which trains activists to use civil action to press
for social change. ''I think that once a movement starts to build
and the different struggles come together, it creates a critical
mass of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruckus Society, one of the primary organizers of the Seattle
protests, plans a three-day training session in June in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With so many issues apparently vying for attention, there is
concern that the demonstrations either will be misconstrued by
journalists as having no message or will not have enough
participants for the message to be heard at all.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be a disappointment to Philadelphia Deputy Police
Commissioner Robert Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington may have been a downer for a few of them, and then
there were the May Day events in Boston, New York and Chicago that
didn't seem to draw too many people,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrill said the groups' diversity is their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're creating a space for lots of different kinds of people
to express themselves,'' he said. ''They can get information and
get inspired, then go home and get organized on their issues.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Facing Showdown on Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This week could be a decisive one for
President Clinton's policy of keeping U.S. troops in Kosovo, with
showdowns likely in the Senate and House that could ultimately
force withdrawal of the peacekeepers next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there will be a tangle over bipartisan language
in a routine military construction spending bill requiring the
Americans' removal from the breakaway Yugoslav province beginning
July 1, 2001, unless Congress votes to keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be a renewed effort by a group of Democrats and
Republicans in the House to require the troops' withdrawal unless
Clinton certifies that Europeans are delivering promised aid for
rebuilding the violence-shattered Balkan enclave. The deadline
would be next April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials oppose both provisions, even though
final decisions would not have to be made until after the next
president takes office. But in the face of widespread congressional
skepticism about U.S. efforts in Kosovo, White House prospects for
stopping some form of restrictions on American forces there are
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's best hope may be rallying enough votes --
more than one-third the members voting in either chamber -- to
signal that a Clinton veto would be sustained. That ultimately
could lead to watered-down language, either before or after an
actual veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be a strong debate on it,'' said Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., a co-author of the
Senate language. ''Anytime you have that much interest in a debate,
you have to wait and see'' about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional opposition to the 5,900 U.S. troops in the
NATO-led, 37,000-strong Kosovo peacekeeping force is a confluence
of several factors. Some like Warner want the Europeans to pick up
more of the responsibility and cost of the aftermath of NATO's
78-day air war against the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Others like cosponsoring Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., believe that
for constitutional reasons, Congress should not let a president
unilaterally dispatch U.S. troops abroad. Still others think the
venture in Kosovo was ill-advised from the start and could become
an open-ended risk of American lives in a region known for its
intractable and violent ethnic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of both parties are supporting Clinton. They
argue that setting a withdrawal date would be a foreign policy
failure that would only encourage Milosevic to postpone further
provocations until the Americans have left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passage would send a very misguided signal to all parties in
the area that they can't count on our staying power,'' Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., a leading GOP voice on foreign affairs, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Others opposing the withdrawal language include Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz., the one-time GOP presidential hopeful; Carl Levin,
D-Mich., top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee; and Joseph
Biden, D-Del., senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the administration's difficult path ahead, the
Byrd-Warner language was approved last week by the Senate
Appropriations Committee by a one-sided 23-3. Only three liberal
Democrats opposed the provision, which would also require Clinton
to develop a plan for having the Europeans supply all ground
combat-troop peacekeepers by July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of creating momentum against it, Democrats supporting
Clinton say Defense Secretary William Cohen; Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff, and other top officials may
journey to the Capitol on Tuesday to meet with senators. That is
the earliest day votes on the issue may occur.
</P>
<P>
   Already, senators supporting Clinton are circulating a letter by
Gen. Wesley Clark, the former top NATO commander in Europe, saying
an American withdrawal ''could give Mr. Milosevic the victory he
could not achieve on the battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House voted 219-200 to kill a provision by Reps.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, Barney Frank, D-Md., and others that would
have required a U.S. departure from Kosovo beginning this June 1
unless Clinton certified that Europeans are delivering on promised
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   They will try again this week, aides say, with changes designed
to attract additional votes. The deadline date will be pushed back
to next April 1, and Clinton would be allowed to temporarily waive
the deadline by postponing it by up to 180 days.

<HEADLINE> Moms Rally for Strict Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates of tighter gun control laws hope a
mass turnout of mothers and families at a weekend march will spur
activism that breaks the gridlock in the Republican-run Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of tragic shooting sprees across the country,
participants in Sunday's ''Million Mom March'' signed thousands of
Mother's Day cards printed with the message: ''Forget the flowers
... forget the chocolate ... forget breakfast in bed. This Mother's
Day, give us a present that lasts: common-sense gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   A homemade sign carried by one family warned lawmakers, who face
elections this fall: ''Accepting NRA money is political suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the ''Million Mom March'' principally want trigger
locks to protect children and a national system that would register
handguns and license their owners. They intend to maintain an
activist movement that will endorse and oppose political candidates
based on gun control positions.
</P>
<P>
   All major gun control legislation before Congress has been
stalled for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politicians, take heed. We are watching you. The hands that
rock the cradles rule the world,'' said Dawn Anna, mother of Lauren
Townsend, a student killed in the Columbine High School shootings
that stunned the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of mothers, many accompanied by children and
husbands, thronged to the National Mall on Sunday. Though there
were no official crowd estimates, participants filled half a dozen
blocks on the grassy area framed by the museums of the Smithsonian
Institution, Congress and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Heilbrink, 9, of Falls Church, Va., carried a poster with
a toy gun stapled to it. ''This gun has the same childproofing as a
real gun. None,'' the poster said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds ranging from a few hundred to an estimated 5,000 in
Denver showed up at similar rallies in dozens of cities across the
country -- from Maine to Michigan to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control advocates didn't have the day to themselves,
however. A considerably smaller group of several thousand
counter-demonstrators gathered near the Washington Monument to hold
a rally where they argued that guns were needed for
self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   That demonstration, organized by a group called Second Amendment
Sisters Inc., also included many mothers who brought their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''My kids know, if you see a gun, you don't touch it. You leave
the area, you go tell a responsible adult,'' said Elitza Meyer,
from Watchung, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   When opponents of gun control marched toward the Capitol, they
came close to ''Million Mom March'' participants and the two groups
exchanged jeers and boos.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton remained at the White House, encouraging
several hundred rally leaders who attended a reception to surmount
''the political mountain'' they had to climb. First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York,
joined the march for a time, but the crush of onlookers forced her
to a nearby road where she slowly made her way to the Capitol on
her own, shaking hands with well-wishers who lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Maryland Democrat and a
daughter of the slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, said: ''You know,
Mothers Against Drunk Driving had an enormous impact against
traffic deaths and I think we can have the same impact here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, elected officials stood in the
background; the day was reserved instead for supportive
entertainers, including mistress of ceremonies Rosie O'Donnell, a
television talk show host, and for women who told painful, personal
stories of losing loved ones to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gun that killed my daughter in her classroom was one that
could be loaded by a 6-year-old, carried by a 6-year-old, and fired
by a 6-year-old,'' said Veronica McQueen, who was transformed into
a public figure when her daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot and
killed in her first grade classroom in Flint, Mich., on Feb. 29.

<HEADLINE> Affluent county copes with financial quagmire  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- How exactly did one of the nation's
wealthiest counties get into such a financial mess? Why are
lawmakers scrambling to close a $117 million shortfall this year
alone?
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gulotta ... didn't raise the general property tax for
eight of 10 years,'' said Fred Parolla, the county comptroller and
a frequent critic of fellow Republican County Executive Thomas
Gulotta. ''So what you had was a shrinking or stabilized general
property tax fund ... and increasing burdens.''
</P>
<P>
   Parolla said contracts with the public employee unions,
especially the police unions, have grown ''beyond what the county
can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Gov. George Pataki rode in last week with a $100 million
bailout plan for Nassau County, it was too late for some residents
already reeling from budget cuts in this affluent Long Island
bedroom community.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this has done to our community is a disaster,'' said Rudy
Vanterpool, administrator of the New Cassel/Westbury Youth Services
Project, one of nearly 100 social service agencies that suffered $8
million in cuts. ''I can't even put into words what has happened to
us, it's so horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge smorgasbord of services provided to Nassau's citizens
for years was one of several major factors that helped bring the
county to near bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to pay the piper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole business community has been very concerned about the
situation,'' said Matt Crosson, president of the Long Island
Association, the island's largest business group. ''It cast a
shadow over the economy of not only Nassau County but Long Island
in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spending makes up nearly a quarter of the county's $2.2
billion budget and has risen 64 percent since 1989, twice as fast
as county spending overall. Newsday reported last month that the
county pays $118,000 per police employee, the highest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics also show that Nassau employs 230 officers
per 100,000 residents, 77 percent higher than the average for
suburban county departments nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta, who is proud of his record of keeping taxes steady, has
said that the county consistently fights against police increases
but usually loses in binding arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   He got tougher recently, threatening to lay off more than 200
officers unless the police union agrees to a package of contract
givebacks.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that despite the fiscal problems, Nassau County
is still rated among the best places in the country to live --
something he sees as a positive reflection of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for many years the county relied on borrowing to help keep
its books straight. Wall Street executive Frank Zarb, who was
appointed by Pataki in March to review the county's financial
health, said last week that the county's $2.7 billion long-term
debt was ''extremely high.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the per capita debt in Nassau was $2,210, while
the average amount for residents in neighboring counties, including
New York City, was $311.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the county's precarious financial condition, Standard
&AMP; Poor's has given Nassau a credit rating that is one notch above
junk status, making it much more expensive to borrow. It has
threatened another downgrade unless the county begins to straighten
itself out by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution offered last week by Pataki and Zarb, who
is chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, is
to create a separate bonding agency to refinance some of the
county's long-term debt at lower interest.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau was also sinking under the burden of an archaic property
tax assessment system unchanged since 1938 -- before the postwar
building boom transformed the rural county into quintessential
suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, property owners challenged their assessments so
successfully that the county has run up an $800 million debt to pay
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it takes an average of six years to settle a tax grievance
case because the county doesn't have enough staff to handle cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it goes into protracted litigation and we always get the
shaft,'' Parolla said.
</P>
<P>
   The county legislature voted in March to overhaul the assessment
system by 2003, spurred by the threat of a lawsuit claiming the
system discriminated against homeowners in minority neighborhoods.
The complaint was that homes increased in value much faster in
white neighborhoods than in minority areas, leaving minority
homeowners paying a higher percentage of home value in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The county's financial troubles have yet to have an impact on
home sales, according Tricia Chirco, of the Long Island Board of
Realtors. She said April sales figures put the median price for a
Nassau County home at $254,000, up from $220,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still feeling comfortable about selling and
buying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's Nassau rescue plan signaled state Republicans would
fight hard to regain control of a county that could be pivotal in
the U.S. Senate and presidential races this fall. Last November,
voters unhappy with the fiscal fiasco ended a decades-long GOP
stranglehold on Nassau politics, giving Democrats a 10-to-9 hold on
the county legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ''carrot-and-stick'' bailout offer requires the
county to cut $50 million from this year's budget, as well as $70
million in each of the next three years. Pataki has offered $100
million in aid over five years, contingent on the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Vanterpool, who said he cut his own salary more than 25 percent
after laying off 14 staffers at the youth center, thinks further
cuts could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means that from 2 o'clock to 7 or 8 o'clock, when those
youth were in our program, now they're left to wander around
unsupervised, getting into all kinds of problems on the street,''
he said. ''We're beginning to see colors -- when I say colors, I'm
talking about gang colors -- on the streets now. And some of those
same youth who were in our program are now wearing those colors.
There's no way right now today that I can tell those youngsters
'come on in,' because I have nothing for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith, director of a social service program called Long
Beach Reach, said the deep cuts in funding for youth programs mean
''we're basically throwing away a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to do that as a society,'' he said. ''It's
every bit as important as the police and the other things we take
for granted.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Avoids a Big Hole in Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC can finally relax: Ross, Joey, Phoebe,
Rachel, Chandler and Monica are returning to the Central Perk next
season, ensuring the network doesn't have to worry about having to
fill a big hole on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The six cast members of ''Friends'' agreed in the predawn hours
Sunday to return for two more seasons, in a deal that will pay each
actor $20 million per year, according to executives close to the
talks who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had set a Sunday afternoon deadline for an agreement, or
else it had promised to go forward today with a schedule that
didn't include ''Friends'' in its customary 8 p.m. time slot on
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   All seven broadcast networks unveil their fall schedules to
advertisers this week, launching a rush to buy millions of dollars
in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   NBC enters into the week with several of its building blocks
already in place for several more years, including ''ER,'' ''Law
and Order'' and ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The network was reportedly considering moving one of its most
popular comedies, ''Frasier,'' away from Thursday nights. The
long-running show starring Kelsey Grammer has been weakened
somewhat this year by ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing ''Friends'' would have been a major blow to NBC, which
has had trouble developing new comedies. Many people in the TV
industry believed the deal would get done, since the show was so
important to NBC and the cast members didn't seem eager to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt
LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer all will be getting a
big raise from the reported $125,000 they made for each of the 22
episodes this season.
</P>
<P>
   The six ''Friends'' will be paid $750,000 per episode for each
year. They also were given a greater percentage of the profits from
the sitcom's lucrative syndication deals, giving them each a total
of $40 million over two years, executives said Sunday. The stars
had reportedly been demanding $1 million each per episode to return
-- a sum NBC paid Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser for the final year of
''Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators beat NBC's deadline by about 12 hours. The actors
reached the deal with Warner Brothers Television, the studio that
produces the show.
</P>
<P>
   '''Friends' is one of the best written, produced and directed
shows on television. We are thrilled and excited to continue,'' the
actors said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The show finishes its sixth season with a one-hour special this
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> All Saints Making Screen Debut  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- It's not a big step from music to movies,
but artists have been known to stumble while making it. Not so for
All Saints, making their screen debut in Cannes this week in Dave
Stewart's ''Honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, best known as Annie Lennox's sidekick in '80s hit band
Eurythmics, turns in a slick, feel-good film for his directorial
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Band members Nicole and Natalie Appleton and Melanie Blatt play
gun-toting, tough-talking sisters, determined to rob their way out
of London's depressed East End during the swinging sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole is Gerry, the responsible ringleader, while Natalie plays
her angry, out-to-shock sister. Melanie makes up the trio as the
younger, wiser sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honest,'' which is competing for the Golden Camera award, will
be officially screened today in Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment may only be 12 years old, but the actor, who
won an Oscar nomination for his role in ''Sixth Sense'' with Bruce
Willis, is already cruising the Croisette.
</P>
<P>
   Osment jetted into Cannes over the weekend to promote his latest
film, ''Edges of the Lord,'' also starring Willem Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The young actor plays a Jewish boy who takes refuge with a
family of Catholic peasant farmers during the Nazi occupation of
Poland. The film is shooting in Poland now.
</P>
<P>
   Osment, whose wide-eyed, mature performance in ''Sixth Sense''
set the industry's talent radars glowing, has also just completed
''Pay It Forward,'' starring Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt.

Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who is showing ''Woman on Top'' in Cannes, says Cruz was
her first choice for the main character, Isabella.

   Chinese director Jiang Wen has a couple of tips for dealing with
overzealous censors.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Chinese censors tried to block his Cannes entry
''Devils on the Doorstep'' from competing. The film is a
tragicomedy set in a tiny Chinese village during the Japanese
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the tricks is to invite the censors to dinner or get
them drunk,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said censors had monitored his film from the outset,
forcing him to change the script five times. Finally, they sent
four or five pages of extra changes to the festival, including a
request for a new title, which Jiang ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't want the title to hurt the feelings of ethnic
minorities. But what feelings, whose?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Devils on the Doorstep'' also stars Jiang as a Chinese
villager who faces disaster when an anti-Japanese faction leaves
two sacks in his home. Inside the sacks are a Japanese
prisoner-of-war and his interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   When food starts running out, the villagers decide to kill the
prisoners but nobody wants to do the deed and the hesitation ends
in tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Report Finds Cancer Rates Declining  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD POWERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Progress is being made in the war against
cancer with fewer Americans getting or dying from the disease, in
part because of reduced smoking and early detection, according to a
new study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the incidence rate -- the number of new
cancer cases per 100,000 people per year -- for all cancers combined
declined on average 0.8 percent per year between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''These findings underscore the remarkable progress we've made
against cancer,'' Dr. Richard Klausner, the director of the
National Cancer Institute, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released Sunday by the NCI, the American Cancer
Society, the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The drop is attributed by officials to progress in prevention,
early detection and treatment and reduced smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest decline in cancer incidence rates has been among
men, who have higher overall rates of cancer than women.
</P>
<P>
   Four cancer sites -- lung, prostate, breast and colon and rectum
-- accounted for over half of all new cancer cases and were also the
leading causes of cancer deaths. The study found that rates are
going down for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of breast cancer changed little in the 1990s, but
breast cancer death rates have declined about 2 percent each year
since 1990 and have dropped sharply since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer rates increased from 1973 until 1991, but have since
declined. The death rates from lung cancer continues to increase
for women but has been declining for men since 1990, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study said colon and rectum cancer is the third most common
but one of the most treatable forms of the disease, if detected
early. When colorectal cancer was found in its earliest stages the
survival rate was 96 percent. However, when detected in the late
stage the survival rate falls to only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The findings of this report underscore the need to improve
rates of colorectal cancer screening. This is one cancer where
screening clearly has benefits by saving lives,'' said Dr. James
Marks, the head of the National Center for Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this
year and 560,000 will die of the disease, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Houston, Santana Salute Clive Davis  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Barry Manilow is having a flashback of the
musical kind. It's the early '70s and he's opening for Dionne
Warwick in New York's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Davis comes to check out Manilow for the new record label
Davis has founded, called Arista. Manilow, signed to another label
to be absorbed by Arista, passes muster with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came back to my trailer and said, 'Hi. Welcome to
Arista,''' Manilow said. ''I'm the oldest living Arista act. It
feels like it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Manilow went on to score Arista's first No. 1 hit, ''Mandy,'' in
1975. He'd have 13 chart-toppers for the label that Davis named
after the honor society at his Brooklyn high school.
</P>
<P>
   Manilow is one of a dozen artists saluting Davis in ''25 Years
of No. 1 Hits: Arista Records' Anniversary Celebration,'' airing
Monday at 8 p.m. EDT on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour special serves up a star-studded parade of Arista
performers singing their biggest hits, which, in the case of Aretha
Franklin, Whitney Houston, Manilow and Santana, means medleys.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's portion of the April 10 taping was heavily scrutinized
after her unpredictable behavior resulted in her being dropped from
the Academy Awards telecast. A voiceover leading into a commercial
break teases viewers about ''the performance you've been hearing
about.''
</P>
<P>
   What viewers won't see is Houston tripping as she walks onstage,
and they won't hear her duet with Deborah Cox on ''Shoop Shoop.''
</P>
<P>
   But editing didn't remove all the spontaneity, including husband
Bobby Brown's two unscripted moments onstage. First, he appears
from the wings with a glass of water when Houston abruptly stops
before the high voltage conclusion to ''I Will Always Love You.''
They kiss and he dabs her sweaty forehead.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston is joined by Cox, Faith Evans, Monica and Angie
Stone on a free-for-all version of ''My Love is Your Love,'' Brown
pops out again. Houston hands him the microphone to jabber, and he
cavorts while she blends into the background.
</P>
<P>
   Houston belts out five songs before leaving the stage with the
cryptic line, ''The record's not over yet, remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's best moments are Santana's opening jam,
Franklin's three songs (taped in New York), Sean ''Puffy'' Combs
and a 30-member choir on ''I'll Be Missing You,'' and Patti Smith's
tear-it-up version of ''Because The Night,'' with Sarah McLachlan
on piano.
</P>
<P>
   Blessedly, the music is the focus. No time is wasted on thank
yous or testimonies on Davis' behalf. The songs speak for
themselves, which has always been Davis' aim.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the subsequent ouster of Davis as Arista CEO, the
show is an ironic valentine to the 66-year-old who nurtured the
careers of dozens of superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Even those he dismissed, such as Melissa Etheridge, have nothing
but kind words for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not on Arista, but Clive was the first one to reject my
demo,'' said Etheridge, who introduces Annie Lennox on the show.
''He is the last of an amazing kind of musical businessman, musical
genius who supports the artist. I really admire Clive for sticking
to his principles, staying there and seeing it through.''
</P>
<P>
   BMG Entertainment, Arista's parent company, ended months of
speculation early this month when it replaced Davis with new CEO
Antonio Reid, 43. Reid co-founded LaFace Records in 1989 with
Kenneth ''Babyface'' Edmonds in a joint venture with Arista.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whose Arista contract was not renewed, said he was the
victim of BMG's mandatory retirement age of 60, while the company
maintained the issue was Arista's long-term direction.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he plans to start a record company this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never count him out,'' Warwick told reporters backstage at the
tribute. ''Clive will come up with something absolutely incredible
and there he'll be all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' musical tastes run the gamut from country to rock to
soul, and he's signed hitmakers in all categories, including
country stars Alan Jackson and Brooks &AMP; Dunn, who perform a rousing
version of ''My Maria.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to have a great expertise in all of it,'' Kix Brooks
said. ''He definitely has the respect of all genres.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage clips interspersed throughout the show feature such
diverse Arista acts as the Bay City Rollers, big-haired '70s
singers Melissa Manchester and Eric Carmen, Air Supply, The Kinks
and the Grateful Dead. The mercifully brief song snippets also
serve up such one-hit wonders as Ace of Base, Ray Parker Jr., Real
McCoy and Lisa Stansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gets his moment in the spotlight at the end, and his
comments made a month before his ouster seem prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a ride it's been,'' he says, thanking colleagues at
Arista and BMG. ''This special night says everything. It's all
about the music and it's all about the artists.''

<HEADLINE> Troubled office supply company taps new CEO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORTLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- The troubled office supply company that
last month lost its Nasdaq slot has named a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Martin D. Wilson, 40, has been named chief executive officer of
Smith Corona, replacing John A. Bermingham and ending Bermingham's
two-year reign. Company officials did not give a reason for
Bermingham's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson retains the titles of president, chief financial officer
and treasurer, positions he's held since October 1998 and May 1999,
respectively. He joined the company in 1994 as director of
accounting and financial reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Boden, who had served as chief operating officer for
the last three months, will continue to work with the company as a
consultant, company officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Boden is the managing partner of Positive Business Change, a
Cincinnati-based company that consults on marketing and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Corona -- which traces its roots to the L.C. Smith &AMP; Bros.
Typewriter Co. founded in Syracuse in 1903 -- stopped making
products when it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in
1997. The firm's subsequent transformation from a manufacturer to
seller has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nasdaq told Smith Corona its shares could no longer
trade on that stock market because the company had slipped below
its financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in four years an exchange dropped Smith
Corona's stock. In June 1996, the New York Stock Exchange removed
the stock from its listing after Smith Corona's bankruptcy
reorganization plan proposed making the stock worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The company has lost 43 workers since January, and now has about
50 employees. The company reported its net worth as $560,000 for
the six months ending Dec. 31, compared with $4.4 million for the
same period the previous year.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, but as the Federal
Reserve's decision on interest rates drew near, few investors were
taking on major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 45.23 at 10,654.60.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index

up 0.81 at 1,421.77.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers were anticipating a quiet session. On Tuesday,
the Fed's Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise
interest rates for the sixth time since last June in its continuing
effort to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Fed offered the latest indication that the economy
remains extremely robust. The Fed said industrial production posted
its biggest leap in April in more than a year, as output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose 6{ to 60|. The Wall

serious discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many other high-profile technology names were lower, however.
Cisco Systems was down 1 3/16 to 58} and PMC-Sierra was down 3
19/64 to 142 41/64.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, Philip Morris rose 1 9/16 to 25~. The Wall

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Lobbyist Tax Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the way the federal government taxes the lobbying expenses of
nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments by the
American Society of Association Executives that the tax is higher
than ordinary rates and therefore amounts to an unfair levy on
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, businesses and nonprofit associations could deduct
lobbying expenses from their taxes. That year, Congress eliminated
the deduction for commercial businesses and established a new tax
applying to nonprofit organizations, other than charities.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations subject to the new tax include professional
societies, trade associations, advocacy groups, labor unions and
other not-for-profit associations.
</P>
<P>
   They must either pay a flat 35 percent tax rate on lobbying
expenses or have their dues-paying members pay the tax directly to
the government.
</P>
<P>
   If a group chooses the second option, all of the tax liability
is passed on to its members even if some of the lobbying was funded
with other income besides dues. Some non-dues income also is
taxable under another federal provision.
</P>
<P>
   The association executives' group, representing about 22,000
executives and staff members of nonprofit professional
associations, sued the federal government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said either form of the tax is higher than ordinary
tax rates, and therefore the tax is a penalty on lobbying that
violates the Constitution's free-speech and equal-protection
guarntees.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia upheld the tax. The appeals court said in a
ruling last November that organizations can avoid an extra tax
burden by splitting into two associations -- one that does no
lobbying and one that only lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying group could be funded by taxable dues, and the
non-lobbying group could be funded with non-taxable dues, the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the association's lawyers said
that alternative would not work because the government still can
tax such dual organizations as if they were one entity.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said the tax ''was not enacted to
penalize speech nor does it have that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is American Society of Association Executives vs. U.S.,
99-1321.

<HEADLINE> Court Clarifies Traffic Stop Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let police
in Florida order passengers to remain in vehicles, along with the
driver, during routine traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which
prosecutors said a state court was wrong to rule that such a police
order violated passengers' privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, the nation's highest court ruled in a
Maryland case that passengers -- as well as drivers -- can be ordered
to get out of vehicles during routine traffic stops. The Florida
case presented the opposite situation, one in which police want
everyone to remain inside the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Today's action is not a decision and sets no legal precedent
outside Florida. It does not preclude the possibility the justices
will choose to address the issue in another case in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wilson was a passenger in a car stopped by Palm Beach
Sheriff's Deputy Sean Murray on July 6, 1997. The deputy said the
car had been speeding and bore a license tag registered to another
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As Murray approached the car from the driver's side, Wilson got
out and began walking to a tavern just five to 10 feet away. Murray
ordered him to return to the car and remain inside until the
traffic stop was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Murray later testified he did so out of concern for his safety
but acknowledged that he had no reason to suspect that Wilson posed
any threat.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilson returned to the car, Murray noticed that the car's
driver was extremely nervous, and that he had attempted to conceal
something under the front seat. After discovering the driver had no
license, Murray arrested him and placed him in his cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Murray testified that when he returned to the stopped car he saw
Wilson trying to conceal something on the floorboard. He then saw a
marijuana pipe sticking out from under the front seat. Murray
ordered Wilson out of the car and patted him down, finding cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson pleaded no contest, reserving the right to appeal a trial
judge's ruling that the seized evidence could be used against him.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court ruled last year that the evidence should
have been suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The traffic violation sufficiently justifies subjecting the
driver to detention -- in or outside the vehicle,'' the state court
said. ''There is a legitimate need for adequate police control over
the traffic violator for the time necessary to conclude the
business of the stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The restraint on the liberty of the blameless passenger is, in
contrast, an unreasonable interference,'' the state court said.
Police may not order passengers to remain with a stopped car ''as a
matter of course'' when there's no reason to suspect they present a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court rejected the state's appeal last
December.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, state prosecutors said,
''Authorizing the police to determine how to best proceed with a
traffic stop, including when passengers are present, will minimize
the risk of harm to both the police and the car's occupants.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Florida vs. Wilson, 99-1468.

<HEADLINE> Court Sidesteps U.S.-Iceland Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today steered clear of a
shipping dispute between a company in Iceland and the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away the company's argument
that contracts awarded in 1998 for shipping military cargo to a
U.S. base in Iceland violated a 14-year-old treaty between Iceland
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration waived its right to file a response
to the appeal, and the justices did not request one as they do in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal had been filed by the Iceland Steamship Co.
Ltd.-Eimskip. The Republic of Iceland government had supported the
company as a ''friend of the court'' when the case was in the
appeals court but did not file a similar brief in the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Military supplies for the U.S.-operated North Atlantic Treaty
Organization base at Keflavik, Iceland, were carried exclusively by
Icelandic-owned and operated shipping companies from the late 1960s
to 1984, the year a U.S.-flag carrier was created to serve the same
route.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, that company was entitled to carry 100 percent
of the military cargo shipped to the base, which caused a
diplomatic rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was resolved in 1986 when the two signed a treaty to
ensure ''that both United States flag carriers and Icelandic
shipping companies are able to maintain a viable presence in the
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty's terms, Icelandic and U.S. companies compete
periodically for the military cargo shipping contracts. The lower
bidder is awarded 65 percent of the cargo-shipping contracts; the
remaining 35 percent is awarded to the next lowest bidder of the
other country.
</P>
<P>
   That system worked without controversy for 12 years, until in
1998 the two companies awarded contracts were TransAtlantic
Lines-Iceland EHF and U.S.-based TransAtlantic Lines LLC.
</P>
<P>
   One person, Gudmundur Kjarnested, effectively managed both
firms. A citizen of Iceland who is a U.S. resident alien, he was
president of one of the firms and vice president of the other and
signed both companies' bids.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.S. Department of the Army made those awards,
Iceland's government sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. State
Department. It said the contracts violated the 1986 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland Steamship sued the Army in 1998, and a federal judge in
the District of Columbia ruled that the 1986 treaty had been
violated.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
reversed that ruling, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''TLI and TLL are separate entities and are entitled to be
treated as such,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Iceland Steamship said
the appeals court wrongly deferred to the State Department's
interpretation of the treaty while ignoring the Iceland
government's conflicting interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The case is The Iceland Steamship Co. Ltd.-Eimskip vs. U.S.
Department of the Army, 99-1631.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Release Foster Photos  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group seeking to force the government to
release photographs taken of White House lawyer Vince Foster's body
after his 1993 suicide lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away Accuracy in Media's
argument that Foster's family has no privacy interest in avoiding
public release of the photos.
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy in Media, a media watchdog group, contends the public
has a ''substantial interest'' in the photos because they might
show whether the government properly investigated Foster's death.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, the deputy White House counsel, was found in a suburban
Virginia park on July 20, 1993, with a gunshot wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations -- including one by Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr -- have concluded that Foster committed
suicide, but some conservatives have speculated that Foster may
have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy in Media invoked the federal Freedom of Information Act
in asking the National Park Service to release photos taken of
Foster's body at the scene of his death and during his autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service refused, citing an exemption for cases in which
releasing information would create an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy in Media sued, and a federal judge ruled for the
government. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia upheld that ruling last October, saying, ''AIM cannot deny
the powerful sense of invasion bound to be aroused in close
survivors by wanton publication of gruesome details of death by
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Accuracy in Media's lawyers said
Foster's relatives have no privacy interest in the photos because
they are not depicted in them.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the family did have a privacy interest, it would be
outweighed by the public interest in finding out whether the
government properly investigated Foster's death, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy in Media was represented by attorney Larry Klayman,
whose Judicial Watch group has filed numerous lawsuits against the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Accuracy in Media vs. National Park Service,
99-1578.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Louisiana Campaign Law  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive
Louisiana's ban on political campaign contributions by some people
licensed to operate video poker machines.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which state
officials argued that the ban was a valid attempt to avoid ''the
appearance of corruption'' by gambling interests.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is one of eight states with some type of ban on
campaign contributions by people involved in the gambling industry.
The justices were told that other states are Indiana, Iowa,
Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's law, enacted in 1996, bans contributions to state
and local political candidates by people licensed to distribute
video poker devices or people who own truck stops or other
facilities licensed to offer video poker.
</P>
<P>
   The ban applies to anyone who directly owns at least 10 percent
of such a facility, or indirectly owns at least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged last year by a group of truck stop owners
licensed to operate video poker. They said the law discriminated
against them and violated their free-association rights as
protected by the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge struck down the law and the Louisiana Supreme
Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state offers no support for its contention that these
prohibitions will prevent corruption,'' the state's highest court
ruled, noting that Louisiana limits the size of all contributions
to state and local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The state court also noted that the ban applied only to some
video poker licensees but not others, and that it did not apply to
the actual owners of the machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the state's lawyers said there is
a ''public perception that gaming is associated with political
corruption'' and that those in the gambling industry can be barred
from making political contributions as a ''trade-off'' for their
state licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The video poker operators' lawyers said, ''The state cannot say
that the gaming industry is inherently vulnerable to corruption.''
There is no ''vice exception'' to the First Amendment, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Louisiana vs. Penn, 99-1473.

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran president speaks at UH graduation  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HARTFORD-- President Francisco Flores of El Salvador
returned to the University of Hartford and urged the graduating
seniors to look to past traditions as they prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, a 1979 graduate of the university's Hillyer College, was
the commencement speaker on Sunday. He recalled his then-troubled
homeland and how his education helped him overcome feelings of
uncertainty and exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a rich paradox that the only way to develop a sense of
direction in our future is by immersing ourselves in the timeless
traditions of our past,'' Flores told some 1,300 graduates and
thousands of friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting Flores with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree,
Life Regent Harry Jack Gray told the Central American leader that
he was an inspiration to both the people of El Salvador and the
students at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ''You represent the sort of student the university seeks to
serve,'' said UH President Walter Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, the first UH alumnus to lead a nation, said he was
''assaulted'' by memories as he returned to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the ''strikes of gold in the generally green
landscape of Connecticut'' when he first arrived in Hartford in
September 1977 as well as the turmoil back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents' somber faces at the airport in San Salvador
concealed deeper fears than those normally associated with a
farewell to a 17-year-old,'' he said. ''Those were difficult times
for me and my country. After decades of military rule, El Salvador
was fast headed to the deepest conflict in its history: A civil war
that would last more than a decade, and that, with its blind
violence, would affect every single Salvadoran family.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores, a member of the Republican National Alliance, was
elected president of El Salvador on March 7, 1999 by an
overwhelming margin. He is part of a new political generation that
had little direct role in the 12-year civil war that ended in 1992
and cost 70,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   He told students to seek truth and creativity and to ''resist
the temptation to be lost in placid generality of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I went back to my country in the worst years of the war,'' he
said. ''I found something greater than my past, greater than my
roots, greater than my identity. I found my country. I found my
happiness. May you, dear graduates, find yours.''

<HEADLINE> Limited's 1Q Earnings Rise 41 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Limited Inc.'s first-quarter earnings
rose 41 percent from a year ago, fueled by strength at its women's
clothing stores Express and Limited as well as a surge in profits
at its Intimate Brands division.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer reported Monday that it earned
$62.9 million, or 28 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 29,
compared with $44.6 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 5 percent to $2.1 billion from $2 billion in the
first quarter of 1999. Sales from stores opened at least a year,
often a key indicator of a retailer's strength, were up 8 percent
for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations of 25
cents a share. Its stock, however, was down $1.68} at $47.93} in
early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited benefited from an 29 percent increase in profits at
Intimate Brands, which stores include Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP;
Body Works.
</P>
<P>
   Also boosting profits was improved sales at its Express and
Limited women's clothing stores. The merchandise in both stores
have been overhauled in recent years to better keep pace with
current fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   This year's results reflect the Limited Too spinoff, a
children's apparel brand, as if it had occurred at the beginning of
1999. The spinoff occurred in August.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Limited announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited operates 2,849 stores under the names Express,
Lerner New York, Lane Bryant, Limited, Structure and Henri Bendel.
The Limited also owns about 84 percent of Intimate Brands, which
operates 2,144 stores.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Bribes Can Be Federal Crime  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The money hospitals receive for treating
Medicare patients subjects people who bribe hospital officials to
federal prosecutions, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   By a 7-2 vote in a case from Volusia County, Fla., the court
said such Medicare funding can be the basis for invoking a law that
makes it a crime to bribe agents of organizations and programs that
receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted by Congress in 1984, federalized what otherwise
would be considered an ordinary case of commercial bribery
routinely handled in state courts, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has a legitimate and significant interest in
prohibiting financial fraud or acts of bribery being perpetrated
upon Medicare providers,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the
court. ''Fraudulent acts threaten the program's integrity. They
raise the risk participating organizations will lack the resources
... to provide the level and quality of care envisioned by the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Allan Fischer was convicted of violating the federal law
and was sentenced to five years and five months in prison after a
company he ran and partially owned received a $1.2 million loan in
1993 from the West Volusia Hospital Authority, a county agency that
used to run two hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The law at issue bans bribes involving the business of any
organization that ''receives in any one-year period benefits in
excess of $10,000 under a federal program involving ... federal
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Volusia Hospital Authority had received between $10
million and $15 million in Medicare payments in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer had been president of Quality Medical Consultants, a
company that performed billing audits for health care providers.
Federal prosecutors said he paid $10,000 to a hospital official's
mother in return for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was convicted after a federal trial in Orlando. In
addition to his prison time, he was sentenced to three years of
supervised release and ordered to pay $1.2 million in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   He previously had left his job at QMC, and the company had filed
for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer early on challenged the legitimacy of his federal
prosecution, contending that ''payments to health care providers
for services to Medicare patients do not meet the jurisdictional
requirements'' of the federal law used to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
that argument, but other federal appeals courts have ruled that
Medicare money cannot be the basis for such prosecutions. Today's
decision resolved those conflicting rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Health care providers such as the one defrauded by (Fischer)
receive benefits within the meaning of the statute,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented. Writing
for the two, Thomas said, ''The only persons who receive 'benefits'
under Medicare are the individual elderly and disabled Medicare
patients, not the medical providers who serve them.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court gave a broad reading to the same
federal law when it ruled in 1997 that it targets any transaction
of federally funded organizations and not merely transactions
involving or affecting federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   But that ruling left open the possibility that some connection
between a bribe and the expenditure of federal money might be
required.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had urged the justices to rule that the
federal law applies to cases like Fischer's. But his call for a far
narrower interpretation of the law was supported by the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Fischer vs. U.S., 99-116.

<HEADLINE> Court KOs Teacher Who Nixed Drug Test  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Georgia high school teacher fired for
refusing to take a drug test after police using a drug-sniffing dog
found marijuana in her car lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away the teacher's argument
that the search was unlawful because it was not based on individual
suspicion and because officers did not get a warrant before going
inside her car.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Hearn, a social studies teacher at Windsor Forest High
School in Savannah, sued the Chatham County school board after her
1996 firing.
</P>
<P>
   In April of that year, the school's campus police officers
conducted a random search for drugs, assisted by dog handlers from
the county sheriff's department. The officers used the dogs to
search classrooms and examine cars in the school's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A dog indicated it smelled drugs in Hearn's car, which had an
open window. Police said they entered the car and found a marijuana
cigarette in the ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher said police did not produce the marijuana cigarette
and she was not charged with a crime. She contends authorities
later received a call saying a student admitted planting the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn was ordered to take a drug test under the school's
anti-drug policy. She refused, although she said she passed a test
at a commercial lab the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn was fired, and the state Board of Education upheld the
firing.
</P>
<P>
   She sued, saying the search of her car was illegal and that she
could not be fired as the result of an unlawful search.
Drug-sniffing dogs cannot be used in public school parking lots
without individual suspicion, and the police should not have
entered her car without a warrant, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
against her.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Hearn's lawyers said public
employees cannot be fired for refusing to take a drug test when the
suspicion of drug use was based on unlawfully seized evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The school district's lawyers said dogs can be used to sniff
cars without violating the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which
bans unreasonable searches. They also said a drug dog alert creates
enough suspicion to allow police to enter a car.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Hearn vs. Savannah Board of Education, 99-1477.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cons Can Serve More Jail Time  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal judges who send ex-convicts back to
prison for violating conditions of their supervised release can add
a new supervised-release term to their time behind bars, the
Supreme Court said today.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so does not unlawfully subject some ex-convicts to
retroactive punishment, the court ruled by an 8-1 vote in a
Tennessee case.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether a 1994 law that clearly gives federal
judges the authority to tack on new terms of supervised release to
defendants re-imprisoned after violating terms of their original
release can be applied to defendants who committed their crimes
before the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court said yes after concluding that judges
had such power even before the law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts had split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court that past practice,
''linguistic continuity from the old scheme to the current one, and
the obvious thrust of congressional sentencing policy confirm that,
in applying the law as before enactment of (the 1994 law) district
courts have the authority to order terms of supervised release
following reimprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a defeat for Cornell Johnson and a victory for
his federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was convicted in Tennessee on federal counterfeiting
charges in early 1994 and sentenced to two years and one month in
prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   His supervisory release was revoked in 1998 after he admitted to
having committed several crimes in Virginia, including forgery and
larceny.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge sentenced Johnson to 18 months in prison,
followed by a year of supervised release. Johnson challenged the
new supervised-release portion of his sentence, saying the judge
had not authority to impose it.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994 -- after Johnson's original conviction and sentence
but before he violated the terms of his supervised release --
Congress gave federal judges the power to impose sentences like the
one he challenged.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said that applying the 1994 law to him violated his
rights. The Supreme Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Johnson vs. U.S., 99-5153.

<HEADLINE> Viag, Veba To Merge Chemical Units  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- In advance of their planned merger,
German energy powerhouses Veba AG and Viag AG said today they would
combine their chemical subsidiaries into a company focusing on
specialty chemicals by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The newly merged company, to be called Degussa AG, will bring
together chemical groups Degussa-Huels AG, owned by Veba, and SKW
Trostberg AG, owned by Viag.
</P>
<P>
   Veba and Viag announced last September plans to merge in a $12.6
billion deal, but the deal has yet to gain antitrust approval
because of their holdings in other German utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the merged Viag and Veba will be its electricity
division, but the company also said it plans to enlarge its gas and
water business as well as beef up its chemical arm in the United
States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Degussa will aim to become the world's largest specialty
chemicals company in terms of sales, doubling revenue to between
$16.4 billion and $18.2 billion within the next four years, the
parent companies said.
</P>
<P>
   By combining operations, the streamlined company also hopes to
cut costs and boost earnings by $273 million within the next three
years, they added. Part of that will entail nearly 3,000 layoffs
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Degussa's chairman Uwe-Ernst Bufe resigned Monday and will be
replaced temporarily by current chief financial officer
Heinz-Joachim Wagner. The chairman of the new Degussa will be
Utz-Hellmuth Felcht from SKW Trostberg, while Wagner will become
chief financial officer of the new company.

<HEADLINE> Ranching, Farm Groups Lose Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ruling against ranching and farming groups,
the Supreme Court today upheld several changes in federal rules for
livestock grazing on millions of acres of federal land throughout
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously ruled against the ranchers' and
farmers' argument that the 1995 rules violate a 66-year-old law and
threaten their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said federal
law gives the secretary of Interior ''broad discretionary powers''
to set grazing rules. The system for allocating land before 1995
''that the ranchers seek to safeguard did not offer them anything
like absolute security,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 livestock producers have permits to graze their
cattle and sheep on 170 million acres of federal rangeland in 13
states, including large parts of Nevada, Utah, Oregon and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1934, such grazing has been regulated by the Department of
Interior. Those with permits got preference for renewal when the
permit expired, and permit-holders could own the fences they built
on public land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Interior Department announced revised rules
intended to improve management and protection of federally owned
land.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, the new rules amended the permit process to
conform with land-use plans, dropped the requirement that permit
applicants be in the livestock business, and gave the government
title to new fences and other permanent improvements built by
permit-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were challenged in federal court by the Public Lands
Council, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Wyoming threw out the three provisions, but
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Supreme Court said the 10th Circuit court was right.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress itself has directed development of land-use plans,
and their use in the allocation process, in order to preserve,
improve and develop the public rangelands,'' Breyer wrote for the
court. ''And the secretary (of Interior) has always had the
statutory authority ... to reclassify and withdraw range land from
grazing use.''
</P>
<P>
   Permit holders still are free to bring individual challenges to
changes in grazing privileges, Breyer said.

   Industrial Output Rises in April
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production posted its biggest leap
in more than a year in April as the output of utilities rebounded,
the Federal Reserve said today. Output at the nation's factories
mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations and the largest increase since a 1.8 percent
gain posted in August 1998. That followed a 0.7 percent increase in
March, much stronger than the central bank previously predicted.
Operating capacity climbed from 81.7 percent in March to 82.1
percent in April, stronger than the 81.9 percent rise many analysts
were forecasting. April's operating capacity was the strongest
since May 1998.

   Survey Shows Venture Capital Fever
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Venture capital isn't just for maverick
financiers anymore. In the latest display of corporate clout in the
venture capital arena, a division of Chase Manhattan Bank invested
the most money in entrepreneurial companies during the first three
months of this year. New York-based Chase Capital's venture capital
investments totaled $289 million during the three-month period that
ended March 31, according to PricewaterhouseCooper's quarterly
''Money Tree'' survey, which was released today. Chase Capital
spread the seed money among 45 different investments, primarily in
companies developing technology for the Internet, said David
Britts, a general partner for the firm.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's securities watchdog said today it has

The penalties were not disclosed, but Japanese media reported today
that regulators will likely order the unit later this month to stop
trading bonds and bond futures for several weeks. The Securities
and Exchange Surveillance Commission said the Tokyo branch of
Deutsche Securities Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank, was involved in several illegal transactions including
soliciting clients with financial products intended to hide their

   Caller ID Traced 'Love Bug' Virus
</P>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A local Internet provider said today
it used caller ID to trace the origin of the ''Love Bug'' e-mail
virus to a Manila phone line that had been used before for breaking
into its computer network. The disclosure explained how
investigators were quickly able to center their investigation on
the residents of an apartment in a lower middle-class Manila
neighborhood, including a young computer student who has
acknowledged he may have accidentally unleashed the ''ILOVEYOU''
virus. Sky Internet said the rogue program first sent copies of
itself to e-mail addresses contained on victimized computers. It
then used the computer's Internet browser to run a program placed
on a Sky Internet Web server to steal passwords stored in the
computer and send them to an e-mail address at another Philippine
Internet access provider.

HAM-HK Construction Joint Venture to reclaim an area of about 494
acres at Penny's Bay off the outlying Lautau Island, a government
statement said. The reclamation project is scheduled to be

   Indonesia Growth Less Than Expected

   Asian Stock Markets Close Lower
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower today on
expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates. In Hong Kong, the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 230.64 points, or 1.53 percent,
closing at 14,881.30. On Friday, the index had soared 619.02
points, or 4.3 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to
raise interest rates at a meeting tomorrow. The Hong Kong market
was also pushed down by rising tensions between Taiwan and China
pending the inauguration of Taiwanese president-elect Chen
Shui-bian later this week, they said. The Japanese benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 44.17 points, or 0.25 percent,
to 17,313.69 points. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was
quoted at 108.90 yen, up 0.60 yen from Friday in Tokyo and
marginally above its level of 108.89 yen late Friday in New York.
Indonesian shares closed sharply lower, with blue chips sustaining
heavy losses after investors were rattled by riots in Jakarta on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 37; Nasdaq Down 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, the eve of the Federal
Reserve's decision on interest rates. Technology stocks showed some
weakness, but with the Fed's decision looming, few investors were
taking on major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 37.35 at 10,646.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators gave up early gains and were lower. The
Nasdaq composite index was down 67.59 at 3,461.47 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.69 at 1,420.27.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said trading was likely to be light until
Tuesday afternoon, after the Fed's meeting. The Fed's Open Market
Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates for the sixth
time since last June in its continuing effort to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Fed offered the latest indication that the economy
remains extremely robust. The Fed said industrial production posted
its biggest leap in April in more than a year, as output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose 6\ to 60]. The Wall
Street Journal reported Spain's Terra Networks SA is in serious
discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many other high-profile technology names were lower. Cisco
Systems was down 1 15/16 to 58 and PMC-Sierra was down 2 13/16 to
143[.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said investors remain leery of highly-priced technology stocks in
the wake of a steep selloff in April. The Nasdaq has recovered some
of its footing, yet remains more than 30 percent below its March 10
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's widespread agreement that tech stocks will continue to
be the leaders,'' he said. But the shakeout in April forced
investors to become more discerning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq debacle has been led by tech stocks that have no
earnings and were priced off inflated revenue estimates,'' he said.
''The quality of earnings is suddenly being talked about a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, Philip Morris rose 1~ to 26 3/16. The Wall
Street Journal reported the company has offered to buy the food
business of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 237.94 million
shares, compared with 297.97 million at the same time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.16 to 484.78.

showers in the soybean belt. Grain prices also tumbled.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Four distinct Republicans vie for open House seat  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One has loads of money, one a famous name. One
holds public office, while one knows his way around Capitol Hill.
Four Republicans bring distinct strengths, and vulnerabilities, to
the race for the first open House seat in New Jersey since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ferguson, the most prolific fund-raiser in the group, has
been criticized for moving into the 7th District just to run for
the seat vacated by Republican Bob Franks, a candidate for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kean Jr. carries his father's famous name but failed to turn
that into organizational support in any of the four counties in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Morrisey has been endorsed by congressmen with whom he
worked on Capitol Hill but now must prove that translates to
support from voters.
</P>
<P>
   And Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, who has experience in elected
office, has been criticized for murky answers on abortion, an issue
important in Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot: a race too close -- or too complicated -- to call.
Unlike the national Democratic party, which has picked Union County
Manager Mike Lapolla as its favored candidate for the seat, the
national Republican party is steering clear until 7th District
Republicans choose a candidate on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   On hot-topic issues, the candidates share much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Morrisey and Weingarten support a flat-tax system, while Kean
and Ferguson say they support something ''flatter'' than the
current code. All favor school vouchers, at least experimentally in
areas where public schools are failing. All support the idea of
letting people invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes
into a private investment account they would manage.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten scored an organizational advantage when he won party
endorsements in Union and Essex counties, giving him preferred
ballot position in towns where 60 percent of the district's
Republican voters live. Ferguson won the ballot lines in the other
two counties, Somerset and Middlesex.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the lightning rod in the race is Ferguson, 29, who
ran two years ago in the neighboring 6th District against
Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson planned to take a second shot at Pallone this year. But
after Franks announced plans to run for Senate, Ferguson moved from
Red Bank to Westfield to launch a bid for the open seat.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten, in particular, has accused Ferguson of
carpetbagging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Republicans are very distrustful of individuals who
shop congressional districts and who feel that one size fits all,''
Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who has put $200,000 of his own money into the
campaign, replied that he and his wife switched districts with the
encouragement of friends who wanted a strong Republican candidate
in a crucial race for an open seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are less concerned about where you're from and
more concerned about what you believe in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson has the support of state and national anti-abortion
organizations and says he would support a constitutional amendment
to ban abortion. The other abortion opponent in the field,
Morrisey, says he would not support such an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Morrisey, 32, cut his political teeth in New Jersey but then
moved to Washington, where he spent two years as health policy
counsel for the House Commerce Committee. He moved back to
Westfield to run for the House, stressing his firsthand knowledge
of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think voters are starving for someone to talk substance and
address the real concerns they have about health care, tax
reduction, educational reform and fiscal sanity in Washington,''
Morrisey said. He has issued position papers on government
spending, campaign finance reform, Medicare and education.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compete for endorsements from county organizations,
Morrisey collected endorsements from more than 100 small-business
owners and from 13 members of Congress who worked with him on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than his opponents, Morrisey has collected money from
political action committees and from individuals from other states
-- a reflection, he says, of his contacts from working at a
nationwide law firm and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten, 40, jokes that he is the old man in the race. He is
also the only person with experience in elective office, having
served on the Millburn Township Committee before joining the state
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the candidate in the race who has a record of getting
things done,'' he said, boasting that he has voted 16 times to cut
taxes as a state legislator (a claim shared by many Republicans who
have served during the term of Gov. Christie Whitman).
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten's position on abortion has come under scrutiny. While
Ferguson and Morrisey are against abortion, and Kean favors
abortion rights, Weingarten says only that lawmakers should respect
''current constitutional strictures'' by not trying to overturn the
1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On whether he supports abortion rights, Weingarten said: ''I
don't think my personal views are the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kean, 31, was the last candidate to begin unveiling positions on
issues, rolling out a campaign finance reform plan last week that
includes daily disclosure of his own contributors. His campaign
announcements until then had focused on what big-name Republicans
have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Kean acknowledges the importance of his family tree, saying he
brings to the race ''the benefit of positive name recognition.''
His father, Thomas H. Kean, was New Jersey's popular governor from
1982 to 1990. His grandfather, Robert W. Kean, served in the House
from 1939 to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ''The name brings with it a sense of honesty and integrity,''
Kean said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Nuclear Reactor Shuts Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) -- An electrical problem triggered
an automatic shutdown of a reactor at Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant early Monday, releasing steam that could contain tiny amounts
of radioactivity, regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   Such radioactivity would be well below federal limits, and ''no
impacts to public health and safety are anticipated,'' the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission statement said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Diablo Canyon, a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric facility with two
nuclear reactors, is on California's central coast. Some 237,000
people live in surrounding San Luis Obispo County, including 43,000
in the nearby city of San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began around 12:25 a.m. in electrical cabling inside
the Unit 1 turbine generator building. That shut down the turbine,
which lead to the shutdown of the Unit 1 reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the reactor tripped from full power, steam was
released into the atmosphere,'' the NRC said. ''The steam released
could contain minute amounts of radioactivity well below the
federal release limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant operators declared an ''unusual event,'' the lowest
level of NRC's four emergency classifications.
</P>
<P>
   Reactor systems functioned properly during the shutdown and
there were no significant complications, the NRC said. Plant
operators were working to restore electrical power.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: No decision yet  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said today he has not
made up his mind about whether to stay in his Senate race or about
his treatment for prostate cancer, contradicting a report that he
had decided to drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not made a decision, along with the doctors, on the
course of treatment or the exact course of treatment,'' Giuliani
told reporters at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had not yet made a decision about the future of
his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton. He did say he
had cancelled planned fund raisers in California that had been
scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Democrats were predicting that his Senate campaign was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all over but the shouting,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' on Sunday. ''As far as becoming the
next U.S. senator, forget it! He never really wanted the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to withdraw, and it has to be before the end of the
month because the Republican convention is taking place,'' former
Mayor Ed Koch told ABC's ''This Week.'' ''There's no question in my
mind he will drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sources would only say that Giuliani hadn't yet made up his
mind, while Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum,
stated, in a gloomy tone of voice, ''I've got no comment on
anything. I've got nothing to say on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from
Staten Island, told NBC's ''Meet the Press'': ''Nobody knows at
this point. I talked to the mayor's staff as late as yesterday
(Saturday). They are still waiting for him to come to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''If there is one person in the United States of
America who can handle that pressure and rise to the challenge and
in fact may even be spurred on by that pressure, it's Mayor
Giuliani. ... He's tougher and stronger than anyone ever gives him
credit for, so don't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari added that neither she nor her husband, former Rep.
Bill Paxon, R-Buffalo, was interested in running if Giuliani does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has prostate cancer and is seeking a separation from
his wife, Donna Hanover, who publicly accused him of having an
affair with a former City Hall aide. The mayor is also flaunting an
ongoing relationship with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ''Fox News,'' Rep. Vito Fossella, R-Staten Island,
added: ''He needs to take the bullets if he can, and I think there
will be a lot of people in New York who are still very much behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, the GOP's strongest potential candidate, has
said he's not interested in taking Giuliani's place, but Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-Long Island, and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted
Forstmann have expressed interest in running if Giuliani drops out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-Long Island, told ''Meet the Press'' he would
pursue the nomination but said it was too soon to write Giuliani
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was anybody else besides Rudy, he'd be out of it by now,
but he's very unpredictable,'' King said. ''If he can somehow get
this in order, if he can get a clean bill of health from the
doctors, if the marriage problems recede in the background, it's
possible by Labor Day you'll see once again a Rudy vs. Hillary
war.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Sunday's New York Post showed Clinton and
Giuliani neck and neck, with 42 percent supporting the first lady
and 40 percent supporting the mayor. Clinton's small lead is well
within the poll's 4.5-point margin of error. Only a third of voters
said Giuliani's troubles ''diminish his stature.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Federal Rape Law  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today threw out a law that
let rape victims sue their attackers in federal court, saying
Congress wrongly trampled on an area of state authority.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling in a Virginia case invalidated a key provision of
the 1994 Violence Against Women Act and followed the court's recent
trend of expanding states' rights at the expense of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in enacting the provision, overstepped its authority
to regulate interstate commerce and enforce the Constitution's
equal-protection guarantee, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   In other action the court:
</P>
<P>
   --Rejected the request of the group Accuracy in Media that
photographs taken of White House lawyer Vince Foster's body after
his 1993 suicide be made public.
</P>
<P>
   --Turned down the appeal of a high school teacher fired for
refusing to take a drug test after police using a drug-sniffing dog
found marijuana in her car.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled that bribing hospital officials is a federal crime
because hospitals receive federal money for treating Medicare
patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Rejected an appeal by ranchers and farmers, upholding several
changes in federal rules for livestock grazing on millions of acres
of federal land throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the rape case the justices ruled that Christy Brzonkala, a
former Virginia Tech student, cannot pursue her federal lawsuit
against two football players, alleging that they raped her in a
dormitory room. Brzonkala, who has allowed her name to be
disclosed, became the first person to sue under the law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was the
victim of a brutal assault,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court. ''If the allegations here are true, no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy ...
But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the
commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzonkala's lawyer, Eileen Wagner, said she had expected the law
to be struck down but added, ''the national debate was worth it for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael E. Rosman, who argued the case on behalf of the
two men sued by Brzonkala, called the ruling ''a very good day for
the Constitution and the rule of law.'' People who allege they are
victims of gender-based violence ''have perfectly good remedies in
state court,'' Rosman said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected arguments by Brzonkala's lawyer and the
Clinton administration that the law was needed because states are
not doing enough to protect rape victims, and because gender-based
violence restricts women's choices in jobs and travel.
</P>
<P>
   That argument ''would allow Congress to regulate any crime as
long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has
substantial effects on employment, production, transit or
consumption,'' Rehnquist said. ''Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or
any other type of violence. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Souter cited ''the mountain of data
assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce. ... Violence against women may be
found to affect interstate commerce and to affect it
substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's ruling affirmed a federal appeals court that threw out
Brzonkala's lawsuit against student athletes Antonio Morrison and
James Crawford. The appeals court said such lawsuits come under the
authority of the states, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a followup to the Supreme Court's 1995 ruling that
struck down as unconstitutional the federal Gun-Free School Zones
Act, which made it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000
feet of a school.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled then that gun possession was insufficiently
linked to interstate commerce and that the gun possession law
usurped states' authority over such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the court has issued a number of rulings that tipped
the balance of power toward the states, including one in January
that shielded state governments against federal age-bias claims by
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers told the Supreme Court that in
deciding to let rape victims sue their attackers in federal court,
Congress found that ''archaic prejudices and improper stereotypes''
about women were affecting the outcomes of cases in state courts.
Violent crime against women costs the nation at least $3 billion a
year, government lawyers told the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for the two athletes said that allowing Congress
to enact such laws would relegate states to a trivial role in such
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote, ''We accordingly reject the argument that
Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based
solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.
The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
national and what is truly local.''
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act also has criminal provisions, and
those were not at issue in today's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Brzonkala, who did not return to Virginia Tech after her
freshman year, has spoken publicly about the case only rarely.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in January before the justices heard
arguments, she said, ''Rape is like having your soul torn out. This
violence happens to too many women, and we need laws on the books
to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six states supported Brzonkala and asked the court to
uphold the provision. In February, Virginia Tech said it agreed to
pay $75,000 to Brzonkala to settle a separate lawsuit she filed
against the university, which she said protected the two men
because they were athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are U.S. vs. Morrison, 99-5, and Brzonkala vs.
Morrison, 99-29.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 83; Nasdaq Down 26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as the Federal Reserve's
decision on interest rates loomed over the market. Blue-chip shares
showed some strength, but few investors were taking on major new
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 83.01 at 10,692.38.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 26.95 at 3,502.11 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 10.67 at 1,431.63.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said trading was likely to be light until
Tuesday afternoon, after the Fed's meeting. The Fed's Open Market
Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates for the sixth
time since last June in its continuing effort to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Fed offered the latest indication that the economy
remains extremely robust. The Fed said industrial production posted
its biggest leap in April in more than a year, as output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose 5 15/16 to 60 1/16. The
Wall Street Journal reported Spain's Terra Networks SA is in
serious discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many other high-profile technology names were lower. Cisco
Systems was down 1 to 58 15/16 and PMC-Sierra was down 2| to 143
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said investors remain leery of highly-priced technology stocks in
the wake of a steep selloff in April. The Nasdaq has recovered some
of its footing, yet remains more than 30 percent below its March 10
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's widespread agreement that tech stocks will continue to
be the leaders,'' he said. But the shakeout in April forced
investors to become more discerning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq debacle has been led by tech stocks that have no
earnings and were priced off inflated revenue estimates,'' he said.
''The quality of earnings is suddenly being talked about a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, Philip Morris rose 2[ to 26 7/16. The Wall
Street Journal reported the company has offered to buy the food
business of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, International Paper rose 3 21/128, fueling the Dow's
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 343.26 million
shares, compared with 414.29 million at the same time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.57 to 487.37.

<HEADLINE> Report: Others Sought Nabisco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos., France's Danone SA and
Britain's Cadbury Schweppes PLC have reportedly made preliminary
offers for all or part of Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food company
that makes Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Holdings Inc. has also indicated it is interested in
bidding for Nabisco's controlling shareholder, Nabisco Group
Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Group Holdings and Nabisco Holdings soared on
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The bids were reportedly made as part of the auction process
that Nabisco Group Holdings launched last month after financier
Carl Icahn said he was prepared to make an offer for the 90.4
percent of Nabisco Group that he doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, who owns about 31 million of the company's 326 million
shares, disclosed Friday that he told the auctioneers he would pay
$22 a share for the rest, or about $6.49 billion. The Journal said
it couldn't determine a value for the other offers.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group owns 80.5 percent of the food company Nabisco
Holdings, and hired investment bankers to explore its options,
including selling itself or its stake in Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco Group
shares climbed 13.3 percent, or $2.06\, to $22.31\ by midday while
Nabisco Holdings stock rose 7 percent, or by $3.06\, to $47 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group, the successor to the company that spun off R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco last summer, has been trading at a discount to the
food company in part because of fears that those who may win legal
claims against the tobacco company could press for payment from its
former parent.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group, based in Parsippany, N.J., declined to comment on
who may have submitted bids.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the
matter, said Philip Morris, owner of Kraft Foods as well as the
nation's biggest cigarette company, and Danone, which has a large
cookie and cracker business, had each bid for the food business.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Cadbury Schweppes PLC has bid for the
non-biscuit portion of Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said bankers have speculated that Nabisco Holdings
might fetch as much as $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, which was spun off by
the predecessor to Nabisco Group last year, formally expressed an
interest in buying the holding company once it sells the food
business.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Cadbury Schweppes and R.J. Reynolds declined
comment and calls to Philip Morris and Danone were not immediately
returned.

<HEADLINE> Short-staffed department reeling from recent setbacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The town's police department, with an
authorized strength of 45 sworn officers, is down to just 28 and
still coping with the recent criminal convictions of two of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Eight officers are on sick or injury leave. The shortage has all
but stopped a plan to have one officer stationed at New Milford
High School and another at Schaghticoke Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to deal with the situation the best we can,'' Acting
Police Chief Colin McCormack told the Danbury News-Times. ''We are
still meeting all our staffing requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack acknowledged it's unusual to have eight officers out
for medical reasons but said the absences are not related to the
convictions of former Officer Scott Smith and Officer William
Scribner.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was fired after he was convicted of intentional
manslaughter for shooting a suspect in the back. Last week he was
sentenced to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner remains on desk duty pending sentencing June 14. He was
convicted this spring of negligent homicide after a teen-age girl
died in a collision with his cruiser. He faces six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack said his missing officers were injured in the line of
duty. Six officers are out on injury leave and receiving workers'
compensation. Two others are on sick leave, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack currently is trying to recruit new officers but said
it takes five to six months before a recruit is trained to handle
regular patrol duties. Meanwhile, the department has used up its
$81,600 overtime budget and had to get an additional $75,000 to
cover overtime until the end of the fiscal year, June 30.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, it received a federal grant for a community
policing initiative that would pay the salary of two officers. That
grant has never been used and it's not clear whether it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCormack's fate is uncertain. The department has been
without a permanent police chief since August, and the town's
police search committee hasn't met in months.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack says his officers are doing the best job they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have worked in a professional manner under obviously very
difficult situations,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Three cities say programs taking guns off streets  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Connecticut cities participating in a federal initiative
to buy back guns say they have retrieved hundreds of weapons and
taken a small but sure step toward stopping gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede few criminals are likely to turn in their
weapons in exchange for a gift certificate. But they say they are
cutting the risk that guns kept in homes will be stolen or
mishandled by children.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can prevent one gun from being taken, one child from
getting hurt, it's a good program,'' said New Britain Police Chief
William Sencio.
</P>
<P>
   New Britain, Hartford and Stamford are taking part in Buyback
America, a $10.5 million initiative by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. More than 80 cities are
participating in the program launched in September 1999 by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials reported last week that more than 10,000 guns have
been collected so far in 43 cities. The program has come under
fire, though, from Republicans who claim HUD does not have the
authority to spend anti-drug money on gun buybacks, and the
National Rifle Association which says the money would be better
spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buyback programs help communities feel empowered when you have
state legislatures that won't do anything to stop violence and
Congress bottles up gun safety bills for years,'' said Brian
Morton, a spokesman for Handgun Control Inc., a Washington
D.C.-based gun control organization. ''And they take guns out of
places where tragedies can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, where the city put up $10,000 to buy back guns, 80
weapons have come in since April 28, said Hartford police Sgt. Neil
Dryfe. In exchange, people receive $100 vouchers to an area
restaurant or store.
</P>
<P>
   The guns -- a mix of handguns, rifles and shotguns -- came in more
quickly than expected and city officials were considering
allocating more money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford conducted its program on five Saturdays in April and
collected 77 guns, said Edward Schwartz, executive director of the
city's Housing Authority. Vouchers were handed out in varying
amounts depending on the type of weapon and whether it worked. A
rusted pellet gun would merit $10 while a functional assault weapon
would be worth $200.
</P>
<P>
   Forty of the weapons were handguns, and all but three were still
operational, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The continuing theme of returns was, 'I'm so glad to get this
out of the house,''' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The city earmarked $71,500 for the program -- $21,000 of that
from HUD. A portion of the funding will go toward handing out
thousands of trigger locks at community events this summer.
</P>
<P>
   New Britain's program began Friday with the retrieval of one
gun, a .22-caliber Colt revolver from a mother of four who no
longer wanted her late father's weapon in her home, Sencio said.
With an allocation of $7,500, the city can give out $75 vouchers
for 100 guns.
</P>
<P>
   The guns are traced to ensure they were not stolen or used in a
crime and then destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Ullman Directs Bergman Tale  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP)-- Almost 30 years ago, she appeared on the
world's movie screens in Ingmar Bergman's ''Scenes From a
Marriage,'' a searing look at marriage, infidelity and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 60, Liv Ullman again examines the corrosive force of
infidelity, this time from behind the camera. But the link to
Bergman remains; ''Faithless'' is based on a painful episode in his
life. When the 79-year-old Swedish legend couldn't bear to direct
it himself, he turned to Ullman, his longtime muse.
</P>
<P>
   The film has drawn attention at Cannes not only for the highly
personal nature of the story, but for the powerhouse performance of
its lead actress, Lena Endre, who appears in nearly every frame and
is already being touted for a best actress award.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bergman was unable to turn his story, about his own
destructive affair with a married woman, into a film for many years
-- until he saw Endre, an accomplished stage actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only when he saw this face, and this actress, could he make
the movie,'' Ullman says.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman, with 40 films as an actress and several Oscar
nominations to her name, has directed only four films, including
''Faithless.'' But the Norwegian star says firmly that now, she
sees herself behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 60 years old, and they don't make parts for me anymore,''
she says. ''I love to direct. That's what I want to do now. Maybe
when I am 70, I will change again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her longtime collaboration with Bergman -- the two had a
five-year relationship that produced a daughter -- it is both a
blessing and a constraint, but mostly the former.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I get a little tired of it,'' Ullman says. Then she
laughs. ''But you know, what a privilege, to get tired of working
with Ingmar Bergman.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three hours long, ''Faithless'' is heavy going, and won't
be everyone's cup of tea. But it is undeniably powerful in the same
way as the 1973 ''Scenes from a Marriage,'' a seminal film about
infidelity. And Endre's performance, which seems to run the entire
gamut of human emotions, more than carries the film.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what life experiences she used to portray her character,
Endre replies simply: ''Every personal experience I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman is incarnated in two characters in the film. His elder
self is an aging director, named Bergman, who is trying to write a
screenplay about the breakup of a marriage. This character is
played by Erland Josephson, who played Ullman's husband in ''Scenes
from a Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The director summons an actress -- Endre -- to help him by telling
the story of Marianne (also played by Endre). Bergman's younger
self is David -- the narcisisstic lover with whom Marianne becomes
entangled, destroying her marriage and harming her child.
</P>
<P>
   David is a director too, and his last name is Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne starts out happily married to Markus, a world-renowned
conductor. The two have a 9-year-old daughter to whom they are
devoted. But one day, David, the couple's best friend, happens to
spend a night at Marianne's house while Markus is gone. This
launches an affair that is consummated in a romantic getaway in
Paris. Marianne is swept up in the desire to live a little
dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy begins in earnest with a powerful scene in which
Markus arrives at David's small apartment and catches the couple in
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Markus, in utter shock and horror, the naked couple
laughs, as people sometimes do when they are in distress, then
cries, then laughs and cries again. Ullman says that when the scene
was completed, the actors didn't even know they'd been laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage over, an awful legal ordeal ensues, and the film
hurtles toward a surprising and tragic climax.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers may find the film too long, or David's character
somewhat unsympathetic -- but that seems to be the intent. Bergman
is known for being hard on himself.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: No decision yet on cancer treatment or Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said today he hasn't
decided on what treatment he will get for his prostate cancer, let
alone whether he will continue his bid for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not completed the external or internal process that I
have put in place,'' he said, disputing a Newsweek magazine report
that he had decided to undergo surgery and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has learned from talking with others with cancer that
''you change your mind about it probably 10 times before you make
the decision'' on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I wake up and think one way will be best, and
sometimes I wake up and think the other way will be best,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did say he had canceled planned fund-raisers in California
that had been scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Told by reporters that Giuliani had not yet made a decision,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Democratic Senate rival, said today at
a Manhattan news conference: ''I have no control over what the
Republicans do. ... I'm just not thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was unable to focus on medical decisions last
week, when he announced that he and his wife of 16 years, Donna
Hanover, were discussing a separation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last week, because of things involving my personal life, my
family and everything else, I didn't have the time,'' he said about
his need to consult physicians and decide what to do next. ''So I'm
going to need to do that this week. I'm going to need to do it
today, tomorrow, the next day. I don't know. You can't put a time
frame on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing the very very best that I can to make the decisions
that have to be made and I will focus on it very much this week,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Democrats were predicting that his Senate campaign was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all over but the shouting,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' on Sunday. ''As far as becoming the
next U.S. senator, forget it! He never really wanted the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to withdraw, and it has to be before the end of the
month because the Republican convention is taking place,'' former
Mayor Ed Koch told ABC's ''This Week.'' ''There's no question in my
mind he will drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sources would only say that Giuliani hadn't yet made up his
mind, while Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum,
stated, in a gloomy tone of voice, ''I've got no comment on
anything. I've got nothing to say on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from
Staten Island, told NBC's ''Meet the Press'': ''Nobody knows at
this point. I talked to the mayor's staff as late as yesterday
(Saturday). They are still waiting for him to come to a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''If there is one person in the United States of
America who can handle that pressure and rise to the challenge and
in fact may even be spurred on by that pressure, it's Mayor
Giuliani. ... He's tougher and stronger than anyone ever gives him
credit for, so don't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari added that neither she nor her husband, former Rep.
Bill Paxon, R-Buffalo, was interested in running if Giuliani does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover publicly accused Giuliani of having had an affair with a
former City Hall aide. The mayor is also flaunting an ongoing
relationship with a third woman, Judith Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ''Fox News,'' Rep. Vito Fossella, R-Staten Island,
added: ''He needs to take the bullets if he can, and I think there
will be a lot of people in New York who are still very much behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, the GOP's strongest potential candidate, has
said he's not interested in taking Giuliani's place, but Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-Long Island, and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted
Forstmann have expressed interest in running if Giuliani drops out.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-Long Island, told ''Meet the Press'' he would
pursue the nomination but said it was too soon to write Giuliani
off.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Sunday's New York Post showed Clinton and
Giuliani neck and neck, with 42 percent supporting the first lady
and 40 percent supporting the mayor. Clinton's small lead is well
within the poll's 4.5-point margin of error. Only a third of voters
said Giuliani's troubles ''diminish his stature.''

<HEADLINE> Two S.C. Republicans Jump Ship  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bill Clinton is almost gone from the White
House, crime is down and tax cuts don't sell the way they used to.
Some Republicans figure they might as well be Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a single week recently, two Republicans in the Legislature
jumped to the Democratic Party in what former Democratic National
Committee chairman Don Fowler said was the first such switch in
South Carolina since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Mickey Whatley and Margaret Gamble, both moderate
Republicans, said they were fed up with being bullied to vote
against Democratic measures on education and health care at the
expense of their districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am loyal first to the people I represent and will never put
a political party's agenda over the needs of this district,'' said
Whatley, a retired North Charleston police chief.
</P>
<P>
   His district leans Democratic, with a large black population. He
won as a Republican in 1998 with 53 percent of the vote against a
Democrat who dropped out but whose name remained on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's suburban Columbia district leans Republican, but she
voted for Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges' new school-readiness program
and his prescription drug plan for senior citizens against the GOP
leadership's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seniors who are having to decide between food and
prescription drugs. My district has children who are being left
behind in school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders dismissed the party-switching as an election-year
convenience. Gamble and Whatley would have had primary opponents
next month had they stayed in the party. ''It's called
self-preservation,'' said House Majority Leader Rick Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the defections moved the Democrats to
within four seats of regaining control of South Carolina's House.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the South, Georgia state Rep. Randy Sauder
decided last month to seek re-election as a Democrat because of
Republican opposition to Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes' education
reform bill. In Alabama, state Sen. Jeff Enfinger jumped to the
Democratic Party in January because he said it had broader issues.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland state Sen. Robert Neall became a Democrat in November
because of GOP criticism that he was not conservative enough.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Whit Ayers doesn't deny Democrats have had
recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the fact that you had two House Republicans about ready to
lose a Republican primary and they switched to the Democratic Party
in an effort to save their seats says absolutely nothing about
party competition in the South,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bigger picture is the growth of the Republican Party,''
said Earl Black, a Rice University political scientist who
specializes in Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   The longer and broader trend over the past generation has seen
the once reliably Democratic South become a Republican power base.
The recent Republican-to-Democrat switching in South Carolina is
nowhere near in size to the groundswell of state Democrats who
jumped to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said 15 to 20 Democratic legislators in South Carolina
have switched to the GOP since the 1960s. Nine of them jumped after
the 1994 election, giving the Republicans control of South
Carolina's House for the first time this century. The Democrats
control the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, however, Democrats regained the
governors' offices in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. They
control 24 of 30 Southern legislative chambers.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the Democrats' education platform and health
care agenda seemed to resonate with voters more than the GOP
staples of tax cuts and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a winning message,'' said the governor, who wants a
lottery to support the state's lagging public schools.
''Republicans have tended to stick to the same messages that they
had in the 1980s that were appealing to voters at that time.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Streamlining Equipment Approval  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that consumers have an abundance of
choices for their phones, modems and fax machines, federal
regulators are looking to privatize the process that helped build
that competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications equipment -- like phones and faxes -- must meet
certain technical criteria to show that they will not harm the
phone network once they are connected. Currently, the Federal
Communications Commission sets the standards and gives its stamp of
approval to the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But that can slow down the introduction of new products because
the commission has to examine about 4,000 items a year. Each review
can take four or more weeks. The process also puts additional costs
on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules proposed Monday, the FCC would hand over many of
these responsibilities to the private sector. In other words,
industry groups would set and maintain the technical standards to
make sure phones and other equipment don't harm the network. Other
groups or independent labs could then certify the products that
comply with the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Retail outlets for telephone equipment would have been
unthinkable thirty years ago,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard.
But now there is ''a very vibrant, robust, marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bell monopoly system -- and before the commission
established its approval process in 1975 -- only phones made by the
company typically were allowed to be hooked into the network. That
created another monopoly in the market for telecommunications
products.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC rules allowed other companies to certify their products
as safe to connect to the Bell network and helped foster
competition. Now retail store chains carry many varieties of phones
and faxes at a variety of prices.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing governmental involvement in the approval process,
the commission hopes to fuel even more innovation in the
marketplace for phone equipment. It could take several months
before the FCC votes to implement the proposed rules, and they take
effect.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Residents Seek Comfort  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   POJOAQUE, N.M. (AP) -- With tears streaming down their faces, two
women clutching rosary beads held each other tightly before the
altar. One couple knelt and prayed that they would be able to
rebuild on the spot where their house was destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   They were among some 375 congregants of the Immaculate Heart of
Mary church in Los Alamos who gathered Sunday at a Roman Catholic
parish in nearby Pojoaque. Though some mourned their losses from
the wildfire that swept through town, others were thankful that
nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we lose a home or when it is damaged, we feel as though
it is happening to our very selves,'' the Rev. Charles Brown told
them. ''God did not plan the fire. It was not his doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The blaze, started by the National Park Service as a controlled
burn, roared out of control, destroying more than 220 structures
and leaving 405 families without homes. It had scorched 44,323
acres and was 28 percent contained this morning. All of Los Alamos'
11,000 residents remained out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown asked the worshippers not to try to assess blame but to
offer forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the result of a miscalculation and the natural forces of
creation,'' he told them. ''No one would deliberately cause such
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Services for victims of the wildfire also were held Sunday in
Santa Fe, 35 miles southeast of Los Alamos. Throughout the state,
churches took up collections for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Katcher, 74, and his wife, Beverly, 77, said they came to
the Pojoaque parish seeking additional strength to cope with losing
their house. The couple said they had only enough time to grab
their wedding pictures and a file cabinet holding important papers
before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was doing all right, but I'm starting to fall apart,'' said
Katcher, a retired electronics technician for the Los Alamos
National Laboratory.

<HEADLINE> Unicredito To Buy Pioneer Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Italy's second-largest banking firm has agreed to
purchase the investment operations of Boston mutual fund house
Pioneer Group Inc. for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Monday, Unicredito Italiano Group will
combine Pioneer's $24 billion in investment operations in the
United States, Europe and Asia with its own to create a $100
billion global investment company.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 billion price tag represents about 5 percent of
Pioneer's assets under management. Industry experts said the price
is expensive, but it will let the Italian bank come a step closer
to becoming one of Europe's biggest asset management groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer shareholders, meanwhile, will get a price that should
satisfy some investors who have been lobbying for a sale,
especially Southeastern Asset Management of Memphis, Pioneer's
biggest investor with 18 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sale, Pioneer plans to distribute its other
investments including venture capital, real estate and Russian
financial services to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unicredito will pay $43.50 per share in cash for Pioneer shares,
40 percent more than the stock's $31 closing price Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Pioneer shares climbed 36.3 percent, or $11.25, to $42.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The sale follows a tumultuous two years at the 72-year-old
Pioneer which saw the company lose tens of millions of dollars in
risky investments, such as a failed Russian bank and a South
African gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   Its flagship fund, Pioneer Fund, was founded in 1928 and is the
fourth oldest mutual fund in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pioneer stockholders, as well as trustees and shareholders
of its funds, must vote to approve the sale.
</P>
<P>
   There will be little immediate change for Pioneer fund
investors. UniCredito's Pietro Modiano will be the chairman of the
newly created Pioneer Global Asset Management, based in Italy. But
Pioneer chief executive John F. Cogan will become deputy chairman.
David D. Tripple, who currently heads Pioneer Investment
Management, will become CEO of Pioneer U.S.

<HEADLINE> Goodbye To '90210' Gang  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No more boozing at the Peach Pit After Dark.
There's a final clearance on Donna Martin's skimpy clothing line at
her Now Wear This boutique. And the Beverly Beat is publishing its
last issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just what are the beautiful people of ''Beverly Hills, 90210''
to do?
</P>
<P>
   Find other work, since the Fox series is ending after 10 years
of pregnancies, drug and alcohol addiction, car wrecks, cheating,
rapes and umpteen different hair colors for Tori Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing the show lasted as long as it did,'' said
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, who wreaked havoc from 1994 to 1998 as bad
girl Val Malone. She and former castmates Jason Priestley and
Gabrielle Carteris return for the series finale, which airs
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad. It's like a dog that you love that's suddenly taken
away from you, and I mean dog in the best sense of the word,'' said
series creator (and Tori's father) Aaron Spelling. ''It's been a
long run, a good run and I loved every minute of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' was part of a new wave of teen series
that hit TV in the early '90s, including ''Fresh Prince of Bel
Air,'' and quickly proved the big winner.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the series won the adoration of fans (Priestley
and Luke Perry being particular targets), was No. 1 among young
viewers, and captured the cover of magazines such as Rolling Stone
and People. There were T-shirts, calendars, trading cards,
backpacks, pillows and dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The series also helped the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Co.
establish itself as a fresh alternative to the big three networks.
</P>
<P>
   In the finale, don't look for Shannen Doherty (Brenda) to
revisit her former ZIP code. Doherty left in '94 after four
tantrum-filled seasons, a move she calls ''the best decision I ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I started getting stagnant and stale in my second season,''
she said. ''I would be a walking corpse if I were still on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-hour wrapup, David (Brian Austin Green) and Donna
(Spelling) marry, while Kelly (Jennie Garth) must decide between
her engagement to Matt (Daniel Cosgrove) and her longtime feelings
for Dylan (Perry).
</P>
<P>
   David and Donna's nuptials may be the most overdue in the
history of television. For those scoring at home, David dumped
Donna in '93 when she wouldn't have sex with him. He proposed in
'97, but she never said yes despite losing her virginity to him.
Late that year, David took up with Val. This season, he dumped
Camille to get back with Donna. Got that?
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter got sick of being a virgin for seven years,'' said
Spelling, whose kids Tori and Randy really did grow up in the
biggest mansion in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 main characters, only Brenda, Steve (Ian Ziering) and
Andrea (Carteris) escaped run-ins with booze and drugs. Cocaine
became the temporary downfall of Kelly, Valerie, David, Dylan and
Noah (Vincent Young). Brandon, Dylan and Noah became alcoholics,
while Kelly downed diet pills and Val rolled joints.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't like 'Melrose Place.' That was sheer camp and sexual
camp,'' Spelling said of his now-defunct Fox show. ''We've done
more issues on this show than any I've been connected with.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide, AIDS, cancer and bulimia befell the teen-agers, who
first cavorted through the halls of West Beverly High on Oct. 4,
1990. Fox picked up only 13 episodes at the start, then asked for
more in batches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we were going to lose it after 13 episodes,''
Spelling said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the rich kids graduated from high school, went on to
California University and got jobs. In between, there was sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll (The Rolling Stones, Collective Soul,
Christina Aguilera and Goo Goo Dolls were among the show's musical
guest stars).
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids started as sophomores in high school. At least we
were honest about it,'' Spelling said. ''I know some shows where
they'll spend eight years in college.''
</P>
<P>
   When Doherty left the show, she was replaced by Thiessen.
Thiessen settled in quickly as Val, who slept with David, got
arrested for gambling, faked a pregnancy, attempted suicide and had
an HIV scare.
</P>
<P>
   ''She gets to do all the dirty deeds which people loved,''
Thiessen said. ''It wasn't bad doing all those love scenes with all
the guys on the show. I was with everybody by my second season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziering is one of four actors who stayed for the entire 10-year
run. He is going to miss his character, Steve Sanders, who was
always up for a good-looking woman or an excuse to party.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shameless hussy,'' Ziering said, laughing, ''and I'm
talking about Steve. I got to walk on his wild side, yet go home at
the end of the day without having to pay for his misdeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling, whose career was revived by ''90210,'' sees a
future for the Beverly Hills gang in a follow-up TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ziering has the perfect title: ''Beverly Hills 90210: The
Geriatric Years.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Hey, Brandon. Pass me the Geritol,''' he cracked.

<HEADLINE> Can Britney Do It 'One More Time'?  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Flip on MTV these days, and you're likely to see
a young, pretty blonde singing a fluffy pop tune with a mixture of
innocence and burgeoning sex appeal. It could be Britney Spears. Or
Christina Aguilera. Mandy Moore or Jessica Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the teen pop queens can be traced back to 1998, when
a then-16-year-old Britney debuted with ''... Baby One More Time.''
Not quite bubble gum but not sophisticated pop, the danceable beats
and her sexy yet childlike image propelled the Louisiana native to
the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18, Spears is set to release her follow-up album, ''Oops ...
I Did It Again,'' on Tuesday. Can she repeat her success against
increased competition for a fickle teen audience?
</P>
<P>
   Some say it won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other acts out there, while they are good, she really has
her own persona. She just sticks out,'' said Paul Karlson, who
oversees top 40 radio promotions at HITS magazine, a radio industry
trade weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Baby One More Time'' sold 9.3 million copies in the United
States alone, according to Soundscan, which tabulates record sales.
</P>
<P>
   Several similar acts followed, the most successful of which has
been the 19-year-old Aguilera. Like Spears, Aguilera has performed
since she was a child -- in fact, both appeared on the ''Mickey
Mouse Club.'' But unlike Spears, Aguilera's vocal power, compared
favorably to Mariah Carey's, has won critical acclaim. She beat
Spears for best new artist honors at this year's Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aguilera's self-entitled debut, while still a smash, sold
fewer copies than Spears' -- 5.6 million in the United States. Other
wannabe teen divas have not done nearly as well -- Moore's debut
album has sold just over 700,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Karlson says response to the title track of Spears' ''Oops ...''
is already strong. ''It's getting amazing requests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-oriented pop has been driving the music industry; the boy
band 'N Sync sold a record 2.4 million copies in one week in March.
That album's now up to 5.2 million and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Spears' numbers to match that. But Karlson and
others say she still has an edge over her competition because she
was the first female teen pop star to make such an impact after a
wave of boy bands -- like The Backstreet Boys and Hanson -- and
teen-age R&AMP;B and country songstresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids instantly related to her, especially young girls, and she
had that classic young pop singer thing. Girls want to be her, and
boys want to date her,'' said Lori Majewski, entertainment director
at Teen People, which named Britney one of its ''25 Hottest Stars
under 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Calderone, senior vice president of music and talent
programming at MTV, which has devoted several days of programming
to Spears, doesn't think the extra competition will dent Britney's
popularity or sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that like in rock and hip-hop, there's room for many
people to be in the pool,'' he said. ''I think that for Britney to
have a really successful sales story -- sort of what The Backstreet
Boys did for 'N Sync -- only helps Jessica and Mandy.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Bullet-Proof Vests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proclaimed his effort
to buy more bullet-resistant vests for police officers a success,
and announced additional money for the program this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also honored 139 police officers killed in the line of
duty last year and announced a new presidential award for police
valor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their purpose and passion was the safety of the people,''
Clinton said at a ceremony honoring fallen police officers. ''We
can never repay them ... but we can honor them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton put in a plug for stalled legislation requiring trigger
locks on handguns and more background checks for handgun buyers,
things many police support. The president noted that better gun
control was the aim of Sunday's Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we will listen to what they had to say. It will also
save a lot of police officers' lives,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first full year last year, the federal vest program
helped buy more than 92,000 armored vests for state police and
local officers nationwide, Clinton said. The three-year Justice
Department program, which Clinton created in June 1998, makes
grants for up to half the price of vests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the $24 million available this year should help buy
approximately 90,000 more vests. Police departments have until next
week to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he supports a proposal in Congress to
extend the vest program for another three years, through 2004, and
to double funding from $75 million to $150 million over that
period.

<HEADLINE> Pa. State Senator Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A state senator who was convicted of
polluting a stream while responsible for a sewage-treatment plant
resigned Monday, less than an hour before an ethics panel was to
consider his status in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William L. Slocum, a first-term Republican, was sentenced
last week to a month in prison and five months of home detention
for polluting a northwestern Pennsylvania stream during the 12
years he oversaw the Youngsville sewage-treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, 52, is the fourth member of the General Assembly to
resign since February. His resignation takes effect June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serving the people of this great commonwealth as a senator has
been the greatest honor and privilege of my life,'' Slocum wrote in
a three-paragraph letter to Lt. Gov. Mark S. Schweiker, who
presides over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum pleaded guilty to six federal misdemeanor charges of
negligent discharge as part of an agreement with prosecutors.
Prosecutors said he allowed raw sewage to flow into Brokenstraw
Creek in Youngsville on several occasions between 1983 and 1995,
while he worked for the Youngsville water department and as borough
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats called for Slocum's resignation immediately after the
sentencing. Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, said the lawmaker should
consider quitting. A Senate ethics panel had been scheduled Monday
to discuss whether to expel or censure Slocum over the charges.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the telephone at Slocum's home said the
lawmaker would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The three other state lawmakers who resigned this year were all
in the House: Republican Tracy Seyfert pleaded guilty to illegally
obtaining a generator intended for firefighters; Democrat Frank J.
Gigliotti was charged with receiving bribes; and Republican Frank
A. Serafini was sentenced on federal perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another state representative, Republican Thomas W. Druce, is
awaiting trial on vehicular homicide in a fatal hit-and-run case.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Rail Killer Not in Control  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A defense expert for admitted serial killer Angel
Maturino Resendiz acknowledged today that the rail-riding drifter
knew his deadly spree was illegal, but maintained he did not know
right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After Dr. Bruce Cohen wrapped up a third day of testimony in
Maturino Resendiz's capital murder trial, defense attorney Allen
Tanner rested his case. Prosecutors were expected to call a
court-appointed psychiatrist this afternoon to rebut Cohen's
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is trying to win an innocent verdict by reason of
insanity, saying the Mexican citizen was delusional when he killed
nine Americans, including the death he is on trial for, the
December 1998 slaying of Houston-area physician Claudia Benton.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the defendant has ''delusional beliefs'' brought
about by acute paranoid schizophrenia, because he believed that he
was on a divine mission to eliminate evil and that public opinion
was on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz chose not to testify on his behalf. Besides
Benton, he is accused of killing five other people in Texas, two in
Illinois and one in Kentucky from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant prosecutor Lyn McClellan confronted Cohen with
statements made by the defendant's only known surviving victim -- a
female friend of slain University of Kentucky student Christopher
Maier -- that he attacked them because he wanted sex. It made no
mention of his purported delusions.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen replied that Maturino Resendiz said he did not remember
much about killing Maier and raping the friend near some railroad
tracks in Lexington, Ky., in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also restated to the jury that Maturino Resendiz's IQ is
120, above average. He added that many people with serious mental
illness are extremely intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   When he began cross-examining Cohen on Friday, McLellan accused
the psychiatrist of tailoring his testimony to fit the insanity
defense strategy. Cohen responded that he found only 10 percent of
the several hundred defendants he has evaluated for sanity to be
insane.

<HEADLINE> Jury Picks Start in O'Hair Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The federal trial started today for the
only man charged in the disappearance of atheist Madalyn Murray
O'Hair and two relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paul Karr, 52, is charged with conspiracy to kidnap and
extort money from O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and her
granddaughter Robin Murray O'Hair, whom she had adopted as her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution and defense attorneys this morning chose a jury of
nine men and six women for the trial, which is expected to last
three weeks. Opening arguments before U.S. District Judge Sam
Sparks were expected to begin this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after O'Hair and her family members vanished along
with $500,000 in gold coins, federal authorities finally believe
they know what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Though no bodies were ever found, prosecutors say the three were
dismembered and buried.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Karr could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do believe Mr. Karr is a very dangerous individual,'' U.S.
Attorney Gerald Carruth said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair is best known for launching the legal challenge that led
to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that effectively struck down
organized prayer in public schools as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she and her two grown children vanished from San
Antonio along with the coins. She wasn't reported missing until a
year later when her estranged son, William Murray, called Austin
police.
</P>
<P>
   Initial speculation was that the three were victims of foul play
or merely ran off with the money from their organization, United
Secularists of America. Some suggested O'Hair, who was 77 and
ailing, had gone off to die quietly to pre-empt Christians who
might have prayed for her soul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the evidence is just as consistent with them having
done what they said they were going to do -- leave town and get away
from the IRS,'' said Karr's attorney, Tom Mills of Dallas. ''We're
just going to have to see what evidence there is that some violence
happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, investigators believe the family was
killed, dismembered in an Austin storage unit, then put into
55-gallon drums and buried.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last year's searches of a South Texas ranch where an
informant said the drums were taken, investigators have found no
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have alleged that Karr, O'Hair's former office
manager David Roland Waters, and Florida resident Danny Fry
kidnapped the family and forced them to turn over the gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, who has a violent criminal history dating back to the
1960s, has said the O'Hairs voluntarily left Austin with Waters,
his former cellmate in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, authorities say, Karr went with Jon Murray to
New Jersey to arrange a $600,000 bank transfer. About a week later,
Murray took delivery of approximately $500,000 worth of gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Karr and Waters were arrested last year on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has not been charged in the alleged plot. He is serving
up to 60 years in prison for the weapons charges and a previous
conviction for stealing from O'Hair's atheist organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fry was found dead in 1995 in Dallas. His body wasn't identified
until three years later because his hands and head had been cut
off.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 153; Nasdaq Down 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as the Federal Reserve's
decision on interest rates loomed over the market. Blue-chip shares
showed some strength, but few investors were taking on major new
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 153.52 at 10,762.89.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 28.70 at 3,500.36 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 15.79 at 1,436.75.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said trading was likely to be light until
Tuesday afternoon, after the Fed's meeting. The Fed's Open Market
Committee is widely expected to raise interest rates for the sixth
time since last June in its continuing effort to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Fed offered the latest indication that the economy
remains extremely robust. The Fed said industrial production posted
its biggest leap in April in more than a year, as output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose 5 15/16 to 60 1/16. The
Wall Street Journal reported Spain's Terra Networks SA is in
serious discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many other high-profile technology names were lower. Cisco
Systems was down 1 15/16 to 58 and PMC-Sierra was down 2| to 143
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said investors remain leery of highly-priced technology stocks in
the wake of a steep selloff in April. The Nasdaq has recovered some
of its footing, yet remains more than 30 percent below its March 10
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's widespread agreement that tech stocks will continue to
be the leaders,'' Yardeni said. But the shakeout in April forced
investors to become more discerning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq debacle has been led by tech stocks that have no
earnings and were priced off inflated revenue estimates,'' he said.
''The quality of earnings is suddenly being talked about a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, Philip Morris rose 2 7/16 to 26}. The Wall
Street Journal reported the company has offered to buy the food
business of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, International Paper rose 3 117/128 to 40}, fueling the
Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose on speculation that if the Fed raises
rates by a half-percentage point on Tuesday, central bankers may be
finished with their cycle of rate increases. J.P. Morgan rose 2
5/16 to 132 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot rose 2 11/16 to 56 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 529.01 million
shares, compared with 593.11 million at the same time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.59 to 489.35.

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Talks on Disclosure  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's federal judges may ask Congress
to consider changing a financial-disclosure law to better protect
them from ''the criminal element in our society,'' Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risks to federal judges are real and deserving of careful
consideration,'' Rehnquist said in a speech to the American Law
Institute, a group of lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rehnquist's first public explanation of his
behind-the-scenes role in a dispute over release of
financial-disclosure reports for 1,600 federal judges to a news
organization that plans to post them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the deadline for all federal judges and other
high-ranking federal employees to submit financial-disclosure
reports for calendar year 1999. Those reports will be available for
public scrutiny soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the organization seeking all reports for 1998 has not
yet received one, APBnews.com's Joe Krakoviak said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, a 27-judge board of directors for
the federal judiciary, overturned a decision by one of its
committees and said last March that the reports must be made
available to APBnews.com. Rehnquist, the nation's highest-ranking
federal judge, chairs the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large majority of the members -- myself included -- felt that
the ... committee's willingness to withhold financial-disclosure
reports in their entirety, well-intentioned as it might be, could
not be supported in view of the statutory language,'' Rehnquist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress specifically provided in the Ethics in Government Act
an exemption from the prohibition on the use of the reports for
commercial purposes to news and communications media for
dissemination to the general public. ... And there are no
exceptions to this for the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist did not suggest there should be such an exception, but
said the Judicial Conference is working on regulations that would
allow sensitive information that ''could endanger'' the judges to
be removed from the reports before they are posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal trial judges ''are exposed to the criminal
element in our society in ways that most federal employees who must
file financial-disclosure reports, such as senators, congressmen
and perhaps appellate judges for that matter, are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current law, judges' reports conceivably could
disclose where a spouse works, where a family member is attending
school or even where a judge lives ''if, for example, the judge is
on a condominium board,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With regard to the issue of posting all judges'
financial-disclosure statements on the Internet, I believe the
Judicial Conference has acted responsibly and demonstrated a
good-faith effort to comply with a law that frankly poses some
risks to judges,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conference now hopes that Congress will also act
responsibly and balance the legitimate needs for public disclosure
of judges' financial holdings with the judges' need for security,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Polish Coal Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland's top government official in charge
of reforming the unprofitable coal mining industry resigned Monday,
apparently in protest over the Finance Ministry's recent demands
that the sector pay its mounting tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy economy minister Jan Szlazak had preferred a softer
approach to clearing up the coal industry's tax arrears than the
crackdown ordered by finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
</P>
<P>
   Balcerowicz, who has frequently criticized the slow pace of
restructuring in the coal industry, has begun legal action to
collect overdue social security and corporate income tax payments
for Poland's cash-strapped budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already 41 mining managers face lawsuits,'' Szlazak told the
public news agency PAP in explaining his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, including Balcerowicz, said Szlazak's
resignation was not related to the overdue taxes or mining reform,
but they refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Prime minister Jerzy Buzek will discuss Szlazak's resignation
with economics minister Jerzy Steinhoff later in the week, said
government spokesman Krzysztof Luft.
</P>
<P>
   Coal production was heavily subsidized during the communist era,
when it was Poland's main hard-currency earner. Since the onset of
market-oriented reforms after 1989, the government has struggled to
reorganize the sector in the face of intense union opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Balcerowicz presented measures to limit
corruption, which according to World Bank reports has been on the
rise in Poland's post-communist economy, due to old regulations
inadequate to a free market.
</P>
<P>
   To combat corruption, a special group will draft legal
regulations by June 20 to introduce competition for public posts,
more transparency in public tenders, equality in access to
information and limit licensing.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael J. Fox has started his own foundation to
help speed a cure for Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The name -- the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's
Research -- unnerves him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that it's eponymous just freaks me out,'' he said in
this week's Newsweek. ''But I understand, from a branding point of
view, that it's effective. I get e-mail from people all the time
saying, 'I finally told a co-worker that I had Parkinson's, the
Michael Fox disease.' That's pretty heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox recently taped his last episode of ''Spin City.'' He is
leaving the show to focus on family, his health and his foundation
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think at some point I may write a book,'' he said. ''I'm as
jaded about celebrity memoirs as everybody else is, so that's not
what I want to do. Someone was asking me the other day what would I
write? And I said, 'How to lose your brain without losing your
mind.'''

<HEADLINE> Polanski Honored, Despite Outcry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODZ, Poland (AP) -- Despite complaints about the sex scandal in
his past, Roman Polanski was made an honorary citizen of Lodz on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were two World War II heroes with ties to the city:
Marek Edelman, the only surviving commander of the Warsaw Ghetto
uprising, and Jan Karski, the envoy from Nazi-occupied Poland who
informed Western leaders about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski studied at the Lodz Film Academy and started his career
in Poland in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the ruling Solidarity party, which has ties to the
Roman Catholic Church, were against honoring Polanski because he
pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They were overruled, however, by other politicians.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Fight Worsens  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Guests, bystanders and journalists
took cover in the lobby of Ramallah's New City Inn Monday, after
Israeli snipers commandeered their rooms and the worst
Israeli-Palestinian fighting in years kept them from going outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets shattered the glass walls of the top floor restaurant
where patrons once enjoyed a sweeping view of Ramallah's
construction boom, one of the fruits of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. But on Monday Israeli soldiers
used the windows to fire on stone-throwing demonstrators and
Palestinian gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fake peace they speak of,'' said Fouad Shadeed, 55,
a Palestinian who was considering moving back to Ramallah from Abu
Dhabi. ''My room was broken into by five soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine Americans were trapped in the hotel, including three
Palestinian-American owners, three staff members, and three guests.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian man who had taken cover in the lobby tried to
leave, but was shot when he ventured out. Israeli soldiers treated
him in the lobby and evacuated him by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters hovered overhead as shots continued to ring out.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes began as marches marking ''Al Naqba,'' Arabic for
the catastrophe, which is how Palestinians view Israel's founding
52 years ago. They quickly spun out of control, though no one
seemed to know just how.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went out and threw stones at the soldiers,'' said Fayez
Akub, a 30-year old marketing student who was hit in the face with
a rubber bullet. ''There was a lot of anger and frustration, then
the soldiers started shooting heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator, 22-year old Eyad Assi, said he heard from
ambulance drivers that some of the wounded had been hit with
regular bullets instead of the rubber-coated steel pellets usually
used during demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bullets started coming from our side, from our soldiers,'' he
said, referring to Palestinian police. Assi was being treated for a
bullet wound in the upper arm at Ramallah Hospital, where friends
and relatives gathered to give blood and visit the scores of
injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the New City Inn's lobby, retired U.S. naval officer Jim
Parrish, 73, took cover with his friend, George Prignano, after
they were forced out of their rooms by soldiers. Parrish, of Morton
Grove, Ill., watched half-hour news updates and leaned on his cane,
his hands shaking from Parkinson's' disease. ''It's too much for an
old man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prignano, also from Morton Grove, said the gunfire took him by
surprise, despite the stone-throwing incidents of the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had demonstrations in Chicago,'' he said, ''but nothing
like this.''

   WASHINGTON (AP)-- A U.S. team will travel to North Korea for a

   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the inspection will begin on May
23 at the Kumchang-ni site.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence a year ago that the site was being used
for weapons production. The purpose of the second visit is to
confirm the work of the first, Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Problems With Palestinian Militants  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Monday
that Yasser Arafat has had ''some difficulties'' in restraining
Palestinian militants, but said the Palestinian leader was
committed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As bloody disorder swept the West Bank, sparked by Palestinian
protests on Israel's 52nd birthday of the country's existence, the
State Department equally praised Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak as being peace-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about the violence and particularly regret
the loss of life,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said. ''But the
parties themselves have committed a serious effort, and are
committed to a serious effort at the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised the chief Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed
Rabbo, who resigned and accused Israel of trying to divide the
Palestinians by setting up rival negotiating channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a great deal of respect for Yasser Abed Rabbo, and
we hope that he'll continue to be part of the negotiations,''
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly confirming the United States approved holding
talks in Stockholm, Sweden, separate from those in the region,
Boucher said ''over the last several years we have been involved in
helping the Israelis and Palestinians work through a variety of
interim and permanent status issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been expectations Arafat would not permit Palestinians
demonstrators to go beyond stone-throwing. But thousands of
Palestinians battled Israeli troops on the west Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue for Israelis as their government proceeds to
relinquish more of the West Bank to Arafat and contemplates
agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state is whether
their security would be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has insisted Arab attitudes toward
Israel have undergone change since Israel was founded in 1948 and
that Israel would be safer if it yielded territory to the Arabs on
all fronts in exchange for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday whether Arafat could have controlled the
demonstrators, Boucher said ''there's obviously difficulties in
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ''it's our view that he is also prepared to
pursue peace and take the historic decisions necessary to end the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, registered
concern with the violence and said violence would not solve
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's very important,'' she said, ''that the leaders
themselves try to do everything they can to control any violence.
It's very important there be the right climate that the peace
efforts will be able to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   American mediator Dennis Ross left Sunday for Israel, planning
talks with Barak and Arafat. Boucher said Albright probably would
go to the area, as well, but did not say when she would make the
trip, designed to keep Israel and the Palestinians focused on a
mid-September deadline for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher welcomed, meanwhile, a move by Barak to turn over to
Arafat three village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Arafat is
demanding part of the city, as well, as a capital for a Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Nuclear Reactor Shuts Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) -- A small electrical fire caused a
reactor at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant to shut down early
Monday, releasing steam that could contain tiny amounts of
radioactivity, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such radioactivity would be well below federal limits and no
public health impacts were anticipated, the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no measurable amount of radioactivity. The plant
operates perimeter monitors that would indicate any appreciable
amount,'' said Breck Henderson, a spokesman for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's Region 4 in Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported when an electric short and fire
happened at 12:25 a.m. in a turbine generator building. The blaze
was put out with a fire extinguisher by 1 a.m., said Jeff Lewis,
spokesman for the plant's operator, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   A firefighting unit from the California Department of Forestry
was summoned to assist in putting out the blaze, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Unit 1 reactor automatically shut down when the emergency
lasted beyond 15 minutes, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Plant operators reported an ''unusual event,'' the lowest level
of emergency declarations required by the NRC. The cause of the
fire in electrical switching equipment was not immediately
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to assess what happened, and why, before putting Unit
1 back into operation,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC resident inspector viewed the fire damage and will be
involved in the investigation of the cause, the NRC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Diablo Canyon, which has two nuclear reactors, is on
California's central coast. Some 237,000 people live in surrounding
San Luis Obispo County, including 43,000 in the nearby city of San
Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Unit 1 went into operation in 1985. Unit 2, in operation since
1986, was continuing to operate Monday, officials said. Each unit
produces about 1,100 megawatts of electricity -- equivalent to the
electric needs of about 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown came five days after a drill held by about 300
emergency workers to prepare for the possibility of a disaster at
the plant. In the drill, monitored by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, a mock radioactive release was tracked to decide
what areas would have to be evacuated.

   Industrial Output Rises in April
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production posted its biggest leap
in more than a year in April as the output of utilities rebounded,
the Federal Reserve said today. Output at the nation's factories
mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations and the largest increase since a 1.8 percent
gain posted in August 1998. Factories, mines and utilities were
operating at 82.1 percent of capacity, up from 81.7 percent in
March. However, The pickup in operating capacity remained below
levels usually associated with increasing inflation. Generally, a
reading of 84 percent makes economists start to worry. Some
economists say the increase in production would justify a
half-point hike in interest rates by the Fed's policy makers when
they meet tomorrow.

urgency to the world's leaders as they gathered today to brainstorm
about combating cybercrime, a transgression that knows no
boundaries. Leaders from Group of Eight countries were in Paris
today for a three-day discussion of Internet crime. Separately, the
41-nation Council of Europe working with the United States, Canada,
Japan and South Africa -- is drafting a treaty to standardize
cybercrime laws. Though their efforts preceded the appearance of
the ''Love Bug'' virus, the attack that crippled corporate and

   Unicredito To Buy Pioneer Group
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Italy's second-largest banking firm has agreed to
purchase the investment operations of Boston mutual fund house
Pioneer Group Inc. for $1.2 billion. Under the deal announced
today, Unicredito Italiano Group will combine Pioneer's $24 billion
in investment operations in the United States, Europe and Asia with
its own to create a $100 billion global investment company. The
$1.2 billion price tag represents about 5 percent of Pioneer's
assets under management. Industry experts said the price is
expensive, but it will let the Italian bank come a step closer to
becoming one of Europe's biggest asset management groups. Pioneer
shareholders, meanwhile, will get a price that should satisfy some
investors who have been lobbying for a sale.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Terra Networks, an ambitious cyberspace
powerhouse barely a year old but strong in Europe and with a
dominant presence in Latin America, is angling to take a big bite
of the U.S. Internet market. Terra confirmed Friday it is in talks
with Lycos Inc., one of the United States' top Internet portals.
Terra told stock market regulators in Madrid that no deal has been
signed, but analysts said some kind of alliance was likely. The
Wall Street Journal reported today that Terra was in serious
discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10 billion in stock. But
there is a significant chance the two sides will fail to reach a
deal, the newspaper said, quoting people close to the matter.

<HEADLINE> McCaffrey, Author Clash on Gulf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey and journalist
Seymour Hersh clashed Monday over charges that troops led by
McCaffrey used unnecessary force in a battle with Iraqi troops
after the Gulf War cease fire.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of McCaffrey's troops are questioned by several of
McCaffrey's former military colleagues in a report written by Hersh
in The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ex-colleagues, retired Lt. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr.,
is quoted as saying that ''there was no need to be shooting at
anybody'' on March 2, 1991. ''They couldn't surrender fast enough.
The war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were a defeated army going home and he attacked them,''
Hersh said on NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nonsense, this is revisionist history,'' responded
McCaffrey, now director of the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said two of his company commanders reported they were
under fire and ''we obviously had to support our soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has investigated the allegations that McCaffrey ordered
an unnecessary attack and concluded there was no evidence of war
crimes or misconduct by McCaffrey or his troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh ''is recycling charges that were investigated 10 years
ago. It conclusively demonstrated there was no wrongdoing,'' said
McCaffrey, who was also appearing on ABC's ''Good Morning America''
and CBS's ''The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said McCaffrey has
Clinton's full support and said of the article: ''It is false.''
Lockhart also launched an attack on Hersh as a self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the article itself is another in a series of articles
by a journalist who thinks if you throw enough stuff up against the
wall, maybe something will stick,'' Lockhart said. ''It's an
attempt to gratuitously go after public officials in an attempt to
try to revive a journalist's career.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said that its research found:
</P>
<P>
   --There was disagreement among officers assigned to McCaffrey's
mobile headquarters about whether Iraqis had attacked American
forces, prompting McCaffrey's strong response. Patrick Lamar, the
operations officer of McCaffrey's division, told the magazine that
the initial skirmish that triggered McCaffrey's order to attack was
''a giant hoax. The Iraqis were doing absolutely nothing. I told
McCaffrey I was having trouble confirming the incoming'' fire.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Lt. Gen. John J. Yeosock said ''what Barry ended up
doing was fighting sand dunes and moving rapidly'' and McCaffrey
was ''looking for a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   --Maj. Gen. Ronald Griffith said McCaffrey ''made it a battle
when it was never one.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack ordered by McCaffrey destroyed some 700 Iraqi tanks,
armored cars and trucks, The New Yorker reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hersh says that the Iraqi forces at Rumaylah were in
'retreat,''' McCaffrey said in a response. ''However, he wasn't the
one watching a force spanning five miles, made up of hundreds of
Iraqi tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers face him. The
Iraqis fired on U.S. forces. The Army investigations unequivocally
concluded that the use of force in response was justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine noted that there were occasional ''bitter
disputes'' between McCaffrey and other generals over such things as
the perceived hoarding of tank and truck fuel by McCaffrey, whose
division performed the famed ''left hook'' maneuver that blocked
the retreat of Iraqi forces from the war zone in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> FDA Prepares To Overhaul Warnings  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's one of medicine's thorniest issues: how
to teach doctors the pros and cons of the dozens of new drugs that
hit the market each year. A drug that's safe for one person can
kill the next; it largely depends on how each patient's risk
factors match each drug's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many doctors never read the warning labels of drugs they
prescribe. In 2{ years, the FDA has banned four drugs that killed
dozens of Americans in part because doctors disregarded or never
read the warnings. A fifth such drug is scheduled to come off the
market this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the FDA is preparing to overhaul hard-to-read drug labels,
hoping a new system similar to how foods are labeled will make it
easier for doctors to spot the biggest risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our interest is the clinician who has 30 seconds to make that
prescribing decision,'' says FDA drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock.
''They need something right in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That alone won't solve the problem, so agency scientists also
are debating stricter measures -- such as restricting which doctors
can prescribe certain risky drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A sobering exchange at a recent meeting of the agency's
scientific advisers illustrates the heightened concern:
</P>
<P>
   An experimental pill for impotence called Uprima will certainly
kill some men if it's allowed to sell, the advisers said bluntly.
But they called new impotence treatments necessary, so they urged
strong warning labels to deter prescriptions for the men most at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when a top FDA official asked how to ensure those warnings
would do any good, the advisers admitted they probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us knows what does work,'' responded
adviser Dr. Robert Califf of Duke University. ''Less than 1 percent
of physicians have seen a label in the last year. So I think it's
highly unlikely that putting anything in the label is going to make
any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a message FDA ''has been very slow to understand,'' says
Dr. Jerry Avorn, medication safety chief at Boston's Brigham &AMP;
Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A drug's label is actually pages of tiny print mixing
explanations of the drug's chemistry with how well it works and its
side effects. Some doctors read these complex labels, but many say
they're too busy and instead learn about new drugs from
pharmaceutical salesmen unlikely to stress risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't have a system that works for only the good doctors,
because they're not the ones who are going to get their patients
into trouble,'' adds Avorn.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes drug Rezulin, the painkiller Duract, the
hypertension drug Posicor and the antihistamine Seldane all were
pulled off the market -- and the heartburn drug Propulsid joins them
this summer -- for causing lethal side effects. While critics
question why the FDA didn't ban these drugs sooner, experts blame
many of the deaths on doctors' failure to heed repeated warnings
about how to safely prescribe the pills and for whom.
</P>
<P>
   Simplifying the label might make more doctors actually read it.
Woodcock says the FDA soon will propose new regulations making
prescription drug labels look more like food labels, with special
at-a-glance sections highlighting the biggest risks. The fine print
would come later, giving more details.
</P>
<P>
   Woodcock acknowledges that change isn't enough. ''It can't be a
cop-out. We can't just say, 'We're going to put it in the label and
then it's the doctor's problem' -- because it's the patient's
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Avorn wants FDA to restrict marketing of risky drugs, like the
agency did in 1998 with its unprecedented order that doctors must
be specially trained to prescribe the infamous birth defect-causing
drug thalidomide. FDA officials are debating that idea.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just FDA's problem. Medical schools ''do a very bad
job'' in teaching medication use, and no one requires that doctors
prove they safely prescribe to get their medical licenses renewed,
Avorn notes.
</P>
<P>
   Avorn's Harvard-affiliated hospital is pioneering programs to
teach doctors to prescribe better. Minutes after a prescription
enters the hospital's computer system, his office can page the
physician to urge a safer substitution. He also counters
pharmaceutical sales pitches by sending experts on 15-minute visits
with doctors to explain the safest use of new drugs, a program
copied in several hospitals here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can change prescribing practices,'' he concludes. But for
most doctors today, ''there's nobody coming to teach them anything
except the sales reps.''

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Backs New Russian Leader  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Mikhail Gorbachev said Monday he supports
President Vladimir Putin but warned Russia's new leader against
resorting to authoritarian methods in trying to restore stability
and the country's global clout.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by a think-tank run by Gorbachev concludes
Putin will increase government controls as he moves to fight
lawlessness and revive the country's international prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moderate authoritarianism is the most likely option,'' the
former Soviet president said at a news conference presenting the
report. ''This doesn't mean that we are embracing it, we simply
believe it to be the most probable scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian politicians and others have expressed fears that
Putin, who spent 15 years as a Soviet KGB agent, may reverse some
of the democratic reforms of the post-Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev voiced hope that Putin, elected March 26, will meet
public expectations by reviving the moribund economy and combating
rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who resigned as the last Soviet president when the
Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991, has been critical of his
longtime foe, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom he
blamed for economic failures and widespread official graft.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption accusations plagued Yeltsin's administration in its
last years, tarnishing Russia's international image and spooking
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has spoken in general terms about the need to combat
corruption, but hasn't taken a stance on the corruption allegations
against prominent members of Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made Putin his political heir when he unexpectedly
resigned Dec. 31. Putin won presidential elections March 26, with
many voters attracted by his promise to restore strong government
and restore Russia as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev said he remains concerned that Putin might overstep
the boundaries of what the report described as moderately strong
rule. ''Who can really draw the line that shows what is moderate?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, Gorbachev cited Putin's recent order to appoint
seven presidential representatives to oversee Russia's regions. The
move was seen as an attempt to tighten federal control over
Russia's far-flung provinces and limit the degree of their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Putin to clarify his intentions, saying that the
current uncertainty feeds concern. ''It all can be turned in any
direction you like,'' Gorbachev said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who is popular abroad but detested by many Russians,
warned Putin against any temptation to establish autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must dispel the myth that a strong state must be
dictatorial,'' he said. ''A strong state envisages active regional
and municipal authorities, and a free press,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 157; Nasdaq Up 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned higher today as investors
anticipated that the Federal Reserve's meeting on Tuesday will
bring the central bank close to the end of a year-long cycle of
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 157.29 at 10,766.66.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also turned higher after weakness early
in the session. The Nasdaq composite index was up 63.45 at 3,559.70
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 24.47 at 1,445.43.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was extremely light, indicating that few investors were
willing to take on major new positions. But rate-sensitive stocks
posted strong gains, buoying the Dow as investors speculated that
if the the Fed raises rates by a half-percentage point on Tuesday,
central bankers may be finished with their cycle of rate increases.
J.P. Morgan rose 1 11/16 to 132 3/16 and Home Depot rose 2 1/16 to
55 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise
interest rates for the sixth time since last June in its continuing
effort to cool the economy. Today, the Fed offered the latest
indication that the economy remains extremely robust. The Fed said
industrial production posted its biggest leap in April in more than
a year, as output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities
rose 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance was helped along by Philip Morris, which rose
2| to 26 15/16. The Wall Street Journal reported the company has
offered to buy the food business of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, International Paper rose 3 117/128 to 40}.
</P>
<P>
   While blue-chip names racked up substantial gains, the volatile
technology sector was mixed. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose
6 13/16 to 60 15/16. The Wall Street Journal reported Spain's Terra
Networks SA is in serious discussions to acquire Lycos for at least
$10 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many other high-profile technology names were lower. Cisco
Systems was down 1[ to 58 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said investors remain leery of highly-priced technology stocks in
the wake of a steep selloff in April. The Nasdaq has recovered some
of its footing, yet remains more than 30 percent below its March 10
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's widespread agreement that tech stocks will continue to
be the leaders,'' Yardeni said. But the shakeout in April forced
investors to become more discerning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq debacle has been led by tech stocks that have no
earnings and were priced off inflated revenue estimates,'' he said.
''The quality of earnings is suddenly being talked about a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 633.15 million
shares, compared with 693.28 million at the same time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.16 to 492.10.

<HEADLINE> Officials Begin IRA Weapons Mission  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The two independent statesmen
appointed to inspect secret Irish Republican Army weapons dumps
pledged Monday that they would ensure weapons revealed by the
outlawed group would never be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not underestimate the profound importance and the
unprecedented nature of the task which we have been asked to
undertake,'' said a joint statement from former Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, an African National Congress
veteran who helped topple apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The pair arrived in Belfast nine days after the outlawed IRA, in
a major breakthrough, announced it would put its weapons stockpiles
''completely and verifiably beyond use,'' a euphemism for the
gradual disarmament proposed by 1998's Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's refusal to make any disarmament commitments in
February forced Britain to withdraw powers from the province's
fledgling Catholic-Protestant administration, the intended
centerpiece of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, Ahtisaari and Ramaphosa will travel under IRA
escort to at least three hidden arms bunkers somewhere in the
neighboring Republic of Ireland. Other dumps are to be identified
and neutralized, by a method yet to be agreed, if political
progress continues elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two men promised Monday to ''regularly reinspect these dumps
to ensure that the weapons have remained secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the British and Irish governments have been
trying to build sufficient Protestant support for resuming the
power-sharing Cabinet, which includes politicians from the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
   Britain hopes to transfer considerable powers back to the
four-party coalition next week.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
must vote Saturday on whether the IRA's pledges are sufficient to
merit returning to office alongside Sinn Fein -- and a positive
verdict is by no means guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sway Protestants, Britain said Monday it would
allow the government's senior minister in Northern Ireland, Peter
Mandelson, to have the final say over whether the British flag
continues to fly over government buildings. Sinn Fein ministers had
ordered the flag removed from offices under their stewardship
during the Cabinet's brief 11 weeks in power.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also unveiled a new scholarship foundation for members
of Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force, which
is due to be reformed as part of the Good Friday package.
</P>
<P>
   However, both measures failed to address the Ulster Unionists'
fundamental demand for the police force's name, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, to be retained.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists insist that, regardless of the IRA's latest
concessions, they won't resume work alongside Sinn Fein unless
Britain drops plans to rename the force the more neutral-sounding
Police Service of Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein just as adamantly
demands the abolition of the RUC name.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the senior minister
within the suspended Cabinet, warned after meeting Ahtisaari and
Ramaphosa that he still needed to know whether the IRA ever
intended to allow its weapons to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Revealing some dumps was ''not the permanent solution,'' Trimble
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Offers Social Security Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- With the Social Security system
now as old as some retirees claiming benefits, George W. Bush today
outlined a plan that would allow workers to invest part of their
payroll taxes in private accounts. He also promised to strengthen
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential rival Al Gore said the Bush plan, while appealing
during boom times, ''would weaken our economy and undermine the
basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush did not specify how large a portion could be put in
private accounts, the most commonly discussed option is 2
percentage points of the current 12.4 percent Social Security
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also pledged to:
</P>
<P>
   --Maintain current benefits for those at or near retirement.
</P>
<P>
   --Put payroll taxes off limits to prevent borrowing against the
Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Refuse to increase the current 12.4 percent payroll tax used to
fill the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Preserve the system's current provision to pay benefits to
widows, widowers and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   --Refuse to let the government itself invest Social Security
funds, preferring instead to let individuals make the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and
me,'' the Republican presidential contender said at a senior
citizens center outside Los Angeles, alluding to Democratic Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust
individual Americans. I trust Americans to make their own decisions
and manage their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking today outside Philadelphia, said, ''If we turn
the Social Security system into a system of winners and losers, we
will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans and
in the end we will all have to pay to make up the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds
appealing,'' he said. ''But in reality the Bush Social Security
privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic
guarantee of a minimum decent retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With a reduction in the payroll tax, that money has to be made
up or unfortunately it leads to difficult trade-offs,'' said Martin
Corry, director of federal affairs for AARP, the nation's largest
organization of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   Corry said there are too few details in Bush's plan to judge it,
but noted that some lawmakers have suggested using government
surpluses to help create private accounts, which would be less of a
problem. AARP has not endorsed any Social Security reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   Employers seemed to like Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is exactly what the American workers want, a rock-solid
guaranteed benefit and a chance to own a piece of the rock,'' said
Leanne Abdnor, director of a lobbying coalition of employers,
including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Medicare, the medical insurance program for the
elderly, Bush said he would:
</P>
<P>
   --Guarantee access for all senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   --Give every recipient a choice of health plans, including a plan
providing prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   --Refuse to increase the taxes for Medicare, which is funded with
a portion of the Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   --Cover the expenses for low-income seniors.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow streamlined access to the latest medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
   --Change the way Medicare solvency is measured by analyzing both
the hospital insurance and physician insurance components of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the principles have already trickled into Bush's
stump speeches, the idea of reforming Social Security could present
one of the defining issues of the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore favors paying down the national debt and using the savings
in interest payments to shore up the existing Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, delivering his own speech Social Security
today at Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., said last week: ''Think
about what happens when that first generation of Americans retires
in a bear market. They would be left trying to live on worthless
paper and we as a nation could be left stuck with sky-high bailout
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of Social Security reform is driven by several
factors: an increase in life expectancy, the impending retirement
of the 77-million strong baby boom generation and the resulting
decline in the number of workers to support the retirees' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is funded through a ''tax-and-transfer''
method, in which benefits are paid directly with money collected
from payroll taxes. That leaves it vulnerable to a declining
workforce and an increasing number of dependents. The existing
system is now projected to become insolvent in 2037.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues that private investment accounts are a necessary and
cost-effective way to keep the system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts would face some regulation to guard against
speculation, but Bush argues that if the money is invested over
time, retirees will get the long-term benefits of compounding
interest.

<HEADLINE> European Federation Still a Dream  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It's a grand vision for a continent that gave the
last century its most horrible wars: a government uniting countries
from Britain to Germany and France to Finland, maintaining national
distinctions while operating under a federation-style political
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, being promoted anew by Germany's foreign minister,
seems like the logical end of efforts that have opened borders,
eliminated tariffs and adopted a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   But six years after the idea last sparked passionate criticism,
many skeptics remain -- indicating a United States of Europe still
has a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Even German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made a nod to the
wary in his speech promoting the idea last week -- labeling it a
''personal vision of the future'' in his address at Berlin's
Humboldt University.
</P>
<P>
   The planned expansion of the European Union ''will make a
fundamental reform of European institutions indispensable,''
Fischer said. ''How can one imagine a European Council with 30
state and government heads? Thirty presidencies? How long will a
council meeting then last? Days or even weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Questions like those, Fischer said, mean the original vision of
a united Europe from 50 years ago should be carried to its logical
end with a European Federation led by an executive branch and two
houses of legislature codified in a European constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone isn't ready to go that far right now, a ''core
group'' of countries should make the first move and the rest can
join later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me it is fully clear that Europe can only play its
appropriate role in economic and political competition when we
proceed courageously,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Splits over common European policy have been blamed by some
leaders as a reason for the weakness of the euro, leaving traders
with their heads spinning over the 11 euro countries' conflicting
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Closer cooperation would also lead to common defense and foreign
policy, enabling the EU to step out of Washington's shadow and
avoid a repeat of the recent embarrassments in the Balkans, when
the Europeans had to wait for U.S. support to act on their own
continent.
</P>
<P>
   But the response to Fischer's proposal illustrated the divisions
over where the EU is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionally euro-skeptic British tabloids criticized
Fischer's proposal as a German ''master plan'' for a ''Euro
superstate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Euro set to rob UK of self-rule, admit Germans,'' The Sun
screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians warned a two-tier system of a ''core group''
and outsiders would merely erect political walls the EU was
intended to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want a rigid system of 'ins' and 'outs' or anything
that would lead to a two-speed Europe,'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office told The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said his government
wants ''a union in which everyone is equal. We must not accept any
kind of unequal structures, however temporary in nature,'' he told
the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Even at EU central, reaction was muted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Fischer has shown a brave vision,'' Michel Barnier, EU
commissioner for institutional reform, said Monday in Brussels,
Belgium. But he noted it was a ''long-term view,'' and cautioned
that ''forging ahead'' without all EU members was ''questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Unqualified praise for Fischer's speech came from France,
Germany's traditional partner in pushing for European integration.
Italy also said countries that so wish should move forward with
closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   France's Le Monde newspaper headlined its editorial on the
speech ''Danke Schoen, M. Fischer,'' calling the federalism plan an
''ambitious vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the course of the last few years, the word (federation) has
practically become taboo, as if Europeans ... fear it will
encourage Euro-skepticism,'' the paper wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's speech will be discussed this week at a German-French
summit meeting, ahead of Paris taking over the rotating EU
presidency in July. Fischer is to join Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on a visit to the French town of Rambouillet for talks with
President Jacques Chirac and Premier Lionel Jospin, German
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ''core group'' moving ahead with faster
integration has supporters across the political spectrum in
Germany. A similar proposal was floated in 1994 by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's then-governing conservative Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is new about the ideas,'' said Christian Deubner, an
expert on European relations at Germany's prestigious Stiftung
Wissenschaft und Politik think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   He shied away from guessing when a European Federation could
become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even so, I think we are getting closer and closer to a moment
at which these kind of questions have to be taken seriously in the
sense that we have to start acting on them,'' Deubner said.

<HEADLINE> 'Friends' Is Back; 'Frasier' Moves  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is moving ''Frasier'' from Thursdays to
Tuesdays, cutting the newsmagazine ''Dateline NBC'' from five
nights to three and welcoming the man who made Jerry Seinfeld's
buddy Kramer back to TV this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which announced its fall schedule today, avoided a
big hole on Thursday nights when the six ''Friends'' actors agreed
to return for two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matt
LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer will all be paid $20
million each to film 24 episodes next year, according to an
executive close to the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity.	   NBC is
adding four new comedies and three dramas to its
schedule. It is eliminating its Saturday night lineup of dramas
''Profiler,'' ''Pretender'' and ''The Others,'' and also axing the
comedies ''Suddenly Susan,'' ''Veronica's Closet,'' ''Jesse'' and
''Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Frasier'' moves to Tuesdays at 9 p.m., back to where it spent
four years before switching, with great fanfare, to Thursday to
replace ''Seinfeld'' in 1998. The younger comedies ''Will &AMP; Grace''
and ''Just Shoot Me'' will fill the 9 p.m. hour on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dateline NBC'' has been the network's workhorse over the past
few years. But with evidence that the glut of newsmagazines is
causing audience fatigue, NBC is eliminating the Monday and
Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Michael Richards Show,'' with the actor who played
Seinfeld's sidekick, will debut on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Richards
plays an unconventional private investigator in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will be shown on Saturday nights until February, when NBC
broadcasts games from the new football league it is starting with
the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's four canceled comedies all drew tepid reviews but big
audiences when given starts on the network's powerful Thursday
schedule. This fall NBC will launch one new Thursday comedy, ''The
Steven Weber Show,'' starring the former ''Wings'' actor as an
executive whose life unravels after a blind date puts a hex on him.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is the first of seven broadcast networks to present its new
schedule to advertisers this week.
</P>
<P>
   The network set a deadline of 3 p.m. EDT on Sunday to conclude
negotiations with the ''Friends'' actors, or else promised to go
ahead without its most popular comedy. But the deal was reached
about 12 hours before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The six ''Friends'' will be paid $750,000 per episode for each
year, compared with a reported $125,000 this year. They also were
given a greater percentage of the profits from the sitcom's
lucrative syndication deals, giving them each a total of $40
million over two years, executives said Sunday. The stars had
reportedly been demanding $1 million each per episode to return -- a
sum NBC paid Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser for the final year of ''Mad
About You.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors reached the deal with Warner Bros. Television, the
studio that produces the show. It finishes its sixth season with a
one-hour special this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The five other new shows NBC will premiere in the fall:
</P>
<P>
   --''Dag,'' a comedy which stars David Alan Grier as a demoted
Secret Service agent who must guard the First Lady, played by Delta
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   --''Tucker,'' modeled after Fox's successful ''Malcolm in the
Middle,'' is a comedy about a 14-year-old boy and his newly
divorced mother who are forced to move in with her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   --''Deadline'' gives producer Dick Wolf (''Law and Order,'' ''Law
and Order: Special Victims Unit'') his third hour on NBC's
schedule. It's a drama about a columnist working on a New York City
tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   --''Titans'' is another nighttime soap opera from producer Aaron
Spelling. It centers on a 26-year-old fighter pilot who returns to
Beverly Hills to find his family torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   --''Ed'' marks the return of David Letterman to NBC -- sort of.
The drama about a New York attorney who moves back to his
Midwestern hometown comes from Letterman's production company and
was created by two ''Late Show'' producers and writers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and the WB network will announce their schedules Tuesday,
CBS and Pax TV on Wednesday, and Fox and UPN on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Ruling on Rape Suits  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   From the Supreme Court's ruling Monday that threw out
a
provision of the Violence Against Women Act that allowed rape
victims to sue their attackers in federal court:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority decision:
</P>
<P>
   Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the
phrase, economic activity... thus far in our nation's history our
cases have upheld commerce clause regulation of intrastate activity
only where that activity is economic in nature...
</P>
<P>
   If accepted, (Brzonkala's) reasoning would allow Congress to
regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of
that crime has substantial effects on employment, production,
transit or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or
any other type of violence... (and) family law and other areas of
traditional state regulation...
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
national and what is truly local... The regulation and punishment
of intrastate violence that is not directed at the
instrumentalities, channels or goods involved in interstate
commerce has always been the province of the states...
</P>
<P>
   Petitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was the victim
of a brutal assault... If the allegations here are true, no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for
the conduct of respondent (Antonio) Morrison. But under our federal
system that remedy must be provided by the commonwealth of
Virginia, and not by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From Justice David H. Souter's dissenting opinion:
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity
that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate
commerce. The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for
the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress...
</P>
<P>
   One obvious difference from (a 1995 case in which a federal
gun-possession law was struck down) is the mountain of data
assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce...
</P>
<P>
   Gender-based violence in the 1990s was shown to operate in a
manner similar to racial discrimination in the 1960s in reducing
the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of
goods shipped in interstate commerce... Violence against women may
be found to affect interstate commerce and affect it
substantially...
</P>
<P>
   Today's majority, however, finds no significance whatever in the
state support for the act based upon the states' acknowledged
failure to deal adequately with gender-based violence in state
courts, and the belief of their own law enforcement agencies that
national action is essential.

<HEADLINE> Russians Bomb Key Chechen Targets  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian bombers targeted rebels Monday in
Chechnya's southern mountains following overnight attacks on
federal posts, and Russian troops said they ambushed several
militant bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel forces shelled Russian police stations and traffic
checkpoints at least 18 times overnight, the military command said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal posts were hit in the Vedeno gorge in the east, the
Argun Gorge and the Shatoi region in the south-central mountains,
and near Nozhai-Yurt close to the border with the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan, officials said. There were also four
smaller attacks in the capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal troops were wounded and taken to a hospital in
Mozdok just west of Chechnya, but figures were not provided.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, reconnaissance planes flew over the Vedeno Gorge,
followed by attack jets that pounded the area for several hours,
the Russian command said. The rugged area is a key rebel refuge
from Russian forces, which seized lowland areas of Chechnya after
entering the rebellious republic in September.
</P>
<P>
   The military command also claimed Monday that 22 militants were
killed when Russian troops found an empty rebel camp near Gonsolchu
on Sunday. The Russians waited for militants to return to the camp,
then opened fire, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian special forces unit trapped another group of rebels in
a forest near Samashki in western Chechnya, killing 15, the
military said. And Russian ground troops combing mountain areas
during the weekend uncovered a rebel base near Shatoi, killing five
rebels, the military claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The claims could not be confirmed. Casualty figures are
difficult to verify and both sides exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an amnesty that Moscow offered to rebel fighters was
to expire Monday at midnight, after little success.
</P>
<P>
   Since the amnesty offer took effect in December, just 150 rebels
have taken advantage of the chance to turn in their weapons and be
released if Russian authorities find they have committed no serious
crimes, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most rebels have scorned the deal, and hard-line Russian
officials have criticized it as too lenient toward the militants.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
played down its limited results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amnesty has played its positive role,'' he told a news
conference. Still, he said the Kremlin ''should not be in a hurry''
to extend the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Russian forces found wreckage of an Su-24
reconnaissance jet that disappeared last week in the eastern region
of Benoi-Vedeno, the Interfax news agency quoted the air force
headquarters as saying. Officials gave no information about the
fate of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The military said the plane could have crashed because of bad
weather. The rebels say they shot it down with a shoulder-fired
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
separatist guerrillas. They went back in after Chechnya-based
militants seized villages in neighboring Dagestan, and after about
300 people died in apartment bombings blamed by the government on
Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Kids, Staff Held Hostage in Norway  </HEADLINE>
By KAARE LUNDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HJELMELAND, Norway (AP) -- A gunman barged into a preschool in
western Norway on Monday, taking 25 children and 10 staff members
hostage before agreeing to meet with a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   About seven hours into the standoff, the man released all but
five children and two adult hostages from the old, wooden
schoolhouse in Hjelmeland, a town of 2,500 people 185 miles west of
the capital, Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to release the hostage taker's name or say
anything about potential motives, although news media speculated
that one of the female hostages was somehow involved in a rape case
in which the man was a suspect. Police confirmed that the hostage
taker was armed but refused to say what kind of weapon he had.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I haven't scared anyone more than necessary,'' the
hostage taker told the husband of one hostage by telephone,
according to a report in the Internet newspaper Nettavisen. It was
the worst hostage case in this peaceful nation of 4.5 million since
1994, when an elderly couple and a police woman were taken hostage
in a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children who were released are fine, all things
considered,'' said Olav Sonderland, chief of police in Stavanger,
the region's main town.
</P>
<P>
   One of Norway's most prominent defense lawyers, Tor Erling
Staff, was allowed to try to mediate an end to the crisis after the
gunman released most of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Staff entered the preschool just after 8 p.m. for face-to-face
talks with the hostage-taker, the Norwegian news agency NTB
reported. He told NTB that he had made a proposal by telephone,
without getting much of a response. Staff refused to give any
details.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining hostages were being held inside the building,
although many of the children earlier were allowed outside in the
schoolyard. During the day, toddlers could be seen playing on
swings inside the chain-link fence that surrounded the building.
Most of the youngsters were later freed.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Anders Bang-Andersen said police quickly ruled
out any attempt to rescue the children playing outside because of
concerns the man, reported to be about 40, would become violent or
break off talks with police if they moved into the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   The man's lawyer, Odd Forsell, said his client was charged in a
rape case that goes to court this month and was involved in a child
custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the moment, I can't see that either the child custody or
the rape case have anything to do with this situation,'' Forsell
was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
   The man stormed into the school at about 11 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they knew something was wrong when they
called the city-run school at 11:30 a.m. and a man answered the
phone and hung up. No men work at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tragedy for a small, quiet and peaceful township like
Hjelmeland,'' city manager Fred Johansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonderland said it would be tragedy anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using children for something like this, in Norway or anywhere
else, is a very serious matter ... these are children who are under
age 6,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Inspector General criticizes furniture sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An Assemblyman may have violated New York's
Public Officers Law by selling furniture to a state agency through
a business co-owned with his wife, according to an inspector
general's report.
</P>
<P>
   The state Inspector General investigated the no-bid sales of
$30,507 worth of items to the state Office of Mental Retardation
and Developmental Disabilities from a Chenango County furniture
store co-owned by Republican Assemblyman Clifford Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch is a member of the Assembly Mental Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, elected officials cannot sell anything to a
state agency worth more than $25 unless the purchase goes out to
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Two OMRDD employees made 31 purchases for agency facilities from
December 1997 to February 1999 at Country Settings, which is owned
by Crouch and his wife, Barbara, according to the report. The
report concluded that the two employees made the purchases ''in a
manner intended to avoid proper oversight and in apparent violation
of state procurement rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That these purchases were made at Country Settings, a retail
establishment owned by an assemblyman who serves on a committee
affecting OMRDD issues, created the appearance of a conflict of
interest,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The IG's report said that as the sales appear to violate Public
Officers Law, it was forwarded to the Legislative Ethics
Commission. The commission can impose civil fines and refer matters
for criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch did not return a call to his office seeking comment. He
told investigators that he did not know OMRDD was a customer. He
said his involvement in the business is limited to helping with the
payroll and occasional deliveries.

<HEADLINE> Rain Outlook Sinks Grains, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures sank Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by rainy weather forecasts that
bode well for newly planted crops but not for prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both corn and soybeans fell about 3 percent in a decline that
was even steeper until a new long-range forecast for a dry summer
revived drought fears and pumped up prices late in the trading day.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans posted their lowest price for the near-term contract in
two weeks. Predictions of midweek rains in the Midwest prompted the
dive immediately after the session's opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   Additional pressure came from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's supply-demand report for May, which projected large
stockpiles of soybeans at the end of the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also benefited from a two-week forecast calling for
favorable conditions for Midwestern crops.
</P>
<P>
   The market for both farm commodities rebounded late in the day
after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration signaled
that dry conditions would continue in June, July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat fell and rose again along with soybeans and corn, only
less sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.82\ a bushel; July
corn fell 7 cents to $2.38} a bushel; July oats fell 2{ cents to
$1.19} a bushel; July soybeans fell 16 cents to $5.49} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures settled sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle were unchanged at 67.92 cents a pound; August
feeder rose 0.35 cent to 83.95 cents a pound; June lean hogs fell 2
cents to 70.85 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 2.95 cents to
86.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> UN Polio Campaign Suffers Setbacks  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Wars, a vaccine shortage, and logistical problems
have set back a campaign to eradicate polio, but the dreaded
disease should be wiped out by 2005, the World Health Organization
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign begun in 1998, WHO set a goal of certifying the
last transmission of polio by the end of 2000, with the whole world
declared polio-free five years later.
</P>
<P>
   However, WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said Monday
at the annual meeting of the agency's governing body that the
organization would fail to stop polio infection by the end of this
year. WHO includes 191 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these factors mean that a year from now the wild virus
will still be infecting children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Hemisphere has been certified polio-free since 1994.
But up to 20 other countries are likely to still have the virus in
circulation at the end of this year, said a joint statement by WHO,
Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The countries weren't listed, but Brundtland said there were
predictions of ''a high risk of continued polio transmission at the
end of the year in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian
subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   To declare the world polio-free in 2005, Brundtland said efforts
must be redoubled, with commitments from manufacturers to assure
supplies of vaccine and promises from warring factions to allow
immunization of every child.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland also said ''the tide is turning'' in efforts to
provide AIDS drugs to Africans. Brundtland welcomed the move last
week by five pharmaceutical companies to slash the cost of such
drugs in Africa, but said more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of drugs remains a crucial issue for combatting disease
in poor countries, Brundtland said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot accept that important drugs -- which have been
discovered, produced and made available -- can only be used by a
fortunate few. We cannot accept that for the millions who need them
most, they might as well be on another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland said other steps are being taken to improve health in
developing countries by combatting malaria and tuberculosis,
providing more vaccines and making pregnancy safer.
</P>
<P>
   She appealed to delegates to the assembly to back a ban on
advertising tobacco products ''because it is absolutely right. It
has been proven again and again that it makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is not on our side,'' Brundtland said. ''Do not allow any
extra millions to be added to the death row of tobacco.''

<HEADLINE> Pressure on Fed for Higher Rates  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worried that a booming economy is about to
spawn inflation troubles, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday will
administer double its normal dose of interest rate medicine, many
economists are predicting.
</P>
<P>
   They expect the central bank to boost a key interest rate by
one-half percentage point, instead of the usual quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed's view is that they really have to get serious about
hiking rates,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the newfound urgency is a string of economic
reports showing the economy is zooming ahead despite widespread
predictions of a slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has fallen below 4 percent for the first time in 30
years, economic growth from January through March came in at a
sizzling 5.4 percent rate and just Monday, the government reported
that industrial production in April soared by 0.9 percent, the
strongest advance in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the strength, economists have been busily
revising their forecasts for this year. The National Association
for Business Economics now expects the gross domestic product to
increase by a remarkable 4.9 percent this year, which would be the
fastest growth rate so far in this nine-year expansion, the longest
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery has managed to last so long because inflation has
been dormant, allowing the central bank to let the good times roll
without having to worry too much about cooling things off with
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications that inflation pressures are beginning
to mount. A measure of wages and benefits increased in the year's
first three months at the fastest pace in eight years, seemingly a
confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's repeated
worries that tight labor markets will eventually translate into
inflationary wage demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The free lunch we have enjoyed with inflation is clearly
over,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One Corp. in
Chicago. ''We now have growth with a price, rising inflation and
rising interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   This combination of continued strong growth and the first signs
of inflation are leading analysts to predict that the Fed will
boost the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each
other, by a half-point to 6.5 percent. The Fed starting last June
30 has increased the funds rate from 4.75 percent to 6 percent
currently.
</P>
<P>
   A half-point increase would be immediately translated into a
similar rise in commercial banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark
for millions of consumer and business loans. It now stands at 9
percent and at 9.5 percent would be at its highest level in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   A minority of economists believe the Fed will stick with its
incremental quarter-point increases on Tuesday, arguing that
anything larger could jolt investors not only in the United States
but in countries still trying to emerge from the global financial
crisis of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having overseen the greatest economic expansion in history,
Fed Chairman Greenspan isn't about to jeopardize an impressive
record by sending panic through financial markets with a disruptive
and maybe unnecessary bold move,'' said Richard Yamarone, economist
at Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the half-point camp said they believe some recent
dips in U.S. stock prices reflected investors pricing in a
half-point Fed rate increase and anything smaller could trigger a
market rally, something the Fed would not want to see, given that
rising stock prices have fueled the consumer spending boom the Fed
is trying to dampen.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe Tuesday's expected half-point increase
will be followed by a similarly large boost at the Fed's next
meeting on June 27-28. They then expect the central bank to take a
breather to see whether its yearlong credit tightening will have
the desired effect of engineering another soft landing in which
growth slows enough to control inflation but not enough to trigger
a recession.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Greenspan and his colleagues would be repeating a
feat they last accomplished in 1994-95, when seven rate boosts
slowed the economy and kept the current expansion alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is always the risk that the Fed could go too far, but
there is so much momentum in the economy right now that we don't
see them tightening enough to trigger a downturn,'' said David
Wyss, senior economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI.

<HEADLINE> Israel OKs Handover of Villages  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's parliament on Monday approved turning
over three Arab villages next to Jerusalem to the Palestinians, but
the vote showed how shaky Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition is
on peace issues.
</P>
<P>
   The majority was obtained only because ministers and deputy
ministers from two parties in Barak's coalition stayed away instead
of voting against the measure, which passed 56-48, with one
abstention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, members of three parties representing Israel's Arab
minority and two other left-leaning parties outside Barak's
coalition voted in favor, compensating for his lack of support from
coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is hoping to recreate this ad hoc peace team in future
votes, but if his coalition crumbles, he might be forced to call
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to violent Palestinian demonstrations and exchanges of
gunfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police as the
parliament debate was in progress, Barak said it showed the way to
peace is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration in downtown Jerusalem, opposition leader
Ariel Sharon charged that Israel's government is allowing the
Palestinians to lay siege to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of opponents of the government's peace moves carried
signs opposing handing territory to the Palestinians. Most of the
demonstrators were teen-agers. Gila Nizri, 15, from Petah Tikva,
outside Tel Aviv, said, ''Every time they give away a little more,
and in the end there will be nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy announced the vote in parliament
to the crowd, which responded with boos. Levy said he would take
his National Religious Party out of Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-compromise Peace Now group counter-demonstrated by
projecting a laser image of assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin on a wall overlooking the demonstration. In 1995, Rabin was
killed by an Israeli extremist opposed to his peace moves. Police
stopped the projection.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Barak's Cabinet approved the transfer of Abu Dis and
two other villages next to Jerusalem to full Palestinian control.
Up to now they have been in a zone where Israel and Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority share responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing parliament, Barak warned that absence of an agreement
would lead to ''Belfast or Bosnia, an interminable, bloody
conflict, with much bloodshed on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the National Religious Party, two other members of
Barak's coalition opposed the handover of the villages, but angled
to stay in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, the second-largest party in Barak's coalition, has
withheld support for peace moves, demanding money for its bankrupt
school system. Six Shas ministers and deputies absented themselves
from the vote, while ten other Shas members of parliament voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, head of the Israel
B'Aliya party, stayed away while his three members voted against.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver of ministers and deputies skipping the vote allows
their parties to stay in the coalition. If they had voted against,
Barak could have ordered them out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the step-by-step approach to Israel-Palestinian
peacemaking started in 1993, the Palestinians gradually gain
control of most of the West Bank. At the same time, the two sides
are to negotiate a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Barak's policy say the Palestinians have not
fulfilled their part and are allowing armed elements to plan and
carry out attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   They charged that Arafat was responsible for the violence
Monday, when Palestinians marked the anniversary of the 1948
creation of the state of Israel, which they call ''Al Naqba,'' the
catastrophe.

<HEADLINE> Putin Foe Wins St. Petersburg Vote  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTINA SHEVORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- The main liberal candidate for
governor of St. Petersburg said Monday he was preparing a court
challenge to the election results after the incumbent -- a longtime
foe of President Vladimir Putin -- scored a lopsided victory.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Yakovlev received 73 percent to Igor Artemyev's 15
percent in unofficial returns from Sunday's voting, with 100
percent of polling stations reporting, election officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote followed an election campaign marked by accusations of
dirty tricks and the incumbent's alleged ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Artemyev said slow reporting of results overnight made him
suspect ballot-box stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are dealing with open fraud which must be investigated,''
Artemyev said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev didn't address Artemyev's accusations, saying he was
''pleased but not surprised'' at the results giving him a second
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to work for the good of the city,'' he said.
''There is a lot we can do together.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a St. Petersburg native who was a top aide to Yakovlev's
rival and predecessor Anatoly Sobchak, carefully congratulated the
incumbent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trust placed in you is not only a high evaluation of your
work, but also of people's hopes for positive changes in St.
Petersburg,'' Putin said in a statement. ''I strongly believe that
professionalism, experience and a demanding attitude toward work
will allow you to successfully solve the problems of Russia's
northern capital.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Artemyev, a former city financial official,
accused Yakovlev of ties to underworld figures and blamed him for
St. Petersburg's reputation as Russia's organized crime capital.
Organized crime is a major problem in Russia, with gangs extorting
money from private companies and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sovershenno Sekretno, a national magazine, produced a special
St. Petersburg edition earlier this month accusing Yakovlev of ties
to organized crime. Police confiscated thousands of copies, which
were distributed free through mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg has been the scene of a rash of mob-style
killings of political and business figures. A member of the city
legislature, Yuri Shutov, is in jail on charges of ordering seven
contract killings, and prosecutors have described him as the head
of an organized crime group.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev denies the allegations of links to organized crime and
bills himself as a strong manager. As an example, he points to the
city's newly built hockey stadium, site of the world championships
which ended on Sunday.

   Elvia Cortez, 53, was ''practically decapitated,'' when a
3-inch-thick circular tube containing explosives went off around
her neck, army Lt. Col. Fabio Roa said. The explosion occurred by a
rural highway outside this town in central Boyaca State.
</P>
<P>
   Just before dawn, four men burst into her home on a farm outside
town, placed the collar around her neck, and told her they would
detonate it at 3 p.m. if she failed to pay them $7,500, Roa said.
The four men then left.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called, drove Mrs. Cortez to the side of a nearby
highway flanked by cow pastures, and began trying to deactivate the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A technician was working on the explosive-packed collar when the
device went off at about 1 p.m, Roa said.
</P>
<P>
   The technician lost his left arm, one soldier lost three
fingers, another part of his forearm, and another suffered cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Mrs. Cortez were present when the collar
exploded, and were seen afterwards in tears. She was the mother of
four children.
</P>
<P>
   Roa said the assailants were probably from the country's largest
rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
The group finances itself in part through kidnappings and armed
extortion, and sometimes kills those who refuse to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Common criminals also kidnap and extort people for money in the
South American country.

<HEADLINE> United Cancels 57 More Flights  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines canceled 57 additional flights
Monday, 40 because of bad weather and the rest due to a continuing
shortage of pilots at the world's largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the weather-related cancellations resulted from poor
visibility conditions along parts of the West Coast, airline
spokesman Joe Hopkins said. A storm system was bringing
thunderstorms to northern California, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue during a series of cancellations in recent days is
United's crew-staffing policies. Some pilots have declined to work
overtime, upset at what they say is the airline's failure to hire
more pilots, according to the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, pilot shortages and bad weather resulted in the
cancellation of 108 of United's 2,400 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Herb Hunter, a United pilot, denied any job
action was being encouraged by the union and said pilots are not
refusing regular assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's calling in sick. Nobody's not doing their job,''
Hunter said Monday. ''We've advised the company over the last six
to nine months that we're going to be short of pilots ... and now
it is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot criticized as ''not a wise strategy'' United's
practice of counting on pilots to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   United's Hopkins said the policy has worked -- until pilots began
refusing overtime after their contract status changed on April 12,
when an employee stock-option plan expired. The airline is beefing
up its force of 10,000 pilots and cutting its schedule back
accordingly by canceling some flights, he said. Customers are
notified ahead of time and United tries to assist with their plans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''United and its pilots are not in a labor dispute and pilots
continue to fly their assigned flights,'' Hopkins emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   United, which is 55 percent employee-owned, and the pilots
submitted their contract standoff to federal mediation last month
when the airline's employee stock-option plan ran out. Pilots'
wages were linked closely to that plan because they agreed to lower
salaries in 1994 when it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are now seeking sharply higher pay in addition to other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   United has declined to discuss specifics of contract talks, the
latest round of which reportedly was taking place Monday in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, airline contracts do not expire and most
airline workers are prohibited from striking unless they receive
permission from the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
   While the law allows airline employees to picket, union
spokesman Hunter said there are no plans for United pilots to do so
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said it is not unusual for airline contract to take a
year or two to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said United wants to reach agreement as quickly as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Ethiopians Demonstrate  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Tens of thousands of Ethiopians vented
their anger Monday against a U.N. resolution threatening sanctions
if Ethiopia and Eritrea don't end the latest round of fighting in
their two-year border war.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came as an Ethiopian offensive rolled across the
northern Badme front into Eritrea, its much smaller neighbor in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, well-coordinated demonstrators, including groups
of schoolchildren, men on horseback and priests from the Ethiopian
Orthodox Church, marched in Meskel Square. Many carried banners in
English and Amharic warning the United Nations not to repeat an
arms embargo imposed by its precursor, the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 the League imposed sanctions against Italy and Ethiopia,
then known as Abyssinia, after Italy invaded. At that time,
Ethiopia was the only independent nation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council prepared to discuss how
to ensure compliance with the resolution calling for ''immediate
steps'' if the two countries don't stop fighting by Tuesday and
resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   A British diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Britain planned to introduce another resolution calling for an arms
embargo on both impoverished countries, which have already spent
millions of dollars obtaining weapons and warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they have appealed to international donors for
help in dealing with widespread hunger in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The war is ostensibly about the two nations' poorly demarcated
border. But observers say it is driven as much as anything by the
rivalry between Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki. Eritrea, once a province of Ethiopia,
gained its independence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A military analyst, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it appeared that Ethiopia clearly had the upper hand and had
broken through Eritrean defenses in the northern Badme front along
the disputed 620-mile border as well as at Zalambessa, 255 miles
northwest of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said Ethiopian aircraft were supporting the infantry
offensive, which he called much bigger than the one in February
1999 when Ethiopia retook Badme with thousands of casualties on
both sides. The war was sparked by Eritrea's seizure of Badme, 400
miles north of Addis Ababa, in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital, Asmara, government spokesman Yemane
Gebremeskel said Eritrean forces shot down an Ethiopian SU-27 jet
fighter and a Mi-24 helicopter gunship during what he called
''extremely heavy fighting'' at the Mereb-Setit front, the Eritrean
name for the Badme region.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to disclose Eritrean casualties in the four days of
fighting since the Ethiopians launched their offensive on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous attempts at shuttle diplomacy by U.S. and U.N.
diplomats, there have never been face-to-face talks between the two
belligerents. The closest they got was separate rooms last month in
Algiers for ''proximity talks,'' which collapsed over disagreement
on implementing a peace agreement drawn up by the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have accepted the blueprint. But Eritrea wants a
cease-fire first, which would include a pullback by both sides and
a U.N.-supervised demarcation of the border that has separated the
two countries since Eritrea gained independence. Ethiopia wants the
implementation first and says Eritrea's position amounts to
''setting preconditions.''

<HEADLINE> Rail Suspect's Jail Mate Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A former prison mate of Texas Railroad Killer
Angel Maturino Resendiz testified Monday that they worked together
coaching inmates on using insanity claims to overturn sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mitchell Rollins, 43, said he worked with Maturino
Resendiz in the law library at the Marianna Federal Correctional
Institute in Florida for about 16 months, starting in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ordered some books and read up on it,'' said Rollins, who
noted that the defendant helped him file his own incompetence
brief.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity in the 1998 slaying of Houston-area physician Claudia
Benton, one of nine killings he acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins, a bank robber serving a 25-year sentence, was called to
the stand by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins conceded under cross-examination that the writs he and
Maturino Resendiz helped file were little more than
fill-in-the-blank forms.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, a Mexican citizen, was serving a 2{-year
sentence for illegal re-entry into the United States when he met
Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution began calling rebuttal witnesses Monday
following four days of defense testimony, including two psychiatric
experts who said delusions stirred by paranoid schizophrenia caused
the defendant to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz is on trial only for the rape, stabbing and
bludgeoning death of Benton. Lawyers believe he killed six people
in Texas, two more in Illinois and on in Kentucky from 1997 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
   If found innocent, Maturino Resendiz would probably be sent to a
mental hospital for an undetermined time and still would face at
least six more capital murder cases. A guilty verdict would mean
either lethal injection or life in prison, with no chance of parole
for 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Teen Driver Crashes, Kills Girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager too young to hold a
driver's license was fleeing from police when he crashed his
parents' car through a drainage ditch and sent it airborne into a
swimming pool, killing a 12-year-old passenger, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were investigating a report of a suspicious car at 2:30
a.m. Sunday when they spotted the sedan with Michael Singh, 14, at
the wheel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the car sped away, but officers didn't chase it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect that when he saw the police car in back of him that
he panicked because he had no license and did not have
authorization to have the car,'' police spokesman Chuck Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The car went through a stop sign, careened through a vacant lot
and crashed into a 50-foot wide drainage ditch, which sent the car
over a fence and into a swimming pool, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaily Pittman, 12, was thrown from the car and died at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and sisters Jeanna Collins, 15, and Carly Ann Collins, 12,
were pulled from the car and were being treated for undisclosed
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, teen-agers must be 15 before they can get a driver's
license, and 15-year-olds are allowed to drive only with an adult
in the front seat.

<HEADLINE> Man Releases Hostages in Norway  </HEADLINE>
By KAARE LUNDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HJELMELAND, Norway (AP) -- A man who took 25 children and 10
staff hostage at a Norwegian nursery school surrendered today,
releasing all the hostages unharmed after 10 hours, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified gunman surrendered after meeting with a
well-known criminal defense lawyer and speaking on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who said he had taken hostages because he had been
denied the right to see his own child, was driven away in a police
car with his attorney. The schoolhouse is located in Hjelmeland, a
town of about 2,500 people some 185 miles west of the capital,
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Police and ambulance crews immediately moved in to get the five
children and two female staff that had remained trapped by the man
after he released 28 others earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting here knowing that my first teen-ager just turned
13 in May, and I'm not even allowed to call,'' the man said in a
telephone call broadcast live by the TV-2 network before he
surrendered. ''Many would kill themselves because they couldn't
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to release the hostage taker's name or say
anything about potential motives, although news media speculated
that one of the female hostages was somehow involved in a rape case
in which the man was a suspect. Police confirmed that the hostage
taker was armed but refused to say what kind of weapon he had.
</P>
<P>
   The man had called the television station and demanded the right
to hold a news conference to present his side of a child custody
case. He lost the right to see his children because he had been
charged with rape, the network reported. TV-2 said he had also been
in contact with the station before the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His desperation resulted in the worst hostage case in this
peaceful nation of 4.5 million since 1994, when an elderly couple
and a police woman were taken hostage in a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing to lose. I have several times had a rope around
my neck,'' he said in the telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone call was broadcast on the Sentrum news show along
with a televised panel of psychologists and experts who listened in
and urged the man to think things through and not make good on his
threat to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining hostages were being held inside the building,
although many of the children earlier were allowed outside in the
schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   One of Norway's best known criminal lawyers, Tor Erling Staff,
who was mediating at the hostage-taker's request, had also entered
the building for face to face talks with the hostage-taker, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. Staff told NTB that he had made
a proposal by telephone, with getting much of a response. He
refused to give any details about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The man stormed into the school at about 11 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they knew something was wrong when they
called the city-run school at 11:30 a.m. and a man answered the
phone and hung up. No men work at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a tragedy for a small, quiet and peaceful township like
Hjelmeland,'' city manager Fred Johansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonderland said it would be tragedy anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using children for something like this, in Norway or anywhere
else, is a very serious matter ... these are children who are under
age 6,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Reps. Await Giuliani Decision  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a safe bet that no one is watching the
Rudolph Giuliani drama more intently than officials at the House
Republican and Democratic campaign committees.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the mayor to drop out would likely prompt at least
one, and possibly more, GOP House members to give up relatively
safe seats in order to run for the Senate. And that's a prospect
that Democrats relish as they labor to win a majority in the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Rick Lazio and Peter King, who represent adjoining Long
Island districts, have made clear their interest in the Senate
seat. The name of Rep. Jack Quinn, who represents an area around
Buffalo, has also surfaced, although an aide to Quinn said Monday
the lawmaker has ''pretty well taken himself out'' of the race. He
would reconsider, the aide said, if the party turned to him.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see the potential for political gain. ''When three of
their top candidates are all incumbent House Republicans sitting in
competitive seats, it exacerbates their open seat problem,''
Democratic campaign spokesman Erik Smith said of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilkinson, spokesman for the Republican House campaign
committee, says, ''as far as we're concerned Giuliani is still
running and that's the way we like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican retirees in the House total 23 thus far this year,
compared with only seven Democrats. Republicans and Democrats agree
on one fact: open seats generally require more money and resources
from the national party than a district where an incumbent brings a
political organization and fund-raising base to the race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio won his seat in 1992 by defeating a Democratic veteran
enmeshed in a House bank scandal. He has been safe since, but
Democrats claim that several local office holders would be
interested in running if the seat became open.
</P>
<P>
   King's district has been in Republican hands for years, although
President Clinton carried it in both his White House elections.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's seat would be toughest for Republicans to hold. He
replaced a Democrat who retired in 1992, and strong ties with
organized labor have helped him stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   ----------
</P>
<P>
   The first general election television commercial of the
congressional campaign is on the air, courtesy of Republican Rep.
Jim Rogan, an extraordinarily early advertising debut that
underscores the difficult challenge he faces in California.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rogan says the commercial is slated to run for
two weeks for a total cost of $80,000 on five cable television
channels in the congressional district around Los Angeles. It slams
Rogan's opponent, state Sen. Adam Schiff, as a supporter of HMO
legislation that will earn ''millions for the trial and personal
injury lawyers'' who donate money to his campaign at the same time
it will ''raise health insurance premiums'' for working families.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Jason Roe, said the ad was launched because
Schiff concentrates on local issues, and ''we want to begin to at
least engage'' him on health care, Social Security and other
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal to the commercial, spokesman Parke Skelton said
Schiff supports the patients' bill of rights legislation backed by
the White House and that cleared the House on a bipartisan vote. In
contrast, he said, Rogan voted for ''two sham bills sponsored by
the HMO lobby.'' The advertising ''smacks of desperation,'' Skelton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the terrain that I think he should choose to conduct
his campaign on ... unless he felt he had to redefine'' his
position, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, seeking his third term in office, was outpolled by Schiff
in the state's open primary in March, a dangerous sign for an
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ----------
</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful members of the House has drawn a free
re-election pass from the Democrats -- for the second straight time.
Florida Rep. C. W. (Bill) Young, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, drew only minor party opposition when the filing
deadline passed in his state recently. He's held his seat around
St. Petersburg since 1970, and won 67 percent of the vote the last
time he faced a Democratic challenge, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Florida Republicans also escaped Democratic
challenges. They are Reps. Joe Scarborough; Clifford Stearns;
Michael Bilirakis; Porter Goss; Ileana Ros-Lehtinen; and Lincoln
Diaz-Balart.
</P>
<P>
   Three Florida Democrats will win new terms unopposed by the GOP.
They are Reps. Jim Davis; Carrie Meek; and Peter Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, 25 Republicans are without Democratic challengers in
states where filing deadlines have passed, and 21 Democrats have
escaped GOP opposition.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters' Kin May Not Get Funds  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Touched by the deaths of six Worcester
firefighters in a warehouse blaze last year, tens of thousands of
people gave at least $8.5 million to a variety of funds to help the
dead men's families.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears the families may never see some of that money.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund's organizers study the complex federal tax rules
governing money collected by nonprofit organizations, the families
haven't yet seen a penny of the donations in the largest fund,
which has grown to $6.4 million since the Dec. 3 fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community, and that includes us, wants this money to go to
the families,'' said Thomas Cole, a spokesman for the Telegram &AMP;
Gazette of Worcester, which set up the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ''The amount of money raised exceeded any
expectation that we had. And it may well exceed the amount the IRS
would allow to be distributed directly to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is working with tax advisers, state regulators,
the Internal Revenue Service and representatives of the families to
try to clear the legal hurdles and get the money to the families,
Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters died after two of them became lost in a burning
warehouse while looking for homeless people they thought may be
inside. Four more firefighters went in to find them, and they all
perished.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst loss of life among firefighters from a building
fire in America in more than 20 years. President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore joined 40,000 mourners at the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen children were left fatherless.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges offered free tuition. A rock band offered to play a
benefit. Residents of nursing homes collected donations from
visitors. A baseball team contributed money from ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Relief funds were set up to collect donations, including the
Fallen Firefighters Fund of Worcester, managed by the city
firefighters' credit union. It received nearly 20,000 contributions
and already has distributed more than $2 million to the families. A
Salvation Army fund also collected $171,000, which will soon be
given to the families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected some donations, but the outpouring was remarkable.
People from all over the world donated,'' said Deputy Fire Chief
Gerard Dio, treasurer-manager of the credit union.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the largest fund, according to experts, is the
rules that govern it because it was set up as a nonprofit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed those who donated to make tax-deductible
contributions, making it more attractive to businesses. But it also
placed the fund under the restrictions of the IRS, unlike the
credit union fund, which could simply give out the money. The
newspaper fund took in 43,000 donations.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Tesdahl, a Washington attorney specializing in nonprofit
law, said disbursing money from a nonprofit fund is tricky. The law
is designed to ensure such organizations, in exchange for favorable
tax treatment, help a large segment of the community and not just a
small, specific group.
</P>
<P>
   He said generally the IRS wants the nonprofit to determine the
need of the recipients and release money based on that need.
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point, once their need is fulfilled, you don't just
keep dumping the money on them and make them rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said: ''If the board of this fund believed that
these families needed and deserved $6.4 million, that's
theoretically permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that such funds have faced challenges:
The Denver-based Mile High United Way distributed $4.6 million
after the Columbine High School shootings. United Way spokeswoman
Kelly Cahill said that, after weighing the needs of victims and
donors' intent, $3 million went to victims and the remainder went
to community programs and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegram &AMP; Gazette said it will set up a community board
independent of the paper to make decisions about how to give out
the money. The newspaper hopes to begin distribution in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want to do is alleviate the distress of the families,
provide for their future security, meet their needs, before any
other purposes are considered,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   He said if all the money can't go to the relatives, some might
be used for a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Family members did not respond to a letter requesting comment.

<HEADLINE> Obstacles Surface in Colombia Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PABLO, Colombia (AP) -- The paramilitary commander calmly but
vividly recounted how his men fought and massacred their way into
this strategic northern region, for decades a stronghold of rival
leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people ran frantically, shouting, throwing themselves into
rivers,'' said the mustached officer in green fatigues, his
Czech-made AK-47 assault rifle slung on a post that also supported
a saddle and a brightly colored hammock. ''The guerrillas had
confused them, told them we were a bunch of bloodthirsty savages.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Alarcon, a 12-year veteran of the nationwide rightist
militia army known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,
was friendly in the interview at a cattle ranch a two-hour bumpy
drive from this town on the muddy Magdalena River.
</P>
<P>
   But something weighed on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after taking this region rich in oil, gold and
cocaine, Alarcon is cool to a proposal by President Andres Pastrana
that would hand it back to the leftists without so much as a
skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are willing to cooperate in the peace process,'' he said.
''But the thing is, we cannot accept handing back to the guerrillas
something which does not belong to them and which they have already
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pastrana announced a plan to turn greater San Pablo
and two neighboring counties along Colombia's main river into a
guerrilla safe haven and venue for future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   However, potentially fatal obstacles stand in the way of the
initiative, whose start date is still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's concession to the leftist National Liberation Army,
or ELN, heartened many Colombians hoping for an end to a campaign
of bombings and kidnappings that the rebels waged to force Pastrana
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has also sparked angry opposition from locals who
have become accustomed to -- if not exactly enthralled with -- their
rightist occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   People fear reprisals and strong-arm guerrilla rule should the
ELN, the country's second-biggest rebel army, come back from the
nearby San Lucas mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of peasants and shopkeepers joined protests in and
around the 1,800-square-mile region last week, including rallies,
sit-ins at government offices and highway and river blockades.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the verge of civil war,'' said Jairo Orozco, an
organizer of a new grass-roots protest movement that claims to be
independent but supportive of the right-wing paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under a scorching sun in San Pablo's town square, Orozco urged
people to take up arms if necessary. A placard in the crowd of 500
people read: ''Mr. Pastrana, what authority do you have to play
with our lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Looming darkly in people's minds is a huge demilitarized zone
already ceded to Colombia's largest left-wing rebel movement, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana evacuated his security forces from a 16,000-square-mile
southern ranching area 17 months ago to spur peace talks with the
group, known as the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   While those talks move glacially, the FARC is allegedly using
the sanctuary to rustle cattle, appropriate land, forcibly recruit
teen-age fighters and plunge deeper into the lucrative cocaine
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has pledged tighter controls in the north, including
international observers and naval patrols along the Magdalena
River. The ELN has promised better behavior than the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between the FARC's sparsely
inhabited southern haven and this volatile region in the north
where the ELN, FARC and paramilitaries are all active and where a
refinery produces 75 percent of Colombia's gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the bellybutton of Colombia,'' said Monsignor Jaime
Prieto, the Roman Catholic bishop of Barrancabermeja, site of the
state-owned refinery and the commercial hub of the region that
includes San Pablo, Cantagallo and Yondo.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing upon -- and some say instigating -- the swelling
opposition to Pastrana's plan is Carlos Castano, national leader of
the 7,000-man rightist militia forces and son of a rancher slain by
the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Castano, known principally as a purveyor of
violence, has seized the opportunity to try to build a political
following while forging a new image as peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Castano gained this territory through war, and now he wants to
show that he's politically powerful, too,'' said the Rev. Francisco
D'Roux, a Jesuit peace activist in Barrancabermeja.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Castano announced he would respect
Pastrana's plan if the ELN ceased military actions nationwide
during the nine-month trial period the president has proposed. The
rebels have not replied.
</P>
<P>
   And many believe Castano's true price for cooperating is a place
in the talks for himself -- something the guerrillas oppose and
Pastrana has ruled out for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Castano's men stand ready to carry out any order he
hands down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to support the people to the ultimate
consequences,'' said Alarcon, the regional paramilitary chief, who
says he commands several 320-man units. ''Our movement is growing
every day.''

<HEADLINE> Yemen Divided Over 'Gender' Fight  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- The women's studies program at San'a
University has been shut down and its director has fled the
country, leaving students in limbo. And all over a word -- gender.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim clergymen and some of the university's professors insist
''gender'' is an English word -- with no Arabic equivalent -- that
was being used at the women's institute as part of a conspiracy by
Westerners to bring in homosexuality and sexual freedom for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other professors and students say the controversy was
deliberately ignited by conservatives because they don't want to
have institutions in Yemen that spread liberal ideas like equality
between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real reason for the center's closure is political. The
Islamists didn't want it,'' said Fatima Jubran, 35, who was
studying for a master's degree at the women's program.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the conservatives won. The Empirical Research and
Women Studies Center has been closed since October while the
university revises the program's curriculum and looks for a new
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Mansour al-Zindani, a political science professor at the
university who pushed for the closure, said the Dutch-financed
center -- one of the most active women's institutes in Yemen --
''provoked this conservative Yemeni society by using 'gender' over
and over in its publications.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every educated person knows that gender is a vague word that
some may interpret as kind, others as same-sex relationships and
some as equality of men and women,'' said al-Zindani, who's also a
high-ranking member of the Islamic Islah Party.
</P>
<P>
   The professor's brother, Sheik Abdul-Majeed al-Zindani, is a
well-known radical within the Islah party and heads its
policy-making Shura council.
</P>
<P>
   Many defend the women's studies program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The center was established to help in women's development and
look into women's issues through research and studies. There was
nothing immoral or decadent about its activities,'' said Mohammed
Ba Obeid, a professor of psychology at San'a University who also
taught at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Raoufa Hassan, director of the four-year-old center, went to the
Netherlands after mosque preachers denounced her as immoral. Some
100 male and female students preparing for one-year diplomas and
master's degrees in women's studies are left waiting while the
university examines the center's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   As the university deals with the controversy, tapes of rousing
mosque sermons denouncing the ''genderites'' at the center can be
found at stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an evil conspiracy under way. It's the gender
conspiracy,'' Sheik Mohammed al-Unsi says on one tape. ''Gender is
total decadence, meaning families constituting of men married to
men or women married to women. It also means that a woman can offer
herself to any man she fancies.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Swaps 'Frasier,''Will &AMP; Grace'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is shifting ''Frasier'' to Tuesdays in the
fall, cutting back ''Dateline NBC'' to three nights and hoping to
resurrect the genre of nighttime soap operas with the man who made
''Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The network, which announced its fall schedule on Monday, will
put the actor who played Jerry Seinfeld's buddy Kramer back on TV
but had bad news for Jerry's old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The seven broadcast networks present their schedules to
advertisers this week, with ABC and the WB network Tuesday, CBS and
Pax TV on Wednesday, and Fox and UPN on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is adding four new comedies and three dramas to its
schedule. It is eliminating its Saturday night lineup of dramas --
''Profiler,'' ''Pretender'' and ''The Others'' -- and axing the
comedies ''Suddenly Susan,'' ''Veronica's Closet,'' ''Jesse'' and
''Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The network avoided a major problem when the six actors on
''Friends'' agreed this weekend to two more seasons at $20 million
a year each. Some other popular NBC shows, including ''ER,'' ''Law
and Order'' and ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' have multi-year commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Its boldest schedule move was bumping ''Frasier'' from the
popular Thursday lineup to Tuesday and replacing it with ''Will &AMP;
Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC expects ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' entering its third season, to have
a longer future and believes the best way to attack ABC's ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is by appealing to a younger audience,
said Garth Ancier, NBC entertainment president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dateline NBC'' has been the network's workhorse over the past
few years. But with evidence that the glut of newsmagazines is
causing audience fatigue, NBC is eliminating the Monday and
Wednesday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Neal Shapiro said he expects more editions of
''Dateline'' will be added if other shows fail.
</P>
<P>
   NBC hopes a new Aaron Spelling series, ''Titans,'' can revive
the genre of nighttime serials. It centers on a 26-year-old fighter
pilot who returns home to find his dad engaged to a former lover
who's about to bear the son's child.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of total guilty pleasure fans of this genre
love,'' Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Michael Richards Show,'' with the actor who played
Seinfeld's sidekick, will feature Richards as an unconventional
private investigator. But the network passed on a pilot featuring
Wayne Knight. The public so identifies him with his ''Seinfeld''
character, Newman, that it isn't ready to accept him as a dad, said
Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will be shown on Saturday nights until February, when NBC
broadcasts games from the new football league it is starting with
the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The usually jaded audience of advertisers watching NBC's
schedule announcement gave a standing ovation to the cast of the
freshman drama, ''The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   The five other new shows NBC will premiere in the fall:
</P>
<P>
   --''Dag,'' a comedy starring David Alan Grier as a demoted Secret
Service agent guarding the First Lady, played by Delta Burke.
</P>
<P>
   --''Tucker,'' a comedy modeled after Fox's successful ''Malcolm
in the Middle'' about a 14-year-old boy and his newly divorced
mother who move in with her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   --''The Steven Weber Show,'' which stars the former ''Wings''
actor as an executive whose life unravels after a blind date puts a
hex on him.
</P>
<P>
   --''Deadline,'' which gives producer Dick Wolf (''Law and
Order,'' ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'') his third hour on
NBC's schedule. It's a drama about a columnist working on a New
York City tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   --''Ed,'' a drama about a New York attorney who moves back to his
Midwestern hometown. It comes from David Letterman's production
company and was created by two ''Late Show'' writers.

<HEADLINE> One Last Chance for Knight  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is absolutely, positively the last defense of Bob Knight
you will read in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Until he gets caught.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing thought control.
</P>
<P>
   Or running a coven.
</P>
<P>
   Or implanting microchips in the cerebellums of his ballplayers,
buddies and bosses.
</P>
<P>
   On videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Knight stayed or went Monday was almost beyond the
point. The damage has been done. His run at Indiana will be history
soon, too.
</P>
<P>
   He is one dog who revels in refusing to learn new tricks. So
Indiana University president Myles Brand giving Knight one last
chance is as good a solution as any. This way, the next time
Brand's phone rings in the middle of the night, there will be no
questions about who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Taping the university code of conduct to the front of Knight's
sweater like some scarlet letter would have been a waste of paper.
Forcing him to attend anger-management counseling would have only
engendered more !@$&AMP; .
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who read his stab at a first-ever apology should
remember he insisted on having the last word. That isn't about to
change. It's like Knight's request to be buried upside down, so his
critics could pay homage in the most uncritical way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been too confrontational,'' his Saturday night
apology read, ''especially when I know I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long before the next blow up?
</P>
<P>
   Not long enough that Brand couldn't afford to wait him out.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that if you stacked all of Knight's accomplishments
on one side of the ledger and all his embarrassments on the other,
there would have been some wiggle room left. But in order to buy
Knight that last chance, Brand had to level the piles.
</P>
<P>
   If Knight thought people were watching him a little too closely
before, just wait. In 29 seasons, he has run over and across
hundreds of kids, assistants, administrators and reporters, and his
file is already packed: 10,000 unfavorable newspaper reviews, a
dozen disciplinary notes, a half-dozen complaints from ballplayers,
run-ins with authorities, and now terrorizing a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Every headline loosens a few more repressed memories. And let's
not forget that the Stockholm syndrome -- in which hostages
gradually come to sympathize with their captors -- is almost
certainly the reason there are not more.
</P>
<P>
   Knight nearly braining a secretary by hurling a vase is
disturbing, because it's a departure from his usual tactics. Knight
rarely takes on guys his own size. That's what a bully is.
Intimidating a secretary is a new low. Even for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ultimately, it's worth repeating what was said here when the
videotape came out proving Knight wasn't teaching Neil Reed how to
gargle while walking backward. Or what should have been said when
he did everything from intimidate school officials to smack his own
kids to leave a Tampax in a player's locker as a motivational tool.
</P>
<P>
   Duh. Nothing this guy does should surprise anyone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Change the names and the situations and the stories all coalesce
into one. When he didn't get tossed for the first one or the
second, or the 30th, what was Knight supposed to think? Here's
what: That as long as the Hoosiers won basketball games, he was
bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   And Knight was.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to say that as long as he won, he was called nothing
worse than ''eccentric.'' But Knight hasn't won a Big Ten title
since 1993, or advanced past the second round of the NCAA
tournament the last half-dozen years. Now, he can't even be called
the best coach in his own league. Besides Tom Izzo, who took
Michigan State to the national title, most people building from
scratch would take Illinois' Lon Kruger and Ohio State's Jim
O'Brien ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer any question that some coaches do it better.
Mike Krzyzewski's name always comes up in that context. The Duke
coach played point guard for Knight at Army and served his coaching
apprenticeship there, too. Krzyzewski soaked up the lessons and
moved on; Knight is still teaching kids that basketball is war when
he should know better. The next time he tries will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has three national championships, though they happened
long enough ago to provide any more cover. The last stop on the
horizon for that select company of coaches that Knight travels is
Dean Smith's 879 career wins. Knight already has 753. He still
averages 20 wins per season, but it's the six or so more seasons
he'll need that now seem unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   It's still worth remembering that on sum, most of those who came
into contact with Knight will swear he had an impact on their
lives, helped determine what they did when they left the team and
in some cases, he even helped get them there.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some guys become coaches and why, so long as they're
successful, they get away with everything short of murder. Because
they can lead.
</P>
<P>
   He could, too.
</P>
<P>
   Once.

<HEADLINE> Author Questions Gulf War Actions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey and journalist
Seymour Hersh clashed Monday over allegations that troops led by
McCaffrey used unnecessary force in a battle with Iraqi troops
after the Gulf War cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of McCaffrey's troops are questioned by several of
McCaffrey's former military colleagues in a report written by Hersh
in The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ex-colleagues, retired Lt. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr.,
is quoted as saying that ''there was no need to be shooting at
anybody'' on March 2, 1991. ''They couldn't surrender fast enough.
The war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were a defeated army going home and he attacked them,''
Hersh said on NBC's ''Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nonsense, this is revisionist history,'' responded
McCaffrey, now director of the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said two of his company commanders reported they were
under fire and ''we obviously had to support our soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has investigated the allegations that McCaffrey ordered
an unnecessary attack and concluded there was no evidence of war
crimes or misconduct by McCaffrey or his troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Army issued a brief statement saying, ''No new
issues appear to have been raised in the story'' and ''there is no
need to reopen the investigation.'' It added: ''The Army has
confidence in the conduct and integrity of the soldiers of the 24th
Infantry Division.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh ''is recycling charges that were investigated 10 years
ago. It conclusively demonstrated there was no wrongdoing,'' said
McCaffrey, who also appeared Monday on ABC's ''Good Morning
America'' and CBS's ''The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said McCaffrey has
Clinton's full support and said of the article: ''It is false.''
Lockhart also launched an attack on Hersh as a self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the article itself is another in a series of articles
by a journalist who thinks if you throw enough stuff up against the
wall, maybe something will stick,'' Lockhart said. ''It's an
attempt to gratuitously go after public officials in an attempt to
try to revive a journalist's career.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said its research found:
</P>
<P>
   --There was disagreement among officers assigned to McCaffrey's
mobile headquarters about whether Iraqis had attacked American
forces, prompting McCaffrey's strong response. Patrick Lamar, the
operations officer of McCaffrey's division, told the magazine the
initial skirmish that triggered McCaffrey's order to attack was ''a
giant hoax. The Iraqis were doing absolutely nothing. I told
McCaffrey I was having trouble confirming the incoming'' fire.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Lt. Gen. John J. Yeosock said ''what Barry ended up
doing was fighting sand dunes and moving rapidly'' and McCaffrey
was ''looking for a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   --Maj. Gen. Ronald Griffith said McCaffrey ''made it a battle
when it was never one.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack ordered by McCaffrey destroyed some 700 Iraqi tanks,
armored cars and trucks, The New Yorker reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hersh says that the Iraqi forces at Rumaylah were in
'retreat,''' McCaffrey said in a response. ''However, he wasn't the
one watching a force spanning five miles, made up of hundreds of
Iraqi tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers face him. The
Iraqis fired on U.S. forces. The Army investigations unequivocally
concluded that the use of force in response was justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine noted that there were occasional ''bitter
disputes'' between McCaffrey and other generals over such things as
the perceived hoarding of tank and truck fuel by McCaffrey, whose
division performed the famed ''left hook'' maneuver that blocked
the retreat of Iraqi forces from the war zone in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Argues for Open Ties to China  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday he
will visit China this summer to discuss ways of establishing closer
ties to the Chinese military, including possible cooperation on
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Economic Strategy Institute, Cohen argued for
keeping open lines of communication with China as a means of
influencing the future direction of the world's most populous
nation
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the United States have a particular opportunity to shape
this future course,'' he said. ''That is one of the reasons I have
spend so much of my time traveling to China. I will be going again
this summer to re-establish our military-to-military contacts so we
can discuss issues of how we can cooperate on humanitarian types of
operations, ... basically trying to reduce tensions which could
lead to confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen visited China in January 1998; he had planned to return
last year but that fell through when the United States led NATO's
air campaign against Kosovo. China suspended military-to-military
relations with the United States after the mistaken U.S. bombing of
China's embassy in Belgrade last May.
</P>
<P>
   Relations began to improve early this year when a settlement was
negotiated for damage to the embassy and lives lost in the bombing.
Adm. Dennis Blair, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, visited
Beijing in late February.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Cohen urged congressional approval of permanent
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to reject (it), it seems to me, says to the Chinese
that we are treating you as an adversary,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> United Europe Gov't Still a Dream  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It's a grand vision for a continent that gave the
last century its most horrible wars: a government uniting countries
from Britain to Germany and France to Finland, maintaining national
distinctions while operating under a federation-style political
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, being promoted anew by Germany's foreign minister,
seems like the logical end of efforts that have opened borders,
eliminated tariffs and adopted a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   But six years after the idea last sparked passionate criticism,
many skeptics remain -- indicating a United States of Europe still
has a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Even German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made a nod to the
wary in his speech promoting the idea last week -- labeling it a
''personal vision of the future'' in his address at Berlin's
Humboldt University.
</P>
<P>
   The planned expansion of the 15-nation European Union ''will
make a fundamental reform of European institutions indispensable,''
Fischer said. ''How can one imagine a European Council with 30
state and government heads? Thirty presidencies? How long will a
council meeting then last? Days or even weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Questions like those, Fischer said, mean the original vision of
a united Europe from 50 years ago should be carried to its logical
end with a European Federation led by an executive branch and two
houses of legislature codified in a European constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone isn't ready to go that far right now, a ''core
group'' of countries should make the first move and the rest can
join later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me it is fully clear that Europe can only play its
appropriate role in economic and political competition when we
proceed courageously,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Splits over common European policy have been blamed by some
leaders as a reason for the weakness of the euro, leaving traders
with their heads spinning over the 11 euro countries' conflicting
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Closer cooperation would also lead to common defense and foreign
policy, enabling the EU to step out of Washington's shadow and
avoid a repeat of the recent embarrassments in the Balkans, when
the Europeans had to wait for U.S. support to act on their own
continent.
</P>
<P>
   But the response to Fischer's proposal illustrated the divisions
over where the EU is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionally euro-skeptic British tabloids criticized
Fischer's proposal as a German ''master plan'' for a ''Euro
superstate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Euro set to rob UK of self-rule, admit Germans,'' The Sun
screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians warned a two-tier system of a ''core group''
and outsiders would merely erect political walls the EU was
intended to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want a rigid system of 'ins' and 'outs' or anything
that would lead to a two-speed Europe,'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office told The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said his government
wants ''a union in which everyone is equal. We must not accept any
kind of unequal structures, however temporary in nature,'' he told
the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Even at EU central, reaction was muted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Fischer has shown a brave vision,'' Michel Barnier, EU
commissioner for institutional reform, said Monday in Brussels,
Belgium. But he noted it was a ''long-term view,'' and cautioned
that ''forging ahead'' without all EU members was ''questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Unqualified praise for Fischer's speech came from France,
Germany's traditional partner in pushing for European integration.
Italy also said countries that so wish should move forward with
closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   France's Le Monde newspaper headlined its editorial on the
speech ''Danke Schoen, M. Fischer,'' calling the federalism plan an
''ambitious vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the course of the last few years, the word (federation) has
practically become taboo, as if Europeans ... fear it will
encourage Euro-skepticism,'' the paper wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's speech will be discussed this week at a German-French
summit meeting, ahead of Paris taking over the rotating EU
presidency in July. Fischer is to join Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on a visit to the French town of Rambouillet for talks with
President Jacques Chirac and Premier Lionel Jospin, German
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ''core group'' moving ahead with faster
integration has supporters across the political spectrum in
Germany. A similar proposal was floated in 1994 by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's then-governing conservative Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is new about the ideas,'' said Christian Deubner, an
expert on European relations at Germany's prestigious Stiftung
Wissenschaft und Politik think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   He shied away from guessing when a European Federation could
become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even so, I think we are getting closer and closer to a moment
at which these kind of questions have to be taken seriously in the
sense that we have to start acting on them,'' Deubner said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Social Security Plan Reviewed  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Comments on Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush's
Social Security reform plan and on plans generally to devote part
of the program to personal retirement accounts:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Both Bush and Gore should be commended for saying to the
public, 'Here's where I am' instead of waiting until after the
election.'' -- Martin Corry, AARP's federal affairs director.
</P>
<P>
   ''Social Security would be made a program that saves rather than
spends. Workers, not politicians, would control investment.
Personal accounts would create assets and wealth among lower-income
Americans who currently have none.'' -- Michael Tanner of the
libertarian Cato Institute, in praise of Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are 100 percent against it. That son of a Bush should keep
his hands off my money.'' -- Sol Silverman, 85, joining Democratic
and union critics of the plan in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking about doing these things for seven years
and it's about time at least one of the parties caught up to us.''
Richard Thau, president of Third Millennium, a Generation X group
that supports partial privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't privities Social Security.'' -- A misspelled banner towed
by a plane over Bush's campaign event, sponsored by 2030 Action, a
group of people in their 20s and 30s opposed to partial
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Clinton-Gore administration had not scared people about
the state of the program with their pledges to 'save Social
Security first,' it is questionable that Bush would be proposing a
privatization plan today.'' -- Dean Baker, co-author of ''Social
Security: The Phony Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The privatization approach endorsed by George W. Bush
partially insulates personal retirement finances from future fiscal
crises.'' -- Paul Hewitt, director of a global aging program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost every type of worker and family, retirement under
Social Security means receiving fewer dollars in old age and
passing on less wealth to the next generation that they could if
allowed to place their current Social Security tax dollars in
private retirement investments.'' -- David C. John of the
conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush needs to be straight with voters. The costs of
privatization are unavoidably enormous.'' -- John Sweeney, president
of AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Democrat Gore.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Federal Rape Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rape victims cannot sue their attackers in
federal court, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, saying it is up to
the states -- not Congress -- to give such help to women victimized
by violence.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling threw out a key provision of the 1994 Violence
Against Women Act and continued the court's trend of expanding
states' rights at the expense of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
national and what is truly local,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices barred a federal lawsuit by former Virginia Tech
student Christy Brzonkala against two football players she says
raped her in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   Brzonkala ''alleges that she was the victim of a brutal
assault,'' Rehnquist said. ''If the allegations here are true, no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy....
But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the
commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which
represented Brzonkala, said, ''I consider this to be a severe blow
for women's rights because of the chilling effect it will have on
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress identified a kind of gender discrimination,'' Rodgers
said. ''Congress is trying to address that with a creative,
specific solution and the court says, 'No, you can't do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael E. Rosman, who argued the case on behalf of the
two men sued by Brzonkala, called the ruling ''a very good day for
the Constitution and the rule of law.'' People who allege they are
victims of gender-based violence ''have perfectly good remedies in
state court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affirmed a federal appeals court decision that
threw out Brzonkala's lawsuit against student athletes Antonio
Morrison and James Crawford. Brzonkala has allowed her name to be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of
the phrase, economic activity,'' Rehnquist said. The justices
rejected arguments by Brzonkala's lawyer and the Clinton
administration that the law was needed because states are not doing
enough to protect rape victims, and because gender-based violence
restricts women's choices in jobs and travel.
</P>
<P>
   That argument ''would allow Congress to regulate any crime as
long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has
substantial effects on employment, production, transit or
consumption,'' Rehnquist said. ''Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or
any other type of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is a follow-up to the Supreme Court's 1995 ruling that
struck down as unconstitutional a law that made it a federal crime
to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. The justices said
gun possession was not sufficiently linked to interstate commerce
and that the law usurped state authority over such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's next in line,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
who sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, said Monday. ''The
court really went off here in a way that I find extremely
troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement saying
he is ''deeply disappointed'' that victims may no longer sue in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I continue to believe that there should be remedies
for victims of gender-motivated violence, we plan to study the
Supreme Court's decision ... to determine the best means to help
these victims,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Those five
have provided the majority in a number of 5-4 decisions that have
boosted states' rights versus those of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Souter cited ''the mountain of data
assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce.'' Thirty-eight state attorneys
general supported the right to sue in federal court, Souter noted.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington University law professor Mary Cheh said the
ruling ''signals that there is this ongoing attempt to reposition
the states vis-a-vis the federal government.... This has the
potential of keeping this train on the track. Where it ultimately
goes, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act also has criminal provisions, and
those were not at issue in Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are U.S. vs. Morrison, 99-5, and Brzonkala vs.
Morrison, 99-29.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Fast Action on Gun Law  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton praised congressional
negotiators Monday for moving to resolve an impasse over gun
control and urged quick passage of legislation he said would keep
more Americans alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should not be a political issue,'' Clinton said at a
ceremony honoring police officers killed in the line of duty.
''It's about keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, and
keeping more of our citizens, especially our children and our
police officers, alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Reps. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and John
Conyers, D-Mich., the chairman and top Democrat of the House
Judiciary Committee, for making progress on issues that have
delayed passage of gun control legislation for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde wrote Conyers late Friday informing him he was willing to
change the definition of a ''gun show'' to ensure that it would
include any event ''used to facilitate the sale of firearms.'' He
also appeared willing to expand the pool of potential buyers
subject to three-day background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers and other Democrats said that previous compromise plans
offered by Hyde made it too easy for gun sellers to claim they were
not holding a gun show and thus would not be subject to Brady Act
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, in a response to Hyde, commended his willingness to
engage in substantive negotiations on the issue. Closing the gun
show loophole, he said, was ''an exceedingly modest proposition''
that Congress should be able to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's spokesman, Sam Stratman, said the Republican side is now
reviewing a compromise proposal made by Conyers. ''We'll have an
answer for Mr. Conyers sooner rather than later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A juvenile crime bill passed by the Senate last year contained
gun control language that required gun show buyers to go through
background checks, promoted child trigger locks, banned the
importation of large capacity ammunition clips and prohibited
juveniles with serious criminal records from possessing guns.
</P>
<P>
   A similar House bill did not include the gun provisions. Hyde
and other GOP leaders have since agreed that the gun safety
measures must be part of the final bill, but an acceptable
compromise has eluded the negotiators, with the gun show language
being the biggest sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Congress to move on gun safety legislation was a
major theme of the Million Mom March that drew a large turnout to
the Washington Mall on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted Monday that the march
would finally give Congress the push it needed to take action. ''I
believe that at long last, Congress will say no to the National
Rifle Association, and yes to the hundreds of thousands of mothers
from across the United States who marched on the nation's Capitol
to demand an end to the epidemic of gun violence.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins Break Even Financially  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins did better than
expected in former star Mario Lemieux's first year of ownership,
breaking even on an operating basis, increasing ticket sales and
selling the naming rights to their arena.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from bankruptcy in September, the Penguins
anticipated losses of between $2 million and $3 million. Advancing
two rounds into the playoffs helped offset those projected losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty remarkable -- this franchise lost $13 million last
season,'' Lemieux said Monday in a state-of-the-team address. ''Our
franchise is worth a lot more today than we paid for it, and I'm
very optimistic about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Penguins' dramatically improved financial state,
they won't suddenly plunge into the free agent market, Lemieux
said. Also, some ticket prices will go up slightly next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to keep getting our players through the draft, the
way we did it in the past,'' Lemieux said. ''We just can't afford
(free agents) ... that's why we went into bankruptcy. Sooner or
later, you have to pay it off when you sign a lot of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've said all along that we're going to run this team like a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ticket price hike, to be announced to season ticket-holders
in a letter mailed this week, will help offset a higher payroll --
$35 million next season compared to $32 million this season.
Jaromir Jagr, Martin Straka and Alexei Kovalev are among those due
raises.
</P>
<P>
   After Lemieux took over, the Penguins cut ticket prices in many
sections of Mellon Arena and designated some upper-tier seats as
family sections, with prices as low as $10. Lemieux said those
seats will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The payroll is going up, so we have to adjust a little bit,''
Lemieux said. ''We're 21st out of 28 teams in ticket revenue, and
that's pretty far down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins' ability to keep selling corporate boxes and
higher-priced seats will be tested next year when the Steelers and
Pirates open new stadiums. Pittsburgh is the smallest city with
three major pro sports teams, and there is considerable competition
among the teams to sell boxes and luxury seats to a relatively
small number of corporate and company clients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Penguins' vastly improved financial state -- they
were the first major pro sports team to go bankrupt in 25 years --
chief financial officer Ken Sawyer said they still aren't breaking
even on a debt-to-revenue basis.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's group is paying off $23 million in bank debt and $15
million in past debt, including money owed former players in
deferred compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we've come a long way,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Penguins didn't go nearly as far as they wanted in
the playoffs, especially after opening a 2-0 lead in the second
round against Philadelphia. The Penguins lost the next two games at
home, both in overtime, and never won again.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had gotten a bounce in Game 3 or Game 4, we'd be in New
Jersey right now and that would have been nice,'' Lemieux said.
''We just ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep that from happening again, Lemieux suggested the
Penguins must add more size, especially on the third and fourth
lines. He also wants to re-sign goaltender Ron Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   ''But what we can afford to pay him and what he might be able to
get could be different,'' Lemieux said. Tampa Bay is among those
interested in Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux also said:
</P>
<P>
   --The Penguins will announce next month whether they will push
for a new arena or if they prefer to stay in a refurbished Mellon
Arena, which opened in 1961 and is the NHL's oldest. Previously,
Lemieux said the Penguins hoped for a new arena by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   --He sees no reason why Ivan Hlinka, who is signed to a
three-year contract, won't be the next coach. Asked when the
Penguins would make him their new coach, Lemieux said, ''I thought
we named him already.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux doesn't foresee any scenario in which Herb Brooks, who
replaced the fired Kevin Constantine in December, would agree to
stay as coach. Brooks prefers to return to scouting.
</P>
<P>
   --He agrees with Jagr, who said the Penguins must guard against
becoming too one-dimensional by acquiring too many European
players.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need stars and you need grinders,'' Lemieux said. ''You
can't have everybody doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Penguins are no longer shopping for investors because his
group is happy with its current makeup. Some investors have
increased their stakes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm willing to put more money in,'' he said. ''We have a great
group of investors who want to keep this group intact.''

<HEADLINE> Heat's Riley Disgusted With Effort  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Pat Riley took a day off from coaching Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat coach was too ''disgusted'' to even try after his
team's effort against the New York Knicks in Game 4, a 91-83 loss
that has this Eastern Conference semifinal series tied at two games
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   No offensive drills. No defensive work. Nothing more than a
videotape session, a painful rerun of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat committed 17 turnovers Sunday, including nine by center
Alonzo Mourning. They settled for -- and missed -- too many
long-range jump shots. And, more importantly to Riley, they showed
little effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't bring it,'' Riley said. ''We didn't bring it
physically and we didn't bring it mentally. And if you don't bring
it as a team, you're going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Riley's main evaluations of game tapes is to look for his
team's effort on each play. In Miami's 77-76 overtime victory in
Game 3, Riley said his team had 51 ''effort plays'' in the fourth
quarter alone. He graded his players at 95 percent effort -- a
season high.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped into the 70 percent range throughout Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to try to explain it anymore,'' he said. ''I'm
not going to try to teach it anymore. Today I'm disgusted; tomorrow
I'll start coaching again.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Wednesday night in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every game we've played thus far, the team that has lost has
come back with that little edge, and that's been the difference,''
Knicks forward Latrell Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat hope to continue that streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wants to lose, and everyone on this team was
disappointed because we felt we could have played better and the
outcome could have been different,'' guard Jamal Mashburn said.
''(Riley) was annoyed just like we all were annoyed. There was a
little bit of a short fuse there, and everybody was on the same
page.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat don't expect to make any major changes for Game 5,
they're just hoping for better execution.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Tim Hardaway, hobbled with a sore left foot, will
continue to play -- and start. Hardaway is shooting 8-for-30 (27
percent) from the field in the series, including 4-for-17 from
3-point range, and has 18 assists.
</P>
<P>
   His mobility is limited, in transition and on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway met with Riley for about 10 minutes after Monday's
session. Neither would comment on the meeting, but Riley defended
Hardaway's play and presence on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tim is absolutely playing as courageously as he can. Despite
what people think, he has been a positive for us,'' Riley said.
''We need him. We need his heart. We need his savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He means too much to this franchise to be thought of as a
liability. We're working our way around it. He didn't make nine
turnovers and he didn't miss four free throws, so I would not be
pointing fingers at Tim Hardaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway had nothing to do with Charlie Ward reeling off the
Knicks' final nine points, either. Rookie Anthony Carter was on the
floor at the end of the game, and afterwards, he called Ward's
baskets ''garbage points.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how,'' said Chris Childs, the Knicks' other point
guard. ''We were up (five points) when Charlie made all the big
plays, and they were all against him. He was guarding him, so
what's it say about his defense?''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Links Lead, Kids' Delinquency  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- New research suggests that millions more children
than previously thought might have lead-linked mental impairment,
while another study supports a strong link between lead exposure
and juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that the current standard for
''acceptable'' levels of lead in the blood is much too high, and
also underscore the need to focus on prevention, said Dr. Bruce
Lanphear of Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Lanphear led one of the studies presented Monday in Boston at a
joint conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics and
Pediatric Academic Societies.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is a toxic metal that can interfere with development of the
central nervous system and can be detected in blood and bones.
Severe lead poisoning, which can cause seizures and even death, can
sometimes be treated with medication, but Lanphear said the more
subtle declines in mental functioning linked to lead are persistent
and may be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 417 youngsters in Allegheny County, Pa.,
significantly higher bone-lead levels were found in those convicted
of delinquency than in a comparison group of young people with no
juvenile convictions, reported Dr. Herbert Needleman of the
University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Among boys, convicted juveniles were nearly twice as likely to
have high bone-lead levels as the youngsters in the comparison
group. The risk for girls was even higher, partly because only a
small number of female delinquents -- 21 -- was studied, Needleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest a possible link between early lead exposure
and 11 percent to 37 percent of arrested delinquents, said
Needleman, whose previous research linked aggressive and
anti-social behavior to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lead exposure may be one of the most preventable causes of
criminal behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' blood lead levels have dropped significantly in the
past 30 years with the removal of lead from gasoline, residential
paint, plumbing systems and cans. But it remains a threat primarily
in old paint, and children who eat paint chips or crawl on floors
covered with old paint dust are especially at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The government's acceptable blood lead level is 10 micrograms
per deciliter. An average of 4.4 percent of children ages 1 to 5 --
about 890,000 youngsters -- have levels at least that high, though
in some poor communities with old housing the average levels are
significantly higher, said Don Ryan, executive director of the
Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But Lanphear found cognitive impairment, especially affecting
reading ability, in children with levels as low as 2.5 micrograms
per deciliter
</P>
<P>
   Lanphear studied national data on 4,853 children ages 6 to 16
from 1988 through 1994, comparing blood lead levels and scores on
tests of reading and math ability.
</P>
<P>
   Most had blood lead levels below 10. But for every increase of
one microgram, there was an estimated reduction in reading scores
of 1 point and a slightly smaller drop in math scores.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that harmful effects are seen with the
lowest detectable blood lead levels -- effects that at best could
mean the difference between an A or B grade, Lanphear said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that more than 12.8 million U.S. youngsters born
between 1972 and 1988 have blood lead levels in excess of 2.5
micrograms and ''are adversely affected by environmental lead
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommended limit ''is inadequate to protect children,''
said Lanphear, proposing a maximum threshold of at least half the
current 10-microgram limit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Miller, executive director of Lead Industries
Association, a trade group for battery makers, lead-scrap recyclers
and other lead users, said it is difficult to prove a link between
low blood-lead levels and cognitive problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''These effects may not be significant,'' he said, noting that
most adults today ''had blood lead levels above 15 and 20 and 25
when they were young'' without any notable harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than worrying about such minor effects,'' he said, the
focus should be on ''kids who truly do have lead poisoning.''

<HEADLINE> Ray Lewis' Murder Trial begins  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA LaHAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis marked his
25th birthday Monday sitting in a Fulton County courtroom as his
murder trial began with jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis entered the courtroom a half-hour before co-defendants
Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting. Neither Oakley nor Sweeting
spoke to the NFL star as they came in.
</P>
<P>
   The three are charged with murder in the Jan. 31 deaths of
Jacinth ''Shorty'' Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, following a
post-Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner started the
process of winnowing the 136 potential jurors to the 12 people and
two alternates who will hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, defense attorneys tried to identify people who
might be predisposed to convict their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, Lewis' lawyer, asked the jury pool if anyone had
negative opinions about professional athletes. Bruce Harvey, who
represents Oakley, tried to ferret out any bias against criminal
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the selection began Monday, prosecutors and defense
attorneys had agreed to get rid of 42 potential jurors based on
answers they gave Friday on a written questionnaire. Bonner
immediately sent those people home.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys wanted another 20 people removed from the jury
pool based on their questionnaire answers, but Bonner got rid of
only five of those.
</P>
<P>
   One potential juror wrote on her questionnaire, ''I tend to
think they are guilty, but I don't know all the facts.'' That was
enough for Bonner to remove her from the jury pool. Others were
removed for medical reasons or to take care of sick family members.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner did not immediately dismiss a potential juror who wrote,
''Professional sports figures should not receive special
treatment.'' However, she said she could reconsider each individual
juror later.
</P>
<P>
   Only 88 potential jurors are left, but it could take several
more days to narrow the list to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. had only two
questions for the jury pool Monday, both related to whether the
potential jurors could render a fair judgment if asked to serve.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys had a much longer list of questions.
Garland asked if any jurors listened to rap music regularly, or if
anyone had ever called 911 for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Other defense questions suggested how the attorneys might defend
their clients during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sadow, the lead attorney for Sweeting, asked potential
jurors if they had ever been forced to use a weapon in
self-defense. He also asked if anyone had been shot at.
</P>
<P>
   ''And for those of you who answered yes, how many of you stuck
around to find out why they were shooting at you?'' Sadow asked to
the laughter of the potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired at the limousine Lewis was riding in after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said in court documents that the defendants
chased down Lollar and Baker and started fighting with them after
an argument at the Cobalt Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyers are expected to argue that he didn't stab anyone
and acted as a peacemaker. But if the prosecution can convince a
jury that Lewis participated in the brawl that led to the two
deaths, he can be convicted of murder even if he didn't stab
anyone.

   HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Penn State University quarterback Rashard
Casey and a high school teammate beat an off-duty police officer
until he was unconscious because the white officer was at a bar
with a black woman, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you doing with him? You should be with us. You're one
of us,'' Casey and Desmond Miller told Officer Patrick Fitzsimmons'
acquaintance at the River Street bar early Sunday morning,
according to Hoboken Police Chief Carmen LaBruno. Casey and Miller
are black.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who led Penn State to a victory in the Alamo Bowl last
year and was once called ''a human highlight film'' by a teammate,
punched Fitzsimmons, 34, as he was walking to his car, LaBruno
said. Casey and Miller, both 22, kicked the officer in the head
once he fell, and continued to kick him after he lost
consciousness, LaBruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Four witnesses, including an off-duty Jersey City police
officer, positively identified Casey and Miller as the officer's
attackers and Casey's clothes were covered with blood when he was
arrested, LaBruno said. Tests to determine whether the blood was
Fitzsimmons' should take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller entered not guilty pleas to charges of
aggravated assault at the Hudson County Courthouse in Jersey City
on Monday. Miller entered his plea by teleconference from the
Hudson County Jail, where he was being held in lieu of $20,000
bail. Casey, who posted $5,000 bail sometime on Sunday, came into
court in street clothes and walked out with lawyer Dennis McAlevy.
</P>
<P>
   Casey did not speak to reporters, but held his hands up at the
instructions of his lawyer. ''Anybody see any marks on those
hands?'' asked McAlevy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have full faith that when this matter is fully adjudicated,
Rashard Casey will be the starting quarterback at Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are deciding whether to try the assault cases as
bias crimes, which would double the maximum prison terms Casey and
Miller could serve from 10 years to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence of a bias crime comes from Fitzsimmons'
acquaintance, not from eyewitnesses, said Edward DeFazio, Hudson
County's deputy first assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Casey's principal at Hoboken High School, Frank Spano, on Monday
said that his former star quarterback is not biased toward
interracial relationships because he has a 2-year-old biracial son.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is totally out of character for Rashard Casey,'' Spano
said. ''He's always been a gentleman, a quiet, well-mannered young
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who graduated from Hoboken in 1995, was slated to start
as quarterback this season after splitting time last year with
starter Kevin Thompson. He passed for one touchdown and ran for a
second on Dec. 28 to lead the Nittany Lions to a 24-0 victory over
Texas A&AMP;M University in the 1999 Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 59 of 94 passes last year for 856 yards and six
touchdowns and was the team's No. 2 rusher with 290 yards and five
touchdowns who became known for his scrambling style. ''He's a
human highlight film,'' fullback Mike Cerimele said of Casey last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State Sports Information Director Jeff Nelson declined to
comment Monday on the charges. He did say the university could take
action against students convicted of crimes, including suspension
or expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller, of Jersey City, arrived at the River Street at
about 1:40 a.m. Sunday, and stayed there for about an hour, LaBruno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, a five-year veteran who teaches tolerance training
at his job in the community policing division, was at the bar with
his friend, whose name authorities refused to release.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller jumped Fitzsimmons as he left the bar, police
said. A third Hoboken High alumni, Keeon Walker, told Casey and
Miller to stop the attack because Fitzsimmons was a police officer,
LaBruno said. Walker, who plays football at Syracuse University,
will not face charges.
</P>
<P>
   LaBruno would not say whether Fitzsimmons was armed at the time.
The officer was released from a hospital Sunday, but may require
facial surgery after sustaining severe bruises and abrasions,
authorities said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond has been released from the
hospital after being admitted for the second time in a week because
of an upset stomach and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond had been scheduled to spend Monday night at the Walter
Reed Army Medical Center but was released early after ''recovering
quicker than expected,'' his office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-year-old lawmaker's office said he checked himself into

doctors had recommended he stay Monday night to ensure he is
completely recovered before returning to work.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, R-S.C., the oldest senator in American history, also
spent two nights in the hospital last week after being diagnosed as
dehydrated as a result of a stomach ailment. He returned to the

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Fire Could Turn Back  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The fire that burned down 260 homes in
Los Alamos destroyed historic Indian ruins over the weekend and
threatened to turn back toward town with an increase in the winds
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Less-severely damaged parts of Los Alamos were reopened to
residents Monday, but Police Chief Rich Melton said they would
still be without power. The Los Alamos nuclear laboratory remained
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic blaze, with an 89-mile perimeter, was burning into
a canyon Monday on the edge of an Indian reservation, where tribal
fire spokesman Alvin Warren said it destroyed some ''culturally
sensitive archaeological sites.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   So far firefighters have managed to keep the flames away from
the tribal homes at the Santa Clara Pueblo, where about 1,500
people live. However, the fire came within a quarter-mile of cliff
dwellings in a popular hunting and fishing area about 15 miles
northeast of Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the 44,000-acre blaze was 28 percent contained. More
than 1,500 firefighters worked furiously to surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time they see a plume of smoke, it will be attacked
vigorously,'' fire spokesman Jim Paxon said. ''Today, we're mopping
up and holding the line.'' But Paxon warned: ''This does not mean
the total threat of fire to Los Alamos is gone. It's diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   The main worry was the National Weather Service's forecast of
wind gusting to 50 mph Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was that high when the fire first jumped into Los
Alamos last Wednesday, forcing the evacuation first of the entire
town and then parts of the surrounding area, for a total of 25,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 7,000 residents of suburban White Rock were allowed
back home. Firefighters have said it may be more than a week before
the others can return and weeks before the blaze is out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little concerned about the weather -- the winds may
shift,'' said Terry Coggeshall, a returning White Rock resident who
was afraid her homecoming might be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, spokeswoman Kay Roybal
said officials were checking to see whether the facilities might be
ready to reopen. They had been closed a full week as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to take air samples Monday to check for
radioactivity from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos fire was started May 4 on Bandelier National
Monument by National Park Service officials hoping to clear brush
and deadwood. But the blaze raged out of control. Park
Superintendent Roy Weaver has been placed on leave pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, firefighters tried to keep the fire from spreading
farther into the Santa Clara Indian Pueblo or onto the Baca Ranch,
a majestic 95,000-acre volcanic area being purchased by the Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the fire had consumed more than 6,000 acres of
Pueblo land -- ''more than 10 percent of our reservation.'' Pueblo
Gov. Denny Gutierrez said the fire was burning near a creek that
the tribe depends on for its water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our lifeline coming down from that canyon,'' he said.
''Our watershed is there, cultural matters in the valley. It's very
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a total of 405 families lost their homes in the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the state's congressional
delegation will meet Tuesday in Washington to begin planning the
government compensation effort.

<HEADLINE> Lott Pushed To Release Fire Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As fire raged in New Mexico, a Democratic
congressman urged Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott on Monday to
stop delaying an emergency spending bill that includes $250 million
to fight fires on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to approve the money quickly could hurt the government's
ability to fight fires during what could be the worst fire season
since 1994, said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington state, the ranking
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee's interior
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the Senate not to act on this ... is just not right,''
Dicks said. The money ''should have been there in the accounts, and
it's not there because one person said, 'No,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., indefinitely postponed votes on the $13 billion
bill because he contends the money can be approved through the
normal appropriations process rather than on an ''emergency''
basis.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lott did not return a telephone call seeking
comment on Dicks' complaint, first made through a letter Friday to
the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans said firefighters on federal land in New
Mexico and throughout the country will have the money they need to
do the job. If federal officials do not have enough money in
firefighting accounts, they have broad authority to borrow from
other federal accounts, GOP aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has proven willing to reimburse any funds borrowed for
firefighting as part of the normal appropriations process, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is never any reason with the authority they (federal
officials) have to reduce any firefighting activities,'' said Doug
Crandall, chief of staff for the forests and forest health
subcommittee of the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending bill includes $100 million for
firefighting on Bureau of Land Management, Park Service and Fish
and Wildlife lands through the remainder of this year and early
next year, and $150 million for firefighting on Forest Service
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The House by a 263-146 vote on March 30 approved the bill, which
also includes money for combating drugs in Colombia, peacekeeping
in Kosovo and cleaning up after Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved an agriculture
spending bill that includes $100 million for the BLM, Park Service
and Fish and Wildlife firefighting efforts. But that bill did not
include the $150 million for the Forest Service because it was not
part of the administration's request, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture spending bill could gain final approval and the
president's signature by July 4, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks said that would not be soon enough. Only 550
firefighting crews will be available this summer if the funds are
not approved quickly, instead of 625 crews that are typically
available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP officials disputed that, saying the crews are funded
separately through fire prevention dollars. The request Dicks is
seeking would fund fire operations, they said.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry of Mrs. Clinton Rejected  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Arkansas Supreme Court's disciplinary arm
has decided not to institute proceedings against first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton that could have led to the revocation of her law
license because of the Whitewater scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint by a conservative group, Landmark Legal Foundation,
did not present ''a sufficient basis'' to initiate an investigation
of the first lady, James Neal, executive director of the committee
on professional conduct, wrote in a letter released Monday by
Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The group asked for an inquiry after federal regulators found in
1996 that Mrs. Clinton, as a lawyer in Little Rock, created a real
estate document later used by her Whitewater partners' savings and
loan to deceive federal regulators. The document helped enable a
payment of $300,000 in real estate commissions to the father-in-law
of Mrs. Clinton's law partner, Webster Hubbell, on a failed land
development called Castle Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative group never got a response to its initial
complaint in 1996 due to what Neal said may have been a ''mix-up or
miscommunication.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he now recalls that he evaluated the complaint in 1996
and rejected it, and that a disciplinary committee conducted a
second review in the past month and reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levin, president of the conservative group based in
Herndon, Va., said the Arkansas disciplinary committee provides
''no information justifying or explaining their latest decision for
failing to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inspector general at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
singled out Mrs. Clinton's legal work as a major factor in the
perpetration of this fraud'' at the S&AMP;L owned by the Clintons'
Whitewater partners, said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the court's attorney disciplinary arm is considering
whether to revoke President Clinton's law license for his denials
of a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Group Plans New Standards  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decrying ''amateurs'' teaching without
credentials, a coalition of educators announced Monday tough new
standards for teachers' colleges seeking endorsement of their
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing what classes are taught, colleges would have
to prove their graduates are good teachers to earn accreditation,
the group said. The plan, however, does not specifically call for
testing individual teachers for their expertise, which has had high
failure rates in states like Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe children are well served when anyone can walk
in off the street and be a teacher,'' said Arthur Wise, president
of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. But
he and other educators remained cool to alternative certification
programs that enlist former businesspeople or other experts without
in-depth teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   The council -- backed by teachers' unions, state school
superintendents and other educators -- unveiled a list of standards
the nation's roughly 600 teacher-college programs would have to
meet before receiving its seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the council say the group does little more than keep
the status quo. Teachers, for example, are not required to get
specific training in a subject like algebra or chemistry, nor must
they pass a universal test to become teachers -- much like the bar
exam required of an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the power of the decision of who is a qualified
teacher should be made at the principal level -- and for that you
need to know individual scores,'' said Charles R. Hokanson Jr., a
researcher at Thomas Fordham Foundation, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Wise said by next fall, teacher colleges would have to prove
they are graduating candidates capable of helping children learn.
The proof, he said, would include how many graduates pass state
teachers license exams, what principals and superintendents have to
say about the candidates' internship and job performances and
graduates' rating of how well university programs prepared them for
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges also must prove that graduates have been trained to
work with many children, including minorities and the disabled. The
group was vague on what role student test scores would play in
determining how well these new teachers teach.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a good start, said Jamie Horowitz, spokesman for the
American Federation of Teachers union, which recently proposed
mandatory entrance exams for new hires. Such plans have been
endorsed by President Clinton and presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher college accreditors and their institutions have been
accused of being irrelevant at best and lax at worst in preparing
the next generation of teachers. Wise said Monday however the
agency already rejects 1 in 4 college programs that don't meet its
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department says mass retirements and low-retention
over poor salaries and work conditions will lead to more than 2
million teaching vacancies in the next decade. Currently, filling
empty classrooms is difficult enough for highly populated districts
like Los Angeles, where two in three of last year's new hires
lacked full certification.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association
teachers union, said Monday you can't fill classrooms without
paying attention to credentials -- arguing that even Albert Einstein
might not have been a good middle school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''By no fault of their own, many so-called teachers are in fact
amateurs,'' he said. ''A woman who graduates from MIT with a degree
in physics has an abundance of knowledge ... but does she know how
to manage a classroom of teen-agers?''
</P>
<P>
   The accreditation, though endorsed by the Education Department,
is not required universally. But states like Maryland are moving
toward tying such credentialing to grants for universities.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight of Maryland's 22 teachers colleges have the
credential, but state schools superintendent Nancy Grasmick doesn't
expect the requirements to drive schools out of the
teacher-education business.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the teacher shortage, we are here to build capacity, not
reduce capacity,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Penn State QB Faces Charges  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Penn State quarterback Rashard Casey and a
high school teammate beat an off-duty police officer until he was
unconscious because the white officer was at a bar with a black
woman, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you doing with him? You should be with us. You're one
of us,'' Casey and Desmond Miller told Officer Patrick Fitzsimmons'
acquaintance at the River Street bar early Sunday morning,
according to Hoboken Police Chief Carmen LaBruno. Casey and Miller
are black.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who led Penn State to a victory in the Alamo Bowl last
year, punched Fitzsimmons, 34, as he was walking to his car,
LaBruno said. Casey and Miller, both 22, kicked the officer in the
head once he fell, and continued to kick him after he lost
consciousness, LaBruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Four witnesses, including an off-duty Jersey City police
officer, positively identified Casey and Miller as the officer's
attackers and Casey's clothes were covered with blood when he was
arrested, LaBruno said. Tests to determine whether the blood was
Fitzsimmons' should take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller entered not guilty pleas to charges of
aggravated assault at the Hudson County Courthouse in Jersey City
on Monday. Miller entered his plea by teleconference from the
Hudson County Jail, where he was being held in lieu of $20,000
bail. Casey, who posted $5,000 bail sometime on Sunday, came into
court in street clothes and walked out with lawyer Dennis McAlevy.
</P>
<P>
   Casey did not speak to reporters, but held his hands up at the
instructions of his lawyer. ''Anybody see any marks on those
hands?'' asked McAlevy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have full faith that when this matter is fully adjudicated,
Rashard Casey will be the starting quarterback at Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are deciding whether to try the assault cases as
bias crimes, which would double the maximum prison terms Casey and
Miller could serve from 10 years to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence of a bias crime comes from Fitzsimmons'
acquaintance, not from eyewitnesses, said Edward DeFazio, Hudson
County's deputy first assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Casey's principal at Hoboken High School, Frank Spano, on Monday
said that his former star quarterback is not biased toward
interracial relationships because he has a 2-year-old biracial son.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is totally out of character for Rashard Casey,'' Spano
said. ''He's always been a gentleman, a quiet, well-mannered young
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who graduated from Hoboken in 1995, was slated to start
as quarterback this season after splitting time last year with
starter Kevin Thompson. He passed for one touchdown and ran for a
second to lead the Nittany Lions to a 24-0 victory over Texas A&AMP;M
in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 59 of 94 passes last year for 856 yards and six
touchdowns and was the team's No. 2 rusher with 290 yards and five
touchdowns who became known for his scrambling style. ''He's a
human highlight film,'' fullback Mike Cerimele said of Casey last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State sports information director Jeff Nelson declined to
comment Monday on the charges. He did say the university could take
action against students convicted of crimes, including suspension
or expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller, of Jersey City, arrived at the River Street at
about 1:40 a.m. Sunday, and stayed there for about an hour, LaBruno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, a five-year veteran who teaches tolerance training
at his job in the community policing division, was at the bar with
his friend, whose name authorities refused to release.
</P>
<P>
   Casey and Miller jumped Fitzsimmons as he left the bar, police
said. A third Hoboken High alumni, Keeon Walker, told Casey and
Miller to stop the attack because Fitzsimmons was a police officer,
LaBruno said. Walker, who plays football at Syracuse, will not face
charges.
</P>
<P>
   LaBruno would not say whether Fitzsimmons was armed at the time.
The officer was released from a hospital Sunday, but may require
facial surgery after sustaining severe bruises and abrasions,
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says He Doesn't Have Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENSIDE, Pa. (AP) -- The latest mini-debate between George W.
Bush and Al Gore: whether the vice president has money in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for his plan to allow Americans to privately invest
Social Security money, Bush said Monday, ''Al Gore, who calls these
bipartisan proposals risky, has a substantial amount of his money
invested in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is building his own retirement security in the market,
why does he object to young Americans doing the same?'' Bush said
in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who argues that privatizing Social Security would be a
dangerous gamble, does not have money in the stock market,
spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush must be listening to the same ''little birdie''
that incorrectly told him Gore was a member of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right this time?
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp isn't counting at least one investment, in
Occidental Petroleum Inc., because it is part of a trust fund that
he does not own.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign says Gore will benefit from that trust
fund after his mother dies so it is, for all practical purposes, a
personal investment in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''That money will be a big part of his retirement nest egg,''
said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pork belly futures fell heavily Monday on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid increasing evidence that supplies are now running
well ahead of demand -- a possible sign the recent bacon boom may
have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, grain and soybean prices slid sharply and
sugar jumped to a 6{-month high.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for pork bellies, from which bacon is made, have been
red-hot in recent months as fast-food chains roll out new
sandwiches with bacon in them or add it to season the taste of beef
being cooked longer to guard against E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   But bellies crashed last week after fast-rising prices hit $1 a
pound and the market turned lower on the belief that demand had
peaked as stockpiles were rising.
</P>
<P>
   Following a brief recovery at week's end, pork bellies for July
delivery tumbled 2.95 cents Monday to 86.15 cents a pound, a
7{-week low, in the wake of U.S. Department of Agriculture figures
showing ample supplies and falling retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   Summer barbecue season is certain to revive demand, but
investors fear it may not be enough to compensate for big supplies
of frozen pork bellies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There comes a time in any market, whether it's bacon or
whatever, where you just oversaturate the market,'' said Dave
Maher, an analyst for Securities Corp. of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets to a point where people say 'I had bacon on this,' 'I
had bacon on that' -- I think I'll try something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with similar supply-demand discrepancies, June lean hogs
fell the exchange-imposed limit 2 cents to 70.85 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and soybeans swooned on the Chicago Board of Trade after
the issuance of rainy weather forecasts that bode well for newly
planted crops but not for prices.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the two crops fell about 3 percent in a decline that
was even steeper until the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said abnormally dry conditions would continue in
June, July and August -- reviving drought fears.
</P>
<P>
   July corn fell 7 cents to $2.38} a bushel; July soybeans fell 16
cents to $5.49} a bushel; July wheat fell 2 cents to $2.82\ a
bushel; July oats fell 2{ cents to $1.19} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar zoomed higher on word that this year's crop in Brazil, the
No. 1 exporting country, may be down 10 percent over last year.
That would shrink the world sugar glut.
</P>
<P>
   July sugar settled up .17 cent at 6.95 cents a pound on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Venture Capital Fever  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Big business is playing an increasingly
larger role in venture capital investment, according to statistics
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A first-quarter survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers identified a
division of Chase Manhattan Bank as the leading venture capital
investor during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Chase Capital's venture capital investments
totaled $289 million during the quarter, according to accounting
firm's ''Money Tree'' survey. Two other banks, Wells Fargo's
Norwest Equity Partners and BancBoston Capital Ventures, also
ranked among the most active in the venture capital market,
investing a total of $119 million and $115 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think big banks and companies are here to stay,'' said Tracy
Lefteroff, a PricewaterhouseCoopers' managing partner specializing
in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and corporations are forming venture capital divisions
because of the huge payoffs generated in recent years by Internet
startups after they sold their stock in initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Established technology giants such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft
Corp. also are providing venture capital to startups.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of a windfall isn't the only draw for corporate
America. Lefteroff said many major companies have realized that
funding technology startups can give them the inside track on
innovations developed by entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America's interest in using the Internet to lower its
purchasing costs also played a big role in venture capital
investment during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists poured $1.4 billion into firms trying to
develop ''business-to-business'' Web sites that handle electronic
transactions between companies and their vendors. The $1.4 billion
invested in those firms represented a 15-fold increase from last
year and eclipsed the amount funneled into the once-hot
''business-to-consumer'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business entrepreneurs are catering to demand
created largely by corporate giants that expect to reap huge
savings by using e-commerce to buy supplies and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Internet businesses accounted for the bulk of the first
quarter's total venture capital investments of $17.2 billion.
PricewaterhouseCoopers' figure is about $5 billion less than the
first-quarter total reported by the National Venture Capital
Association because of different calculation formulas, Lefteroff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related companies attracted $10.8 billion, or 58
percent, of venture capital invested in the first quarter,
PricewaterhouseCoopers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock market's losses since March 31, venture
capitalists don't expect to turn off the investment spigot anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are going through a real renaissance period in
technology and entrepreneurialism,'' said Stewart Alsop, a general
partner at New Enterprise Associates in Menlo Park. ''A guy who
drew up a good idea on a napkin on a coffee table could maybe get
$1 million or $2 million in venture capital a couple years ago.
Now, that guy with the napkin is getting $4 million or $5
million.''
</P>
<P>
   New Enterprise invested $186 million in the first quarter and
isn't pulling back, Alsop said.
</P>
<P>
   The PricewaterhouseCoopers survey also found that venture
capital is increasingly finding its way in regions outside the
country's technological hubs in the San Francisco Bay area, Los
Angeles, Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, venture capital investment in the Midwest totaled
$982 million in the first quarter, up 69 percent from 1999's final
quarter. The Silicon Valley remained the nation's entrepreneurial
hotbed with $6.1 billion in venture capital investments, a 7
percent increase from the fourth quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> FCC Speeds Phone Equipment Approval  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that consumers have an abundance of
choices for their phones, modems and fax machines, federal
regulators are looking to privatize the process that helped build
that competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications equipment -- like phones and faxes -- must meet
certain technical criteria to show that they will not harm the
phone network once they are connected. Currently, the Federal
Communications Commission sets the standards and gives its stamp of
approval to the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But that can slow down the introduction of new products because
the commission has to examine about 4,000 items a year. Each review
can take four or more weeks. The process also puts additional costs
on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules proposed Monday, the FCC would hand over many of
these responsibilities to the private sector. In other words,
industry groups would set and maintain the technical standards to
make sure phones and other equipment don't harm the network. Other
groups or independent labs could then certify the products that
comply with the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Retail outlets for telephone equipment would have been
unthinkable thirty years ago,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard.
But now there is ''a very vibrant, robust, marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Industry Association predicted that such
streamlining could save manufacturers millions of dollars a year
and would ''expedite the process for bringing innovative
telecommunications equipment to the marketplace,'' said the group's
president Matthew J. Flanigan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bell monopoly system -- and before the commission
established its approval process in 1975 -- only phones made by the
company typically were allowed to be hooked into the network. That
created another monopoly in the market for telecommunications
products.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC rules allowed other companies to certify their products
as safe to connect to the Bell network and helped foster
competition. Now retail store chains carry many varieties of phones
and faxes at a variety of prices.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing governmental involvement in the approval process,
the commission hopes to fuel even more innovation in the
marketplace for phone equipment. It could take several months
before the FCC votes to implement the proposed rules, and they take
effect.

<HEADLINE> Court says patients in psychiatric hospital competent to vote  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- They may be patients in a state psychiatric
hospital, but a judge said Monday they are ''presumed competent''
enough to vote and cannot automatically be excluded from casting
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercer County Republican Committee contested any absentee
ballots cast in November 1998 by some patients at the Trenton
Psychiatric Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The county election board deadlocked on how to handle the
ballots, and a lower court judge ordered five of the seven sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a state appeals court says the ballots should be opened,
the votes counted and the election laws interpreted so psychiatric
patients at least get the opportunity to vote.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey law provides that every citizen of the appropriate
age can vote, except those who are ''an idiot or insane,'' Judge
Ariel A. Rodriguez wrote in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, there is no statutory definition of the terms
''idiot'' or ''insane'','' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no evidence ever presented ''as to the competency
of the individual voters,'' Rodriguez wrote. Without evidence
showing an individual voter is incompetent, ''involuntarily
committed residents of a psychiatric hospital are presumed
competent to vote,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   State election law does allow challenges to a specific
individual's right to vote, the judge noted. But ''there are
specific limitations on the powers of the challengers,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such policy derives from the basic precept that the right to
vote is quintessential to our democratic process,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Some may ask whether patients who have been involuntarily
committed to psychiatric hospitals are even able to register an
opinion on candidates, let alone vote, said S. Paul Prior, a staff
attorney for New Jersey Protection and Advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   That question ''goes to the heart of society's misconceptions of
people with mental illness or in psychiatric hospitals,'' said
Prior, who filed the original lawsuit on behalf of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in state hospitals are usually well enough to make
decisions for themselves after a few weeks of treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket objection would be ''almost exactly like'' a
prescription barring residents in senior citizens' homes from
voting, Prior said. Some may be ''infirmed or invalid, but not all
are like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling lays out that the burden of disqualifying the
voter lies with the challenger, Prior said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no different than any political party, any political
organization, challenging anyone else,'' Prior said. ''People with
mental illness should not be treated any differently than anyone
else.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Doctor Returns to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's pediatrician headed back to
Cuba on Monday believing her U.S. visa was about to expire. But
U.S. officials said she could stay another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Caridad de Las Mercedes Ponce de Leon Narvaez boarded a late
morning Continental Airlines flight at Reagan National Airport and
flew to Houston on the first leg of her return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Her departure surprised the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. INS agents caught up with Ponce in Houston and told her
she could fly back to Washington, agency spokeswoman Maria Cardona
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ponce told the agents her plans had already been set,
Cardona said. She planned to arrive in Cuba by way of Cancun,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to immediately return to Washington, Ponce she
said she hoped to rejoin Elian soon, Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce arrived on U.S. soil on April 27 on a two-week visa.
Customs agents confiscated medications she was carrying on grounds
that she was not licensed to treat patients in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her visa expired last Thursday. At the request of Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, her visa was extended until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said Ponce was told late last week the INS was inclined
to allow her to remain until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The INS was prepared to contact Ponce on Monday about her visa
status but learned belatedly that she had booked a seat on the
flight to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody told her she had to go,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport Monday morning, Ponce said she was distressed
about the prospective separation from the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here confident that I would be allowed to stay for as
long as I was needed,'' she said. ''I have every confidence that
this will be resolved and that I will be permitted to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardona said the INS was willing to allow Ponce to remain
because the elder Gonzalez made a strong case on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cardona, Gonzalez said Ponce played a ''very
significant role in creating a stable environment for Elian.'' He
also described her as a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the Maryland retreat with his family for all
but the first few days after he was seized by INS agents from
relatives in Miami on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce said that Elian has had no contact with the relatives
since then, and has declined to talk about his months in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to make him talk about that,'' she said
through a translator. ''We told him he could talk about whatever he
wants....We told him that those people in Miami had some good
qualities. They took care of him during those months.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been joined in Maryland by four classmates, who have
helped him achieve a sense of normalcy after almost five months in
Miami, Ponce said.
</P>
<P>
   Morning classes at the retreat are helping him catch on the
schooling he missed while he was in Miami, Ponce said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father are awaiting a court decision on whether
the boy will be allowed to return to Cuba, as his father wishes.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Could Hurt Whistleblowers  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency that protects
whistleblowers says a recent decision by the Merit Systems
Protection Board could ''gravely threaten'' its ability to prevent
retaliation against employees who raise allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kaplan, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,
criticized a recent ruling by the merit board that ordered OSC to
pay lawyers' fees to officials who are found ''substantially
innocent'' of any charges, even if the decision to prosecute was
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   If the decision stands, it could ''gravely threaten OSC's
ability to deter retaliation against whistleblowers,'' Kaplan said.
''While OSC would never seek to prosecute an agency manager without
possessing a well-founded belief that they had violated the law,
the board's decision would require us to predict to a certainty
that we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   If the agency has to pay lawyers' fees every time it loses a
case, that could take a big chunk of cash out of an agency whose
annual budget is just $9.7 million, according to a watchdog group
that lobbied for the Whistleblower Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it financially unrealistic for the OSC to take those
actions in all but the most extreme cases,'' said Tom Devine, legal
director for the Government Accountability Project, which defends
whistleblowers. ''By requiring victory, the decision's impact is to
raid the Office of Special Counsel's budget when it tries to impose
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a ruling by the merit board earlier this month that
the OSC had to pay the lawyers' fees for two Internal Revenue
Service supervisors cleared of retaliating against employees who
complained to the IRS assistant commissioner for investigations.
The merit board not only dismissed the charges, but agreed that the
supervisors could collect $33,000 in lawyers' fees from OSC.
</P>
<P>
   OSC spokeswoman Jane McFarland said the agency has asked the
Office of Personnel Management to request the merit board to
reconsider its decision. Failing that, the agency can appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland said OSC, instead of bringing charges itself, often
asks federal agencies to discipline employees. ''Agencies could be
more reluctant to self-police themselves if they feel we're not
going to pursue the matter,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> American Home Products Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal grand jury is investigating whether
American Home Products adequately reported adverse events involving
patients taking its diet drugs to the Food and Drug Administration,
the company reported in a filing Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in 1997
after studies linked them to serious heart problems. The drugs were
one half of the fen-phen diet drug combination that was taken by 6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   American Home has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle several
thousand lawsuits from people who took the drugs. A federal judge
in Philadelphia is now weighing whether to approve the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American Home said it was unaware of a Federal Bureau
of Investigation inquiry into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing on Monday, American Home said in early May it had
receive a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the
District of Maryland seeking documents regarding the company's
adverse event reporting system and its reports involving Redux and
Pondimin.
</P>
<P>
   American Home, in the filing, denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> US Skeptical of Russia Economic Aid  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration encouraged new
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday to speed up economic
reforms but said Russia still had not met conditions for receiving
economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As International Monetary Fund staffers flew to Moscow for
preliminary talks, State Department officials said Russia still had
not completed necessary reforms in several areas, including its
banking system and safeguards for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who declined to be identified, said the
administration was encouraging Putin's government to keep working
to meet the requirements necessary to receive funds.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF last July approved $4.5 billion in loans to Russia, and
paid out $640 million before suspending the program until further
reforms were passed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States plays a dominant role in IMF decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Belanger, the IMF's mission chief, is due in Moscow early
next week for technical discussions with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has pledged to reform the economy and bring it closer to
Western standards. He appointed a brain trust in March to draft a
plan for a new economic program. It is expected to make
recommendations later this month.
</P>
<P>
   German Graf, who heads the group, has said Putin prefers rather
radical reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin has named a pro-reform economist, Mikhail
Kasyanov, to be Russia's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   These moves coincide with the approach of President Clinton's
trip to Moscow for talks with Putin June 4-5. Economic reform -- and
the difficult conditions much of the Russian population is trying
to cope with -- is high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov said last week that a new, leaner tax code should be
prepared by the end of May to ''improve the investment climate and
reduce the tax burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, elected in March, has pledged to continue market reforms,
but neither he nor Kasyanov has outlined specific proposals for the
economy.

<HEADLINE> INS Calls Haddam's Asylum an Error  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Algerian Islamic leader alleged to have
terrorist links was mistakenly granted asylum in the United States,
an immigration official said Monday. The asylum was revoked when
the error was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's been in detention for more than three years since
his original asylum request was denied, Anwar Haddam was granted
the special status on an application filed for him by his wife in
the last several months, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the error was made by the wife or the
INS, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Haddam's wife, Nassima, was granted asylum in November, a status
which allows her to apply for her family members. A section of the
application asks whether the family members are in detention or
have other status that makes them ineligible, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether she filled that out incorrectly -- or
whether she did it correctly and the INS overlooked it, the INS
official said.
</P>
<P>
   A physics professor and one-time candidate for parliament,
Haddam and his fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front party won the
first round in Algeria's first-ever multiparty elections in late
1991. But the army canceled the second round in early 1992 when it
became clear the Salvation Front would win.
</P>
<P>
   The party was banned and many of its members were jailed or went
into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Haddam had been living in the Washington area from 1993 through
1996, as a representative of the parliamentary wing of the party
and awaiting a decision on his asylum request.
</P>
<P>
   He was jailed pending deportation in December 1996, when his
asylum was denied on so-called ''secret evidence,'' said his
lawyer, Malea Kiblan.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Nihad Awad of the Council of American Islamic
Relations, said the evidence included allegations that Haddam has
links to terrorist activities in the North African nation. Neither
Haddam nor his lawyer has been given access to this evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It has been alleged that Haddam is tied to the Armed Islamic
Group, a guerrilla movement fighting the military government in
Algeria. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting
in Algeria over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (immigration) service has never produced an iota of
evidence that he belongs to anything other than the Islamic
Salvation Front, which is the party, period,'' Kiblan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has never advocated violence and has always advocated a
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Algeria,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Nassima Haddam filled out the form completely and
correctly, Kiblan said, ''Yes. And we provided them with his alien
registration number.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she got notification by mail Thursday that the asylum
had been granted May 5 and tried for much of the day Friday to
learn why Haddam hadn't been released from detention.
</P>
<P>
   Kiblan said she found a notice revoking the asylum on her fax
machine Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is deemed by the United States to be dangerous,
Haddam has remained in detention since December 1996 while he
fights an immigration order that he be removed from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While he's been held here, he was convicted and sentenced to
death in absentia in Algeria for militant acts.

<HEADLINE> Fire Burns Historic WWII Buildings  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The cluster of sagging, wooden buildings
where U.S. scientists created the world's first atomic bomb were
only recently spared the ravages of time. Now almost all of them
have been destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six buildings that were home to World War II's
top-secret Manhattan Project were reduced to a pile of rubble last
week by the devastating Cerro Grande blaze that also burned more
than 200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire that scorched its way across the Los Alamos National
Laboratory grounds did spare more modern buildings that are key to
the country's nuclear weapons projects. But lab officials said it
destroyed an irreplaceable link with the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were some of the last really significant buildings from
the Manhattan Project era,'' said John Isaacson, who manages
cultural resources at the lab. ''We had really hoped to preserve
them. It's a real loss to our history.''
</P>
<P>
   The buildings were known in the 1940s as V Site. They served as
the center of operations for scientists who perfected and assembled
the explosive lenses used to detonate the Trinity test device, the
world's first nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The one building to survive was the project's final assembly
plant, said Ellen Bradbury, who heads the nonprofit group Recurosos
de Santa Fe, which was raising money to save the structures.
</P>
<P>
   That building was the most historically significant of the six,
Bradbury said Monday, adding her group's fund-raising efforts would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings, like many others at Los Alamos from that era,
were abandoned at the end of Word War II. While others were torn
down to make room for more modern facilities, V Site survived,
mainly because its secluded location made demolition hardly
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   For 55 years the buildings slowly decayed. Their roofs began to
sag and leak, and the desert sun baked their wooden frames to a
brittle texture.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, efforts had begun to save them. After the lab won
a federal grant to restore the structures, volunteers began a drive
to raise matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson said the goal was to turn V Site -- once a
high-security, off-limits area -- into an interpretive center open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But then last week flames from a National Park Service burn that
got out of control spread onto lab property.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were able to save the nation's only active
plutonium facility and other sites, but five of V Site's buildings
fell to the flames one after another.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 60 other World War II-era buildings scattered
around the 43-square mile lab site, Isaacson said. But none of them
hold such historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most just served as storage facilities or an administrative
building,'' he said. ''But V Site was different.''

<HEADLINE> Report: NJ hospitals getting better at cardiac surgery  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- More people are surviving coronary bypass
surgery in New Jersey hospitals, according to a state health
department report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Better medical practices, spurred in part by the state's annual
''report card,'' have improved care for cardiac patients, state
health officials said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1998, the percentage of bypass patients who
died fell from 3.75 percent to 2.6 percent -- a 30 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, surgeons at 14 New Jersey hospitals performed 8,377
bypass surgeries, with 218 patients dying either during the
procedure or in the hospital afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are even better when state health officials adjust
for the severity of a patient's illness. Since very sick patients
are more likely to die, health officials account for various risk
factors -- age, sex and other health conditions, such as whether a
patient also has kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   The adjusted rate dropped nearly 40 percent -- from 4 percent in
1994 to 2.6 percent in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac surgeons said the report has led doctors and hospitals
to closely examine their techniques, identify problem areas and
institute better practices.
</P>
<P>
   Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a treatment used when
one or more coronary arteries are clogged. It's the most common
type of heart procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Health and Senior Services Commissioner Christine
Grant said the report's intent is to get hospitals and surgeons to
scrutinize themselves. She said consumers can also use the
information to seek better care and ask better questions of their
providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant warned against avoiding a hospital because it has a
higher-than-average death rate. Hospitals may have made changes in
their programs since 1998, including having different surgeons or
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives patients one more bit of information as they make
decisions with their doctors,'' said Dr. Alfred Casale, associate
chief of cardiac surgery at the Atlantic Health System.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that two hospitals -- Newark Beth Israel and
Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center in Camden -- had
above-average death rates in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Beth Israel has had higher than average rates for each of
the three years the report has been compiled. State officials
couldn't say exactly why, although they acknowledged that poverty
may be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people tend to wait longer to get medical care and so would
have more serious problems -- some of which are not adjusted for in
the risk factors, explained Dr. Jan Weber, a cardiologist at Our
Lady of Lourdes Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Craig Saunders, cardiology chief at Newark Beth Israel, said
his hospital has completely overhauled its cardiac unit, replacing
many surgeons. He expects patient outcomes to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Volume may also be a factor. National studies show hospitals
that perform more procedures generally get better results. Beth
Israel doctors performed 414 bypasses in 1998, while Cooper
surgeons did 273. That compares to 1,177 at Morristown Memorial
Hospital, which has the best bypass results in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But volume isn't everything. St. Francis in Trenton was the only
other hospital that had lower than average death rates, and the
hospital performed only 238 bypasses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The other 10 hospitals had death rates that were in line with
the state averages.
</P>
<P>
   The report also shows that University Hospital in Newark failed
again to meet state requirements to perform at least 350 surgical
heart procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Health department spokeswoman Rita Manno said the hospital is
hiring a consultant to evaluate the program and come up with ways
to increase volume. The hospital scrapped a plan to merge with
another cardiac unit -- a solution offered when last year's report
card also showed the hospital failing to meet state requirements,
Manno said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous years, this report does not list the success
rate of surgeons who performed more than 100 procedures per year.
Changes in the way the data are collected prevented that, state
health officials said, but promised the information will be on next
year's report card.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Pleads to Rwanda Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- The only foreigner to face charges in
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda changed his plea Monday from innocent
to guilty at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   George Ruggiu, a Belgian-born Italian citizen, faces two counts
of directly and publicly inciting people to commit genocide while
employed at the private Radio Television Libre Des Mille Collines
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus, were slain between April and July 1994 by elements
of the extremist Hutu-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Rwandans organized into militias also took part in the
genocide, egged on by Hutu extremists using radio broadcasts to
incite the slaughter. Tutsi-led rebels ended the blood bath when
they chased the government and the army into exile in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret the events, and I have decided to assume the
responsibility,'' Ruggiu told the court. ''I am guilty because of
what I was directly doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has asked for a 20-year sentence if Ruggiu is
convicted. The maximum sentence the tribunal can hand down is life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiu pleaded innocent in Oct. 24, 1997. On Tuesday he told the
court he had not been pressured into changing his plea.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiu had claimed through defense lawyer Mohamed Aquini that he
was unaware he was being used to incite the killing.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third genocide suspect to plead guilty. The others are
Omar Sherushago and Jean Kabanda, who was interim prime minister
during the genocide. Sherushago was jailed for 15 years and Kabanda
was given a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Created in November 1994 for 10 years, the tribunal has
convicted seven people and is holding another 44 suspected genocide
leaders in a special detention center.

   Another 125,000 people are being held in Rwandan jails on
varying degrees of participation in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Switzerland, a former Rwandan mayor convicted of
genocide opened an appeal against his life sentence Monday,
disputing witness accounts delivered at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgence Niyonteze's appeal against the sentence for murder,
attempted murder, incitement to murder and war crimes, is expected
to last two weeks. It is being heard by a military tribunal in
Geneva, where Niyonteze is imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Niyonteze, 36, was the mayor of Mushubati, in the province of
Gitarama, 30 miles southwest of the capital Kigali. He was accused
of inciting Hutu extremists to kill Tutsis and moderate Hutus and
of supplying them with weapons.

<HEADLINE> Avs' Bourque Scratched From Game 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Colorado Avalanche defenseman Ray Bourque did not
play in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against the Dallas
Stars on Monday night, opting to give his injured left leg a few
more days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque missed the last two games of the second round against
Detroit after being hurt in Game 3 of that series. He will likely
return when the series shifts to Colorado on Friday night for Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has six assists in his eight playoff games, a plus-3
rating and has averaged a team-best 29 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche acquired Bourque on March from the Boston Bruins,
with whom he had spent his entire 21-year career and established
himself as one of the NHL's best defensemen. About the only thing
he hadn't done was win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's arrival sparked a Colorado revival. Including the
postseason, the team is 21-4-1, with victories in 17 of its last 19
outings, since the trade.

<HEADLINE> INS-Cuban Spy Case To Begin Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In the midst of growing tensions over the Elian
Gonzalez case three months ago, the government arrested a senior
immigration official and charged him with handing over U.S. secrets
to a Cuban-American and lying about contacts with the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, jury selection begins in the trial of Mariano Faget,
who was said to be a Cuban spy before federal investigators said he
may not have actually passed secrets to the communist island's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Still, prosecutors say he violated the Espionage Act by failing
to report meetings with Cuban intelligence agents and diplomats and
passing on classified information about a Cuban defector that was
given to him during an FBI sting.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who faces a 10-year prison term if convicted, concedes
the facts of the case and acknowledges errors in judgment, but
denies spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was shown secret documents Feb. 11 and told that a Cuban
official was about to defect. He called New York businessman Pedro
Font 12 minutes later and passed on the information. Font, a
Cuban-American, is a childhood friend of Faget's.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, James Goldman, an Immigration and Naturalization
Service investigator, drove Faget to a meeting with FBI special
agent James Patrick Laflin. Faget was arrested during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Diane Ward tried to get statements made by
Faget during the meeting suppressed, saying her client was the
victim of trickery by Goldman. U.S. District Judge Alan Gold
dismissed the request Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a classic interrogation and he was the focus of the
interrogation,'' Ward told the judge earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Laflin said Faget was arrested because they believed he was not
being truthful with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would be no purpose to arrest him if he was going to
cooperate with the FBI,'' Laflin told the judge. ''He made it plain
to us ... that he was not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Faget also repeatedly lied to agents about how many times he met
with a top Cuban diplomat, Jose Imperatori, insisting it was only
once, the FBI has said. He is charged with making false statements
about his contact with Cuban officials and his involvement in a
company with foreign business connections. Prosecutors dropped a
third charge of making false statements Monday, saying it was not
essential to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Faget has acknowledged meeting with Imperatori but said it was
to talk about potential business opportunities in a post-embargo
Cuba, not to relay U.S. secrets. The case led to Imperatori's
expulsion from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 55, is a Cuban-born U.S. citizen who started working for
the INS as a clerk in 1970 and rose to become acting district
deputy director in Miami before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He has been held without bond since his arrest. The trial is
expected to last a week.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection may be a challenge in a county populated by
800,000 Cuban-Americans, many of whom have strong opinions against
any involvement with Cuba while President Fidel Castro is in power.

<HEADLINE> Continental Drops Fare Increase  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- After leading a round of air fare increases over
the weekend, Continental Airlines Inc. surprisingly rescinded its
decision Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was uncertain whether other carriers also would
abandon the increases of $10 to $30 a round trip on business and
leisure fares. But they predicted future attempts to raise fares
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Continental spokeswoman Julie Gardner confirmed that the
nation's fifth-largest air carrier dropped plans for the fare
increase that was announced Thursday but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the nation's three largest air carriers -- United
Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines -- said they would
match Continental's increase.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 US Airways Inc. had matched both increases Friday but
changed course Monday. ''The fare increase is in effect on our
busines fares but not on our leisure fares,'' US Airways spokesman
David Castelveter said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's reversal left the fare picture clouded at the
onset of the peak vacation travel season.
</P>
<P>
   Though American, Northwest and Delta all said they were
increasing all fares, industry watchers said it appeared those
airlines had rolled back the leisure increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to wait until Tuesday, but my guess is the
leisure hike will be dropped and the business fare will hold,''
said Terry Trippler of 1travel.com, an online seller of discount
travel tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines Corp., the fourth-biggest carrier, fell in
line with the increase Sunday after announcing Friday it would not
raise its prices. Trans World Airlines and America West Airlines
also confirmed Monday they would match the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Delta's tardiness in announcing its
intentions may have doomed a price raise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of those where they had it 100 percent if Delta
moved, but because Delta was slow to match it, and some of the
other airlines chickened out, they all may lose this fare hike,''
said Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, a website that sells
discounted airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But Parson said because this attempt nearly succeeded, the
airlines will take it as a sign to try again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's anything we should be looking for, we should look
for another fare hike attempt,'' Parsons said. ''It doesn't mean
it's over, it just means its over today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the fourth time this year Continental tried to
raise fares. Two Continental-led increases stuck this year, one in
January and one in March.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested Continental was taking advantage of high
service rankings. The airline took first place last week in a
survey of frequent flyers by research firm J.D. Power and
Associates. Airlines were scored on on-time performance, food
service, flight attendants and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they feel they're more in a position to lead on
price,'' said Glenn Engel, an airline industry analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Continental cited rising fuel costs as its original reasons for
boosting fares.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, crude oil prices hovered near $30 a barrel. An
expectation of strong U.S. summer demand pushed the prices over the
$30 mark on Friday for the first time since March 20.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Still Unsure of Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani canceled a fund-raising
trip to California but said Monday he has still not decided whether
to run for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton or what course
of treatment he'll take for his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he still needed to consult with doctors and decide
whether to undergo surgery or radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last week, because of things involving my personal life, my
family and everything else, I didn't have the time,'' he said.
''So, I'm going to need to do that this week. ... You have to make
the decision when you are ready to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past three weeks, Giuliani, 55, has disclosed that he
has treatable prostate cancer and that he is seeking a legal
separation from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, TV personality and actress Donna Hanover, has accused
him of having had a relationship with a former City Hall aide, and
Giuliani himself has acknowledged an ongoing relationship with
another woman, whom he has characterized as a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   Some aren't waiting to see what the mayor will do next.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Building and Construction Trades Council,
representing 200,000 workers in 300 unions, on Monday endorsed
Clinton for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The union previously backed Giuliani for mayor and other
Republicans as well, including Gov. George Pataki and former Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato. Union president Edward Malloy said the group made
its choice in the Senate race a month ago, before Giuliani's health
problems and the extent of his marital woes became known.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Giuliani, Clinton said she was not focused on
her rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no control over what the Republicans do,'' the first
lady said. ''I'm just not thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Further clouding his future in the race, Giuliani canceled a
planned fund-raising swing to Southern California scheduled for
Tuesday and Wednesday, saying he needs to consult with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   He still planned on appearing at a fund-raiser in Manhattan on
Monday evening and is scheduled to appear Thursday at a town
hall-style meeting.

<HEADLINE> NBC Expanding 'Today' to 3 Hours  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The workday is about to expand for Katie Couric
and Matt Lauer. NBC announced Monday it will expand the dominant
''Today'' show from two to three hours this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The show will air from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., starting Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has talked internally about expanding ''Today'' for about 20
years. But a series of factors, including the show's ratings
strength and its immense profitability, made the time right for NBC
President Andrew Lack to announce the move to affiliates on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we've wanted to do for years,'' said ''Today''
executive producer Jeff Zucker. ''The 'Today' show has never been
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Later Today,'' which airs from 9 to 10 a.m. on most NBC
stations, will be pushed back an hour on the 13 NBC
owned-and-operated stations.
</P>
<P>
   Couric and Lauer will be part of the extra hour, but the
additional time will also give NBC the chance to increase the roles
of newscaster Ann Curry and weatherman Al Roker. Both have been
eager to do something more.
</P>
<P>
   The network and its stations clear an estimated $200 million in
profits a year through the ''Today'' show, which dominates ABC's
''Good Morning America'' and ''The Early Show'' on CBS. The chance
for another highly profitable hour was too hard for NBC executives
to resist.
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't want to try it last fall, when ''Later Today''
debuted, because it was concerned about tougher competition for
''Today.'' But ''The Early Show'' has been a ratings disaster for
CBS. ''Good Morning America'' has picked up steam, but has not
seriously challenged NBC's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The network also perceives a potential weakness at 9 a.m. on
many ABC stations when Kathie Lee Gifford leaves ''Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for NBC lies in overexposure or stretching its
''Today'' team too thin. The cable network MSNBC recently tried
airing reruns of ''Today'' in the early afternoon, but it did
poorly in the ratings and was quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''Later Today'' is continuing, Monday's news doesn't
augur well for the talk show. It began last fall to tepid reviews
and mediocre ratings. It will be on at 10 a.m. for roughly
one-third of the nation's television viewers but must be sold in
syndication to the other markets.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Columbine Report  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from Jefferson County Sheriff's Office's
report on the
Columbine High School massacre:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner, a uniformed
officer assigned to the school, drove his car around the school in
response to a radio report of a ''female down'' in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Gardner stepped out of his patrol car, Eric Harris turned
his attention from shooting into the west doors of the school to
the student parking lot and to the deputy. Gardner, particularly
visible in the bright yellow shirt of the community resource
officer uniform, was the target of Harris' bullets. Harris fired
about 10 shots from his rifle at Gardner before his gun jammed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gardner, seeing Harris working with his gun, leaned over the
top of the car and fired four shots. He was 60 yards from the
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seconds later, Harris began shooting again at the deputy.
After the exchange of gunfire, Harris ran back into the building.
Gardner was able to get on the police radio and called for
assistance from other sheriff's units: 'Shots in the building. I
need someone in the south lot with me.' It was 11:26 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At 11:29 a.m., the gunmen entered the school library yelling,
'Get up!' Some witnesses reported hearing one of them yell,
'Everyone with a white cap or baseball cap, stand up.' Others
reported hearing, 'All jocks stand up. We'll get the guys in the
white hats!'
</P>
<P>
   ''When no one stood up, a witness heard one of the gunmen say,
'Fine, I'll start shooting.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''Harris, noticing a student under Table 11, told him to
identify himself. The student, who was an acquaintance of Dylan
Klebold, identified himself and asked Klebold what he was doing.
Klebold replied, 'Oh, just killing people.'
</P>
<P>
   ''The student asked if Klebold was going to kill him. Klebold
told him to get out of the library, which he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Valeen (Schnurr), who was critically hurt, began to cry 'Oh
God, help me.' Klebold, who had shot her, came back and taunted her
about her belief in God. He then walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Within the span of 16 minutes, the gunmen had killed 13 people
and wounded 21 others. A savage act of domestic terrorism, their
crime is the deadliest school shooting in the history of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At one time or another, the number of shooters believed to be
involved in the incident ranged from two to eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a report that a suspect had escaped the school. ...
There were reports of snipers on the roof of the school. ... There
were continued reports of bombs exploding. ... There were numerous
reports of hostages throughout the school. This information came
from people within the school and from law enforcement officers who
interpreted their observations.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Klebold fired 188 shots, including 37 shotgun
rounds and 151 9mm rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the shotgun rounds, Harris fired 25, including 21 inside the
library, and Klebold fired 12, including six inside of the library.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 9mm rounds, Harris filed 96, including 47 outside the
building, and Klebold fired 55, including 52 inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''A total of 141 shots were fired by law enforcement officers at
Columbine High School. ... No individual was hit or injured by
'friendly fire.'''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Peacekeepers Stranded  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- More than 100 U.N. peacekeepers
freed by Sierra Leone's rebels were stranded Monday in a remote
corner of neighboring Liberia as negotiators worked for the release
of hundreds of others still being held captive.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend releases of some U.N. hostages gave guarded hope
that the imperiled U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone could
be put back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can imagine, the morale (of U.N. personnel) is good and
their men are encouraged by this,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said in New York. ''Things are improving every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month-old peace agreement was shattered this month after
Revolutionary United Front rebels seized about 500 U.N. captives
and fighting broke out between rebels and government troops. Most
of the hostages are believed to be Zambian.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels freed a total of 157 hostages over the weekend, but
as of Monday, only a small number had been able to return safely to
their units. The biggest group of freed hostages -- about 124 -- was
awaiting evacuation from the town of Foya on Liberia's border with
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing very serious logistical problems to airlift
them,'' said Lassana Kouyate, a senior official with the 14-nation
West African economic group, ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian officials who negotiated the captives' release said
they did not have enough aircraft to evacuate those released. In
addition, road access to Foya is almost impossible during the
spring rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.N. official in Liberia
said the United Nations was unwilling to fly its own helicopters
near rebel territory for fear they would be shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Another 18 hostages were allowed Sunday to return to an Indian
U.N. contingent in eastern Sierra Leone. However, their safety, was
not guaranteed. The area remained surrounded by rebels, and U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard called it a ''kind of relaxed detention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 freed U.N. captives were flown by a
government-chartered helicopter to Liberia's capital, Monrovia, on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels continued to hold about 350 U.N. hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Oluyemi Adeniji, the U.N. special representative to Sierra
Leone, said no concessions had been made for the releases, and he
praised Liberia's President Charles Taylor for his role in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is the RUF's closest ally in the region and had been
asked by West African leaders to mediate with rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor claimed the United States had refused air transport to
evacuate the freed hostages, and that the men were therefore forced
to trek through the jungle for nearly three days after their truck
got stuck on bad roads. U.S. ambassador to Liberia Bismark Myrick
declined immediate comment on the claims Monday, describing the
hostage crisis as ''delicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has long had strained relations with the West,
warned that continued attacks by Sierra Leone's government and its
allies against the rebels ''threaten the lives'' of the remaining
U.N. captives.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council heard a closed-door
briefing on Sierra Leone from Bernard Miyet, the
undersecretary-general for peacekeeping who returned from the West
African country last week.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters afterwards, Miyet defended the U.N. force
arguing that it had succeeded in protecting the capital, Freetown.
He said Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front ''is on the
defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan hinted Monday that the hostage crisis could cost RUF
leader Foday Sankoh the ministerial post he was given as part of
the peace agreement made last July. As commissioner for the
management of strategic resources, national reconstruction and
development, Sankoh is in charge of the diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot have a state where a group of rebels arrogate
themselves the right to exploit the riches of the country either
for themselves or for a war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their eight-year campaign against the government, the rebels
have killed tens of thousands and mutilated and dismembered many
more in a bid to gain power through intimidation.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Activate Catalanotto  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers infielder Frank
Catalanotto was activated Monday from the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for him, infielder Tom Evans was placed on the
15-day DL, retroactive to May 11, with right shoulder problems. An
MRI on Friday revealed Evans has a partial tear of his rotator cuff
and a torn labrum in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined whether Evans, who was batting .278
with five RBIs in 23 games, will have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto pulled his left groin on April 21 and was placed on
the disabled list the following day. He was sent on a
rehabilitation assignment to Triple-A Oklahoma City on Friday. He
is hitting .500 with eight RBIs in nine games with the big-league
club.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rusty Greer was sent to Double-A Tulsa on Monday on a
rehab assignment. Greer, batting .240 with one homer and five RBIs
in seven games, was placed on the 15-day DL on April 13 with a left
hamstring injury and underwent arthroscopic surgery April 16.

<HEADLINE> Gore Slams Bush on Social Security  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush proposed letting
Americans invest Social Security taxes in the stock market Monday,
appealing for support from the millions of people who have thrived
in a booming market.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential rival Al Gore condemned the idea as a dangerous
gamble that would turn the solemn obligations of the 65-year-old
retirement plan into ''a system of winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   In what could be one of the defining issues of the general
election campaign, Bush outlined his plans for modernizing Social
Security in a speech to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, the Republican said, ''this generation and this
president will save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ''I am here with a message for America and to put my
opponent on notice: The days of spreading fear and panic are
over.'' Yet he also said that unless proper action is taken the
system is heading for ''the moment of financial collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he raised a vision that under his plan -- with
many details still to come -- ''a worker who invests even a limited
portion of his or her paycheck could, over a career, end up with
hundreds of thousands of dollars for retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not say how much of the current 12.4 percent Social
Security tax should be freed for private investment; the most
commonly discussed option is for 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in suburban Philadelphia, contended that diverting money
into the stock market would risk Social Security's promise of a
guaranteed income to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners
and losers, we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too
many Americans and in the end we will all have to pay to make up
the differences,'' the Democratic vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Bush's event, a group with apparently more passion than
spelling ability hired a plane that trailed a banner reading:
''Don't privities Social Security.'' The group, 2030 Action, says
it speaks for people in their 20s and 30s who oppose partial
privatization of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, however, is supported by many younger workers who are
not averse to risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grandma always said, 'Don't put all your eggs in one
basket,''' said Richard Thau, president of Third Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Bush is betting his proposal will show he is
willing to tackle vexing issues in a bipartisan manner. He also
hopes it will be embraced by the new class of investors and
e-traders who have propelled the stock market to unprecedented
heights.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is exactly what the American workers want,'' said Leanne
Abdnor, director of a lobbying coalition of employers, including
the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said the costs of
privatization ''are unavoidably enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore retains an advantage in polls among senior citizens -- a
group that considers Social Security sacred and is a consistent
voting bloc. The vice president led Bush 49 percent to 40 percent
among those 65 and over in a poll this month by the Pew Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
   However, he had led the Texas governor by more than three times
that margin in a Pew poll in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a reduction in the payroll tax, that money has to be made
up or unfortunately it leads to difficult trade-offs,'' said Martin
Corry, director of federal affairs for AARP, the nation's largest
organization of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   Americans trust Gore over Bush on the issue of handling Social
Security, 47 percent to 39 percent, according to a CBS-New York
Times poll released Monday. The idea of allowing people to invest
some of their Social Security funds is supported by just over half
the public, with more than half of 18- to 44-year-olds supporting
it, and a majority of adults over age 45 opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of Social Security reform is driven by demographics:
Life expectancies are increasing, the 77-million-member baby boom
generation is about to retire and fewer workers will be working to
cover benefit payments. As it now stands, the system is projected
to become insolvent in 2037.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also pledged to:
</P>
<P>
   --Maintain current benefits for those at or near retirement.
</P>
<P>
   --Put payroll taxes off limits to prevent borrowing against the
Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Refuse to increase payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   --Preserve the system's current provision to pay benefits to
widows, widowers and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit the government itself from investing Social Security
funds in the stock market, preferring instead to let individuals
make the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, at Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., said: ''Today when
Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing ... but
in reality the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken
our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's advisers also say Bush hasn't fully
accounted for up to $1 trillion in costs that would be incurred as
the system began taking in less money from workers but paying out
the same benefits until the transition was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, conceded that
some of the costs might have to be paid out of the treasury, but
said such projections are too far off to allow for accurate
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined his principles for Medicare, the medical
insurance program for the elderly, such as giving every recipient a
choice of health plans including at least one providing
prescription drug coverage.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts School Impact Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers agreed to increase the funds
that go to school districts where federal operations, such as
military installations, cut into the local tax base.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, on a voice vote Monday, provided $906 million for
Impact Aid, one of the largest programs in the federal K-12 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Impact Aid is truly a federal responsibility,'' Rep. Bill
Goodling, R-Pa., said of the legislation -- which enjoyed a
bipartisanship rare among the latest round of education lawmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also allowed schools to count children living in
privatized military housing and sets aside construction money for
schools with health or safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
   School systems get most of their money from state income taxes
or local property taxes on homes and businesses. But they can lose
revenues because the military pays no property taxes and service
people shop at commissaries and avoid sales taxes. The 1950 law
first signed by President Truman mainly funds school districts
according to how many of the nation's 1.3 million military children
they teach.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 17 million children are affected by financially
struggling districts, said John Forkenbrock, executive director of
the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can expect stability,'' Forkenbrock said Monday.
''There's been a lot of anxiety among school administrators over
what happens when property is deeded to private developers'' who
build housing for military families.
</P>
<P>
   Many military posts have schools run by the Defense Department,
but military families often send their children to civilian schools
-- either because they live off base or the post doesn't have a
nearby Defense Department school.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Scott, a Democrat from the Norfolk, Va., area, also
said schools suffer in metro areas such as his district -- where
many families are connected with the military but not necessarily
living on bases.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, said Forkenbrock, downsizing overseas has brought more
military families to U.S. installations. The new plan would give
more money to a school systems like Killeen, Texas, which is
expanding because of new arrivals to the nearby Fort Hood army
post, he said.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers approved nearly $200 million more than proposed
for this year's budget by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department spokeswoman Erica Lepping said the House
legislation expands the number of districts eligible for the
money,and doesn't properly target the neediest schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the needs of the Impact Aid community would
adequately be met by the funding level the president proposed,''
Lepping said. She said the department had no overall objections to
the bill, but would like to negotiate changes in the funding
formulas that ''reflect current costs and needs rather than be
based on outdated calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., whose district includes Offutt Air Force
base, said Monday: ''Our students and teachers should not be
treated as second class citizens. Every year Congress rides to the
rescue of these schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's version of the program also calls for more funds
and formula adjustments. But unlike the separate House bill, its
Impact Aid funding is part of a larger bill renewing all of the
programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   That $20 billion bill -- the subject of much debate over federal
control of education -- is pending because Senators agreed to work
on military construction issues this week.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The Impact Aid bill number is H.R. 3616.

<HEADLINE> Gore Saves the Day on 'Futurama'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENSIDE, Pa. (AP) -- It's a cartoon Al Gore on a TV show that no
one would mistake for the nightly news. But when you're running for
president, saving the day in any form is worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the perks of power beyond Air Force Two, Gore takes a
guest turn on ''Futurama,'' the Fox cartoon featuring characters
making their way through the 30th century.
</P>
<P>
   Producer David Cohen read that ''Futurama'' was one of Gore's
favorite shows and arranged for the vice president to play himself
in the season finale airing Sunday, May 21.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode, the mad scientist, Prof. Farnsworth, invents a
''What If?'' machine that lets each character find out what would
happen if one of their wishes was granted.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, a 20th century guy who is cryogenically frozen and wakes up
in the future, asks what would have happened had he not bumped his
head and fell into the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   He goes back to 1999, learns that his life was just as lame as
before the bump on the head, and it falls to Gore and his team of
''Action Rangers'' to return Fry to the 30th century.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting Gore are physicist Stephen Hawking, Star Trek actress
Nichelle Nichols and Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons &AMP; Dragons.

<HEADLINE> McCain Rips GOP on 'Pork' Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flashing his maverick instincts anew, Sen.
John McCain warned his own Republican Party leadership on Monday
that the voters will ''repudiate'' them for ''profligate''
pork-barrel projects they put into spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The vanquished GOP presidential contender used words including
''offensive,'' ''appalled'' and ''ashamed'' to describe projects
lawmakers included in an $8.6 billion military construction bill
while omitting $6 million to help 12,000 military families come off
the food stamp rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican said there are $900 million worth of
projects in the bill that the Defense Department has not requested.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Republican leadership and the chairmen of these
committees continue to spend taxpayers' dollars in this profligate
manner, sooner or later the American people will repudiate these
actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ''This bill is a classic example of the
abrogation of our responsibilities to average taxpayers, those who
are not represented'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For years, McCain has complained about home-district projects
his colleagues add to spending bills, and Monday's remarks were a
continuation of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this time they came after a presidential campaign
in which he strove to cast himself as an independent voice who is
not afraid to take on causes, even ones unpopular among other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, McCain's comments were loaded with specific examples
of projects he found objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the first one he mentioned was the bill's section 2109,
which he dryly described as ''a funding profile for a ship that has
not been requested by the Navy, cannot be built under the expedited
process the ship's congressional sponsor seeks to impose.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he mentioned no names, that project is sponsored by
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott supported Texas
Gov. George W. Bush for the GOP presidential nomination and made
several tart remarks about McCain while the senator's campaign was
still under way.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for providing at least a $263 million installment
on a $1.5 billion LHD-8 amphibious assault ship to be built at a
shipyard in Lott's hometown of Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about McCain's remarks, Lott spokesman John Czwartacki
cited comments from a speech he said McCain made last December 7 in
New York. According to Czwartacki, McCain said the Navy has
''neglected modernization'' of such ships, adding, ''We must begin
immediately to buy equipment on which our future security
depends.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's exactly what we're trying to do,'' Czwartacki said.

<HEADLINE> Most of Los Alamos, N.M., Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- More than three-quarters of Los Alamos
was reopened to residents Monday, while the fire that burned down
260 homes raged out of control on other fronts, including an Indian
reservation where historic sites have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were allowed back into the less-severely damaged parts
of this town of 11,000, but Police Chief Rich Melton said they
would have to get by without gas and electricity, possibly for a
week. The Los Alamos nuclear laboratory remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic blaze, with an 89-mile perimeter, was burning into
a canyon Monday on the edge of an Indian reservation, where tribal
fire spokesman Alvin Warren said it destroyed some ''culturally
sensitive archaeological sites'' over the weekend. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   So far firefighters have managed to keep the flames away from
the tribal homes at the Santa Clara Pueblo, where about 1,500
people live. However, the fire came within a quarter-mile of cliff
dwellings in a popular hunting and fishing area about 15 miles
northeast of Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the 44,000-acre blaze was 28 percent contained. More
than 1,500 firefighters worked furiously to surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time they see a plume of smoke, it will be attacked
vigorously,'' fire spokesman Jim Paxon said. ''Today, we're mopping
up and holding the line.'' But Paxon warned: ''This does not mean
the total threat of fire to Los Alamos is gone. It's diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   The main worry was the National Weather Service's forecast of
wind gusting to 50 mph Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was that high when the fire first jumped into Los
Alamos last Wednesday, forcing the evacuation first of the entire
town and then parts of the surrounding area, for a total of 25,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos Fire Chief Doug MacDonald said officials were sure
there would be no problem in reopening 80 percent of Los Alamos
while the fire continues to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel confident or we would not make the recommendation to
come back,'' he said. ''We evacuated once and we don't want to
evacuate twice.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 7,000 residents of suburban White Rock were allowed
back home. Firefighters have said it may be more than a week before
the others can return and weeks before the blaze is out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little concerned about the weather -- the winds may
shift,'' said Terry Coggeshall, a returning White Rock resident who
was afraid her homecoming might be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, spokeswoman Kay Roybal
said officials were checking to see whether the facilities might be
ready to reopen. They had been closed a full week as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to take air samples Monday to check for
radioactivity from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos fire was started May 4 on Bandelier National
Monument by National Park Service officials hoping to clear brush
and deadwood. But the blaze raged out of control. Park
Superintendent Roy Weaver has been placed on leave pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, firefighters tried to keep the fire from spreading
farther into the Santa Clara Indian Pueblo or onto the Baca Ranch,
a majestic 95,000-acre volcanic area being purchased by the Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the fire had consumed more than 6,000 acres of
Pueblo land -- ''more than 10 percent of our reservation.'' Pueblo
Gov. Denny Gutierrez said the fire was burning near a creek that
the tribe depends on for its water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our lifeline coming down from that canyon,'' he said.
''Our watershed is there, cultural matters in the valley. It's very
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a total of 405 families have lost their homes in
the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the state's congressional
delegation will meet Tuesday in Washington to begin planning the
government compensation effort.

<HEADLINE> Racial profiling the issue as Florio, Corzine debate on radio  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The close confines of a radio studio did not
dampen the vigor with which Jim Florio and Jon Corzine hacked at
each other Monday in the second of their debates in the Democratic
primary for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first debate last week in a New Jersey Network studio,
Florio seized on the chance to get at his wealthy opponent in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last week, however, Corzine offered stiffer opposition.
He was composed, dealt out direct replies to Florio's attacks and
made clear statements on his proposals on education, health care,
police discrimination and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine faulted Florio for doing too little to address racial
profiling by state troopers during his term as governor from 1990
to January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really think this was an issue that was addressed
adequately under the governor's tenure,'' Corzine said, noting that
two Newark leaders, Mayor Sharpe James and U.S. Rep. Donald Payne,
brought the issue to Florio's attention and were ignored. Both are
now Corzine supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he did address racial discrimination with executive
orders that reduced the number of reported incidents. He claimed
the incidents increased again only in 1995 after Gov. Christie
Whitman had taken office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a falloff in some of the incidents that were
reported to us, particularly by the (American Civil Liberties
Union), which was monitoring these things. Then, after I left
office, apparently there was a picking up again of this and so when
the United States Justice Department came to New Jersey and
reviewed the records for 10 years back, they concluded there was a
sufficient pattern of this sort of activity from 1995 on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said, ''I guess the Florio
rewriting history tour continues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said federal agencies began investigating after a 1996 state
court ruling concerning the troopers' practices on the New Jersey
Turnpike. ''The case dealt with activity during the Florio
administration, and it was after that decision came out that the
Justice Department became involved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Former ACLU director Ed Martone said Florio did respond to the
group's complaints in 1990 and implemented retraining for troopers
that the ACLU helped to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result was that at the ACLU, we saw a sharp decline in the
complaints we were getting about it,'' Martone said. ''I can't draw
a conclusion from that, that therefore, profiling stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was broadcast live from the Manhattan studios of
WLIB-AM, a station that gears its programming toward black
listeners. The hosts and some callers raised the issues of racial
profiling, the death penalty and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates will face off again Tuesday night at Beth Shalom
in Livingston and Thursday at News 12 New Jersey studios in Edison.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are at polar opposites on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he would press for an immediate moratorium on all
executions, while Florio said such moves might be warranted in some
states but not in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 60 percent of the people on death row in America are
people of color. I think there is something afoul,'' Corzine said.
''We need to move very sharply to get this done, and I think we
should go to a moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Florio said Corzine's ambitious plans to
expand spending on preschools and health care would devour the
federal budget surplus needed to reinforce Social Security in
future decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''If in fact you use up the non-Social Security surplus for
Jon's various schemes, the Social Security system will pay a
devastating price,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor, you are demagoging this issue, ''Corzine fired back,
accusing him of trying to needlessly scare voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no proposal that I am talking about that cannot be
funded,'' Corzine said. ''If we want to make sure that the trust
fund grows adequately for this baby boom generation that's coming
down the pike, we are going to have to make some small, incremental
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   On education, Florio told the WLIB listeners, ''He has not come
forward with Word One as to what he would do to try and improve the
schools in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine again was ready for the jab. ''Well, governor, that is
because you haven't been listening. The fact is I have talked about
doubling the expenditure of the federal government over the next
five years on preschool, reconstruction of schools, smaller class
size, bringing standards to bear.''

<HEADLINE> Fires May Uncover Historical Sites  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Although dangerous and destructive, wildfires
like those raging across New Mexico and Arizona can also have
beneficial effects. One is uncovering archaeological sites crucial
to understanding an area's history, experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire reduces vegetation, sometimes revealing clues to earlier
civilizations. Archaeological findings in the wake of fires are so
common that firefighting teams routinely include archaeologists who
advise on how to protect potential sites.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists are assisting in the fire that has consumed more
than 44,000 acres of forest and destroyed 260 homes in Los Alamos,
N.M. As of now, they are sure the fire has damaged more sites than
it will reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is very little good about this fire,'' said Mike
Elliott, an archaeological assistant at the Santa Fe National
Forest. He noted that among other things, the fire is so hot it can
split and chemically alter rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The fire has already destroyed some sensitive archaeological
sites on the edge of the Santa Clara Pueblo, an Indian reservation
15 miles northeast of Los Alamos, said tribal fire spokesman Alvin
Warren. He did not elaborate on the damage.
</P>
<P>
   An example of fire than did some good from an archaeological
perspective is a 1996 blaze at the Mesa Verde National Park in
Colorado. It exposed more than 400 archaeological sites, mainly
cliff dwellings and small dams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sites had been covered by dense oak brush and a pinon
juniper forest until the fire eliminated the density,'' said Jane
Anderson, the project manager for the rehabilitation of the nearly
4,800-acre area.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, dating back to the 1200s and 1300s, had been
inhabited by the ancestral Pueblo Indians who now live along the
Rio Grande, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists were surprised by the sites' density, which
suggested more people living in the area than initially thought,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several fires in 1996 near Flagstaff, Ariz., revealed both
historic and prehistoric sites. They ranged from logging and
railroad lines about 80 years old to artifacts dating from 700 to
1100, said Linda Farnsworth, a Forest Service archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   But while fires can reveal archaeological sites, firefighters'
suppression efforts can damage them.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers and heavy machinery can destroy sites and fire
retardants dropped from helicopters can stain rocks, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Often the only vestige of a wall is a row of rocks, she said.
''To an untrained eye, it would be very easy to dig that up,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said archaeologists are already planning how to protect
what may be left after the fire near Los Alamos is extinguished --
particularly from erosion expected once summer rains hit deforested
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't fix what the fire has done to the sites,'' Elliott
said. ''But we can slow erosion and other problems in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Drifter Not Insane  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Admitted serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz
did not suffer from paranoid schizophrenia or any other major
psychosis when he killed a Houston-area physician, a
court-appointed psychiatrist testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to testimony from two defense experts, Dr. Ramon Laval
said the 40-year-old Mexican drifter suffers from several
personality disorders and harbors ''strange'' beliefs, but was not
insane when he killed Dr. Claudia Benton in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew what he was doing,'' said Laval.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz's beliefs that he has supernatural powers,
such as the ability to predict disasters or leave his own body, are
not signals of major mental illness, Laval testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''However idiosyncratic, strange or weird, these are not
delusions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity in the slaying of Benton, one of nine killings he
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Dr. Bruce Cohen, a forensic psychiatrist
testifying for Maturino Resendiz, said the defendant suffered from
delusions brought on by paranoid schizophrenia, or the inability to
discern reality.
</P>
<P>
   During his third and final day on the stand, Cohen acknowledged
that Maturino Resendiz knew that killing Benton and eight others in
three states between 1997 and 1999 was illegal, but maintained that
he thought he was doing God's work in his diseased mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would agree he was acting out of severe anger,'' Cohen said.
''But the question is, what was the basis of that anger?''
</P>
<P>
   Before resting, defense attorney Allen Tanner attempted for a
second time to admit into evidence a videotape of Maturino
Resendiz's initial interrogation the night after his surrender in
El Paso in July. State District Judge Bill Harmon withheld a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Melissa Ferguson, another psychiatrist and director of the
Harris County Mental Health-Mental Retardation Authority's jail
unit, said she detected no severe mental illness upon his arrival
July 14.
</P>
<P>
   He was later admitted to the jail's psychiatric ward on a
suicide watch, but Ferguson said she diagnosed him with
depression-related psychosis, never paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   She did note, however, that his thoughts seemed to revolve
around ''hyperreligious'' subjects that indicate a personality
disorder. The defense claims deluded Judeo-Christian beliefs are at
the root of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Tanner, Ferguson said a regimen of
anti-psychotic drugs caused Maturino Resendiz to tone down his
religious rantings, adding that his delusions had stemmed from
depression instead of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's first rebuttal witness was a convicted bank
robber who testified that he and Maturino Resendiz counseled fellow
inmates on pleading insanity while they were in prison in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mitchell Rollins, 43, who remains at a federal prison in
Florence, Colo., said Maturino Resendiz even helped him make a
bogus incompetence claim to try to win a new trial when they were
cellmates in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ordered some books and read up on it,'' Rollins said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers expected jurors to get the case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If found innocent, Maturino Resendiz likely would be sent to a
mental institution for an undetermined time and still would face at
least six other capital murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict would mean either lethal injection or life in
prison, with no chance of parole for 40 years.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cops Plead Innocent to Perjury  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first three officers charged in the
city's massive police corruption probe are victims of a lying
ex-cop whose status as super-informant has led authorities to treat
him like a rock star, defense attorneys claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the policemen pleaded innocent to perjury and falsifying a
police report, their lawyers denounced ex-officer Rafael Perez,
whose allegations of beatings, shootings and frame-ups have led to
the dismissal of cases against 80 defendants, many of whom had
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 officers have come under scrutiny since Perez,
hoping for a lighter sentence on charges that he stole cocaine from
a police evidence locker, began telling investigators last year of
wrongdoing in the Rampart station's anti-gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Sgt. Edward Ortiz, Sgt. Brian Liddy and Officer
Paul Harper involves the alleged planting of a gun on a gang member
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Barry Levin, who represents Ortiz, and other defense
lawyers criticized authorities for giving too much credence to the
claims of Perez, who was sentenced to five years in prison but was
given blanket immunity for abuses he described.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perez got the deal of a lifetime,'' said Levin. ''They treat
him like he was a rock star. It's really disgusting, the way the
district attorney falls all over Rafael Perez.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Paul DePasquale, an attorney for Liddy: ''When he's
accompanied from place to place with his all-star treatment, they
refer to him as Elvis. They say 'Elvis is in the building' or
'Elvis has left the building.' You practically have to learn a
special handshake to cross-examine Perez.''
</P>
<P>
   District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons had no comment on
the defense statements.
</P>
<P>
   While the officers were being arraigned in state court, a judge
threw out the first federal conviction to be tainted by the Rampart
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. dismissed the case
against Jorge Sisco Aguilar, who drew a nearly six-year sentence
for being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm. Hatter
said he had little confidence in two Rampart officers who testified
at Sisco's 1997 trial.

<HEADLINE> Keyes: Racial issues have no place in debate over school pledge  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Alan Keyes on Monday
condemned black lawmakers who oppose a measure to require
schoolchildren to recite part of the Declaration of Independence
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said he had a difficult time understanding the
''stupidity'' of people who denounce the recitation and say it is
offensive to black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes said the Declaration of Independence was crucial to ending
slavery in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been the key, the source of these battles and the
source of the courage it took to fight them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes spoke during a Statehouse news conference at which Sen.
Gerald Cardinale, R-Bergen, tried to revive his effort to get the
school pledge measure approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It was posted for a vote in March, but was tabled after
Cardinale lost votes because of opposition from black senators.
They objected to the clause that says, ''All men are created
equal'' because when the declaration was written, that basic
democratic principle did not apply to black people.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinale assembled a small group of clergy, lawyers and a
corrections officer, who all spoke about the merits of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinale said he hoped the show of support from the black
community will persuade more lawmakers to vote for the bill. He
added, however, that he has the needed 21 votes, once Sen. Walter
Kavanaugh, R-Somerset, who has been sick, returns to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, a black legislator who opposes the
measure, said the declaration ''is a great historic document that
should be taught in its proper context ... Rote recitation
subliminally infuses in our young people a very different history
than what is the reality of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has been kicking around the Statehouse
for 13 years, would require children in grades three through 12 to
recite the following portion of the historic document:
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent
of the governed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require school districts to teach students
about the document, explaining the historical context, such as why
it refers only to men, and that it was written while slavery was
accepted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say a daily recitation will help instill basic
democratic values in children. They say the recitation will be
coupled with lessons, making it more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, say a daily recitation will trivialize the
ideas. They also question why lawmakers want to single out the
declaration when many other important historical documents exist.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Suspect's Sanity Debated  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN CHRISTENSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The man accused of gunning down seven of his
Xerox Corp. co-workers believed the company ''was messing with
him'' and ''hated his co-workers because he thought they made him
look bad,'' a prosecutor argued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Peter Carlisle also said Byran Uyesugi, 40,
''deliberately, methodically and maliciously'' killed the victims
Nov. 2 at the company's downtown warehouse -- an argument meant to
rebut Uyesugi's insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not want Xerox to fire him and he didn't want those men
in that room to have the satisfaction of seeing him lose his job,''
Carlisle said during opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''So he pumped 25 bullets into unarmed men and deliberately,
methodically and maliciously became a mass murderer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi's attorneys did not deny that their client was the
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   However, the former copier repairman had a ''serious,
long-standing and deeply ingrained'' mental illness that manifested
itself through ''delusions and distorted thinking,'' attorney
Rodney Ching said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Uyesugi saw ''dark shadows around his home,'' Ching
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He also suffered from the sensation of being poked in the
head. The only way he would get relief would be to pick up an
object ... and poke back at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi's erratic behavior -- including threats against
co-workers and an arrest for damaging a downtown office elevator
after arguing with a customer -- was addressed during evaluations by
Xerox and mental health experts beginning in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During those evaluations, Uyesugi said he was being spied on by
the FBI, CIA and his co-workers, and those co-workers were
sabotaging his copiers and their spare parts, Ching said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Uyesugi was suffering from a serious mental illness on the
day of the shootings,'' Ching said. ''And as a result of Mr.
Uyesugi's mental disorder, he lacked substantial capacity to
appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the
shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi faces one count of first-degree murder for the multiple
killings, seven counts of second-degree murder and one count of
attempted murder in the second degree for allegedly shooting at an
eighth man, who escaped.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces a maximum life imprisonment without
parole. Hawaii does not have the death penalty. If acquitted by
reason of insanity, he could be confined at the state psychiatric
hospital in Kaneohe.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, three court-appointed examiners said
Uyesugi suffered from schizophrenia and delusions of persecution.
But those experts said Uyesugi knew right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle argued that Uyesugi -- a high school sharpshooter who
owned 11 handguns, five rifles and two shotguns -- was fully
responsible for his actions Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''He stood over the men as they were on the floor, on the ground
already struck down by bullets, completely defenseless, and shot
into their hearts to make absolutely certain there was no chance
any of them had at survival,'' Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why kill? Anger and hate. He was angry at Xerox because he
thought they were constantly messing him and constantly looking for
reasons to fire him,'' Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hated his co-workers because he thought they made him look
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors visited the scene of the shootings Monday afternoon. The
trial resumes Wednesday and is expected to last about a month.

<HEADLINE> Girl Killed in Teen Driver Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- A teen-ager too young to hold a
driver's license was fleeing from police when he crashed his
parents' car through a drainage ditch and sent it airborne into a
swimming pool, killing a 12-year-old passenger, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were investigating a report of a suspicious car at 2:30
a.m. Sunday when they spotted the sedan with Michael Singh, 14, at
the wheel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the car sped away, but officers didn't chase it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect that when he saw the police car in back of him that
he panicked because he had no license and did not have
authorization to have the car,'' police spokesman Chuck Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The car went through a stop sign, careened through a vacant lot
and crashed into a 50-foot wide drainage ditch, which sent the car
over a fence and into a swimming pool, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaily Pittman, 12, was conscious when pulled from the vehicle by
a police officer who dove into the pool, but collapsed shortly
after and died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and sisters Jeanna Collins, 15, and Carly Ann Collins, 12,
were pulled from the car and were being treated for undisclosed
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, teen-agers must be 15 before they can get a
learner's license, and 15-year-olds are allowed to drive only
between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. with an adult licensed driver in the
front seat.

<HEADLINE> NFL a Houston Topic Again  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A new home for Houston's NFL expansion team
being built to replace the Astrodome isn't the only construction
going on. Charley Casserly is quietly building a team to play there
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 23 years helping the Washington Redskins become
archrivals of the Cowboys, Casserly has moved closer to Dallas as
executive vice president and general manager of the Houston
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to sign 100 players our first year, that's our
challenge that we have to make and beat the odds,'' Casserly told a
gathering of the Southwest Region of the Associated Press Sports
Editors on Monday. ''There are some people who say we can't beat
the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly put together Redskins teams that won three Super Bowls
before he was fired in 1999 by new owner Daniel Snyder. Houston
franchise owner Bob McNair quickly took Casserly off the
unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Casserly is taking aim at the Cowboys with the same
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to realize the great job that Tex Schramm (former
Cowboys general manager) did in really promoting the state of
Texas,'' Casserly said. ''What we have to do is to build a solid
base and take one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo said he's looking forward to having a
cross-state rival beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good there are two professional football teams in Texas.
It is too big a state to have just one,'' Campo said. ''We want to
have a relationship with them, playing scrimmages somewhere or
something along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston franchise doesn't even have a name yet, but Casserly
is busily completing a scouting staff to begin searching out talent
for the team's first draft in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is money spent with nothing coming in,'' Casserly said.
''This is a part of a philosophy that Bob McNair has of wanting to
do things the right way. I believe that's why we're going to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly will put his scouting crew to work this summer and then
turn his attention to getting the city ready for a return to NFL
football; the Oilers left for Tennessee after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are getting some great input on our practice facilities ...
will be the finest in the league and our stadium will be among the
finest,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly expects McNair to build his new football franchise in
much the same way as he got into horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been in horse racing for five years and it was a slow
process,'' Casserly said. ''He's already bred a Kentucky Derby
winner. We are building a house. If we don't finish it in Year 1,
we've got Year 2 and we've got Year 3. We are going to be there for
a long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a coach will come next year, provided Casserly and McNair
find the right man.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a perfect world, we would want a head coach who had been
successful in the NFL,'' Casserly said. ''You just never know who's
going to be available. Then, you look for a successful college
coach who's been in the league as an assistant or a successful
coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction is under way on a $367 million, 69,500-seat
retractable roof football stadium that is being built next to the
Astrodome.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky River Fish Kill Reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- An eight-mile stretch of contamination,
apparently from a distillery fire last week, has caused a massive
fish kill on the Kentucky River, an official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of contamination permeated the river from surface to
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sucking all the oxygen out of the water, and fish are
dying,'' said Mark York, a spokesman for the Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Cabinet. ''It's pretty much wiping out
everything that's in the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The contamination apparently was caused by alcohol runoff from a
May 9 fire that destroyed a warehouse at the Wild Turkey Distillery
near Lawrenceburg, upriver from Frankfort, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bourbon is not toxic, but something in the water -- perhaps
bacteria -- was fed by the alcohol and depleted the water's oxygen,
York said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dunleavy: No Problems With Pippen  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- If Scottie Pippen is stewing about sitting
out a crucial stretch of Game 4 against the Utah Jazz, it's news to
Portland Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen didn't re-enter Sunday's game in Salt Lake City until
there was 2:11 left. Without him, the Blazers had cut an
eight-point deficit to 81-80, but by the time he came in, it was
87-80. Utah held on to win 88-85, avoiding its first-ever sweep in
a seven-game series and setting up Game 5 at the Rose Garden on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has just 15 points on 6-for-22 shooting his last
three games after scoring 20 points in Game 1, was asked by a
reporter whether he was surprised to be on the bench that long.
''About as surprised as you are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy was taken aback by questions about the matter Monday.
He said he had talked about it after the game Sunday, and that
Pippen ''basically understood.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said to him, as far as late in the game is concerned, I went
back to Steve (Smith) at 6:51. The normal rotation is to come back
with Scottie in the next dead ball,'' Dunleavy said. ''What
happened was, in the next dead ball, we were on a run. It was
81-80, and I kind of just stayed with the guys that were on the
floor at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen wasn't around to discuss the issue. He was the only
player besides Greg Anthony, whose wife was expected to give birth
to their first child, to not show up for the Blazers' mandatory
pre-practice interview session.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers still are irritated over the officiating in Game 4,
as well as the postgame trash-talking by Jazz center Olden
Polynice. But they should be in a better mood, considering they
have beaten Utah 13 straight times at home in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing like being at home, being in your own bed,
being around your family,'' Portland forward Brian Grant said.
''You don't have to worry about the fans or anything flying onto
the court. We've got to close this series out, because we don't
want to go back to Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's win postponed the inevitable breakup of the Karl
Malone-John Stockton-Jeff Hornacek trio. On Tuesday, the Jazz will
again be motivated by pride more than hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we win, we keep playing. If we lose, we go home,'' Malone
said. ''Sometimes when you're in that position, you've got to leave
it all out on the floor. The game in Portland is the same thing.
You've got to have pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Grant, the Blazers would have gotten blown out Sunday.
In the second half he had 16 points on 6-of-10 shooting and 12
rebounds. But the rest of the Blazers shot just 34 percent. The
team also missed 10 of 25 free throws and committed 16 turnovers,
including two especially costly ones on consecutive possessions in
the final four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made so many mistakes, it didn't matter what we shot,''
Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference for Utah was the sudden, improbable energy shown
by Polynice, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds and held Blazers
center Arvydas Sabonis to six points. But Polynice's contributions
went beyond the stats.
</P>
<P>
   He pumped up the Jazz and the crowd by screaming and flailing
his arms, and by confronting Pippen in the first quarter. Nothing
much happened, but Pippen clearly was annoyed, shoving Polynice
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care how many rings somebody has, they're not going to
talk to me any kind of way,'' said Polynice, who took more shots at
Pippen after the game. ''He's still living off the six rings,''
Polynice said. ''But there was a guy named Michael who did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant doesn't expect the Blazers to lose their concentration
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Scottie is focused on one thing, and that's winning,
and I don't think he'll let Olden Polynice or anybody take him out
of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers couldn't wait to get out of Utah, and they're
counting on a fast start Tuesday to keep them from returning there
for Game 6. The longer the Jazz hang around, the more pressure the
Blazers will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try to jump on them early, and maybe plant that
seed that they can't beat us in Portland,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Hernandez-MLS Transfer Slowed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Negotiations to bring Mexican star Luis
Hernandez to Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy have been
''slowed'' by his team's ownership change.
</P>
<P>
   The league ''continues to remain upbeat'' about an eventual
signing, however, MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month of discussions have been held between MLS,
Hernandez's representatives and Tigres, Hernandez's Mexican First
Division team.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, a news release announcing Hernandez's signing
and the players the Galaxy would have to relinquish to obtain him
was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sale of Tigres and a coaching change after their
failure to qualify for the playoffs has caused them to re-evaluate
the planned transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Under MLS' single-entity structure, all players sign contracts
with the league. Players of Hernandez's stature are then assigned
to teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez would be assigned to the Galaxy, and would be expected
to stimulate ticket sales among the region's extensive Latino
population.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will have to give up players to obtain Hernandez to
stay under the MLS salary cap and foreign-player limitations. Los
Angeles also is not due to be allocated a player.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 31, is the career leading goal scorer for Mexico's
national team.

<HEADLINE> Avs' Foote Leaves Game With Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Colorado defenseman Adam Foote left Game 2 of the
Western Conference finals after being struck near his right eye
Monday night by the stick of Dallas forward Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, Colorado's top defenseman in the absence of Ray Bourque,
sustained a laceration and was taken to Baylor University Hospital
for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen took a shot from an angle and his follow through hit
Foote in the side of the head just 2:42 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Foote has no goals and five assists in this year's playoffs. He
scored five goals and set up 13 others in 59 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque missed his fourth straight playoff game with an injury
to his left leg. He is expected to rejoin the lineup Friday night
when the series shifts to Denver for Game 3.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates WNBA's Comets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Houston Comets celebrated their WNBA title
Monday with a trip to the White House, where President Clinton said
he watched some or all of each game in last fall's women's
basketball championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets dedicated their victory to a teammate who died of
cancer. They won their third consecutive WNBA title in September,
weeks after the death of point guard Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the loss of Kim, this has not been an easy year,''
Clinton said during a Rose Garden ceremony to honor the team.
''Adversity breaks some people. It caused you to break records.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself a ''moderately fanatic basketball fan,'' Clinton
said he followed the women's games closely.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper, who led the team to all three championship
victories in 1997, 1998 and 1999, jokingly told Clinton that a team
jersey with the name ''Clinton'' on the back could be worn by
either the president or his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll fight with Hillary over the right to wear it,'' Clinton
said with a grin.

<HEADLINE> FBI Interviews Tennessee Professor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The FBI met Monday with a University of
Tennessee professor who has raised allegations of academic fraud
involving the school's athletes.
</P>
<P>
   English professor Linda Bensel-Meyers claimed her office was
broken into, her phone tapped and she was threatened since she
alleged football players received improper academic help to stay
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   She met with two FBI agents on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't go into detail because I don't want to ruin the
investigation,'' she said, ''but they see clear reason to
investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoxville FBI spokesman Scott Nowinski confirmed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking to her, obtaining all the facts concerning
these allegations,'' he said. ''Obviously, it is going to take a
little time to look into them, to evaluate them and to see whether
there is a potential federal violation there and whether there may
be anything that is provable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowinski said if the bureau launches an investigation, he
wouldn't be able to comment on it until it is over.
</P>
<P>
   The university and the NCAA earlier dismissed allegations that
academic tutors wrote papers for athletes and athletics department
managers failed to forward complaints to administrators.
</P>
<P>
   However, the UT Faculty Senate and the NCAA are continuing to
investigate allegations of grade-changing and other irregularities
Bensel-Meyers claimed she found in the academic records of 39
athletes.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Woman Killed by Neck Bomb  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT DALTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIQUINQUIRA, Colombia (AP) -- An explosive placed around a
woman's neck by men demanding money went off Monday as technicians
tried to deactivate it, killing the woman and a bomb technician as
well as injuring three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Elvia Cortez, 53, was ''practically decapitated,'' when a
3-inch-thick circular tube containing explosives went off around
her neck, army Lt. Col. Fabio Roa said. The explosion occurred by a
rural highway outside this town in central Boyaca State.
</P>
<P>
   Just before dawn, four men burst into her home on a farm outside
of the town, placed the collar around her neck, and told her they
would detonate it at 3 p.m. if she failed to pay them $7,500, Roa
said. The four men then left.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called, drove Mrs. Cortez to the side of a nearby
highway flanked by cow pastures, and began trying to deactivate the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A technician was working on the explosive-packed collar when the
device went off at about 1 p.m, Roa said. Officials said it may
have been rigged to explode if tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   The technician had an arm blown off and died later in a Bogota
hospital, the army reported. One soldier lost three fingers,
another part of his forearm, and another suffered cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Mrs. Cortez were present when the collar
exploded, and were seen afterwards in tears. She was the mother of
four children.
</P>
<P>
   Roa said the assailants were probably from the country's largest
rebel band, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
There was no immediate reply from the group, which finances itself
in part through kidnappings and armed extortion, and sometimes
kills those who refuse to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Common criminals also kidnap and extort people for money in the
South American country immersed in a 36-year guerrilla conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians are accustomed to scenes of extreme violence. But
''it's the first time in the history of the war that we've seen
such a macabre act,'' observed Gen. Fabio Bedoya of the army's 1st
Brigade based in the state capital, Tunja.

<HEADLINE> New Ways To Smuggle Money Found  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Stiff financial reporting requirements for
banks and other institutions have forced many criminals to find
other ways to move their ill-gotten cash. In recent years, they've
tried to hide it in truck transmissions, battery chargers and even
candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the ways the underworld employs to
smuggle tons of cash -- billions of $5, $10, $20 and $100 bills,
many from street drug sales -- out of the United States, according
to law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The cash often goes into banks in South America or the
Caribbean. Once ''sanitized,'' it can be wired back into the U.S.
banking system -- the final leg of the ''Black Market Peso
Exchange,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern New Jersey and New York, with bustling airports and
shipping docks, along with the Texas-Mexico border, are among the
nation's busiest areas for bulk cash movement.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Varrone, Custom's acting deputy assistant commissioner,
told a congressional hearing here on Monday that most of the
favored smuggling areas fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Customs Service, which has seized more than $256 million being
smuggled in cash over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But smugglers can use a route that Varrone said his agents
cannot touch without a warrant: U.S. mail bound for other
countries. A single 4-pound letter-class parcel, the maximum weight
for non-Canadian addresses, can hold about $180,000 in $100 bills,
Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the agency would like to see legislation that would
allow such searches when officers have ''reasonable cause'' to
suspect cash (or drugs or weapons of mass destruction) is in
international mail. They already have authority for warrantless
searches on incoming international mail and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who convened Monday's hearing as
chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and
Consumer Credit, said that provision would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   She has introduced a bill aimed specifically at bulk cash
smuggling, which officials described as a clumsy but integral part
of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The small-denomination bills used to pay for 700 pounds of
cocaine on the street yield more than a ton of cash, Varrone said.
That cocaine would bring some $26 million on the street, Customs
said.
</P>
<P>
   The money laundering task forces that combine officers from
federal, state and local law agencies have turned more attention to
bulk smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cash seizure at Port Newark came in June 1998, when
Customs agents, acting on a tip, searched a 20-foot cargo container
on a ship bound for Venezuela. A mobile X-ray uncovered $11.2
million hidden in truck transmissions, Varrone said.
</P>
<P>
   Currency also has been found stuffed into other objects being
exported, including battery chargers and candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Cash handlers for drug dealers have turned to buying gold with
their proceeds, melting it into various objects, such as nuts and
bolts, which are then painted to disguise their value, Varrone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Customs inspectors checked all passengers boarding a
flight to Venezuela from Newark International Airport. They found
one carrying $460,000. Travelers can legally carry cash out of the
country, but must declare it on a form as they leave. The passenger
had not declared the cash.

<HEADLINE> Group Makes Congo War Accusations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Human Rights Watch has accused the Rwandan
army and its allied Congolese rebels of raping and killing
civilians who were caught in eastern Congo during the 1{-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Tuesday, the U.S.-based human rights
watchdog said its staff had conducted interviews in eastern Congo
in which Congolese civilians blamed the Rwandan Patriotic Army and
the Congolese rebels of punishing them for allegedly supporting
Rwandan Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu militia sought support from Congolese President Laurent
Kabila after fleeing Rwanda in fear of reprisals for the 1994
genocide of more than 500,000 people, most of them minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, the rights group said, the Congolese rebels and
the Rwandan army attacked civilians in the village of Kilambo in
North Kivu province on Feb. 5. Soldiers tied up men, raped their
wives in front of them and then killed 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre took place in revenge for earlier attacks by Hutu
militia, Human Rights Watch said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan government spokesman Joseph Bideri denied the
accusations, saying they were ''malicious, baseless and biased''
and aimed at discrediting his government.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Congo is the most volatile part of Africa's third
largest nation, where a dozen tribes are hostile to minority
Tutsis. Congolese Tutsis form the core of the anti-Kabila
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tutsis say they are the victims of ethnic hatred spread
by Rwandan Hutu militiamen and the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government has poured troops and
arms across the border in pursuit of Hutus suspected of taking part
in the genocide and backs the rebels who took up arms against
Kabila in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and the rebels signed a peace accord last year, together
with Rwanda and Uganda which also backs the rebels, and Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, which back Kabila. Foreign troops have promised
to withdraw from Congo after the United Nations deploys 5,537 U.N.
observers and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch said that rape and other forms of sexual
violence have increased in eastern Congo, perpetrated mostly by
armed Hutu militia.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted one woman from the village of Chabwinemwami as saying
that Hutu combatants attacked her home on June 17, pillaged her
house, beat her with clubs then raped her in front of her four
sons.

<HEADLINE> O'Hair Disappearance Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Federal prosecutors began laying out their
case Monday against the only person facing charges in the
disappearance of missing atheists Madalyn Murray O'Hair, her son
and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A trail of money transfers and missing gold coins are key
elements in the trial of Gary Paul Karr, a 52-year-old ex-con
charged with conspiracy to kidnap and extort money from the atheist
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you follow the money, you can pretty much figure out what
happened in this case,'' Assistant U.S Attorney Gerald Carruth said
in opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair is best known for starting the legal challenge that led
to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that struck down organized
prayer in public schools as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators believe she, son Jon Garth Murray and
granddaughter Robin Murray O'Hair were killed, dismembered and then
put into 55-gallon drums and buried.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's defense attorney, Tom Mills, countered that the
prosecution is missing a key piece of evidence: dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The three disappeared from San Antonio in 1995 with $500,000 in
gold coins purchased with money from their organization, United
Secularists of America. Their bodies have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the trio was kidnapped from Austin by
Karr, O'Hair's former office manager, David Roland Waters and their
cohort, Danny Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Only Karr has been charged. Waters is in prison on federal
weapons charges and Fry was found dead in Dallas County in 1995
with his head and hands missing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Waters has not been charged, investigators consider him
the mastermind behind the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   Mills suggested the atheists fled to escape an investigation by
the Internal Revenue Service and that federal authorities haven't
diligently pursued reported sightings of them in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know she was extremely smart, clever, lied and responded to
problems by traveling out of the country sometimes with false
identification,'' Mills said. ''It may be the simplest explanation
is that she did what she said she was going to do for a year -- she
fled to escape the Internal Revenue Service.''
</P>
<P>
   After they vanished, authorities questioned whether the atheists
were victims of foul play or merely ran off with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested O'Hair, who was 77 and ailing, had gone off to
die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray for her soul. She wasn't
reported missing for a year until her son, William Murray, called
Austin police.
</P>
<P>
   Karr wasn't indicted until December 1999. If convicted, Karr
could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, who has a violent criminal history dating back to the
1960s, has said the O'Hairs were not kidnapped, but voluntarily
left Austin with Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Waters, who had intimate knowledge of O'Hair's
financial holdings and had previously been convicted of stealing
from her organization, became enraged when her newsletter was
highly critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tale of not only financial greed, but also of
revenge on the part of Waters,'' Carruth said. ''He became obsessed
with separating the O'Hairs from their money.''

<HEADLINE> Florio attacks Corzine for ducking major broadcast debate  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jim Florio on Monday
blasted opponent Jon Corzine for avoiding a debate on
network-affiliated television stations here and in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four primary campaign debates, only two were to be
televised, one last week on New Jersey public television and one
scheduled Thursday on the cable news channel News 12 New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine replied that he had agreed to four debates, the second
at a radio station here Monday and the third Tuesday night at a
synagogue in Livingston, and so would agree to no others. He said
network stations had been free to cover any of the debates and it
was not his fault that they had chosen not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a diversion away from talking about the fundamental
issues,'' Corzine said. ''I think it is important that we have
debates. Four is more than the Republicans are having, it is more
than the governor did at other periods of time. There is no walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said Corzine's reply was hollow because his campaign had
refused an invitation directly from WPVI, the ABC network affiliate
in Philadelphia, to tape a debate on May 26 at WPVI's Trenton
studio. The debate was to be aired on WPVI Philadelphia and WABC
New York on Saturday, May 27, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The four Republican candidates -- U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, state
Sen. Bill Gormley, Essex County executive Jim Treffinger and
college professor Murray Sabrin -- have agreed to tape a debate on
the same day at the same studio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon has made a lot about wanting to help the Democratic Party.
Here we are going to have the Republican Party with this ideal
opportunity to show off their four candidates. They have all
agreed. I have agreed. But for whatever reason Jon doesn't want to
agree,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would really plead with Jon for the interests of the state
to allow us all to talk about the issues to accept this debate,''
Florio said on the air during the radio debate Monday at WLIB-AM
here. ''We have not had mass outlets that are at the network
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said Corzine's refusal to debate him on network
television was all the more striking since he has been spending
millions on TV ads on those same affiliated stations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Florio claimed Corzine's campaign spending of $1
million a week on TV commercials has now increased to $2.6 million
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine refuted this. ''I am not going to talk about what I am
spending but I can tell you those numbers are wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Florio was trying to make debates themselves a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have been debating about debates most of this year,'' he
said during Monday's radio debate. ''We have been on any number of
platforms together where we spoke about the issues that we care
about. At some point, I think we need to converse with the voters
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Tieman, executive director of the League of Women
Voters, confirmed that Florio accepted the WPVI debate, which they
are cosponsoring, but that Corzine so far has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have kept the time open,'' Tieman said. ''We are going to
determine soon when we are absolutely going to call it off.''

<HEADLINE> Renault, Nissan in European Venture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French car maker Renault and Japan's Nissan Motor
Corp. on Monday announced plans to save $1 billion over the next
five years by combining their European sales and marketing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Renault and Nissan said the move was intended to deepen the
alliance between the two companies by using Renault's network to
raise Nissan's profile in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan will similarly be supporting the development of Renault
in Australia, Mexico and Japan, the two companies said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers said their European sales divisions, which now
employ 5,600 people, would be trimmed by 9 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third, $338 million, of the expected savings in Europe
would come from ''cross-badging'' their models. Renault will sell
Nissan sports utility vehicles under its name, while Nissan will
sell Renault's light commercial models.
</P>
<P>
   They expect to raise their share of the European auto market to
17 percent from 14 percent over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
   Another $500 million of the savings will come from restructuring
and some $250.7 million would come from additional sales and cost
reductions and a streamlined marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's sales and marketing operations will move from Amsterdam
to Paris which will be the center for the combined group.

   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush today proposed letting
Americans invest Social Security taxes in the stock market, appealing for
support from the millions of people who have thrived in a booming market.
Presidential rival Al Gore condemned the idea as a dangerous gamble that would

Columbine Report Is Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A sheriff's department report released today indicates
the 12 Columbine High School students killed by teen-age shooters were dead
within 16 minutes. It appears to counter claims by the victims' families that
law officers could have saved lives if they had acted more quickly. However, the
report also confirms that teacher Dave Sanders, who died, and some of the 23
wounded waited for hours until the school was evacuated.

Court Bans Federal Rape Lawsuits

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rape victims cannot sue their attackers in federal court,
the Supreme Court ruled today, saying it is up to the states -- not Congress --
to give such help to women victimized by violence. The 5-4 ruling threw out a
key provision of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act and continued the court's
trend of expanding states' rights at the expense of the federal government.
''The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and
what is truly local,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.

A defiant Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., an author of the bipartisan provision,

other programs in that and other bills.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Agrees To Pay Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay a $750,000 fine to
settle state charges that it failed to properly oversee one
executive who committed fraud and another who mismanaged clients'
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The company neither admitted nor denied the finding of facts in
the agreement, which was announced Monday by Secretary of State
William Galvin's office.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch spokesman Joe Cohen said Merrill Lynch entered the
agreement to allay client concerns about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was the largest ever imposed by the Massachusetts
Security Division.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Merrill Lynch will pay the Massachusetts Investor
Education fund $100,000 to cover the cost of the investigation. It
also agreed to retain a consultant to review compliance policy in
its Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement charged inappropriate supervision of two
executives. One of them, former vice president and senior financial
consultant David Martineau, pleaded guilty in February to six
counts of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Martineau persuaded clients to invest funds
through him, diverted the money, then lost nearly all of it through
risky trading of stocks and options. Martineau was fired by Merrill
Lynch in August 1998 and had already agreed to be barred for life
from working as a stockbroker. The company has denied it was aware
of his schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Greene, who retired in 1998 after 38 years at Merrill
Lynch, is still under investigation by the Securities Division and
could face an administrative fine.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement alleged that Merrill Lynch failed to prevent
Greene, one of the firm's top producers, from improperly
concentrating clients' money in a few stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Nestor, director of the Massachusetts Security Division,
said Merrill Lynch should have paid closer attention to Greene's
investments.

<HEADLINE> Devils Says They Need To Be Better  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Winning doesn't seem to be good enough for
the New Jersey Devils these days.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's got to be almost perfect, and in their estimate,
Sunday's 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 1 of the
Eastern Conference final wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers got too many chances against goalie Martin Brodeur.
The Devils didn't play good positional hockey at times. Players
were getting caught standing still and not reacting. The litany
from coach Larry Robinson and the players was long.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The Devils have to play a lot better in Game 2 on
Tuesday night if they want to go home to New Jersey with a 2-0 lead
in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is aware we didn't play our best,'' defenseman Scott
Stevens said after the Devils practiced for less than an hour at
the First Union Center late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to play better and we have a lot of things to work
on,'' the Devils captain said. ''Everybody in this room believes
that. It's not like we had a false sense of security after that
game, that we played a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the Devils gave the Flyers too much room to skate
and move the puck, making it too easy for them to come out of their
zone.
</P>
<P>
   While his team pursued the puck better as the game went on, it
wasn't anywhere as good as New Jersey did in the first two rounds
against Florida and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a funny game on our part because we played really well
for periods of time and we stood around for periods of time and
watched,'' Robinson said. ''We can't afford to do that. Marty came
up with some key saves for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wasn't concerned about the Flyers' 36-24 edge in shots
because many of those were from the side boards. He was more
concerned about how the Devils reacted at times in their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had at least a half dozen very good scoring
chances, and they could have had a few more, had the puck not
bounced the wrong way a couple of times in front.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to play a much more all-around solid game,'' Robinson
said. ''We won about 30-some percent of our faceoffs, which means
we didn't have the puck for a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that said, the Devils also know the playoffs can be a
weird time. New Jersey has won nine of 11 games in the postseason.
The only two losses were against Toronto in games where the Devils
had the better of the play, only to see Maple Leafs goalie Curtis
Joseph steal games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing about the playoffs is we could have played a
terrific game, made no mistakes, whatever and unfortunately, it's
Game 2 and you have to do it all over again,'' Robinson said.
''That's the glory of the playoffs. You can't rest on your laurels
and you can't hang your head (over) what you should have, could
have or would have done. You have to bounce back. We have to forget
about Game 1 and go on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The one area Robinson expects the Flyers to change is their
patience. They gambled a few times and got burned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect them to play a much tighter defensive style game,
instead of getting themselves caught,'' Robinson said. ''But they
played a pretty good game. They don't have a lot to change.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Journals Showed Anger  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold grew up as
apparently normal kids, but authorities said Monday there were
clues to a ''darker side'' that no one fathomed and that the two
shared only with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In their report on the Columbine High School massacre,
investigators said Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, also kept detailed
journals describing their love for anger and their hatred for
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The final entries are detailed plans for their attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Klebold's words, the day before the shootings: ''About 26.5
hours from now the judgment will begin. Difficult but not
impossible, necessary, nerve-racking &AMP; fun. What fun is life
without a little death?''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's last entry: ''Walk in, set bombs at 11:09 for 11:17.
Leave, drive to (Clement) Park. Gear up. ... Set car bombs for
11:18, get out, go to outside hill, wait. When the first bombs to
off, attack. Have fun!''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said friends and teachers described Klebold as a
nice, normal student, ''but there was another darker side.''
</P>
<P>
   In Klebold's 1997 journal, he described not feeling comfortable
with peers, being depressed and hating life. A bit later, his tone
changed as he talked about his first love. Deputies found a letter
he wrote to one girl but apparently never sent.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, he first wrote about getting a gun and going
on a killing spree. He found a soulmate in Harris, who began
expressing similar thoughts the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold both wrote of not fitting in, not being
accepted and their lack of self-esteem. Investigators who analyzed
the writings said ''they plotted against all those persons who they
found offensive -- jocks, girls that said no, other outcasts or
anybody they thought did not accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said most of the teens contacted were unaware they
had ever offended Harris or Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harris and Klebold seemed to have lived two lives,''
investigators said. ''Their friends and family described them as
normal teenage boys. Others described them as outcasts. But they
left behind evidence of a much darker and sinister side. This
darker side was an aspect they apparently shared only with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   In his academic day planner, Harris wrote random thoughts. One
entry simply said, ''The lonely man strikes with absolute rage.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Klebold wrote in Harris' yearbook that the two would
seek revenge, apparently for their arrest for breaking into a
vehicle in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wrath for January's incident will be godlike,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' journal began in April 1998 and he wrote about how much
he hated the world. ''Before I leave this worthless place, I will
kill whoever I deem fit,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, he wrote that he wanted to kill everyone
''except about five people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I ain't going out without a fight,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   In his own 1998 yearbook, Harris wrote on the photographs of
almost every student words such as ''worthless'' and ''die.'' On
other students, he simply put an ''X'' on those he did not like.
Few students escaped his wrath.

<HEADLINE> De Beers Sells Diamond Field Stake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- South Africa's De Beers diamond cartel has agreed
to sell its 27 percent stake in a vast but so far undeveloped
diamond field in Russia's Arctic, the Interfax news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers will sell its stake in Severalmaz, a Russian company
owning rights to develop the Lomonosov deposit in the Arkhangelsk
region, to the Russian diamond monopoly Alrosa, Interfax said,
citing a joint statement from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not give the stake's value, but said the
companies signed a protocol agreeing to the sale in London on May
4.
</P>
<P>
   The Lomonosov deposit, located in a remote and poorly developed
area of Arctic forest in northwest Russia, is considered one of the
world's largest untapped diamond reserves, with an estimated $12
billion worth of gems and industrial stones. Yet plans to develop
the deposit have stalled for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media had speculated before the sale that De Beers
bought the stake in order to intentionally halt production and
prevent an oversupply of gems in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has said it worked in good faith to bring the field
into production. The report did not say why company decided to sell
the stake.

<HEADLINE> Security Up for Devils-Flyers Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Security for Game 2 of the Eastern
Conference finals between the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia
Flyers will be increased because of an ugly fight in the stands
late in the opening game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers and officials from Comcast-Spectacor, which operates
First Union Center, said in a release Monday that the extra
security will be on hand because of the potential problems with the
''turnpike'' series with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Two fans, one wearing a Flyers jersey and another in a Devils
jersey, engaged in a fight in the closing minutes of the Devils'
4-1 win Sunday afternoon. A couple of other fans also got involved
before security broke up the problems.
</P>
<P>
   A no-tolerance policy will be in effect for Tuesday night's
game, and spotters will be in the stands watching for possible
problems. Anyone causing any trouble will be ejected, might be
subject to arrest and could have their ticket privileges revoked,
the release warned.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gore Disclose Finances  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A saxophone, a $2,500 men's suit, assorted
golf clubs and a wooden doll are among $23,602 worth of gifts
President Clinton received last year and has decided to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 1999 financial disclosure report released Monday
listed a total of 28 gifts he wants to take with him when he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1999 financial disclosure form, Vice President Al Gore
and his wife, Tipper, reported assets of between $882,010 and
$1.981 million.
</P>
<P>
   These assets included their home in Arlington, Va., valued at
$497,900; a home in Carthage, Tenn., appraised at $266,200; farm
pasture land valued at $180,180; and other property and a house in
Carthage worth $66,400. The assets also included individual
retirement accounts and various credit union and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores listed three liabilities totaling between $250,000 and
$600,000. Two were for loans secured by homes in Arlington and
Carthage, and the third was a personal line of bank credit started
in 1998 at Citizens Bank in Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   The only gift Gore listed was $1,550 in legal time donated by
long-time friend, James Neal of Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts Clinton listed included $1,515 in cufflinks and a book
he got from former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles of
Charlotte, N.C., a 78th PGA Championship limited edition golf
putter valued at $400 he received from B. Andrew Fowler of Newport
News, Va., and a $1,350 cashmere throw from Sally Hershberger of
New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the Clinton reported assets worth between $1.26 million
and $5.7 million, the majority of which was in a blind trust valued
at between $1 million and $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official familiar with the first family's finances
said that since 1993, the Clintons have incurred $10.7 million in
legal bills. They have paid off about $6.4 million, including $2.25
million last year. As of February of this year, they had a debt of
about $4.3 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Tennessee senator and a North Carolina
congresswoman on Monday were named co-chairs of the committee that
will draft the party platform during the Republican National
Convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist and Rep. Sue Myrick will work with Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson, who was named chairman of the committee on May
1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Frist and Representative Myrick offer sound
leadership, extensive policy experience and balanced political
skills to the delegates who will join them and Governor Thompson in
drafting a document that portrays the ideals and vision that have
cemented the Republican Party as the majority party in America,''
said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The platform must be approved by a majority of the 2,066
delegates at the July 31-Aug. 3 convention. The Resolutions
Committee, or Platform Committee, consists of 107 delegates,
including a male and a female delegate from each state, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and one delegate each from
American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Monday, presumptive GOP presidential candidate

<HEADLINE> Departures Help UCLA Recruiting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Some basketball coaches might be panicking at
the imminent early departure of three key players. Not UCLA's Steve
Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   He even found a positive spin to put on sophomores JaRon Rush
and Jerome Moiso and possibly freshman Jason Kapono leaving for the
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony is all the guys leaving has helped our recruiting,''
Lavin said Monday. ''Definitely in the last couple weeks, we've
gotten more calls and more people kind of recruiting us because
they want to have the opportunity to impact at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rush and Moiso declared themselves eligible
for the June 28 draft. On Saturday, Kapono, the co-Pac-10
Conference freshman of the year, joined them by entering his name
in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   If all three go, the Bruins would lose 41.1 points and 17.7
rebounds a game -- well over 50 percent of their scoring and nearly
half of their rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, Moiso and Kapono's departures would likely leave a
starting lineup of Earl Watson, Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes, Billy
Knight and a fifth spot up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has already signed T.J. Cummings and Josiah Johnson -- the
sons of NBA player Terry Cummings and former NBA and UCLA star
Marques Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel pretty confident we're about to put together a really
good (recruiting) class,'' Lavin said. ''The way it's shaping up is
I think there'll be enough high-level, impact players to give us a
chance to compete with the top programs, but also some players you
hope are going to be here four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin compared the current situation to losing Toby Bailey, J.R.
Henderson, Kris Johnson and Jelani McCoy a couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost a lot,'' he said, pointing out that only Baron Davis
and Watson returned that season. ''Every year we've lost someone at
the beginning of the year and at the end of the year to injuries
and the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kapono doesn't plan to sign with an agent, which allows
him to retain his college eligibility. He has until June 21 to
withdraw from the draft without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't have predicted he'd leave after one year,'' said
Lavin, who was approached by Kapono a week after the Bruins lost to
Iowa State in the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels very confident that he's going to be a first-rounder,
but he wants to leave the door open as a safety net,'' Lavin said.
''If he weren't to be a first-rounder, then, obviously, coming back
makes sense because he could play himself into maybe a lottery
pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, a 6-foot-7 forward, led the Bruins in scoring with 16
points a game and he shot 47 percent from 3-point range. He could
become the first UCLA freshman ever taken in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short of a Final Four, he had about as close to a storybook
one year as I can remember,'' Lavin said. ''Even when we were
struggling, he was playing so well and he was in the spotlight.''

<HEADLINE> Coach: Kansas Recruit Goes Pro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- High school star DeShawn Stevenson will
turn pro, depriving Kansas coach Roy Williams of a player he
described as his most gifted recruit ever.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has struggled with getting a qualifying score on the
SAT and apparently decided the trouble was not worth passing up
potential millions from the NBA
</P>
<P>
   ''This youngster is a fine young man who signed with KU in the
fall, and wanted to be a Jayhawk,'' Williams said Monday. ''Now he
has decided to move in a different direction, and I understand and
support that. He has decided to pursue another dream and there is
nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, 6-foot-5 and 210 pounds, is a McDonald's All-America
who averaged 28 points and nearly 11 rebounds as a senior at
Washington Union High School in Fresno, Calif. He was projected as
a likely starter next season for the Jayhawks at small forward or
shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This spring has been a very stressful time for DeShawn and his
family,'' said Williams, who had traveled to Fresno late last week
to meet with Stevenson. ''Now that the decision has been made, we
in the Kansas basketball family should support him.''
</P>
<P>
   In early May he announced his intention to enter the NBA draft,
then reversed himself a few days later. Stevenson said he believed
he had achieved a qualifying score on the Scholastic Achievement
Test.
</P>
<P>
   That changed again last week after he learned that his
dramatically improved SAT score had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's SAT score, about 450 when he took it as a sophomore,
jumped to about 1,150 when he took the test again this year as a
senior, well above the 820 necessary for freshman eligibility at an
NCAA Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   But the increase was so big it caught the attention of the New
Jersey-based Educational Testing Service, which apparently
red-flagged it.
</P>
<P>
   That disqualification meant that if Stevenson enrolled at Kansas
he would not be able to play for the Jayhawks next season unless he
retook the test and achieved a qualifying score.
</P>
<P>
   If he is drafted in the first round, as he believes will happen,
Stevenson will receive a guaranteed three-year contract valued
between $1.9 million and $9.4 million under the league's rookie
salary structure. The NBA plans to release a final list of early
entrants later this week.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 198; Nasdaq Is Up 79  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks made a surprising advance on the eve of
the Federal Reserve's policymaking meeting as investors speculated
that the central bank is close to ending its long run of rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.41 Monday to close at
10,807.78. Broader stock indicators also turned higher after
weakness early in the session. The Nasdaq composite index rose
78.59 to 3,607.65, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 31.40 to
1,452.36.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was relatively light, indicating that few investors were
willing to take on major new positions. But rate-sensitive stocks
posted strong gains that defied conventional wisdom that rising
interest rates are bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 1{ to 132 and Home Depot rose 2{ to 56{.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were speculating that if the Fed raises
rates by a half-percentage point on Tuesday, central bankers may be
finished with their cycle of raising interest rates. The Fed's Open
Market Committee is widely expected to raise rates for the sixth
time since last June in its continuing effort to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concerns about future Fed policy moves should tend to abate as
investors become more comfortable with the prospect that the
economy will be slowing,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed itself offered the latest indication that the economy
remains extremely robust. The Fed said Monday that industrial
production made its biggest leap in more than a year during April,
as output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of evidence for the Fed will be the Consumer
Price Index, due for release Tuesday morning. Chris Wolfe, equity
market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private client group, warned
that signs of inflation in the CPI report could puncture the
enthusiasm that drove stocks higher Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get a bad CPI number ... that sets us up for a bit of a
selloff,'' Wolfe said. ''On the other hand, even a very good CPI
number won't stop the Fed from raising rates tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's advance was helped along by Philip Morris, which rose
2 11/16 to 27 after The Wall Street Journal reported the company
has offered to buy the food business of Nabisco Group Holdings
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper rose 3 13/32 to 40\ in the first trading
session since the company won a bidding war for Champion
International Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While blue-chip names racked up substantial gains, the volatile
technology sector was mixed. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, Lycos rose
7{ to 61|. The Wall Street Journal reported Spain's Terra Networks
SA is in serious discussions to acquire Lycos for at least $10
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But many other high-profile technology names struggled. Cisco
Systems was lower for most of the day before eking out a gain of
1/16, closing at 60.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said investors remain leery of highly-priced technology stocks in
the wake of a steep selloff in April. The Nasdaq has recovered some
of its footing, yet remains nearly 30 percent below its March 10
peak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's widespread agreement that tech stocks will continue to
be the leaders,'' Yardeni said. But the shakeout in April forced
investors to become more discerning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq debacle has been led by tech stocks that have no
earnings and were priced off inflated revenue estimates,'' he said.
''The quality of earnings is suddenly being talked about a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.02
billion shares, compared with 1.05 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.87 to 497.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.9 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Case Punitive Phase Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Faced with a 10-inch stack of motions that
accumulated in his two-week vacation, a judge delayed for a week
Monday's scheduled start of the punitive damage phase in a landmark
smokers' case.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are far apart on issues besides money. The
smokers' attorneys want to exclude most of the industry's proposed
witnesses, and the tobacco industry wants to limit potentially
damaging testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also wants Circuit Judge Robert Kaye to impose a
cap on the dollar request for punitive damages rather than allow
the smokers' attorney to set the figure, calling the $100 billion
amount listed in the lawsuit ''patently and absurdly excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry seemed to be worried about the unpredictability of
an unfriendly jury, which already has ruled the nation's five
biggest cigarette makers conspired to produce a deadly product and
awarded $12.7 million in damages to three sick smokers. Punitive
damages would cover an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, who rescheduled the punitive damages phase to begin May
22, should keep smokers from asking for anything more than 10
percent of the industry's net worth, the tobacco motion said.
Industry supporters value Big Tobacco as low as $8 billion, and
anti-smoking activists consider $100 billion low.
</P>
<P>
   Florida law bars a punitive verdict from driving a company out
of business, but the party seeking damages normally sets the amount
without a judge's intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also wants to exclude:
</P>
<P>
   -- Testimony that the industry has not made meaningful changes in
policies and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   -- The possibility of a verdict to be paid over time, like $250
billion worth of state settlements covering tobacco payments
through 2025.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mention of parent and affiliated companies, the industry's
financial reserves for lawsuits, corporate activity abroad and
punitive damage awards in other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, which has not paid any money to smokers on a jury
verdict, has agreed to limit youth promotions, remove billboards
and cut other marketing in its settlements with states.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.

<HEADLINE> IU Players Welcome News on Knight  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For Indiana's players, all that mattered was
that they didn't lose their coach.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosier players welcomed Monday's announcement that Bob Knight
had saved his job by accepting a fine, a suspension and agreeing to
watch his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach is going to have to make a change, and he's going to
have to do things different,'' said Jarrod Odle, a reserve. ''But,
overall we've still got our coach and we've still got our team and
I think we can work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Odle, Tom Geyer and Dane Fife -- three loyal, vocal supporters of
Knight during the uncertainty that enveloped Indiana's basketball
program for nearly two months -- attended the news conference where
university president Myles Brand announced the coach's punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had been fired it would have been devastating to the
program. You never know how many guys would have left, what would
have happened, who they would have brought in. Now that's all
behind us and we can go forward,'' Odle said.
</P>
<P>
   Geyer, who has been used sparingly the past two years, said he
was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd rather he not have that three game suspension, but we
have to respect what the board of trustees and the president have
handed down and deal with it,'' Geyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's behavior on the floor doesn't need to change at all,
Geyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want him to continue to push us and demand the most out of
us. As far as how he acts off the court, I genuinely think he can
change and become the better person that they want him to be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who has produced three NCAA championships, 24 NCAA
appearances and 11 Big Ten titles in 29 seasons with the Hoosiers,
is the reason most of the players came to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of offers to go to other schools and play but I
turned them down to come here and sit on the bench and learn from
what coach Knight has to say,'' Geyer said. ''From him I get an
education, not only about basketball, but about life in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Fife, a starter in 22 of 27 games this past season, said player
support for Knight likely contributed to his opportunity to
continue coaching the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to show him, as well as the university how much we
care about him. We appreciate what President Brand and the trustees
have done. We felt it was a proper decision, good steps were
taken,'' Fife said.
</P>
<P>
   Fife said Knight will have to make some adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't be the same. I'm really not quite sure what he needs
to do. But he's got to be careful with reporters and when he's on
the court he can't be kicking chairs or smacking the press table,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fife said he had been thrown out of two practices, with a motion
to hit the showers, but learned from Knight's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I eventually came back to (those) practices, and he let me
back in,'' Fife said. ''I'm not looking for him to change as a
coach at all. He is the way he is, and he's been successful because
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman recruit Jared Jeffries, the Indiana high school Mr.
Basketball and Gatorade national player of the year, also praised
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very glad it worked out this way. Coach and I have always
gotten along and our relationship will develop. I think I would've
really had to think about where I wanted to be if Coach Knight had
left,'' Jeffries said. ''Everybody loves a winner. I think the team
will unify. We really came together during this.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Palestinians Die in New Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Carefully orchestrated Palestinian
protests spun out of control Monday and escalated into gun battles
between Israeli troops and Palestinian police. Four Palestinians
were killed and more than 330 people injured in the protest
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At one West Bank junction, Israeli snipers commandeered a
Palestinian-run hotel and took aim at Palestinian gunmen holed up
in buildings nearby. Hotel guests and staff, including nine
Americans, were trapped in the lobby. One Palestinian guest who
ventured out was wounded by sniper fire.
</P>
<P>
   In at least five sites, gun battles erupted between Israeli
troops and Palestinian police and demonstrators. It was the worst
violence since Al Naqba protests in May 1998 when five people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Palestinians fired hundreds of shots and
threw firebombs at Joseph's Tomb, an Israeli enclave in Nablus.
Israeli soldiers fired back, and one Palestinian was killed,
hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said about eight Israeli armored personnel carriers
moved toward Nablus from a nearby army base, but did not enter the
Palestinian-ruled city. The clash ended when Palestinian police
formed a line in front of the demonstrators and persuaded them to
disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Palestinian lands, thousands battled Israeli soldiers
with rocks and firebombs. Streets were littered with stones, and
white clouds of tear gas and black smoke from burning tires rose
into the air. Helmeted Israeli soldiers took aim from behind trash
bins, and Palestinian gunmen, some in civilian clothes, fired from
behind buildings and bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Two Palestinian policemen and two Palestinian demonstrators were
killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   At least 337 people were injured. Palestinian hospital officials
said they had treated 323 Palestinians, and the Israeli army said
14 soldiers were hurt, including several hit by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the worst violence in years, Israel's Cabinet and
parliament approved the handover of three West Bank villages near
Jerusalem to Palestinian rule. Prime Minister Ehud Barak sought the
transfer as a good will gesture to the Palestinians at a time when
peace talks were being conducted in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials denied reports that State Department mediator
Dennis Ross was in Stockholm to take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are trying to formulate an overdue blueprint for a
peace treaty. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo,
who was not invited to Stockholm, resigned in protest Monday,
saying Israel was trying to sow division among the Palestinians by
setting up rival negotiating channels.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the Jerusalem suburbs, Barak wants the
Palestinians to postpone negotiations on an additional troop
pullback in the West Bank, which is due in June, and instead focus
on reaching a peace treaty framework.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian leaders traded blame for Monday's
violence, but the rhetoric was relatively mild, considering the
scope of the bloodshed. On Monday evening, Barak called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to inform him of the 56-48 parliament vote
approving the land transfer and asked him to restrain his men, a
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events began with marches by thousands of Palestinians
marking ''Al Naqba,'' the Arabic word for catastrophe which is how
Palestinians describe Israel's founding and the beginning of their
displacement 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were organized by several Palestinian factions,
with Arafat's Fatah movement taking the lead. Israeli officials
suggested that Arafat had intended nothing more than a warning to
Israel that delays in reaching a peace treaty are dangerous, and
that the demonstrations had spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''When violence breaks out, even if connected to an anniversary,
it is hard to stop it,'' said Israel's deputy defense minister,
Ephraim Sneh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upsurge in violence, the Clinton administration
equally praised Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak as
being peace-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about the violence and particularly regret
the loss of life,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said. ''But the
parties themselves have committed a serious effort, and are
committed to a serious effort at the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, tensions have been rising among Palestinians, in
part because of slow-moving peace talks and Israel's refusal to
release more Palestinian prisoners at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would not be deterred by the violence and would
forge ahead with the peace talks. However, he said he would only
hand over the three West Bank villages -- Abu Dis, Izzarieh and
Sawahra a-Sharkieh -- after the violence abates.
</P>
<P>
   Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to Arafat, blamed Israel for
the violence and denied that the Palestinian Authority organized
the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The violence began around 10 a.m. Monday, after a two-minute
siren rang out across the Palestinian lands in commemoration of
''Al Naqba.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators walked toward Israeli army positions and Jewish
settlements. In at least five locations -- the West Bank towns of
Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and Bethlehem and the Jewish settlement of
Netzarim in Gaza -- gun battles erupted between Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators and policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest clash erupted outside the West Bank town of
Ramallah. At first, about 400 Palestinians hurled stones and
firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went out and threw stones at the soldiers,'' said Fayez
Akub, a 30-year-old marketing student who was hit in the face with
a rubber bullet. ''There was a lot of anger and frustration, then
the soldiers started shooting heavily.''

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Protest U.N. Resolution  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Tens of thousands of Ethiopians vented
their anger Monday against a U.N. resolution threatening sanctions
if Ethiopia and Eritrea don't end the latest round of fighting in
their two-year border war.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came as an Ethiopian offensive rolled across the
northern Badme front into Eritrea, its much smaller neighbor in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, well-coordinated demonstrators, including groups
of schoolchildren, men on horseback and priests from the Ethiopian
Orthodox Church, marched in Meskel Square. Many carried banners in
English and Amharic warning the United Nations not to repeat an
arms embargo imposed by its precursor, the League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 the League imposed sanctions against Italy and Ethiopia,
then known as Abyssinia, after Italy invaded. At that time,
Ethiopia was the only independent nation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the United States introduced a U.N. Security
Council resolution Monday calling for an arms embargo against the
warring Horn of Africa neighbors. But Russia strongly objected.
</P>
<P>
   The council met Monday afternoon to follow up on the resolution
it adopted Friday calling for ''immediate steps'' to be taken if
the two countries didn't immediately cease hostilities and resume
stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no agreement on what steps to take, and experts
from the 15 nations on the council were scheduled to meet Tuesday
morning to try to reach consensus on a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously hope we can get broad support and vote this
tomorrow, but we have to go through a lot of discussions and
meetings before we get there,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy
Soderberg said. ''We are deeply concerned about the cost of human
life to this conflict and want to see it brought to an end as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The war is ostensibly about the two nations' poorly demarcated
border. But observers say it is driven as much as anything by the
rivalry between Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki. Eritrea, once a province of Ethiopia,
gained its independence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A military analyst, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it appeared that Ethiopia clearly had the upper hand and had
broken through Eritrean defenses in the northern Badme front along
the disputed 620-mile border as well as at Zalambessa, 255 miles
northwest of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said Ethiopian aircraft were supporting the infantry
offensive, which he called much bigger than the one in February
1999 when Ethiopia retook Badme with thousands of casualties on
both sides. The war was sparked by Eritrea's seizure of Badme, 400
miles north of Addis Ababa, in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eritrean capital, Asmara, government spokesman Yemane
Gebremeskel said Eritrean forces shot down an Ethiopian SU-27 jet
fighter and a Mi-24 helicopter gunship during what he called
''extremely heavy fighting'' at the Mereb-Setit front, the Eritrean
name for the Badme region.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to disclose Eritrean casualties in the four days of
fighting since the Ethiopians launched their offensive on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous attempts at shuttle diplomacy by U.S. and U.N.
diplomats, there have never been face-to-face talks between the two
belligerents. The closest they got was separate rooms last month in
Algiers for ''proximity talks,'' which collapsed over disagreement
on implementing a peace agreement drawn up by the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have accepted the blueprint. But Eritrea wants a
cease-fire first, which would include a pullback by both sides and
a U.N.-supervised demarcation of the border that has separated the
two countries since Eritrea gained independence. Ethiopia wants the
implementation first and says Eritrea's position amounts to
''setting preconditions.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Arafat Trying To Keep Order  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Monday
that Yasser Arafat has had ''some difficulties'' in restraining
Palestinian militants, but said the Palestinian leader was
committed to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As bloody disorder swept the West Bank, sparked by Palestinian
protests on Israel's 52nd birthday of the country's existence, the
State Department equally praised Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak as being peace-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about the violence and particularly regret
the loss of life,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said. ''But the
parties themselves have committed a serious effort, and are
committed to a serious effort at the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised the chief Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed
Rabbo, who resigned and accused Israel of trying to divide the
Palestinians by setting up rival negotiating channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have a great deal of respect for Yasser Abed Rabbo, and
we hope that he'll continue to be part of the negotiations,''
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly confirming the United States approved holding
talks in Stockholm, Sweden, separate from those in the region,
Boucher said ''over the last several years we have been involved in
helping the Israelis and Palestinians work through a variety of
interim and permanent status issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been expectations Arafat would not permit Palestinians
demonstrators to go beyond stone-throwing. But thousands of
Palestinians battled Israeli troops on the west Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue for Israelis as their government proceeds to
relinquish more of the West Bank to Arafat and contemplates
agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state is whether
their security would be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has insisted Arab attitudes toward
Israel have undergone change since Israel was founded in 1948 and
that Israel would be safer if it yielded territory to the Arabs on
all fronts in exchange for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday whether Arafat could have controlled the
demonstrators, Boucher said ''there's obviously difficulties in
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ''it's our view that he is also prepared to
pursue peace and take the historic decisions necessary to end the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, registered
concern with the violence and said violence would not solve
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's very important,'' she said, ''that the leaders
themselves try to do everything they can to control any violence.
It's very important there be the right climate that the peace
efforts will be able to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   American mediator Dennis Ross left Sunday for Israel, planning
talks with Barak and Arafat. Boucher said Albright probably would
go to the area, as well, but did not say when she would make the
trip, designed to keep Israel and the Palestinians focused on a
mid-September deadline for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher welcomed, meanwhile, a move by Barak to turn over to
Arafat three village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Arafat is
demanding part of the city, as well, as a capital for a Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Underworld smuggles cash overseas for laundering  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A web of financial reporting requirements
for banks and other institutions has forced many criminals to put
their ill-gotten cash into different financial instruments: truck
transmissions, candy wrappers and battery chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the vehicles the underworld employs to smuggle
tons of cash -- billions of $5, $10, $20 and $100 bills, many from
street drug sales -- out of the United States, according to law
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The cash often goes into banks in South America or the
Caribbean. In that sanitized form, it can be wired back into the
U.S. banking system -- the final leg of the ''Black Market Peso
Exchange,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Northern New Jersey and New York, with bustling airports and
shipping docks, along with the Texas-Mexico border, are among the
nation's busiest areas for bulk cash movement, they said Monday at
a congressional hearing here.
</P>
<P>
   Those areas often fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Customs Service, which has seized more than $256 million being
smuggled over the past four years, according to John C. Varrone,
the agency's acting deputy assistant commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But smugglers can use a venue his agents cannot touch without a
warrant: U.S. mail bound for other countries. A single 4-pound
letter-class parcel, the maximum weight for non-Canadian addresses,
can hold about $180,000 in $100 bills, Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the agency would like to see legislation that would
allow such searches when officers have ''reasonable cause'' to
suspect that cash (or drugs or weapons of mass destruction) are in
international mail. They already have authority for warrantless
searches on incoming international mail and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, who convened Monday's hearing
as chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions
and Consumer Credit, said that provision would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   She has introduced a bill aimed specifically at bulk cash
smuggling, which officials described as a clumsy but integral part
of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The small-denomination bills used to pay for 700 pounds of
cocaine on the street yield more than a ton of cash, Varrone said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the money laundering task forces that combine
officers from federal, state and local law agencies have turned
more attention to bulk smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cash seizure at Port Newark came in June 1998, when
Customs agents, acting on a tip, searched a 20-foot cargo container
on a ship bound for Venezuela. A mobile X-ray uncovered $11.2
million hidden in truck transmissions, Varrone said.
</P>
<P>
   Currency has also been found stuffed into other objects being
exported, including battery chargers and candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Cash handlers for drug dealers have turned to buying gold with
their proceeds, melting it into various objects, such as nuts and
bolts, which are then painted to disguise their value, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Customs inspectors found $460,000 on a passenger
going to Venezuela from Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can legally carry cash out of the country, but must
declare it on a form as they leave.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage compliance, Customs has 17 currency-sniffing dogs
deployed around the nation, including Kelly, a 3-year-old, 66-pound
Belgian Malinois, who performed Monday for Roukema and the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The dog sniffed several volunteers, and within seconds was
circling Gloria Bryant, director of congressional affairs for
Customs, who had been given a sealed bottle of the ink used to
print cash.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is trained to recognize the smells of a big roll -- over
500 bills, said her handler, Canine Officer Gene Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who mainly works at Kennedy International Airport, is one
of only five dogs who can work around passengers, since she will
signal her handler by sitting, while the others signal a cache of
cash by pawing at a container or suitcase, Schneider said.

Murders of Lawmen Hit Record Low
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forty-two law enforcement officers were murdered on duty
in the United States during 1999, a decline of more than 31 percent from the
year before and the lowest total on record, the FBI said today. The FBI said 19
fewer officers were slain at work last year than the 61 who were feloniously
killed in 1998. The drop is consistent with an eight-year-long, nationwide
decline in major crimes. The FBI says its national figures on lawmen murdered go

Drug Shows Promise for Alcoholics
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A drug widely used outside the United States to help keep
alcoholics from drinking shows promise in its first American test, researchers
report. Acamprosate worked best in people who aimed to avoid alcohol entirely,
rather than just cutting down, said researcher Barbara Mason of the University
of Miami School of Medicine. It has to go hand-in-hand with having abstinence as
your treatment goal,'' she said. Mason presented the study's results today at
the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Acamprosate is now
sold in Europe, South America, Asia and elsewhere, and more than a million
people have taken it, Mason said. It is manufactured by Lipha s.a. of Lyon,

<HEADLINE> Winds Swell Grand Canyon Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- A wildfire that began
last month as a prescribed burn on the North Rim of the Grand
Canyon swelled to more than 8,400 acres Monday, and fire crews
braced for 25 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was 20 percent contained within the park boundaries,
but it remained out of control as it headed northeast into Forest
Service lands, park spokesman Robert Spoelhof said.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials were hoping for rain, calling it ''our best
bet in fighting this fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire began April 25 as a prescribed burn designed to help
remove brush and grasses on about 1,500 acres, rejuvenate forested
areas and prevent large wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   However, strong winds drove the fire through the prescribed burn
area, and by Thursday it was in the park and Kaibab National Forest
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The fire wasn't threatening stores, housing or a lodge on the
North Rim. Visitors to the area were evacuated last week. The South
Rim, where the vast majority of park visitors go, remained open.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 firefighters and support personnel were on the scene
Monday, along with four helicopters and seven air tankers.

<HEADLINE> IU Campus Reacts to Knight Decision  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Just down the street from Assembly
Hall, they gathered by the dozens around a bar's television to
nervously await the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Would Bob Knight stay or go?
</P>
<P>
   When the news came Monday, the 100 people at Nick's English Hut
cheered. They even rang the bar's iron bell in honor of the Indiana
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can you say? He owns the town,'' patron Ed Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, investigated amid accusations he choked a player in
1997, was allowed to keep his job, but was fined, suspended and
told to control his temper. The decision was announced by school
president Myles Brand at an Indianapolis news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day, in a college town devoted to basketball,
Knight's latest brush with trouble came and went with little
fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't he the coach?'' asked Indiana graduate student Janet
Scott, with complete sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who pays a bit more attention to her harpsichord than to
sports, said she wasn't surprised Knight was allowed to continue
coaching: ''I think sports people have different rules that they
live by.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David Jensen, who happens to make harpsichords,
concurred: ''What would happen if the president of the university
choked a student? That would be a different story because nobody
pays to watch the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Nick's English Hut, people were happy for the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, we did ring the bell for good old Bobby,'' Dyer said,
adding that Knight is good for business. ''He helps bring in a lot
of out-of-towners to basketball games. Without him, ticket sales
would go down, food sales would go down, liquor sales, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who has won three national championships in his 29 years
at the school, did not attend the news conference. Leaving his
office in Assembly Hall shortly before the conference, Knight
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why talk now when so many things have been said without ever
giving me a chance to talk?'' Knight said as he walked away.
However, Knight was repeatedly asked to comment on the events and
the investigation in recent weeks, but consistently declined.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on campus, where the student body is reduced to those
attending summer school, there were no great whoops of support, no
banners endorsing The General, and overall, no shock at the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was really a surprise that he wasn't asked to
leave,'' said Scott Witoszynski, a senior and the student body vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bierly, a junior, added that Monday's decision could be
the beginning of a new and improved Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the perfect opportunity for him to change his
ways,'' Bierly said. ''Everybody has said he's ready to change his
ways for so long, but there hasn't ever been a set of guidelines
forcing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the student union with Witoszynski and Bierly, senior
Gayle Wolski said the university had to punish Knight, but also had
to be practical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things needed to be done to set an example,'' she said. ''At
the same time, if he were terminated, we'd have lost a lot of local
and national support, not only for basketball, but for the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jim Sherman, psychology professor and president of
the University Faculty Council, said this latest chapter in the Bob
Knight story won't tarnish the school's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university is not defined by Robert Montgomery Knight,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Infected Biologist Broke Lab Rule  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- An Army scientist who contracted a
potentially deadly infection while working in a germ warfare
defense laboratory broke a safety rule by failing to report his
symptoms while continuing to work for six weeks, a spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified, 33-year-old civilian microbiologist is
expected to recover from glanders, which he contracted while
working on a vaccine to shield troops from the disease, Fort
Detrick spokesman Charles Dasey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dasey said it wasn't clear how the man contracted glanders, a
bacterial infection typically found in horses that is usually fatal
in humans if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Lab rules require employees working with infectious materials
who develop fevers greater than 100.5 degrees to report for medical
evaluation after attempting to notify their supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist developed symptoms in mid-March, including a fever
he later estimated at 102 to 103 degrees, said Dr. Anusha Belani,
an infectious disease specialist at Frederick Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated with antibiotics but the fever returned, she
said. He was referred to her in mid-April with symptoms that
worsened to include painful liver and spleen abscesses and
respiratory distress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Belani admitted the scientist to the hospital on May 2. That was
when people at Fort Detrick began suspecting glanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once he came forward and told his supervisor he was sick and
going to the hospital, then the people in his lab started to look
at what was wrong with him and they started thinking about whether
this was related to his work,'' Dasey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dasey said a fever that high should have been reported under lab
rules, but ''I don't think anybody here is thinking about
penalizing the employee right now.''

<HEADLINE> Dominican Rep. Election Is Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Immigration officials
backed by troops seized voter and ID cards from hundreds of
dark-skinned people Monday, the eve of a crucial presidential
election. The opposition claimed the government was trying to block
their support and keep them from gaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration director Danilo Diaz said cards were being
confiscated from Haitian guest workers who acquired them
improperly.
</P>
<P>
   But the center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party, whose
candidate Hipolito Mejia was leading in polls ahead of Tuesday's
vote, noted the seizures took place in its strongholds, especially
northwestern towns near the Haitian border.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of the government's campaign to taint the
election,'' said Tony Raful, acting president of the party, which
has the support of many dark-skinned Dominicans -- including
citizens of Haitian origin who are allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors on the scene were cautious. ''It strikes
us that the timing is not the best, but we think it's something
very localized,'' said Santiago Murray, chief of the Organization
of American States monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4.3 million people were registered to vote as of Tuesday.
Planes were packed with Dominicans coming from the United States to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Stores and businesses closed at noon Monday -- amid a heavy
police presence.
</P>
<P>
   The election comes with the economy growing about 40 percent
over the past four years, but average income still hovers around
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, a 59-year-old agrochemical business owner is capitalizing
on the resentments of those left behind in the economic increases,
promising social programs and small community-level public works
projects.
</P>
<P>
   That worries a business community that has thrived under the
current government's trade- and investment-friendly policies,
boosting trade with the United States and attracting ever more
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to keep going the way we're going because this growth
will be good for everyone,'' said Juan Collado, owner of a small
market in downtown Santo Domingo who supports the centrist
governing Liberation Party's candidate, Danilo Medina.
</P>
<P>
   But Medina, a 48-year-old career technocrat, ran a lackluster
campaign, insisting with little passion that benefits eventually
will trickle down.
</P>
<P>
   After a hectic and sometimes violent campaign, Medina trails in
polls behind Mejia, who has never held elected office, and Joaquin
Balaguer, a 93-year-old ex-strongman who ran the country as his
personal fiefdom during seven stints as president.
</P>
<P>
   But polls suggest Mejia may fall short of the majority needed to
win outright, forcing a second round against either Medina or
Balaguer on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer, who has served seven terms as president, was forced
from power under pressure from the United States after
international observers accused him of stealing the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 1996 election, Dominican troops rounded up and
deported thousands of people they said were Haitians, stripping
them of all identification papers.
</P>
<P>
   The election-eve actions harken to historic animosities in the
race-conscious Caribbean island of Hispaniola. The people of poorer
Haiti, comprising its eastern third, are black, Creole-speaking
descendants of African slaves colonized by the French. Most
Dominicans are of mixed European and African heritage and speak
Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Residents Check on Homes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) --When flames drove John Jaramillo from his
home in Los Alamos last week, he didn't try to stay with friends
nearby, he headed all the way to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But Jaramillo, who was worried about the possibility of nuclear
fallout from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was one of the
first back when authorities lifted their evacuation order for 80
percent of the fire-ravaged town on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He and his 14-year-old daughter had gotten bored with Colorado
and decided to return home. They were driving through Espanola,
just a few miles away, when the evacuation order was lifted for all
but the most severely damaged parts of Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bittersweet return.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo's home and the Mexican restaurant he operates with his
brother were unharmed. But his girlfriend's house had burned to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We come and go from it and you take it for granted,'' he said
of his home, adding he was happy it survived but disappointed he
couldn't save more of his girlfriend's belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's like I don't even know if we want to stay,'' he said.
''You wonder how many people are going to come back to stay and how
many are going to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who returned Monday seemed glad to be back,
though, having rushed home as soon as word spread that they could.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly jammed the winding road leading to Los Alamos from
Pojoaque High School, which had served as an evacuation center
after people were driven out of their homes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They could still see the smoke from the fire in the mountains
beyond their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the first to return was Bill Starkovich, who had been
waiting behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately set about watering his grass and flowers and
sweeping ash from his driveway. ''I wanted to make the house look
nice for my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Kurt Duerre was doing pretty much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to see if I can keep things from dying. That's the
first order of business,'' he said as he watered his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   He also must deal with a stench in his house, caused not by
smoke from the fire but by food that spoiled in the refrigerator
when the power failed.
</P>
<P>
   The reopened neighborhoods showed few outward signs of the
devastation that had occurred just a few blocks away, where more
than 250 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a coating of ash, lots of wilted flowers and dried-up
lawns, it appeared to be just another quiet day in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was Ed's Food Market, where people began lining up
for groceries Monday afternoon, although a sign said the store
wouldn't reopen until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe they're finally reopening the town,'' said
employee Jerry Kindsfather, who was busy throwing out cartons of
frozen food, eggs and milk that had spoiled.

<HEADLINE> 25 Are Charged in Vieques Protests  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Twenty-five protesters were charged
with trespassing at the Navy bombing range on Puerto Rico's Vieques
island and released without bail Monday to cheers from dozens of
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Navy Get Out! Navy Get Out!'' chanted dozens of protesters
outside the federal courthouse Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 were among 55 protesters who cut through a fence to slip
into the training ground Saturday night. The rest were released on
Sunday and face similar charges, including former light heavyweight
boxing champion Jose Torres.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals on May 4 cleared 216 protesters from camps on the
range. Activists have been trying to force the Navy to leave
Vieques, and have vowed to continue entering Navy land.
</P>
<P>
   Under an executive order by President Clinton, trespassers at
Vieques can face more serious penalties: up to 10 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters, including Graciani Miranda Marchand, a
former president of the Puerto Rico Bar Association, told the
magistrate they didn't recognize the U.S. court's jurisdiction in
Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first time I've had a record, but I am proud of what
I did. I didn't trespass anywhere. I entered my own land,'' said
Emma Nieves, a 52-year-old Vieques resident.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy controls two-thirds of Vieques and uses it for weapons
storage and military exercises. Resentment over the Navy's presence
flared in April 1999, when a Marine Corps jet dropped two 500-pound
bombs off target, killing a civilian security guard working in the
bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations with Gov. Pedro Rossello, Clinton
agreed to order the Navy out by May 2003 if the island's 9,400
residents voted in a referendum to expel it. Clinton gave the Navy
permission to continue training until then without explosives.

<HEADLINE> Chmura Charged With Sexual Assault  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) -- Packers tight end Mark Chmura was charged
Monday with sexually assaulting his 17-year-old baby sitter after a
night of drinking at a prom party.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told police she was too drunk and shocked to fight him
off. ''He is four times my size. What could I do?'' she said,
according to a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 255-pound Chmura, accompanied by his wife,
appeared in Waukesha County Circuit Court and simply answered
''Yes, sir,'' when asked if he understood the third-degree sexual
assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura later made a brief statement at a news conference in
Milwaukee, saying the last 30 days have been ''hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I'm sick that the DA's office has charged me in any
way,'' he said. ''I'm literally fighting for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if
convicted. A preliminary hearing was set for May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, 31, said he wanted to continue playing football, but his
lawyer said Green Bay excused him from voluntary camp this week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gessert, 43, the party's host, was charged with sexual
assault for allegedly fondling an 18-year-old girl, and he also was
charged with supplying alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Gessert's lawyer, Martin Kohler, said his client denies any
wrongdoing in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was also charged with failing to prevent underage
drinking, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from a party held at Gessert's home early April
9 after Waukesha Catholic Memorial High School's prom.
</P>
<P>
   When police searched Chmura's home April 10, he said the girl's
name aloud and added, ''How could you do this?'' according to the
criminal complaint. Chmura also said he was being targeted because
of his status as a member of the Packers, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old girl told investigators Gessert and Chmura were
''extremely intoxicated'' when they arrived at the home about 3:30
a.m. April 9, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura signed autographs, had his picture taken and was
''showing off'' to boys at the party.
</P>
<P>
   The girl said she, the 18-year-old, Chmura and Gessert played a
drinking game for an hour and she got drunk. After the game,
Chmura, Gessert and several teens got into a hot tub outside
Gessert's home, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old girl told police she had changed clothes and
began walking down a hallway when she saw Chmura standing by the
doorway to a bathroom. She followed him after he motioned to her.
She said he took her hand and gently pulled her into the bathroom
where he allegedly assaulted her. She told police she didn't do or
say anything because she was drunk and in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   She told police Chmura stopped when her friends pounded on the
bathroom door, calling her name. She grabbed her clothes and ran
out of the bathroom, she said. She later collapsed in an upstairs
bedroom, crying uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said the girl had known Chmura only briefly
because she baby-sat for his children.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura and Gessert were ordered to have no contact with the
girls and witnesses named in the complaint. Assistant District
Attorney Dennis Kreuger said witnesses have received ''intimidating
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Bucher declined to elaborate, although he
did say the statements did not come from Chmura or Gessert.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura's lawyer, Gerald Boyle, said he would not negotiate any
kind of plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Bucher for including ''everything but the kitchen
sink'' in the complaint. He said he didn't know if there was
anywhere in Wisconsin where Chmura could get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is almost like Dahmer,'' said Boyle, who defended
Milwaukee serial killer Jeffery Dahmer. ''Everyone knows about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, who went to Boston College, joined the Packers in 1992.
A fan favorite, he missed all but the first two games of last
season with a neck injury. The Packers selected tight end Bubba
Franks in last month's NFL draft.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Blue Jays 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Pete Schourek allowed four hits in eight innings
as the Boston Red Sox won their sixth straight, 8-1 over the
Toronto Blue Jays on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Red Sox moved a game ahead of the idle New York
Yankees in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (2-3) didn't allow an earned run and kept the Blue Jays
from homering for the first time at SkyDome. Toronto had been
averaging seven runs per game at home and homered in a club-record
21 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   After Marty Cordova singled to left in the fourth inning,
Schourek retired the final 13 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out five and walked two. Rich Garces pitched the ninth
inning to complete the six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek has pitched at least six innings in five of his last
seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored their lone run in the third inning on third
baseman Wilton Veras' throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored three runs in the fifth off Frank Castillo
(1-3) on Donnie Sadler's run-scoring infield single, Darrin Lewis'
RBI single and Trot Nixon's run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 5-1 in the seventh on Lewis' RBI single and Mike
Stanley's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon's two-run double, and Brian Daubach's RBI single made
it 8-1 in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo allowed three runs -- two earned -- on seven hits in six
innings. He struck out eight and walked two.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Shortstop Sadler robbed Shannon Stewart of a hit in the
third inning when he bare handed a ground ball in shallow left
field and threw to second for a force out. ... Attendance was 16,
124. ... The Red Sox were without SS Nomar Garciaparra (on the
15-day DL with a strained left hamstring), 3B John Valentin
(tendinitis in his left knee) and OF Carl Everett (day-to-day with
a pulled right quadriceps.)

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Margaret Harris, a theater designer whose work
helped modernize staid, gilt-laden English theater in the 1930s,
died Wednesday. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Harris began attending theater as a teen-ager with her sister
and a friend. They sketched the actors they saw on stage, sending
the drawings to each theater. One sketch caught the eye of actor
John Gielgud, who suggested the trio design the costumes for a
production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' he planned to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the name Motley, the three went on to design several
productions for Gielgud, including 1932's landmark ''Richard of
Bordeaux,'' ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris also worked on Broadway and in Hollywood, designing an
American production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' starring Laurence
Olivier and Vivien Leigh and working on the sets for the film
version of the musical ''Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II made Harris a member of the Order of the
British Empire in 1975. In 1997, she received a special Olivier
award, Britain's equivalent of Broadway's Tony.
Edward F. Toohey:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Edward F. Toohey, president of the
Philadelphia Council of the AFL-CIO from 1965 to 1992, died in his
sleep Saturday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey was the chief spokesman and power broker for organized
labor in the region for close to three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey's biggest battle may have been the 1973 city teachers'
strike, during which he threatened to call a general walkout by
industrial and public-service workers all over the city. The threat
helped end a six-week conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey was also a leading figure in Democratic politics, closely
allied with Mayors James H.J. Tate and Frank L. Rizzo in the 1960s
and 1970s. He finally left his post in 1992.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Young, the chief executive officer of the
world's largest air tour operation, died Saturday of cancer. He was
58.
</P>
<P>
   Young made a career of turning struggling airlines into
profitable ventures.
</P>
<P>
   During his time with Scenic Airlines, Young led the effort to
merge the airline with the Eagle Canyon Airlines group and relocate
the operation to North Las Vegas. Today, Scenic flies 25,000
passengers a month between Las Vegas and Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon
National Park in Southern Utah and Monument Valley on the
Arizona-Utah border.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a fleet of 24 twin-engine turboprop planes and
about 380 employees.

<P>
   Scenic has led the industry push to develop quieter aircraft to
fly routes over the Grand Canyon in an effort not to disturb people
in the park.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Embargo Ethiopia-Eritrea Arms  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Ethiopia and Eritrea engaged in heavy
fighting, the United States introduced a Security Council
resolution Monday calling for an arms embargo against the warring
Horn of Africa neighbors. But Russia strongly objected.
</P>
<P>
   The council met Monday afternoon to follow up on the resolution
it adopted Friday calling for ''immediate steps'' to be taken if
the two countries didn't immediately cease hostilities and resume
stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no agreement on what steps to take, and experts
from the 15 nations on the council were scheduled to meet Tuesday
morning to try to reach consensus on a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply concerned about the cost of human life to this
conflict and want to see it brought to an end as soon as
possible,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that both sides might be prepared to return to
the indirect peace talks in Algeria organized by the Organization
of African Unity which broke down earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Soderberg said Eritrea sent a letter to the Security Council
president accepting Friday's U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's U.N. ambassador sent the council an OAU communique.
It quoted Ethiopia's prime minister as saying the government
remains ready, if invited by the OAU, ''to pursue peace'' and
restart the talks -- but it made no mention of the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the letters, Ethiopia's offensive in the disputed
northern Badme region continued unabated Monday, and thousands of
Ethiopians protested Monday against the possibility of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. resolution calls for a total arms embargo on both
countries which would be lifted when a final peace agreement has
been signed. It would ban all countries and their nationals from
selling or supplying arms or training personnel from either
country.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would also impose a travel ban on senior
officials of the Ethiopian government. It would be lifted once
Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports to the council that the
Ethiopian government ''has ceased offensive military activities
against the government of Eritrea.''
</P>
<P>
   The rival Russian resolution makes no mention of sanctions,
calling instead on both parties to cooperate with the OAU.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said there was fairly wide interest in the U.S. draft,
but France wanted a time frame for any arms embargo.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Moyer Throws for Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle Mariners left-hander Jamie Moyer,
sidelined with a strained muscle in his left shoulder, threw 60
practice pitches including 40 off the mound at Safeco Field on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Moyer pitched since being placed on the
15-day disabled list retroactive to April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners officials said it is still uncertain when Moyer will
return.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Freddy Garcia, also a starter, was off crutches
Monday, but team officials said they also don't know when he'll
pitch. Garcia went on the 15-day disabled list April 22 with a
hairline fracture of his right tibia.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says It Must Ease Regulations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The government said Tuesday Japan must learn from
the United States in easing regulations and encouraging competition
to keep up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual white paper, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry recommended structural changes, especially in the
service industry.
</P>
<P>
   Japan would benefit from various policy steps the United States
has taken in that area, given that America's competitive edge comes
from its lower prices and constant market innovations, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's service sector has fallen far behind that of many other
developed countries, mainly due to higher prices for services, the
MITI report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. communications sector, including long-distance
telephone and Internet connection services, has also posted growth,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   In the manufacturing sector, however, Japan's auto exports
remain superior to those of the United States, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's semiconductor exports have begun to lag as the
United States beats Japan in technological areas and other East
Asian countries catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also noted that growing foreign investment in Japan
will likely help bring about much-needed changes in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign capital flowing into Japan has been rising in the latter
half of the 1990s, reaching a record high in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign entry into Japanese companies, such as tie-up between
Renault of France and Nissan Motor Co., is likely to help
revitalize the nation's economy, the paper said.

   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush today proposed to let

Murders of Lawmen at Record Low
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI said today that the lowest total on record of law
enforcement officers -- just 42 -- were murdered on duty in the United States
during 1999. It's a decline of more than 31 percent from the year before. The
drop is consistent with an eight-year-long, nationwide decline in major crimes.
The FBI says its national figures on lawmen murdered go back 36 years to 1963.

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A sheriff's department report released today indicates

within 16 minutes. It appears to counter claims by the victims' families that
law officers could have saved lives if they had acted more quickly. However, the
report also confirms that teacher Dave Sanders, who died, and some of the 23
wounded waited for hours until the school was evacuated.

denied. Anwar Haddam was granted the special status on an application filed for
him by his wife in the last several months, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. It was unclear whether the error was made by the wife or

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Tens of thousands of Ethiopians vented their anger
Monday against a U.N. resolution threatening sanctions if Ethiopia and Eritrea
don't end the latest round of fighting in their two-year border war. The protest
came as an Ethiopian offensive rolled across the northern Badme front into
Eritrea, its much smaller neighbor in the Horn of Africa. In Addis Ababa,
well-coordinated demonstrators, including groups of schoolchildren, men on
horseback and priests from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, marched in Meskel
Square.

House OKs Africa AIDS Victim Fund
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House moved today to set up a ''Marshall Plan'' for
AIDS-devastated Africa. The action comes days after both the White House and
major drug companies took steps to ensure access to cheaper drugs for the
continent's exploding AIDS-stricken population. The disease kills 6,000 people a
day in Africa, has orphaned some 15 percent of children in the worst affected
cities, and by some estimates will lower life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa
from 59 in the early 1990s to 45 by 2015. The House bill, passed by voice vote,
directs the Treasury Secretary to negotiate the creation of a trust fund in the
World Bank to gather public and private funding to combat HIV and AIDS in
sub-Saharan Africa.

Newfoundlanders Angered by Alberta Strip Club Ad

<P>
   FORT McMURRAY, Alberta (AP) -- A new strip club's claim to be
''drunken Newfie approved'' has folks from The Rock who live in
this oilsands town ranting and roaring.
</P>
<P>
   Showgirls, which also operates clubs in Edmonton and Saskatoon,
targeted Newfoundlanders in a full-page ad in Monday's edition of
the Edmonton Sun and on its X-rated Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to party our asses off . . .'' says the Internet

Chretien Hints at Smooth Byelection for Clark
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien had some sympathetic
words for Conservative Leader Joe Clark on Monday and said he
''wouldn't make life difficult'' for his rival in a federal
byelection.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a former Tory prime minister who doesn't hold a Commons
seat, emerged from his party's weekend policy conference with the
matter of the seat unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation a Conservative MP from Atlantic Canada will
resign to allow Clark -- who's passed on five byelections already --
to run for a seat before a federal election, expected next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a resignation, I will want to call a byelection,''
Chretien said. ''When? I don't know . . . But I will not make life
difficult for him.''

Justice Stacked Against the Poor, Report Says
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The justice system is ''an abysmal failure'' that
discriminates against the poor while apprenticing future crooks,
says the National Council of Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of developing effective ways of dealing with conflicts
within our families, our schools and our communities, we dump all
our disadvantaged social misfits into the criminal justice
system,'' says a report released Monday by the council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We arrest thousands of low-income young men and lock them up
with experienced criminals who give them advanced lessons in
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is an Ottawa-based citizens group that advises the
federal human resources minister. Its 155-page report, called
Justice and the Poor, was written by independent Ottawa consultant
Louise Dulude.

Student Musicians Attempt World Record Performance
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Canada boasted the largest
orchestra in the world for almost 10 minutes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra was joined by 6,452 music
students from all over British Columbia in the cavernous British
Columbia Place Stadium to challenge the current record, held by the
city orchestra in Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   From as far away as Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia --
a 20-hour bus ride away -- students arrived to fill much of the
stadium, which is more accustomed to the screams of football fans
than the fine sounds of Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   There was an official time keeper and an auditor from KPMG to
ensure the record was broken. A tape and photographs will be sent
to Guinness.

<HEADLINE> Residents Return After Dutch Blast  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- Residents wept and gazed in
amazement Monday as they began returning to their damaged homes
after an explosion at a fireworks storage site devastated an entire
neighborhood, killing an estimated 20 people and wounding another
628.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies by a 144-member forensics team continued
two days after the blast. Firefighters sprayed the blisteringly hot
rubble left by the enormous blast of 100 tons of fireworks in a
low-income neighborhood of this Dutch town, 85 miles east of
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Disaster Victim Identification Team, wearing
white jumpsuits and safety masks, sifted through the ruins in
search of clothing fragments, jewelry and any signs of life. But
officials said it was unlikely any more survivors would be found.
</P>
<P>
   City workers struggled to track down 200 people reported
missing, but officials insisted that most would be found and stuck
to their death toll estimate of 20.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer force of the explosion made it ''extremely difficult
to identify victims,'' said Dick de Jong, head of identification
team.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Erik Helder told reporters the number of injuries
rose Monday after officials discovered that 25 people had been
treated at an air force base.
</P>
<P>
   Police opened up the outer part of the disaster area for many of
the 2,500 residents who fled the blast or were evacuated from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to go home,'' said 45-year-old Aryan Curre as he
stared down an obliterated street while gripping his children's
hamster cage. ''We never thought something like this could happen
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In areas where unstable structures made the return too
dangerous, people gazed through security fences and cried.
</P>
<P>
   One man was so desperate to know what was left of his home that
he climbed a six-foot fence to get a closer look. He was
apprehended by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The city organized bus tours that took people to see their homes
nearer the heart of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that people who no longer have homes want to see
it for themselves,'' said Helder.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were increasingly being raised across the country why
the warehouse was allowed in the heart of a residential area and
how the fire caused such devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Could This Happen?'' read the headline in the nation's
largest newspaper, De Telegraaf, which ran a giant photo of the
devastation on its entire front page.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Wim Kok, cutting short a visit to Hungary, urged
people to focus on rehabilitation efforts and wait for the results
of a government investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''A thorough investigation will have to take place to ascertain
what happened, but our immediate concern is to help those in
need,'' Kok told a news conference in Budapest.

<HEADLINE> SOCOG Directors Will Run Relay Legs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- All 14 directors on the board of the
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games will run sections
of the torch relay in its 100-day Australian tour, a SOCOG
spokesperson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will all run portions of the relay,'' said Kat Vidovic of
the Sydney torch relay team. ''There's nothing odd about that as
it's happened in previous Olympics as well. Directors have always
had an opportunity to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidovic was commenting on published reports Sunday in the Sydney
Sun-Herald that also said all directors of the Australian Olympic
Committee have taken places in the relay as have hundreds of
full-time workers from SOCOG and their families.
</P>
<P>
   SOCOG received about 43,000 public applications for the torch
replay positions from which it chose about 5,000. Another 5,000
went to Olympians, sponsors and VIPs, including Australian golfer
Greg Norman, who will run the torch across the Harbor Bridge in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   A New South Wales state legislator has condemned the high number
of Olympic officials carrying the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ''First it was nepotism, now it is self-promotion,'' said
Charlie Lynn, a state Liberal member. ''I'm so fed up with the
whole thing I've decided to go to Papua New Guinea for the duration
of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The torch relay has been dogged by controversy following a
decision by IOC vice-president Kevan Gosper to allow his daughter
to replace another schoolgirl as the first Australian to carry the
Olympic flame.
</P>
<P>
   Yianna Souleles, a 16-year-old Greek-Australian student from
Melbourne, was scheduled to be first Australian in line for the
torch relay before Greek officials switched the order.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper apologized last Friday for what he called ''fatherly
pride'' and a ''lapse in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gosper was cleared by an IOC ethics committee in
Lausanne, Switzerland over misconduct charges concerning the 2002
Salt Lake City Winter Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper was cleared of charges that he and his family had
accepted excessive hospitality from the organizers of the
successful Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have ever felt such a sense of release and
relief,'' Gosper told a news conference after Monday's
announcement. ''It has been very hard for my family and my close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper has declined to take his spot in the torch relay into the
Melbourne Cricket Ground, where he won a silver medal for the
1,600-meter relay at the 1956 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Souleles, who did carry the flame on a later leg of the relay
last week in Greece, has declined an offer by Gosper to run his
portion of the torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   The torch is scheduled to arrive June 8 in Australia after
traveling through Greece and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The torch will land at Uluru, in Central Australia, to mark the
100-day countdown to the Sept. 15 opening ceremony. It will be
carried by about 11,000 people on its journey around Australia.

<HEADLINE> Divisions Intensify in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Divisions in President Hugo Chavez's
government intensified Monday with the expected withdrawal of a
coalition partner's support for his re-election bid this month.
</P>
<P>
   The split comes after three former army commanders who helped
Chavez stage a 1992 coup attempt also broke away from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The growing discontent inside Chavez's revolutionary movement,
however, doesn't appear to be dampening his chances in the May 28
vote. Polls show he maintains a solid lead over his closest rival,
Francisco Arias Cardenas, one of the former fellow coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Fatherland For All, one of three parties making up
Chavez's ruling coalition, agreed late Monday night to abandon the
government and withdraw their support for Chavez's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party's decision is that we are not backing any
presidential candidates,'' said Pablo Medina, the group's secretary
general following an all day closed door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The move carried potential international ramifications, since
Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez, the current president of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, belongs to
Fatherland For All. Party leaders said Rodriguez would be free to
decide for himself whether to stay in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition infighting is a result of ''struggle for
bureaucratic space'' and differences over which candidates should
be posted in the May 28 vote for local offices, said Tarek William
Saab, a key Chavez ally and candidate for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But party leaders said their irritation with Chavez went beyond
mundane politics. They said they fear the country's
''militarization'' and a dangerous concentration of power in
Chavez's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherland For All leaders became irate when, during flooding
last December that killed thousands, Chavez went over the heads of
local civilian leaders and ''tried to militarize'' the disaster
zone, party leader Pablo Medina said.
</P>
<P>
   He said similar problems have arisen in the eastern state of
Anzoategui, where one of Chavez's generals allegedly disregarded
the authority of the local governor.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has repeatedly said he doesn't need any party's support
as long as the people are with him.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in February 1999, Chavez has done away with
the political establishment that ruled the South American nation
during four decades of democracy, pushing through a new
constitution that eliminated the Senate, increased the power of the
presidency and called for new balloting this month to
''re-legitimize'' most public offices, including the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He says radical changes were necessary to rescue Venezuela from
corrupt leadership that he insists squandered the Western
Hemisphere's largest oil reserves, plunging the vast majority of
the population into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The latest split comes amid growing discontent with what critics
and former allies say is Chavez's tendency to distance himself from
political organizations and ignore the democratic balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   He has come under fire for his friendship with an Argentine
writer, Norberto Ceresole, who has denied the existence of the
Holocaust and who advocates a ''leader-army-masses'' troika that
rules free of attachments to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's using a fascist thesis that seeks to wrap the masses
around a single person,'' said Albanis Segura, a 25-year-old
university student who showed up at a rally last week to cheer on
Arias, Chavez's presidential challenger. ''There must be a
diversity of ideas,'' he added.

to come back from an 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   With Indiana's Reggie Miller serving a one-game suspension for
fighting, Allen Iverson scored 37 points and the 76ers overwhelmed
the poor-shooting and seemingly dazed Pacers 107-86 Monday night to
pull within 3-2 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 will be in Philadelphia on Friday. A seventh and deciding
game, if necessary, would be back in Indianapolis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers' first victory in the series was in Game 4 on
Saturday, when Miller was knocked to the floor by Philadelphia's
Matt Geiger, who was called for two flagrant fouls and drew a
two-game suspension and $20,000 fine. Miller was suspended one game
and fined $5,000 for retaliating. But the NBA also fined the 76ers
$50,000, and owner Pat Croce was so incensed he threatened to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   He later agreed to pay -- grudgingly -- but remained adamant the
fine was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers took his frustration out on the Pacers from the
beginning, hitting seven of their first eight shots for a 15-0
lead. Iverson hit his first three shots and had seven points during
the early run. But without Miller's 25-point playoff average, the
Pacers had virtually no scoring besides Rik Smits, who had 14 of
his team-high 15 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Two baskets by Smits cut Philadelphia's lead to nine, then Smits
blocked a shot by Toni Kukoc and Mark Jackson scored to pull
Indiana within 19-12 in the closing minutes of the first quarter.
The Pacers were never that close the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Another 10-2 Philadelphia run pushed the lead to 29-16 at the
end of the period. The 76rs took control in the second quarter with
a 14-2 streak, including two free throws by Iverson on technical
fouls against Travis Best and Derrick McKey.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pushed the lead to as many as 25 points and led
60-37 at halftime, when the Pacers left the floor to a chorus of
boos. Unlike Saturday, when the Pacers came back from 18 points
down to lead by five before losing 92-90, they never made a serious
charge in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Ratliff added 26 points and Kukoc and Aaron McKie had 13
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Jalen Rose, averaging 21.4 points in the playoffs,
missed his first six shots and finished 4-for-15 from the field
with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's first basket came four minutes into the third quarter,
with the 76ers ahead by 24. Philadelphia led 83-62 going into the
final period, but baskets by Best and Austin Croshere, a fast-break
layup and free throw by Rose and a 3-pointer by Croshere cut the
lead to 85-72 with seven minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   McKie countered with a 3-pointer and the 76ers again pulled away
in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pacers swept the 76ers 4-0 in last year's conference
semifinals. ... The Pacers are 11-5 this season when playing
without one of their usual starters. Their last loss with a starter
out was to Philadelphia in March, when Dale Davis was out with an
injury. ... The losses Saturday and Monday night marked the first
time this season -- after 20 straight payback victories -- that the
Pacers lost two straight games to the same team. ... Philadelphia
has 166 free throw attempts to Indiana's 106 in the first five
games. ... Both Miller and Geiger participated in the teams'
shootarounds Monday morning but were barred by NBA rules from being
in Conseco Fieldhouse for the game. ... Chris Mullin, who started
in place of Miller, had 13 points.

<HEADLINE> Would-Be Examiner Owner Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The would-be publisher of the San Francisco
Examiner testified Monday that he'll compete successfully against
the San Francisco Chronicle by focusing on local issues and
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang said he expects to fill a market niche now poorly
served in the city -- intense daily coverage of local issues, along
with advertising focused on the city's readers, at one-tenth the
price of ads that now appear all over the Bay area in the Chronicle
and Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to make any pretense of being a metropolitan
newspaper, but rather a local daily newspaper,'' Fang testified in
a lawsuit seeking to block the Hearst Corp. from buying the morning
Chronicle and giving him the afternoon Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Hearst plans to Fang a $66 million subsidy
over three years to keep the Examiner publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is being sued by Clint Reilly, a real estate investor and
former mayoral candidate, on antitrust grounds to block its $660
million purchase of the Chronicle. Reilly claims Hearst wants to
let the Examiner fail quickly and leave the city with a single
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the nonjury trial wrapped up after Fang's testimony
Monday afternoon. Lawyers must file briefs, then deliver arguments
in court on May 31 before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker issues
his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Fang, along with executives of the Chronicle and Examiner, have
been trying to show that Hearst's proposed deal will improve
competition in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But if a federal judge allows Hearst to buy the Chronicle and
end a joint operating agreement between the two daily papers, Fang
will have a huge challenge ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to build a staff from scratch -- the Examiner's
employees will go to the Chronicle. He'll also have to do without
the Examiner's printing presses. And while some experts have
testified that it will be a losing proposition without spending up
to $250 million, Fang said he can do it with just the $66 million
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White testified
that he had offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials in
return for his political support of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst denied that White's superiors knew of his offer and
replaced White as publisher following his testimony. He told the
Examiner on Saturday that he welcomes an inquiry by Charles
Renfrew, a retired federal judge Hearst hired to look into possible
violations of journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, White told the Examiner his remark to Brown
was a meaningless ''throwaway'' line, and his testimony made the
comment sound more substantial than it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am completely confident,'' White said. ''It will show there
was never a deal of any kind, that there was not, in fact, horse
trading. The firestorm that followed is really unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Hearst executives who followed White to the witness stand
said they were shocked by White's testimony, even though White gave
essentially the same statement to Justice Department investigators
in December and sent e-mails about his meeting with the mayor to
his superiors last August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was horrified,'' Hearst Corp. CEO Frank Bennack Jr. said
Friday. ''If true, it is clearly outside and contrary to our
policies ... and Journalism 101.''

<HEADLINE> Troops Lost in Cambodia Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS FONTAINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The last American soldiers killed in
the Vietnam War were quietly remembered during a ceremony in
Cambodia Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service held by the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh in
honor of 18 servicemen killed in the Mayaguez Incident contrasted
with the fanfare marking the April 30 anniversary of the fall of
Saigon,
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of frustration over how things were handled,''
said Leon ''Nick'' Vileo, 82, who was stationed in Thailand when
word came through of the Mayaguez affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Toledo, Ohio, native was one of eight members of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars on hand to witness the tiny ceremony and
to open a Phnom Penh chapter of their organization. In all, about
two dozen Americans were present at U.S. ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 1975, about 200 U.S. Marines were launched on a
daring attempt to rescue the 39 American crewmen of the merchant
ship Mayaguez from a Cambodian island.
</P>
<P>
   The container vessel had been captured by Khmer Rouge patrol
boats in the Gulf of Thailand shortly after the Vietnamese and
Cambodian communists defeated U.S.-backed regimes in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a final effort to show American strength after the
humiliating retreat from Indochina, President Gerald Ford ordered
the bombing of the Cambodian coast and the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite superior firepower and sophisticated surveillance, the
American military disastrously underestimated its enemy and was
forced to abort the mission after suffering heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue force descended upon Tang Island in helicopters and
''met unexpectedly fierce resistance,'' Embassy Charge d'Affaires
Carol Rodley recalled in a speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Khmer Rouge shot down three helicopters; Marines who made
it to shore were pinned down on the beaches fighting for their
lives,'' Rodley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. soldiers gave their lives to save the men of the
Mayaguez, including some, tragically, who may have been left alive
on the island,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to the Marines, the Mayaguez crew had been released by
the Khmer Rouge -- whose rule became a watchword for merciless
brutality -- a few hours before the attack and were safely aboard a
Thai fishing boat.

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Aaron Boone homered with two outs in the seventh
inning to break a scoreless tie, and Ron Villone allowed two hits
in seven innings as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Houston Astros 4-3
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. hit a two-run homer for the Reds, who won for
the seventh time in eight games to move into a tie for first place
in the NL Central with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Villone (5-1) struck out three and walked five in matching his
longest outing of the year. He won his third straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima (1-6), who has lost a career-high six straight
decisions, pitched his best game of the season, allowing two runs
and seven hits in seven innings to lower his ERA from 9.53 to 8.49.
</P>
<P>
   Lima didn't allow the Reds until the seventh, his longest
scoreless stretch this season.
</P>
<P>
   Boone broke up Lima's shutout by hitting a 2-2 pitch over the
right-field fence with Eddie Taubensee on first in the seventh. It
was the 17th homer allowed by Lima this season.
</P>
<P>
   Villone was methodical, retiring 10 of 11 batters in one span
from the second to the fifth inning. Ken Caminiti's single in the
first was the only hit he allowed until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Villone, who had lasted seven innings only one other time (April
11 at Colorado), lost his shutout in the bottom of the inning when
Tony Eusebio homered.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves pitched two innings for his sixth save despite
allowing an RBI double to Jeff Bagwell in the eighth inning and a
solo homer to Daryle Ward in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lima is 0-4 with a 9.00 ERA in four starts at Enron Field.
... The Astros are 0-18 in games in which they trail after eight
innings ... Counting Monday's crowd of 41,710, the Astros have had
eight sellouts in 19 home games ... Cincinnati's Michael Tucker is
0-for-12 with runners in scoring position.

<HEADLINE> Knight To Remain as Indiana Coach  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana coach Bob Knight has ''one last
chance'' to keep his job and control his famous temper.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended, fined and ordered to apologize, Knight saved his job
Monday by saying he will try to change his ways following an
investigation into a claim that he choked a player in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Any act that violates a supervised ''zero-tolerance policy'' or
is deemed to be embarrassing to the university will result in his
immediate dismissal, said university president Myles Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's longtime ''pattern of inappropriate behavior ... cannot
and will not be tolerated,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight must sit out three regular-season games next season, pay
a $30,000 fine, and issue an apology to the athletic department
secretary he berated and threatened in two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any failure on Coach Knight's part to meet these standards
will be cause for further sanctions, up to and including
termination,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-week investigation followed accusations by former
player Neil Reed, who said Knight choked him during a practice that
was caught on videotape. During the inquiry, other accusations of
verbal and physical abuse emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who has won three national championships in his 29 years
at the school, did not attend the news conference. Leaving his
office in Assembly Hall in Bloomington shortly before the news
conference, Knight declined to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why talk now when so many things have been said without ever
giving me a chance to talk?'' Knight said as he walked away.
However, Knight was repeatedly asked to comment on the events and
the investigation in recent weeks, but consistently declined.
</P>
<P>
   Trustee John Walda read a statement to reporters in Indianapolis
in which Knight said: ''I recognize I have a problem with my
temper. ... I am sincerely sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Walda said the inquiry, which included interviews with 29 people
and help from a private investigator and a videotape expert, did
not conclude that Reed was choked.
</P>
<P>
   But Walda said Knight clearly grabbed Reed by the neck, and that
in itself was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, appearing on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' on Monday night,
called the university's handling of his situation ''shady.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was basically discarded and almost run out of town'' after
reporting the choking incident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did conduct an investigation, but it was an oral
investigation and there was no written record of it,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Clarence Doninger, who was involved in a fight
with Knight after a loss to Ohio State in February, expressed
skepticism the coach will be able to change his behavior. Doninger
also said he was annoyed that he had not been included in the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty also were skeptical that Knight will change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to continue and continue,'' said English professor
Murray Sperber, an outspoken critic of Knight. ''This is a horrible
hit for the image of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert in anger management said Knight will find it
''extremely difficult'' to control his temper over time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real test of his behavior will be six months from now when
he's got his team behind closed doors,'' said psychologist Dennis
Marikis, an anger management consultant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brand felt it was important to allow the 59-year-old coach
to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the ethical approach is to give him one last chance,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has given me his word that he will take extraordinary steps
to change behavior. We have established tough, specific guidelines
to send a clear message that abusive and embarrassing behavior will
not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand detailed the sanctions one day after trustees met in
private to discuss their investigation into Knight's behavior. The
trustees then turned over Knight's fate to Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no sacred cows at Indiana University and that
certainly includes the basketball program,'' Walda said.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he met with Knight on Saturday to discuss his future,
then met with him again before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conversation I had with Bob was clearly unique,'' he said.
''I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had considered firing Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the discussion proceeded and Bob expressed the view that he
very much wanted to change his behavior ... then we began to talk
about sanctions,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the day before the trustees' meeting, Knight issued
a statement in which he first apologized for his temper and
acknowledged he needs to be ''more diplomatic.'' He did not
apologize to individuals or for specific episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame coach guided the U.S. Olympic team to a gold
medal in 1984. But his successes often were overshadowed by his
bullying behavior on and off the court -- from throwing a chair to
profane outbursts against the media, players, fans and university
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Brand appointed two trustees to investigate Reed's
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Reed left the program in 1997 and transferred to Southern
Mississippi after claiming he was physically and mentally abused by
Knight. He did not elaborate in public at the time, but an
interview with CNN/Sports Illustrated, aired just before the start
of this year's NCAA tournament in March, led to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana ended up losing its first-round NCAA game against
Pepperdine, putting Knight's overall record, including six years at
Army, at 763-290. He is 661-240 and has won 11 Big Ten titles with
the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   Other charges that surfaced during the investigation included
one in which Knight allegedly attacked assistant coach Ron Felling
in November. Felling left the team five days later.
</P>
<P>
   Knight also reportedly clashed with Doninger after a loss late
last season. A university secretary, Jeanette Hartgraves, said that
12 years ago Knight threw a vase that shattered near her, and that
in 1998 he cursed her and had to be restrained by Doninger.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Knight would apologize to Hartgraves and Doninger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy,'' said Jarrod Odle, one of three Indiana players at
the news conference. ''Coach is going to have to make a change, and
he's going to have to do things different. But overall we've still
got our coach and we've still got our team, and I think we can work
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight's flare-ups are storied. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1979, Knight was sentenced to six months in jail for
hitting a Puerto Rican policeman during the Pan Am Games. Indiana's
governor refused to extradite him, and Puerto Rico later dropped
efforts to have him returned.
</P>
<P>
   -- At the 1981 NCAA finals in Philadelphia, Knight was involved
in a hotel shoving match with an LSU fan who said Knight stuffed
him in a garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   -- During the 1984-85 season, he threw a chair across the court
during a game against Purdue. Knight was ejected and suspended for
one game and later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   -- He was suspended for one game in 1993 after a sideline tirade
in a home victory against Notre Dame. Knight screamed at his
player-son, Pat, and then appeared to kick him in the leg. When
fans behind the Indiana bench started booing, Knight turned and
responded with an obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   -- After the Hoosiers' home finale against Wisconsin the next
season, Knight took the public address microphone and recited a
profane verse directed at his critics.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1995, he was reprimanded and fined $30,000 by the NCAA for
a profane outburst at a postgame news conference in the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   -- He was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten in 1998 for berating a
referee.

Residents Return After Dutch Blast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- Residents wept and gazed in amazement Monday as
they began returning to their damaged homes after an explosion at a fireworks
storage site devastated an entire neighborhood, killing an estimated 20 people
and wounding another 628. The search for bodies by a 144-member forensics team
continued two days after the blast. Firefighters sprayed the blisteringly hot
rubble left by the enormous blast of 100 tons of fireworks in a low-income
neighborhood of this Dutch town, 85 miles east of Amsterdam. Members of the
Disaster Victim Identification Team sifted through the ruins in search of
clothing fragments, jewelry and any signs of life. But officials said it was
unlikely any more survivors would be found.

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A sheriff's department report released today indicates
the 12 Columbine High School students killed by teen-age shooters were dead
within 16 minutes. It appears to counter claims by the victims' families that
law officers could have saved lives if they had acted more quickly. However, the
report also confirms that teacher Dave Sanders, who died, and some of the 23
wounded waited for hours until the school was evacuated.

trespassing at the Navy bombing range on Puerto Rico's Vieques island and
released without bail today to cheers from dozens of supporters. The 25 were
among 55 protesters who cut through a fence to slip into the training ground
Saturday night. The rest were released on Sunday and face similar charges,
including former light heavyweight boxing champion Jose Torres. U.S. Marshals on
May 4 cleared 216 protesters from camps on the range. Activists have been trying
to force the Navy to leave Vieques, and have vowed to continue entering Navy

AP Responds to No Gun Ri Questions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press today responded to questions raised
about its Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the killings of civilians by
American soldiers at No Gun Ri in the chaotic opening days of the Korean War.
The 1999 story -- more than a year in the works -- quoted a dozen U.S. veterans
who said a large number of civilian refugees, many of them women and children,
were shot to death under a railroad bridge at the hamlet of No Gun Ri on July
26, 1950. The veterans' accounts confirmed those of two dozen South Korean
survivors. But in this week's issue, U.S. News &AMP; World Report raised questions
about some aspects of the story. Jonathan Wolman, the AP's executive editor,
said all of those interviewed were quoted meticulously, many of them recorded or
videotaped.

Murders of Lawmen at Record Low
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI said today that the lowest total on record of law
enforcement officers -- just 42 -- were murdered on duty in the United States
during 1999. It's a decline of more than 31 percent from the year before. The
drop is consistent with an eight-year-long, nationwide decline in major crimes.
The FBI says its national figures on lawmen murdered go back 36 years to 1963.

Saccharin Dropped From Cancer List

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than two decades after a study in rats prompted

the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences said today that new
studies show ''no clear association'' between saccharin and human cancer. The
announcement came with the release of the 9th National Toxicology Report on
Carcinogens, an every-other-year listing of chemicals that the federal agency

   TORONTO: The Blue Jays play all 12 games against the Red Sox
this season in the next five weeks. After June 25, the teams won't
meet again. ''It's awful,'' Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said. ''You
should be playing teams in your own division during the last month
of the season.'' ... Closer Billy Koch shaved the head of a cop
before the game. The officer is raising money for the Canadian
Cancer Society. Cops for Cancer started in 1994 when police
officers in Edmonton, Alberta, shaved their heads to make a little
boy with cancer feel better about his appearance.
Devil Rays-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays have gone 70 games without being shut
out, the longest current streak in the AL. They were last blanked
on Aug. 28 at Cleveland by Charles Nagy. ... The Devil Rays are 0-8
when the opposition starts a left-handed pitcher. ... Fred McGriff
went into the game 17 hits from 2,000, five home runs from 400 and
67 games from 2,000. He is 19 homers shy of becoming the second
player to hit 200-plus homers in both leagues. Frank Robinson is
the other.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: An MRI on Monday revealed pitcher Kenny Rogers has a
strained left shoulder. Rogers was pulled out of his scheduled
start Tuesday, but is scheduled to return to the rotation after
missing only one start. ... Rusty Greer, on the DL since April 13
with a pulled left hamstring muscle, has been sent to Double-A
Tulsa on a rehab assignment. ... Ivan Rodriguez's pinch-homer
Sunday against Anaheim was his second of the season. It's the first
time a Ranger has hit two pinch-hit homers in a season since Mike
Simms in 1997. Texas leads the majors with its .700 average
(7-for-10) in pinch-hit appearances this year. ... The Rangers have
grounded into a major league-high 48 double plays, 12 more than any
other club. That's a pace of 210, or 36 more than the major league
record set by Boston in 1990.
Twins-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: GM Terry Ryan did not accompany the team to Seattle.
Instead, he went to New Britain, Conn., to scout some Double-A
Twins' prospects, including 2B Luis Rivas, 20, from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: LHP Jamie Moyer made 60 pitches, 40 off the bullpen
mound, for the first time since being sidelined April 15 because of
a strained muscle in the back of his left shoulder. The Mariners
have no idea when he will be able to rejoin their rotation. ... RHP
Freddy Garcia, another starter, is off his crutches, but the
Mariners don't know when he'll be ready to pitch again. Garcia went
on the DL on April 22 with a hairline fracture of his right tibia.
Royals-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Royals reliever Jerry Spradlin picked up his first
save in two years when he struck out Travis Fryman and Richie
Sexson to finish Kansas City's 5-4 win over Cleveland on Sunday.
Spradlin began the 1999 season in Cleveland but was traded early
last season to the Giants, who dealt him to the Royals during
spring training. ''I'm kind of savoring it,'' Spradlin said of the
save, his first since May 25, 1998 as a member of the Philadelphia
Phillies. In earning his fifth career save, Spradlin extended his
scoreless innings streak to 10. ... The Royals went into Monday's
game at Oakland with the worst road record in the AL (5-14). At
home, it's a different story, where they're a league-best 14-4.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Right-hander Gil Heredia, who tweaked his right
hamstring during a winning outing Sunday, is expected to make his
next start as scheduled. ''He's fine,'' Oakland manager Art Howe
said. ''As far as we're concerned, he'll be ready.'' Heredia was
running to cover first base when he felt a twinge in the hamstring
and he was lifted two batters later as a precaution. Heredia (5-2)
still got the win, working 5 2-3 innings in the A's 7-2 win Sunday
over Seattle.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Reds-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: During Dmitri Young's 18-game hitting streak,
snapped Sunday with an 0-for-4 outing, he hit .362 with two homers
and 12 RBI. ... The Reds are 9-1 in games in which Ken Griffey Jr.
homers. Eight of his 12 homers have either tied games or put the
Reds ahead. ... Hal Morris is batting .385 (5-for-13) with one
homer and three RBI as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: INF Bill Spiers has an eye infection and could not wear
his contacts Monday. Spiers, who has started the last five games at
shortstop, was not in the starting lineup but said he was available
for pinch-hitting duty. He'll wear his glasses should he be called
on to play. ... Catcher Mitch Meluskey has thrown out only two of
22 basestealers this year but says he's not worried. ''I've never
had this problem before,'' he said. ''But it's just like batting
averages. You have slumps sometimes and then you get going.''

<HEADLINE> Contractor Charged In Egypt Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Prosecutors charged a contractor with
wrongful death and violation of building regulations in the
collapse of an apartment building that killed 16 people, police
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also summoned for questioning the consulting
engineer in charge of the five-story building in downtown Cairo
that collapsed before dawn Sunday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested contractor Mohammed Mahmoud Khodeiry. A resident
who fled the building minutes before its collapse, Um Ahmed, told
reporters that the contractor had dug a long ditch next to the
building on Saturday, saying it was to erect support rods. ''Then
he left without putting up the rods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers worked until about 3 a.m. Monday before calling off the
search for survivors at the site in Sayyida Zeinab district.
Ambulance officials had said Sunday night that 17 bodies were
retrieved, but the death toll was corrected to 16 after it was
found that one of the bodies had been severed in half and counted
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Six residents who were presumed to be buried under the rubble
turned out to be among those who had vacated the building hours
before it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   District records show that after an 1992 earthquake that killed
about 450 people, the building's owner, Yousri Mohammed Hosni, was
ordered to renovate and repair the building because it had
sustained structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday that Hosni ignored the order until several
weeks ago when he filed a request for a renovation permit with the
distinct council.
</P>
<P>
   Hosni's body was among those found under the rubble on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they paid $330 a piece less than a week ago to
have the building repaired. A half-hour before the collapse, they
had finished a meeting to discuss renovations, including
reinforcement supports and repairs to the concrete.

<HEADLINE> Former QB Schlichter Faces Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Indianapolis Colts and Ohio State
quarterback Art Schlichter, whose gambling problems scuttled his
NFL career and landed him in prison, faced more charges Monday in
two states.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities in Indianapolis charged Schlichter with
money laundering in connection with a scheme to sell tickets to
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, police in Grove City, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus,
charged Schlichter, 40, with using someone else's credit card to
try to obtain cash, a fifth-degree felony.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Schlichter was accused of driving a car at a
motorcycle police officer after a routine traffic stop in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces charges of illegal gambling while he was in prison
recently in Indiana. He was free on bond from those charges when
the latest ones were filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Schlichter is accused of accepting advance
payments for tickets to sporting events that he could not obtain.
Schlichter tried to repay the amounts by making unauthorized
charges on his father's credit cards, U.S. Attorney Timothy M.
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter's father, Max Schlichter, could not be reached for
comment Monday night. No one answered calls at his Columbus-area
home.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus television station WBNS reported Monday night that it
had spoken with Max Schlichter. He said he was aware of the charges
against his son but did not want to talk about whether his credit
card was used without permission.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant was issued Monday for Schlichter in Franklin
County Municipal Court in Columbus. WBNS-TV provided The Associated
Press with a copy of the warrant, signed by police in Grove City.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James McKean said Schlichter stayed last week at
the home of a horse trainer, who later discovered a credit card
missing. McKean said Schlichter used the trainer's credit card to
try to get cash from an automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the charge of misuse of a credit card,
Schlichter could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter was freed from an Indiana prison last September after
serving less than half of a four-year sentence on charges of theft,
forgery and fraud in connection with the theft of $800,000 to
support his gambling habit.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release, he has been charged with using the Indiana
prison's pay phones to bet on football and hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning his Indiana prison term, Schlichter served a
federal sentence in Kentucky for a probation violation. He
surrendered to Indiana authorities on Jan. 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter, a first-round draft pick by the then-Baltimore Colts
in 1981, was suspended by the NFL in 1983 when it was learned that
bookies had threatened him over $150,000 in gambling debts. In
1984, Schlichter returned to the Colts, who by then had relocated
to Indianapolis, and was released following the 1985 season.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Teachers Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- About a million students found school
doors shut Monday after some 140,000 public school teachers started
a national strike to demand a pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   The National Union of Educators began the strike after failing
to reach an agreement last week during a meeting with government
officials, including President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiators said they left the bargaining table
dissatisfied with the government's offer to raise the basic monthly
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers now earn an average of $65 a month and want that
increased to at least $100.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Devil Rays 5  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ivan Rodriguez's three-run homer in the
seventh inning lifted the Texas Rangers to a 6-5 victory over the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver (1-2) allowed four runs, five hits, struck out
four and walked two in seven strong innings for his first win in
eight starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched a perfect ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco, Jose Guillen and Gerald Williams homered for the
Devil Rays, who have lost eight straight against left-handed
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's two-run homer tied it 3-3 in the top of the seventh,
but the Rangers scored three times in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea singled and Chad Curtis walked off Tampa Bay
reliever Rick White (1-3) in the bottom of the eighth, and
Rodriguez homered to center field to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   White allowed three runs and two hits in one inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver left after giving up Guillen's leadoff homer in the
eighth and had to watch as Tampa Bay pulled within a run after Jeff
Zimmerman walked Quinton McCracken and Vaughn. McGriff singled off
Mike Venafro to drive them in.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Crabtree, Texas' fourth pitcher of the inning, walked
Canseco to load the bases. But Crabtree got out of the inning by
getting Vinny Castilla to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead on Gerald Williams' homer to lead off
the game. Miguel Cairo followed with a double and went to third on
a groundout, but Jason McDonald threw Miguel out at home for an
inning-ending double play after fielding Fred McGriff's fly to
shallow right.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a double play, Oliver retired 15 of the next
16, allowing only two runners -- on a single and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaughn led off the Tampa Bay seventh with a walk and
Canseco's homer to right tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton's RBI single gave Texas a 1-1 tie in the second,
and his two-run homer put the Rangers up 3-1 in the fourth.
Clayton's homer, his eighth of the season and third in four games,
came after Devil Rays starter Dave Eiland hit leadoff hitter Mike
Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland allowed three runs in seven innings, walked two and
struck out one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Canseco's homer was his 39th against Texas, second only to
Reggie Jackson's 45. ... The three-run homer of Rodriguez gave him
11 hits in his last 23 at-bats. ... Oliver was one of five AL
starters with at least five starts without a win.
