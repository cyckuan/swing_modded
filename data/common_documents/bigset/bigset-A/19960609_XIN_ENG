<HEADLINE> New York Police Department Sued in Sex-harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Government Friday
filed a lawsuit against the New York City Police Department,
charging that a female police officer was subject to "constant and
pervasive" sexual harassment by male officers, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The suit is said to be the first of its kind to be filed by the
Federal government against the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
Female police officer Goff assinged to a Queens Precinct
complained that male officers watched pornographic movies in the
precinct lounge and posted sexually explicit pictures in the
station house marked with her name.
</P>
<P>
At the station house, according to the lawsuit, the television
was frequently tuned to the Playboy channel, officers watched
pornographic movies in the precinct lounge and sexually explicit
pictures were on display at various places in the precinct.
</P>
<P>
Pornographic pictures with Goff's name were left around the
precinct at various places including on her chair and in her
lockers, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
The suit contended that department officials failed to stop the
activities even when the officer complained repeatedly. Goff had
been harassed for three years before department officials did
anything about it, it said.
</P>
<P>
The suit asked for changes in department policy to make similar
behavior less likely and to insure that reports of sexual
harassment are dealt with by department officials. The government
is also seeking a monetary award for Goff.

<HEADLINE> It's Time to Assess Results of Dayton Accords - Dini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- European Council President and
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here today that time
was approaching to precisely assess the results of the Dayton
accords.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to
Yugoslavia that there was visible progress in the implementation
of the accords and that future developments in Bosnia could be
looked on with confidence.
</P>
<P>
It was especially important to continue preparations for
holding elections in Bosnia as scheduled in September at the
latest by the Dayton agreement, said Dini, who is on a two-day
visit to the Balkan region with European Commission President
Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
He added there were still problems regarding the freedom of
movement and the return of refugees to their homes but it was
unrealistic to expect refugees to return in a few months and the
process would last longer.
</P>
<P>
The meeting due to be held next week in Florence, which will be
attended by foreign ministers of EU member countries and of
countries from the former Yugoslavia, will make the final decision
about Bosnia elections, assess results of the half-year
implementation of the agreement and determine further steps to be
taken.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the process of military and political stabilization
in Bosnia should go parallel with the process of reconstruction
and economic normalization.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the stand towards Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, Dini said
stabilization in the area must go ahead independently of the fate
of the two leaders whose extradition is demanded by the
Hague-based international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic and Mladic, who have been indicted as war criminals by
international war crimes tribunal, remain in power in the Serb
state Republika Srpska despite strong pressure from the
international community. The West sees Karadzic's stay in power as
a great threat to the peace process and the upcoming elections.

</P>
<P>
The leaders were worried about the possibility that Israel's
prime minister elect, Benjamin Netanyahu, might abandon the basic
tenets of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The projected summit, to be convened to rally Arab solidarity
and support to deal with the new Israeli government, will be held
in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on June 21-23.
</P>
<P>
This came in a communique released upon the conclusion of the
two-day summit among Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the three Arab leaders pledged their
commitment to the Middle East peace process, saying that their
commitment is a strategic option that also necessitates Israel's
serious adherence to the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The communique urged Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights,
south Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian lands, the foremost of
which is Arab Jerusalem, in implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolutions 242, 336 and 425.
</P>
<P>
The document "confirmed their intent to achieve a comprehensive
and just peace as a strategic option that requires that Israel
also adhere to it seriously, with no backing away or reneging on
anything which has been achieved."
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that the land-for-peace formula is the basis
for materializing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Mubarak will extend invitations to the
Arab parties to attend the projected summit conference.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders, who began their meeting here Friday and held
four sessions of talks to discuss the effect of the political
change in Israel on the Middle East peace process, also urged the
international community, especially the co-sponsors of the peace
process, to continue their support for the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The leaders renewed their call for clearing the Middle East of
weapons of mass destruction, mainly nuclear weapons, and again
urged Israel to join the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
"We have come here for the sake of peace ... We're for peace,
not for surrender or submission," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the three leaders also called for
strengthening Arab solidarity and closing Arab ranks.

<P>
ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A 60-year-old woman from Greek
Island for Rhodes has given birth to two twin boys, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Athens daily Eleftheros Typos (freedom news),
Christoula Karioti, 60, had given birth by Caesarean section in
her eighth month of pregnancy at Athens' Alexandra Hospital,
breaking Greek record for the oldest mother (previously 58).
doctors said the two boys, weighing 1.5 and 1.8 kilogrammes
respectively, had been found to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
Senior Greek doctors have condemned the decision to let Karioti
have children. The criticism was fuelled by reports that she had
not initially revealed her real age to doctors.
</P>
<P>
"There is a code of ethics observed in this country and abroad
which states that a woman should not be made pregnant by
artificial insemination if she is over the age of 45, that is if
she has completed menopause and cannot conceive on her own," said
Athens gynaecology professor Dimitris Loutradis. "This is because
the complications shown during pregnant tend to increase with the
age of the woman. There is the danger that children born to
mothers beyond the age of conception may quickly become
orphans."

<HEADLINE> China to Set Bottom Lines of Living Expenses for Urban Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China will practice a social
welfare system gradually in all cities by setting bottom lines of
living expenses for its urban residents this year.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering, Minister of Civil Affairs, said that to establish
such a system and guarantee the basic living expenses of urban
residents were an objective demand of economic development as
well as a crying need of perfecting China's urban social security
system.
</P>
<P>
He said that workers of bankrupt, closed or half-closed
factories, surplus factory workers and retirees have made up a
group of new urban poor people.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai became the first city in China in 1993 which provided
financial guarantee to its residents whose income was too low to
support themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou cities in south China, Qingdao, Wuxi
cities in east China and some other economically developed cities
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
China now has over 100 cities that have or are ready to bring
the social security system into effect.
</P>
<P>
The common method these cities adopted was to map out a bottom
line of living standards according to the lowest consumption level
of local people and the financial capability of the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The bottom lines these cities made ranged from 96 yuan to 170
yuan per month. Urban residents whose income is lower than that
would be able to receive relief funds from the local government.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering asked local governments to practice the system in a
realistic way so that poor people can really benefit from the
social security system.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Shanghai Shenhua
squandered one more chance to overtake Dalian Wanda in the ninth
round of the China soccer league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was held to a 3-3 draw at home by less favored
Guangdong Hongyuan hours after the 1993-1995 champion Dalian tied
Apollo 2-2 in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Dalian hang on to the top position with 19 points, just one
more than Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had failed to top Dalian last week as the two
front-runners both were drawn by less fancied rivals.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which stood eighth in the 12-team league, bombarded
Shanghai from the very beginning and opened the account through Li
Haifa at the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
Li put Guangdong 2-0 ahead six minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai then evened the score from two goals in the space of
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
With 10 minutes to go, the host team jumped to a 3-2 lead as
striker Shen Si found the target after a brilliant solo run.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong forward Chi Minghua hit the equalizer in a goalie
melee with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Dalian narrowly kept its unbeaten run as they came from 0-2
down at halftime to level with Apollo.
</P>
<P>
Apollo now places third with 16 points, followed by last
season's runner-up Beijing Guo'an and Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing played 1-1 with Shenzhen while Sichuan downed Guangzhou
Songri 1-0.
</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
making great efforts for employment promotion and manpower
development in the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the first meeting of the Government's
Institutional Reforms Group (IRG), Pakistani Minister for
Parliamentary Affairs Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the
government is fully alive to the problem of growing
under-utilization of manpower.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said that the government has taken initiatives like
self-employment scheme and vocational training program to improve
the labor market conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, despite best efforts, the expected feedback has not
been generated, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the literacy rate, which stands at only 37
percent, is the main reason for the lack of skilled manpower in
the country and results in the high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The IRG, which comprises eminent parliamentarians and senior
civil servants, was constituted by Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of Qureshi, the IRG has been trying hard
to look into some institutional bottle-necks which hindered the
implementation of the schemes and programs made for the employment
promotion.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit China, Prospects of Economic, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri is scheduled to visit China from June 13 to 16, the
first visit of its kind since Lebanon's independence in 1943, with
the aim of enhancing economic and political relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, 52, the mastermind of Lebanon's ambitious
reconstruction plan, has a dual capacity of a successful
businessman and a astute statesman, and his historic visit to
China will undoubtedly promote the bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade activities between China and Lebanon started from time
immemorial. The establishment of diplomatic relations in 1972
gave a momentum to the development of trade between them, which
ushered in a new phase after the end of Lebanon's civil war in
1990.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Chinese Customs, the trade
volume between the two countries, which had never exceeded 49.9
million dollars in the 70s and 80s, increased noticeably to 141.6
million dollars in 1995 from 49.99 million dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, located at Mediterranean's eastern coast with an
area of 10,452 square kilometers and a population of less
than four million, has a long history and abundant
experiences in the field of trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite its small size, Lebanon has an excellent geographic
position as it sits at the crossroads between Asia, Africa and
Europe, and has several qualified natural ports on its
210-kilometer coastline, including Beirut, Tripoli, Saida,
Jounieh, and Sour.
</P>
<P>
lebanon imposes minimum limitation on the importation and
exportation except high tariffs and import licenses for few goods
in order to protect some local products.
</P>
<P>
The modern national education, which began in
the Western missionary activity in 19th century, has kept
supplying qualified multi-lingual graduates to private enterprises
which constitutes a foundation of Lebanon's economy.
</P>
<P>
All these advantages have made Lebanon the trade and
financial center and a collecting and distributing harbor of
goods in the region, hence the reputation of "Paris of
Middle East."
</P>
<P>
The 1975-90 civil war led to the paralysis and destruction
of the infrastructure and undermined Lebanon's economy.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, after taking office in October, 1992, gave the
priority to the reconstruction and has made efforts to
restore Lebanon's regional and world role.
</P>
<P>
The execution of the reconstruction plan has given a chance
for a further promotion of the Chinese-Lebanon cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Jaber, Lebanese minister of the economy and trade, has
recently called on Chinese businessmen to tap Lebanon's advantages
to activate cooperation with their lebanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Chinese-Arab Chamber of Commerce
in Beirut earlier this month, he said that the Chinese can
participate in Lebanon's reconstruction process by contracting
projects and exporting labor, and that they can make
investments, establish joint ventures and develop agricultural
cooperation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"China wants to open world markets for its products of
high quality, and Lebanon wants to develop its industries,"
the Lebanese minister said, "it is necessary to find the
legal formulas in order to widen the exchange of trade
between Lebanon and China."

<HEADLINE> Candle-Lit Ceremonies Held for Thai King's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

candle-lit ceremonies this evening to honor King Bhumibol
Adulyadej's ascension to the throne today 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israeli President's Turkish Trip to Secure Military Pact (by Zhi Linfei) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
is due to leave for Turkey Tuesday for a two-day visit aimed at
securing a controversial bilateral military pact that Arab
leaders urged Turkey to cancel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, invited by his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel,
will participate in a U.N. environment conference in Istanbul.
The two leaders are expected to hold talks to cement bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit, however, has taken on extra emergency in light of
the fact that a pro-Islamic party would likely take over power in
Turkey, and that Arab countries have intensified their pressure
on Turkey to cancel the Israeli-Turkish military cooperation
agreement signed in February.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is expected to take advantage of this opportunity
to press Turkey to honor the agreement, which has prompted
repeated criticisms from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, leaders of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, met in
Damascus to discuss the results of the recent Israeli
elections. They urged Turkey to reconsider the pact that
reportedly allows Israeli warplanes to fly over its air space in
training flights.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued after the two-day meeting said "the
leaders expressed hope that Turkey adopts a policy which goes in
line with good neighborly ties, joint interests and respect of
Arab interests."
</P>
<P>
"The leaders expressed their anxiety and concern over the
recent Israeli-Turkish deal and demand Turkey reconsider it," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's concern about the possible cancellation of the
military pact increased recently as Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare
Party was struggling to form a government to break the
political deadlock since the December 28 elections, which made
it the biggest party in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
If Necmettin Erbakan, leader of Welfare Party, succeeds in
forming a coalition, it will be the first time that a pro-Islamic
party comes to power in the secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Welfare Party blasted the Israeli-Turkish
military pact as running contrary to the dynamics of the
region and complained that it had not been debated in
parliament before signing.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have played down the importance of the
Israeli-Turkish deal, saying it is only an agreement on
training. They argued that Turkey has signed several similar
pacts with other states.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts regards the pact as a strong warning to
Syria and Iran, which Turkey blamed for fostering separatist
Kurdish rebels demanding autonomy or independence in its
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria share a border and Damascus claims a
southern Turkish province as its territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel has traditionally downplayed the growing strategic
alliance with Turkey. Most of the details of the military pact
were released by the Turkish side, while Israeli army tried to
keep it a secret.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Israeli experts said they did not believe
the Welfare Party could succeed in forming a government.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they were given the chance to put together
a government doesn't mean they can. I believe that eventually
the generals will bring about a government without the Welfare
Party," said Efraim Inbar, Director of BESA Center for
Strategic Studies.

<HEADLINE> Violin Concerto Describing Chinese "Romeo, Juliet" to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The copyright of a Chinese violin
concerto about a Romeo-Juliet love story of a pair of Chinese
lovers will be on public auction in September.
</P>
<P>
This was announced recently by He Zhanhao and Chen Gang, two
Chinese musicians who jointly composed the violin concerto in 1959
based on a Chinese folk story.
</P>
<P>
"Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", as the concerto was named, had
been played in over 30 countries and regions during the past 37
years. It was selected by Chinese musicians at home and abroad two
years ago as one of the classic music pieces composed by Chinese
in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
He Zhanhao and Chen Gang said that they would have the
concerto's copyright auctioned to show their support for China's
first auction on musical works to be held in September in Xi'an,
an ancient city in northwest China's Shaanxi province. Many other
famous musical works will also be auctioned at that time.
</P>
<P>
The two musicians believed that the auction would be a bold try
in promoting western and national music to be market-oriented and
be good to the protection of copyright as well as to the
enhancement of self-protection sense among music composers.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls on Army Alert against Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- In a rare gesture, Iranian
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei inspected a unit of the army at
4 o'clock early this morning, calling for readiness of the
armed forces against any foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, also Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces,
urged the armed forces to be well informed, trained, equipped
and organized while stressing morality, honesty and faith of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The very well-equipped army and corps without faith and
morality are inefficient as are the most pious armies without
good organization and management," he said after congregation
prayer at the 27th Mohammad Rasulollah Division.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that it is really rare for Ali
Khamenei to lead the congregation prayer at such an early hour in
the day. It is worth of noticing that Khamenei has recently
been very much involved in the army affairs.
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, Khamenei himself alone observed a grand
military maneuver with the participation of 200,000 armed forces
near the religious city of Qom, 50 kilometers north of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said that there might be two reasons
for so much military involvement by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
First, Iranians are feeling that the tension in the region
and the threat to the Islamic Republic are increasing. Iranians
are facing potential military threats from two sides -- one in
southern sea water with the presence of U.S. and other foreign
forces, and the other one in border regions near Turkey after
the signing of military agreement between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Islamic regime, ruling clergymen in particular,
are challenged by anti-clergy forces inside the country. So,
Khamenei must strengthen his own position in the army and try to
crack down any dangerous anti-clergy elements and liberals who
want to westernize the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Khamenei
underlined the importance of protecting the independence of the
country, saying that great work has already been done to
defend Iran's independence and a large number of the best
young fighters have dedicated their lives for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also reviewed a military parade by the units of
Mohammad Rasulollah Division with the accompany of Major
General Hassan Firuzabadi, head of the Armed Forces Command
Headquarters, and Major General Mohsen Rezaei, Commander of
the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Fire Fighters Gain Upper Hand in Battling Wild Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ulan Bator, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian fire fighters have
gained an upper hand in battling the more than three-month-old
wild fires that killed or injured 85 persons, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The National Standing Special Committee, a government
organization set up to coordinate the efforts in fighting the
nation's worst fires in decades, said most of the wild fires have
either been put out or brought under control, except a fire
burning about 100 kilometers north of Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
The wild fires, started on February 23, spread to 14 of the
nation's 21 provinces, destroying 178 tents, charring 3.7 million
hectares of forest and about 7 million hectares of pasture, said
Deputy Prime Minister Choijilsurengiyn Purevdorj.
</P>
<P>
Purevdorj said the government has mobilized some 80,000 fire
fighters, including 3,000 army soldiers, 700 parachuters and 1,500
police officers, to contain the fires.
</P>
<P>
Besides undisclosed huge economic losses due to the fire, the
fire fighting efforts alone have cost the government 800 million
tugriks, or about 1.7 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Damascus Summit Significant to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian-Egyptian-Saudi summit,
which concluded here Saturday with a call for convening an
all-Arab summit in Cairo later this month, is of great importance
to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing summit, which grouped Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah ibn Abdul-Aziz, called for holding the all Arab summit on
June 21-23 to clear the Arab atmosphere and hammer out a united
Arab stand on the peace process in view of the election of
right-wing Likud Party leader Benjamin Natanyahu as Israel's next
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to political observers here, the three states' call for
convening the Arab summit is of great importance in view of their
political weight in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Saudi Arabia have affirmed their backing of Syria's
fair demand for an Israeli withdraw from the occupied Golan
Heights to the June 4, 1967 boundaries. They also support the
Palestinian demand for setting up a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem status will undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to
the progress of the forthcoming rounds of negotiations between
the Palestinian Authority and the new Israeli government in view
of the fact that Israel insists that Jerusalem remain united as
Israel's capital while the Palestinians demand that Jerusalem be
the capital of the Palestinian state, which they are determined
to set up.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the upcoming Arab summit will
contribute to forming a united Arab stand, prop up the positions
of both Palestinian and Syrian negotiators in their future talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 Arab states expressed their willingness to attend the
summit. Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital said concerted Arab
efforts will be made to secure an Arab presence as large as
possible at the projected Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fresh overtures will be made with both the U.S. and
Russia -- co-sponsors of the peace process -- as well as with the
European Union (EU) with the aim of urging them to play a more
active role in compelling Israel to abide by the basic tenets of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Also, the coming Cairo summit will seek to restore Arab
solidarity and push forward the Middle East peace process despite
the existing differences among Arab states.

<HEADLINE> Military Court for Trying Japanese War Criminals Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The special military court for
trying Japanese war criminals of the World War Two by New China 40
years ago, was restored today in this capital city of northeast
China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
This special military tribunal was set up on June 9, 1956 in
Shenyang according to a decision made by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, on
hearing cases about Japanese war criminals who were under
detention.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal tried 36 criminals, including eight Japanese
generals or field officers and 28 high-ranking officials of the
puppet state of Manchuria founded by Japanese invaders in
northeast China in 1932.
</P>
<P>
The court, used to be a club, was arranged after the model of
the Far East military court in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Liu Minglun, a retired judge of Shenyang Intermediate People's
Court and a witness of the historic event, proposed last year that
the Court, which had become a movie theater at the time, be
restored.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that it was the first time for the Chinese people
to try foreign invaders on the Chinese territory without any
foreign interference since the Opium War (1840-1842).
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for our future generations to be aware of the
history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese troops invaded Shenyang in 1931 and later occupied
the whole northeastern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The restored court has a room displaying historic materials and
pictures of the trials.

NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- India today offered to resume
foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan, stalled since January
1994, and expressed its readiness to work together on all issues

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Rescues Troubled Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has approved a
new loan of 25 billion baht (1 billion US. dollars) to rescue the
troubled Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC).
</P>
<P>
The loan was approved at a meeting chaired by Vijit Supinit,
governor of the central bank, on Friday, the Nation quotes bank
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 25 billion baht loan as fresh capital represents the
largest sum a Thai government has ever spent to rescue a single
institution.
</P>
<P>
This amount would have been large enough even to have saved
Barings Bank, which collapsed in February last year after Nick
Lesson, the bank's Far East futures trader, lost more than 1
billion US. dollars (25 billion baht) of the bank's capital on
futures trading.
</P>
<P>
The BBC has burdened itself by approving 78 billion baht (3.12
billion dollars) in doubtful loans, which have several times wiped
out its capital.
</P>
<P>
Vijit will order the BBC to write off 19 billion baht (760
million dollars) of these by June 30.
</P>
<P>
The economic crime suppression division has already issued
arrest warrants for four suspects on charges of misappropriating
1.657 billion baht (66.28 million dollars) from the bank.
</P>
<P>
The four include former BBC president Krirkkiat Jalichandra,
and former treasury adviser Rakesh Saxena, who have fled abroad.
</P>
<P>
Former BBC executive vice president Ekachai Athikomnantha has
surrendered himself to police.

However, German president Roman Herzog questioned the idea of
making use of the historic chance in building a common Europe
while Austrian President Thomas Klestil noted that no pledges

<HEADLINE> Indian Hotel Industry Poised for Major Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian hotel industry is
poised for a major expansion to cope with the increasing demands
from tourists and business executives from abroad, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leading players in the Indian hotel industry such
as the Taj and the Oberoi group are planning to invest a whopping
2,500 crore rupees (about 714 million US. dollars) in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
liberalization of India's economy has virtually opened the
floodgates for the hotel industry with the sudden surge in the
arrival of foreign investors wanting to do business in the changed
atmosphere, one of lesser controls and regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI report, foreign tourists arrivals are
expected to touch a record five million by the year 2000 as
against two million in 1995. Hotel room availability has to
increase to 125,000 from the present 58,000 within the next five
years to accommodate the growing international business and
tourist traffic.
</P>
<P>
With the sharp increase in international business traffic, five
star hotels in Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay) feel choked due to the
acute shortage of hotels.
</P>
<P>
The hotel industry and the tourism authorities in India have
drawn up a plan to overcome the shortage which envisages changes
in building laws and making more land available for enabling new
hotels to come up.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Minister Leaves for Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati left here for Damascus today to advise Syrians with
Iranian view about the latest development in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit by the Iranian foreign minister to
Damascus in the past three months. Velayati made a nine-day visit
to Syria and Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that Velayati will
present President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's message to Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
However, the brief report gave no details about the message,
but only said that the Iranian foreign minister will also
exchange views on the latest regional developments with the
Syrian officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Iran-Syria cooperation in a number of fields will also be
raised in Velayati's talks, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian government is anxious to
be informed of the result of the two-day mini-summit of the
leaders of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iranians will lose no chance to make their
own influence in the sensitive issue of the Middle East peace
process by assuring Syrians with the support from old ally of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that Tehran's stance toward the
Middle East peace process is quite clear. Iranians would prefer
military settlement in driving Israeli occupiers out of the
Golan Height rather than peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Iran repeatedly declared that it will continue its
humanitarian support to the Lebanese Hezbollah in their struggle
to liberate the homeland occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani pledged "various kinds of
assistance" to the Lebanese Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
As to the mini-summit concluded in Damascus Saturday, the
Iranian government still kept silent up to now. Only local press
made some negative comments.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes Convocation of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has welcomed the
convocation of an Arab summit in Cairo on June 21-23, the Egyptian
state-run media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo press quoted Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid as saying that the enlarged Arab summit, which
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has invited 12 Arab leaders to
attend, is aimed at stressing Arab states' keenness on achieving a
just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa this
morning to discuss arrangements for the summit, from which Iraq
will be excluded.
</P>
<P>
So far, Mubarak has invited Morocco, Algeria, Libya,
Mauritania, Lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, the United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Yemen to attend the
summit in order to form a united Arab front in the face of
Israel's new right-wing government, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported today that Jordan officially announced
Saturday that it would take part in the Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan al Maashar was quoted as
saying following a Cabinet meeting that Jordan supports any Arab
meeting that might close the Arab rank.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Crown Prince
Abdullah of Saudi Arabia issued the call for the summit Saturday
after a two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Make Breakthrough in Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- India is poised to become a
leading player in the global chemical processing market as
researchers in the country found an improved way to produce
zeolites, a family of chemical facilitators, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came when a team of scientists at the
Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) discovered that the
formation of zeolites can be hastened several times by adding a
cocktail of inexpensive chemical compounds.
</P>
<P>
Though these "shape-selective wonder catalysts" have been in
use in petrochemical and other chemical industries for decades,
their crystallization is notoriously slow and requires relatively
high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
"It seems we have found a new method that cuts short the time
required for zeolite crystallization substantially," Doctor Rajiv
Kumar, who led the team, told PTI. The findings appeared in a
recent issue of the prestigious international research journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The team has already filed patent applications for the
technique in India and the United States. The proprietary
technique, once industrially acceptable, will be a money spinner,
the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Zeolites - boiling stones in Greek -- are a group of white or
colorless alumina-silica based minerals with characteristic
crystal structures that occur in nature.
</P>
<P>
The discovery that some of these crystalline compounds can be
good catalysts in industrial chemical process in the 1940s touched
off a rat race to synthesize new zeolite materials with improved
properties or newer applications.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Envoy to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The recently-appointed special
representative of the U.N. secretary general on Cyprus, Han
Sung-Joo, will visit Cyprus by the end of June and early in July.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in New York with the Cyprus Broadcasting
Corporation broadcast today, the new U.N. envoy said that
his first visit to Cyprus would be a fact-finding mission with an
aim to get acquainted with the leaders and the people and parties
involved in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The former foreign minister of the Republic of Korea expressed
the hope for progress in the Cyprus peace process. He noted,
however, that he was not optimistic that an agreement would be
reached suddenly.
</P>
<P>
He explained that one of the very important reasons that
progress should be sought was the continuing military build-up on
the island, the military preparations and the military
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy rejected a Dayton-type solution to the Cyprus
problem since the Bosnian crisis and the Cyprus problem had
different characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Han is expected to attend a scheduled meeting in Geneva
between U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on June 11.
</P>
<P>
Han was appointed by the U.N. chief as his special
representative on Cyprus in May to replace Joe Clark, former
Canadian prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Australian Genetic Missile Targets Cancer Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists have
developed a tiny missile that can precisely attack cancer cells
within human body without harm healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
Mark Burton and Exmond DeCruz at the Charles Sturt University
found the new technology when they managed to combine two existing
drug delivery methods, known as microspheres and liposomes. They
used the combined method to deliver a gene element called a DNA
plasmid.
</P>
<P>
The new method can greatly improve effectiveness of treatment
because of its preciseness and reduce side-effects.
</P>
<P>
Microspheres are tiny polystyrene balls that exploit the
tumor's voracious demand for blood to target cancer cells and
bypass healthy cells. It operates like a tiny missile with the
diameter of a human hair. It can also protect drug from being
degraded by the body's immune system. However, it was too large to
penetrate cancer cell's walls.
</P>
<P>
Liposomes are small enough to slip through the walls of cancer
sells. It can deliver the DNA plasmid to the very heart of cancer
cells. Once sitting in the heart of the cancer cells, the gene
element triggers the process of self-destruction of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
The researchers used biochemistry methods to link the three
components to each other to form a three-stage missile.
</P>
<P>
"The essence lies in their electrical charges: DNA has a
negative charge, so we can link it to the liposome, which is
positive, and we can couple that to the microsphere, which is
negative," Burton said.
</P>
<P>
The technology could also be used to deliver an anti-cancer
drug or a tiny radioactive particle to the heart of the tumor, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of treatment reaching the cancer cells was 10 times
higher than that reaching normal body tissue, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil rallied from a four-point
deficit to edge the American Klim All-Stars 91-90 at the overtime
of the final Sunday, winning the Beijing International Basketball
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
Four-time Olympian Oscar Schmidt scored 24 points but Guard
Andre Lus Fonseca hit 7 of the team's last 11 points to key
Brazil's victory.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, which lost to the Americans 96-98 in the
preliminaries on Friday, trailed at 79-81 with 10 seconds left in
the regulation when American Guard Marc Brown made a layup. But
it was Fonseca who hit two free throws, forcing the game into the
overtime after he was fouled by Brown as he was driving the lane.
</P>
<P>
The Klim All-Stars looked like to win the game after Willie
Sims scored under the basket to put the Americans a 90-86 lead
with 1:15 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
However Brazil, fifth place finisher at the Barcelona Olympics
four years ago, levelled 90-all on Fonseca's layup and Tohrti
klafke's jumper with 20 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
Then the Americans Darryl Johnson, scored clutch points of his
24 in Friday's clash with Brazil, missed a jumper in the final
seconds. And Fonseca was fouled again in the lane with only a
second on clock. Fonseca, who contributed 14 points in his 28
minutes play, made one of the two free throws to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
The Klim All-Stars, which took the half advantage at 49-45, was
led by Sims with 17 points, followed by Johnson and Al Frederick,
both with 14.
</P>
<P>
"As a coach of Brazil, I felt so good to win the first
international competitions," said Brazil coach Antonio
Chakmati. "We played nice start and defense was better than last
game against the Americans."
</P>
<P>
In the playoff for third place late Sunday, the Chinese Olympic
Team beat the 555 Chinese United Team 113-95.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 Hutu
refugees are being held at the border in Tanzania's Kibondo
District as fighting between the Hutu and the Tutsi is reported
to intensify in the Gitega and Ruigi provinces in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The local "Observer" newspaper said today that some 4,341 Hutu
refugees were stopped at the border village of Mkarazi on June 1
and 2,800 others were later stopped at Nyakasanda village.
</P>
<P>
The refugees bore bullet wounds and told horrifying tales of
fierce fighting between the two ethnic rivals.
</P>
<P>
In spite of border closure, some Burundi refugees have been
sneaking into Tanzania's Kobondo refugee camps and others are
hiding in the bush at the border.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 refugees were rounded up at Kumsenga village and
190 others at kibuye village in Kibondo District.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian forces wanted to drive back the refugees but the
UN High Commission for Refugees requested that they be granted
asylum arguing that taking them back to Burundi would mean taking
them to death.

<HEADLINE> Ships Find It Safer On Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Shipping safety has been improved
since China introduced a new shipping system under which vessels
have to sail in separate channels on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, shipping accidents,
casualties and economic losses in the lower reaches of this
China's longest river dropped by 23.3 percent, 25.8 percent and
5.7 percent, respectively, according to the Yangtze River Harbor
Superintendence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The new sailing system marks the point that China has started
to regulate its inland water traffic with scientific measures,
said Liu Songjin, and its success shows China's efforts to improve
shipping safety on its busiest rivers has been of good effect,
said Liu Songjin, Vice Minister of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained the new system is a pilot project of the
ministry's scheme to improve shipping safety on the Yangtze River,
the river with the biggest inland water traffic flow and the
highest incidence of shipping accidents in China, especially in
the lower reaches from Wuhan to Liuhekou.
</P>
<P>
Traffic flow on the Yangtze River accounts for two thirds of
China's total inland water transport. The lower reaches,
stretching about 1,100 km and surrounded by one of the country's
economically developed areas, see the busiest traffic on the river
and the accidents along the section account for 70 percent of the
total along the river.
</P>
<P>
Liu said: "A good shipping order will be beneficial to economic
expansion of the whole Yangtze River basin, and to China's opening
up to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are all open to overseas
ships, and each year thousands of foreign ships sail into the
river.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1993, the Ministry of Communications has
invest some 77 million yuan in building vessel traffic service
(VTS) system from Nanjing to Liuhekou.
</P>
<P>
The project includes four VTS centers in Nanjing, Zhenjiang,
Zhangjiagang and Nantong with 12 radar stations, one micro-wave
relay station and a VHF (very high frequency) relay station.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed before the end of this
year, according to Liu. Some of it have been put into operation,
playing an important role in effecting the new sailing system.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister disclosed that his ministry plans to invest
tens of millions of yuan in the coming five years in establishing
the VTS system on the river section from Wuhan to Nanjing, so as
to better improve the management of shipping order on the Yangtze
River.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Withholds Reaction to Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu Saturday night discussed with senior aides the results
of the Arab mini-summit held in Damascus, but refused to respond.
</P>
<P>
His office said that a reaction would come only after his
government is formed possibly next week.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Assad, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah met in the Syrian capital over
the weekend to discuss implications of Netanyahu's election
victory. They warned that any shifts in Israel's peace policy
would plunge the Middle East into violence. The three leaders
also called for another Arab summit in Cairo in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a possible contender for a senior
Likud cabinet post, said on Israel Television Saturday night that
the calling of the summit even before Netanyahu had formed his
cabinet "indicates that there is nervousness on the opposite side,
because the relatively comfortable life they had with the previous
government they understand has ended and a new period has come."
</P>
<P>
"It is part of a natural and expected reappraisal that one
shouldn't get excited about," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last time Arab leaders gathered en mass was in August
1990, days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Rifts over the invasion
and the subsequent Gulf War, as well as different perceptions
of the peace process, prevented another summit since then.

LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Another Liberian refugee ship with
450 people on board on a two-week Odyssey off the west African
coast has been allowed to berth in the Ghanaian port of Takoradi.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying that there are some
82 Liberians and 170 Ghanaians on the Russian-registered vessel
Zolotisa that left the Liberian capital of Monrovia on May 26.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, the UNHCR and the United States appealed to
the west African nations to allow the ship into the port.
Washington also offered to provide financial support to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Relief officials said the ship was in a poor condition. Many
of the refugees were women and children.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the ship tried to berth in Ghana on May 30
but was prevented from doing so by the Ghanaian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The ship then set course for Lome in Togo. But after taking fuel,
water, food and medicine on board, it was escorted out of the port
by the Togolese navy.
</P>
<P>
In early May, 5,000 refugees fled war-torn Liberia on board
ships. Several countries in the west African region have refused
them entry.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Public Sector Surplus Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- the Philippine government's
consolidated public sector surplus (CPSS) dropped to 1.29 billion
pesos (51 million US dollars) for the first three months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Finance, the figure was against
the 4.64 billion pesos (185 million dollars) surplus posted during
the first three months of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the first quarter consolidated public sector financial
position (CPSFP) surplus was a big turnaround from the 18.53
billion pesos (741 million dollars) deficit programmed for the
period.
</P>
<P>
The 1.29 billion pesos (51 million dollars) surplus is
equivalent to 0.1 percent of gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The decline in the CPSFP was attributed to the budget deficit
incurred by the government-owned and controlled corporations'
(GOCCS), which grew to 2.83 billion pesos (113 million dollars)
from only 1.96 billion pesos (78 million dollars) in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The lower surplus could also be traced to the budget deficit
posted by the national government, which stood at 1.56 billion
pesos (62 million dollars) for the first quarter of this year as
against the 3.19 billion pesos (127 million dollars) surplus
posted in the same period in 1995.

</P>
<P>
According to the press release issued by the Guinea Worm

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The "Sunday Mail" of Zambia today
carries an editorial comment calling for "a reconciliation
between the country's warring political parties".
</P>
<P>
The paper in its editorial comment entilted "Talks Only
Answer" said, "there can be no doubt that the current political
tension has been hightened by differences between the main actors
in the political arena -- MMD (Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy) and UNIP (United National Independence Party) -- and
the sooner the two parties resolved their differences the better
for the country."
</P>
<P>
Tension has arisen between the ruling and opposition parties
in Zambia around the a contitution amendment bill which actually
bars the participation of former president Kenneth Kaunda in
running the presidency in the forth coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
However, there are signs of reconciliation in the nation. At a
meeting called by Zambia's independent monitoring team in Kitwe,
north of Lusdaka, on Saturday the country's political
stakeholders, MMD, main opposition UNIP and the Zambia Democratic
Congress agreed on the need for dialogue and understanding,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The copperbelt MMD Chairman, Kaunda Lembalemba, even went a
step further by saying that insulting President Fredrick Chiluba
and former president Kenneth Kaunda was no good for Zambian
politics, the news paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The "sunday mail" stressed the poit that "although political
parties hold diverse views about the recently-amended constitution
there is no need for fighting".

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Booksellers Stop School Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of booksellers
have stopped supplying government schools due to non-payment
despite assurances by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Education that
outstanding debts are being settled, the Sunday Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said the introduction of the stop
payment system in October last year had resulted in delays in
payment to creditors, including booksellers.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry had teething problems which have now been
addressed as most arrears have been cleared," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the booksellers said they had last been paid by
the government last year with one being owed in excess of 200,000
U.S. Dollars. "We can't supply because we have not been paid money
from last year," they said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1st 100-days of New Government in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Marked achievements have been seen
both in Australia's social and foreign affairs as the
Liberal-National coalition is to celebrate its 100th day in office
Monday, but the budget issue is still a headache for the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Since the coalition won the March 2 election, the outstanding
symbol of John Howard's success is the rising of popular support
gained from the strong stand adopted by him on civil gun control.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, lone gunman Martin Bryant killed 35 and injured 19
others at the historic Port Arthur site in the southern island of
Tasmania, the country was shocked by the terrible massacre.
</P>
<P>
Following the tragedy, Howard pledged an overhaul of gun
control laws including a total ban on all automatic and
semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Howard's impressive strong position, despite the resistance
from powerful gun lobby, has won the people's support and
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government has also taken positive steps in its
relations with foreign countries, notably with Malaysia, by
dispatching a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to hand in an
invitation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, and having talks
with him. The Howard government has successfully eased some
political tensions left over from the previous Keating government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also sent high-ranking officials
to visit a number of countries in the region, specially countries
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to make known of
its priority of foreign policy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
A conspicuous feature is the latest development of its
relations with the United States. Howard has reportedly requested
his ministers to revitalize the relationship "at all levels" with
the US including the strengthening of the ANZUS Alliance, which
comprises Australia, New Zealand and the US.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Defense Minister McLachlan revealed that his country
was desired to provide a "part-time" use to the US military and
allow the "pre-positioning" of US military hardware on the
Australian soil.
</P>
<P>
However, after the new government came to power, Howard found
that the key challenge facing him is to bridge the gap between his
reassurance promised during the election campaign and the daunting
fiscal task ahead.
</P>
<P>
The government has put forward its balanced budget, and pledged
eight billion Australian dollars (six billion US dollars) in
budget cuts in the next two years. A succession of leaks about
planned budget cuts have upset farmers, miners, exporters,
university students as well as business groups.
</P>
<P>
The government also intended to cut the financial spending to
the higher education sector, which was reportedly to be as high as
12 percent. The proposed move touched off a wide-ranging and
strong opposition from the powerful student organizations and
teachers and stuff in universities.
</P>
<P>
Whenever there were reports about the government intention to
cut spending on other major programs such as the Export Market
Development Grants Scheme, or the 150 percent Research and
Development Tax Concession, the people concerned, without
exception, made strong reactions.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, the prime minister recently indicated
that the federal government was determined to stand by its plan to
cut 8 billion dollars out of Commonwealth spending.
</P>
<P>
By waiting until August to announce the details of the budget
spending cuts, Howard has avoided an overall unrest at this
moment, but the question is still there.
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the budget question is not the only headache for the
government, as the prime minister in another occasion listed three
major challenges ahead of him, one of them is the "unacceptably
high level of unemployment". According to the latest report
issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the jobless rate in
the country stood at 8.5 percent in May lowered from 8.9 percent
in April.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Veterans Deployed in Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 veterans have recently
been redrafted and deployed in northern Uganda in a bid to crush
rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), reported the local
daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was quoted as saying that
another 4,000 would be sent to beef up the Uganda People's
Defence Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
"We shall go back to the adquate infantry to track the
rebels," the President said in a speech delivered here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On frequent attacks and ambushes by the LRA rebels, he said
the rebels thrive on "the under-deployment of UPDF forces and
some of our weakness but not that the rebels are strong".
</P>
<P>
On policy towards LRA led by Joseph Kony, he said, "his
fighters who surrender will be granted amnesty but we shall not
forgive Kony, Vincent Otti and Otti Lagony." He blamed them for
killing innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
On policy to rebels of the West Nile Bank Front led by Juma
Oris, he said he would be ready to discuss with Oris because "we
found a message on the body of one of his commanders, a captain
killed, telling him to minimize civilian casualties".

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Invited to Arab Summit in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has
been invited to attend an Arab summit on June 21-23, which was
called by Egyptian, Syrian and Saudi Arabian leaders in Damascus
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's "Sawt Al-Watan" (Voice of the Nation) radio reported
this morning that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak phoned Hrawi
Saturday night to invite his Lebanese counterpart to the Arab
summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say whether the Lebanese president had answered
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz, following their meetings in Syria's
capital Damascus on Friday and Saturday, called for the Arab
summit to close ranks and counter hardline policies of Israeli
Premier-elect Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri welcomed
the call for an Arab summit, saying "it would strengthen Lebanon's
position in demanding an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this summit which we will attend. It is a positive
step," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it is a large Arab summit makes it a meeting of
power and strength. It strengthens the Arab position and
Lebanon's stand in particular," al-Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Netanyahu's victory in the May 29 Israeli
elections has caused concern among Arab nations about the prospect
of the Middle East peace process. It also prompted a series of
minor Arab summits, including one of Mubarak, Jordan's King
Hussein and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Aqaba, Jordan,
Wednesday in an addition to the three-way summit in
Damascus.

<HEADLINE> Russia Predicts Dramatic Events in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia predicted new and dramatic
events to happen in the Middle East but there should be no
setbacks in the peace process because there are no alternatives to
peace, said Russian deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Posuvalyuk made the statement here before winding up his
three-day "politically important" visit to Tehran today.
</P>
<P>
But the official in charge of Russian Foreign Ministry's Middle
East affairs did not elaborate in the issue in the report carried
in today's English-language daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk said that Russia has always been deeply interested
in affairs of the Middle East and plans to be more active in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to try and solve this crisis alone and are
opposed to the idea of one country monopolizing all efforts
toward achieving peace in the Middle East," he was quoted by the
daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that his statement is directly pointed to
the United States in a bid to break the monopoly by Americans in
the politics in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official said that after leaving Tehran he will
confer with Iraqi officials to find ways to provide Baghdad with
humanitarian aid in compliance with U.N. Resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Tehran, the Russian deputy foreign minister
held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati. The
two officials pledged close cooperation in the Middle East
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk arrived here Friday and will also visit
Baghdad, Amman and Damascus after his stay in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Improve Health Care Service for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The poor in Vietnam are expected to
enjoy free medical and health care service in the future, thanks
to the government's efforts to set up health insurance system in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese hospitals will earmark 20 percent of their beds for
the poor and families of fallen soldiers, war invalids and
veterans for treatment free of charge, Vietnamese news agency
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The move was decided at an inter-branch conference on health
care for the poor held here on May 5-6.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has some 14 million poor people, accounting for 20
percent of its total population, and nearly 4 million of them are
in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Poor people occupy between 40-50 percent of hospital beds,
though 73 percent of all the poor usually treat themselves in case
of illness. Five percent of the nation's population have no money
to pay the health care bill, the official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's health care network is "in great difficulty," the news
agency said, adding that as many as 600 communal infirmaries
nationwide have been seriously degraded.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the recent economic booming, many poor people still
do not have enough money to pay health care service.
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, 275,000 people, or 4 percent of the
poor people, were given free health insurance cards.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is striving to provide free medical insurance for
helping the poor out of poverty in additional to the nation's
efforts to set up medical insurance fund in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kirghizia Sees Signs of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, Kirghizia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kirghiz economy has
shown signs of recovery recently, with the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) rising 2 percent in the first quarter this
year from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also showed the industrial output value
jumped by 10 percent in the first four months this year from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade surged by 52 percent in the first quarter this
year to 268 million U.S. dollars compared to the same period in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed these improvements to a milder line taken
by the government in economic reforms since early 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Kirghiz government had carried out radical economic
reforms, including a quick transition to a market economy, and a
massive privatization program in the tiny mountainous country
since its independence from the former Soviet Union in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the three years of radical economic reforms had been
fraught with serious economic woes, such as a successive GDP
decline by 20 percent a year, rocketing inflation rate and a
significant fall in the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of 1995, the government slowed down economic
reforms and succeeded in checking the downward trend of the
economy. As a result, the GDP fell by a mere 6.2 percent that year.
</P>
<P>
To lift the country out of the economic crisis as soon as
possible, the government took a series of measures this year,
including restructuring enterprises, banking and tax collection
systems.
</P>
<P>
The government has set it the lowest goals this year to
increase the GDP by 3 to 4 percent, the value of industrial output
by 3 percent and that of agricultural output by 5 percent.
Meanwhile, the government plans to limit the budget deficit to
less than 6 percent of the GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In an ambitious 10-year development program formulated earlier,
the government hopes to build Kirghizia, now a mainly agricultural
economy, into an industrialized country by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by recent upturns, economists predicted that the
Kirghiz economy will recover from the crisis in two years and
embark on a road of stable growth. But they also cautioned that
the government was still confronted with a series of economic
difficulties -- huge unemployment and enormous domestic and
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Production in half of the country's enterprises had halted by
the end of 1995, leaving 300,000 workers, or one-seventh of the
still employed, jobless.
</P>
<P>
Interlocked debts between enterprises have so far hit 70
billion soms (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) and the backlog of wages
owed to workers 300 million soms (11 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another challenge comes from the increasing foreign debt which
has amounted to 480 million dollars, of which the government needs
to pay about 45 million dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Ex-Leader Urges National Unity to Fight Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's former leader Todor
Zhivkov, who had ruled the country for 35 years until 1989,
appealed Friday for national unity to pull the country out of the
deep economic mire.
</P>
<P>
"I am obliged to tell the Bulgarian people that only with the
efforts of the whole nation can we get out of the catastrophe we
are in," Zhivkov, 84, said in a type-written statement.
</P>
<P>
Bread crisis now is spreading all over Bulgaria, with
skyrocketing prices and repeated strikes, resulting in mounting
economic and social instability.
</P>
<P>
The current socialist cabinet, led by Prime Minister Zhan
Videnov, is taking tough austerity measures in a bid to avert
economic collapse but meets with increasing complaints from both
the opposition parties and the public.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov noted in his statement that the country is facing an
all-out crisis and its future is at stake. The only outlet depends
on the unity of all Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
"Brothers and sisters, we must stop opposing each other and
organize a movement to save the fatherland," he appealed.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov gave no further details about his proposed movement
and said he was too old to become involved himself.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov, who stepped down in 1989, had been under house arrest
until February 1996 when the Supreme Court finally overturned the
seven-year jail sentence made on him for embezzlement in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Despite the allegations of corruption over the years, Zhivkov
has remained popular among many Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov said he had received many requests to run for the
country's presidency but said he was too old for that now.
</P>
<P>
"I will not run for president...Alas life is boringly
short. Look for someone younger," he said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-funded Enterprises in Hebei Expand Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Almost all overseas-funded
enterprises in Hebei province, North China, have expanded
production after making profits.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 2,000 of Hebei's 5,000 registered
overseas-funded enterprises have gone into production.
</P>
<P>
Ye Liansong, governor of the province, attributed this to the
province's good transport facilities, rich natural resources and
solid industrial basis as well as its location in the center of
the rim along the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
Hebei's annual gross domestic product had increased at an
annual average of 14.6 percent in the 1991-95 period, 2.6
percentage points higher than the national average, thus the
province has attracted more and more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Hebei actually used 1.07 billion US
dollars of overseas investment last year, up 44.9 percent over the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Begins Swim From Cuba to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Susie Maroney of Australia
finished more than the 90 kilometers in her bid to swim the 175-km
Florida Straits between Cuba and Florida.
</P>
<P>
After swimming the first 30 kilometers Saturday, Maroney swam
outside her shark cage to escape the nausea she experienced inside
it. Choppy seas tossed the cage, causing the 21-year-old to
swallow too much salt water, Connie Pignatiello, president of the
company that owns the escort boat ``Reel Lady,'' said in a
telephone interview from Coral Springs, according to a press
report.
</P>
<P>
But calmer seas and winds farther in the Straits allowed
Maroney to keep up a steady pace and swim 67 kilometers by
Saturday night, Pignatiello said.
</P>
<P>
After two postponements because of poor weather, Maroney
entered the water near Havana early Saturday in view of about 200
spectators. She was expected to swim for about 50 hours and reach
Florida early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian ultra-swimmer, who took seasickness pills
Saturday, was protected during her swim inside a 8.4-by-2.4-meter
shark cage topped by a canopy.
</P>
<P>
To achieve her goal, she is not allowed to grab the side of the
cage, touch the bottom or get on board the boat for a break. The
cage is dragged alongside the boat and is designed so that the
water will flow in and around it and have minimal drag.
</P>
<P>
She is surviving on a diet of warm chocolate milk, chopped
bananas, high-nutrition cakes and other protein drinks. She
doesn't plan to sleep and will have hourly 10-minute breaks.
</P>
<P>
In more than 50 tries by swimmers to cross the Straits
recognized by the Swimming Hall of Fame, none have been successful.
</P>
<P>
The swimmer was accompanied by four boats. Her mother Pauline
and brother Michael, along with swim coordinator Hugh Rule, are
traveling with her to offer moral support.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Pours Supports for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture since 1993 has injected 11.7 million yuan (about 1.4
million US dollars) into the reservoir area of the Three Gorges
Project, the world's largest water-control project.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the ministry said the investments have been used
for the construction of agricultural production bases, fine seeds
breeding bases and the agro-technique service system.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been making efforts to make resettlement
arising from the construction of the project an easier job because
the reservoir area is less developed economically.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the ministry has set aside 500,000 yuan annully for
Yunyang County, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, to support
infrastructure construction and social undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Agricultural University run by the ministry has
sent teams to help the county carry out scientific and
technological development projects.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 11 projects for the development of agro-technique
have been launched in the county. A sprinkling irrigation system
serving 133 hectares of farmland has eased the drought and
diversified the varieties of crop planting.
</P>
<P>
The sprinkling irrigation system, put into operation last fall,
has become a model project in the development of high-efficiency
agriculture in the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry has organized experts compiling a book
entitled "Overall Planning for the Development of Agriculture and
Agro-Economy in the Reservoir Area during 1995-2010."
</P>
<P>
The book has formulated plans for the development of planting,
forestry and fruits, animal husbandry, aquatic production,
township businesses and the spread of agro-techniques, and
specific measures to carry out these plans.
</P>
<P>
Officials also said the ministry has planned to help each
county in the reservoir area develop one or two key projects which
will make people become better off within a short period.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shizhu County's long-haired hare breeding base,
Badong County's vegetable production base, both supported by the
ministry, have taken shape and are expected to become pillars of
local economy.

HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang province
will spend 7.1 billion yuan on building water supply projects to
meet the urban needs in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that the water shortage caused the
province's industrial output value to decrease by 3.6 billion yuan
last year, and people in a number of cities and counties are
short of drinking water supply.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the main reason for the water shortage
was inadequate government investment in building water supply
projects.

facilities, the provincial government has decided to raise funds
through different channels including overseas investment for such
undertakings.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Striving to be an Industrial Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost Hainan Province
is making its way to be a new rising industrial region in the
country, changing its former status as an agricultural region.
</P>
<P>
After much investment were made in such projects as textile and
power plants which have gone into operation in the past several
years, the provincial industrial output value reached 14 billion
yuan (1.6 billion US dollars) last year from 1988's 3 billion
yuan, a senior local government official said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of industrial infrastructure facilities are being
intensified. Macun power plant with an investment of 1.2 billion
yuan and other eight power plants with an total investment of
nearly 5 billion yuan are in progress, and a large iron and steel
company is to be soon completed.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 billion yuan have been invested in various sectors of
industry in the past seven years, with an average annual increase
of 42.7 percent, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The province was listed as one of the country's five special
economic zones in 1988, but its 1994 industrial output value was
below the national average due to its poor industrial foundation.
</P>
<P>
Since the provincial government decided to develop the province
into an industrial region, it has concentrated on seven pillar
industries, including oil refinery, auto-making, food-processing,
textile, pharmaceutical, paper and building materials industries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It plans to put a total of 56 billion yuan into new key
projects, which will add a new production capability of about 41
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Not to Sign Trade Pact With Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua will not sign a free
trade agreement with Mexico this year, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming general elections and internal difficulties in
industry and agriculture are the main causes preventing the
signing of the agreement, Vice-Minister of Economy Eduardo Belli
was quoted today by the "Barricada" daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers of the two countries had agreed to make their
last efforts so that a more feasible agreement could be reached
in June, he said. "But that will not lead us to the signing of a
free trade agreement."
</P>
<P>
Mexico's reluctance to accept beef and sugar quotas proposed by
Nicaragua added to the difficulty in signing a trade agreement,
said Belli.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has set June
30 as the deadline for the negotiations. But there is no sign of
progress so far, though only 22 days are left for a final deal.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua will hold general elections on October 20 and
President Barrios de Chamorro will end her term of office on
January 10, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Sets Rules Governing Traffic Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common Market
(Mercosur) members have agreed on guidelines to regulate traffic
accidents occurring to their nationals within the jurisdiction of
any of the four member countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
is based on another one already agreed on by Argentina and Uruguay
more than a year ago, the "El Observador" daily said said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will decide in a precise way which law and which
court will be applied after the outbreak of traffic accidents,
which involved automobiles, trucks, buses or citizens of any of
the four countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, if an Uruguayan and an Argentinian collide in
Uruguayan territory, Uruguayan law will be applied and the case
will be taken to an Uruguayan court.
</P>
<P>
However, if two Argentinians collide in Uruguayan territory,
the case will be tried in an Argentine court, but applying
Uruguayan law. The same principle will be applied to citizens of
the other member countries.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are expected to be on the rise following the
increase of exchange of persons and the transit of vehicles among
the Mercosur countries, making it crucial to to arrive at this
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be in force when it is ratified by the
parliaments of the four Mercosur countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit for Nicaragua's
next general elections has dropped to 6.5 million U.S. dollars
thanks to recent international donations, said the Supreme
Electoral Council (CSE).
</P>
<P>
CSE President Rosa Marina Zelaya said the international
community has responded to the call by the Nicaraguan government
and the CSE to fund the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has donated 1 million dollars. Yoshinori
Miyamoto, Japanese ambassador to Nicaragua, announced that Japan
will grant Nicaragua about half a million dollars, Zelaya added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government had already donated 240,000 dollars to
the Organization of American States (OAS) for the observation of
the Nicaraguan electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Zelaya said that despite the new contributions, the budget for
the first round of elections, scheduled for October 20, is still 2
million dollars short.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that the second round of voting looks
necessary as no party is likely to obtain 45 percent of votes
required for a first round victory.
</P>
<P>
The CSE estimates that 4.5 million dollars are possibly needed
for the second round slated for December.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Environment in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China will take a series of
measures to improve the environment in the Three Gorges area,
where the world's largest water-control project is being
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission has announced a program for the
economic development of the Three Gorges area, saying that
tackling of ecological and environmental problems there will have
a direct bearing on the resettlement of the local people and the
construction of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area, located in Sichuan and Hubei Provinces
in the upstream of the Yangtze River, covers 59,900 square
kilometers. After the project's reservoir is full of water, 21
cities or cities will be affected.
</P>
<P>
The area has complicated geological conditions, with steep
cliffs on the banks of Yangtze River, landslides and mud-rock
flows. Soil erosion is also serious because of rampant development
of land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pollutants discharged by towns or cities along the
river have also posed threats to the water quality of the river.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has carried out several projects, such as
building forest-shelter in the upper and middle reaches of the
river, to conserve soil and water in the upper reaches. Some
problems have been solved but the overall environmental situation
is still pregnant with grim possibilities.
</P>
<P>
In order to build the Three Gorges Project, over one million
people will have to be resettled. Large tracts of barren hills and
wasteland will be developed.
</P>
<P>
With the rise of water level, Yangtze's water flowing speed
will become slower, making pollution contents be washed away
slower.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Planning Commission said that China will
give top priority to the fortification of shelterbelt along the
Yangtze and the construction of water and soil conservation
projects in the upstream of the river.
</P>
<P>
The country also plans to plant large tracts of shelter-forest
and economic forest and establish ecological agricultural
development zone in local smaller river areas. Forest-shelter will
also be built in cities in the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the water pollution, the country plans to
intercept the waster water flow, build water supply and drainage
system and waste water treatment plants.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Combating "Fires of Hatred" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Saturday that racial hostility is behind a series of Southern
black church fires, pledging he will devote whatever resources are
needed to "smother the fires of hatred that fuel this violence."
</P>
<P>
At least 30 fires, the latest taking place on Thursday night in
Charlotte, North Carolina, have swept through black churches in
Southern states, since early 1995, but so far no one has been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his weekly radio speech, "We must stand up as a
national community to safeguard the right of every citizen to
worship in safety."
</P>
<P>
Clinton added his support to pending legislation that would
make it easier to prosecute in federal court people who attack
houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms will visit churches throughout the South to advise on
steps that can be taken to ward off arsonists, Clinton said.
