<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Eight Lebanese civilians and one
Israeli soldier were wounded Thursday in a Hezbollah suicide
bombing in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber detonated a bomb in his car when an Israeli
patrol was passing on a road in Qlaiaa village inside the Israeli
occupied border in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He was killed instantly while one Israeli and eight lebanese
civilians who were passing by, including children and women, were
wounded in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying it would continue their
fighting against Israeli occupation forces until they pull out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war in an effort to
liberate southern Lebanon from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Russia's GDP Up 2 Percent, Industrial Output Up 8 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 year eyed Russia's
gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2 percent with industrial
output up 8 percent, said the Russian Economy Ministry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The chemical, petrochemical, timber, woodworking, paper and
pulp, engineering, metalworking, steel, nonferrous metal, food and
construction materials industries reflected the fastest growth,
said the ministry in a release.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation, however, reached 37 percent, compared to the
planned 30 percent, while monthly inflation in the last quarter
dropped to 1.5 percent, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset investment showed an increase for the first time
since Russia began its reforms, registering 1 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The economy's 1999 performance was largely "the result of
actions of the government of the Russian Federation to overcome
the financial and general economic crisis during the 16 months
after August 1998," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Beatle Member Stable After Stabbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Beatle member George
Harrison, who was stabbed in the chest by an intruder armed with a
knife in a pre-dawn attack at his home near London Thursday, was
in stable condition in hospital, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Harrison, 56, was in stable condition in
hospital after fighting off the intruder at his closely guarded
home in Henley-on-Thames, west of London. His wife, Olivia, was
also wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Harrison was admitted to hospital at 5 a.m. (0500 GMT)
this morning. He is now stable. He had a single stab wound to the
chest. His wife was with him. She suffered minor head injuries and
was not admitted," Reuters quoted a spokesman for nearby Royal
Berkshire Hospital as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Guy Bailey said the 33-year-old attacker had
been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at the 100-room
mansion where the couple have lived for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Bailey said a member of the Harrisons' staff reported the
attack at 3:30 a.m. It was not clear if the assailant was an
obsessed fan, like the man who shot dead ex-Beatle John Lennon in
New York in 1980, or a robber, he said. But the attacker was from
Liverpool, birthplace of all the pop group's members.
</P>
<P>
Lennon was shot dead outside his New York apartment building on
December 8, 1980, by obsessed fan Mark Chapman.
</P>
<P>
Harrison, the Beatles' lead guitarist, lived for many years in
the shadow of Lennon and Paul McCartney and was rated a major
musician in his own right only after the "Fab Four" broke up.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Insurance Company Estimates Storm Damage at Several Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's largest re-
insurer, Swiss Re, has estimated the damage from the recent storm
in Europe at about several billion U.S. dollars, Swiss Radio
International reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the gale-force winds and level of destruction
made it worthy of the title, Storm of the Century, Swiss Re said,
adding that the latest storm combined with natural disasters
around the globe earlier in the year have made 1999 the second
costliest year on record, amounting to about 70 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only 1992 was more expensive for insurance companies, when
Hurricane Andrew swept through the United States, according to
Swiss Re. More than 50,000 people lost their lives in the
hurricanes, tornadoes flooding and earthquakes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life is getting back to normal in the areas in
Switzerland worst-hit by the storms, said Swiss Radio
International. Electricity has been restored to most households
and road and rail links reopened. The improving weather has also
allowed the authorities to get a clearer picture of the extent of
the destruction. It is estimated that in canton Berne alone,
around 20,000 buildings were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The storm killed 14 people in Switzerland. The last victim died
in a Zurich hospital Wednesday from head injuries.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua)- The Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni held talks
in Kampala on the Congolese civil war and cooperation between the
two countries on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport in Kigali, Bizimungu told
reporters that the two leaders reaffirmed their full commitment to
the Lusaka cease fire agreement on the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and the peace process in Burundi scheduled for January
2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwandan News Agency report on Thursday, Bizimungu
said that the two heads of state expressed support for the
mediation of former Botswana president Katumile Masire in the
DRC's civil war.
</P>
<P>
 He said that they also discussed the peace process in Burundi
and reiterated their common stand of support for former South
African president,

Nelson Mandela as the new mediator in peace talks between the
Burundian government and the rebels fighting to oust Bujumbura
regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, president Bizimungu and his Ugandan counterpart
Museveni, agreed to bring an end to the distrust brought about by
armed clashes between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in Kisangani in
August 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict has definitely strained our bilateral relations,
" he said, adding that "we acted in time to prevent the situation
from deteriorating".
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to the DRC, to support the DRC
rebels soon after a rebellion broke out in the third largest
African country in early August 1998. DRC president Laurent Kabila
has on the other hand been backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have come to support the rival factions of
the DRC rebels due to their strategic interests in the country.
The Kisangani clashes have plunged the two countries' relations an
all-time low.

BAGHDAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry said on

Committee had suspended 813 contracts it signed under the past four
phases of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry told the Iraqi News Agency that

Under the oil-for-food deal now in its seventh phase, Iraq is

food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people
reeling from the nine-year U.N. sanctions imposed on it after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the envoys from the U.S. and

<HEADLINE> Two Thirds of Millennium Dome Tickets Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Plans for London's New Year's
Eve bash were thrown into chaos Thursday as organizers admitted
that two thirds of the invited guests for the extravaganza at the
new Millennium Dome had not received their tickets.
</P>
<P>
With barely 24 hours to go, only 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets
for the exclusive party under the biggest roof in the world had
been sent out, and it was too late to mail the rest, Reuters
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The glitch meant the cavernous 758 million pound (1.23 billion
U.S. dollar) structure on the Thames river, purpose-built amid
considerable controversy to celebrate the new millennium, could be
at least half-empty on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the thousands who did not get their tickets in
the post should be able to queue for them on the night at one of
two London rail stations, Stratford and Charlton.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who should be going to the Dome on New Year's Eve
will actually be able to go. Whether they received the ticket by
registered post, or if they go to either Charlton or Stratford and
their name is on the guest list, then there will be a way in which
they can go to the Dome," a spokesman for the New Millennium
Experience Company said.
</P>
<P>
Tickets to the Dome were never put on sale. But organizers had
promised to send them out two weeks before the event to the lucky
recipients, who were either nominated because of community work or
won the tickets through competition.
</P>
<P>
All those promised tickets have undergone rigorous security
checks and many received a map of the Dome with its 16 "zones" in
recent weeks, with a promise of tickets to follow. But in most
cases the tickets did not turn up.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they had delayed issuing tickets for security
reasons and then had problems with the Christmas post.
</P>
<P>
Months of planning have gone into the New Year's Eve program of
singing, dancing, partying and praying, which is to be attended by
Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Al-Sharaa Discuss Syrian-Israeli Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa on Thursday discussed
the Middle East peace process, especially the resumed peace talks
between Syria and Israel, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Sharaa decided to maintain consultation and
coordination between their two countries, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also asserted the need to coordinate stances between Syria
and the Palestinians on their separate peace talks with Israel,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held talks on
December 15-16 in Washington, a signal of the resumption of Syrian-
Israeli peace talks after a freeze of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to continue talks on January 3 on Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights, security arrangements and
normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are negotiating with Israel for a final peace
agreement on tough issues including borders, Jerusalem, refugees
and Jewish settlements. The Palestinians have welcomed the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks, saying that any progress on
the Syrian track will help promote the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa has left for Syria after ending his lightening visit
in Cairo, during which he conveyed a message to Mubarak from Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Describing the message as important, al-Sharaa said before
departure that it dealt with Syria's stance on the peace process
and its developments, as well as Damascus' expectations from the
coming round of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists on complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights while Israel hopes to maintain early warning systems on the
strategic plateau as part of the security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Syria showed its strong resentment against Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in 1993 for making a peace deal with Israel without
consulting other Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
But Cairo's ties with Damascus improved after a visit earlier
this month to Syria by Moussa with a letter from Mubarak to Assad.

Vietnam in Hanoi on Thursday on behalf of their respective
countries.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the treaty, all outstanding issues relating
to the land border between China and Vietnam have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended the signing ceremony were Vietnamese

</P>
<P>
Recalling all rounds of negotiations on land border between the
two countries, Tang attributed the removal of numerous
difficulties, the complete settlement of remaining disputes and
the timely signing of the treaty, first and foremost, to the very

countries.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the success to the consistent efforts made
by the two countries' delegations and working groups in charge of
land border negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam are close neighbors, and to bring peace,
amity, cooperation and stability along the land border between the
two countries into the 21st century conforms to the common
aspirations of the two peoples and serves the fundamental interest
of the two countries, Tang said. It will also contribute
significantly to regional peace and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Khai described December 30, 1999 as a
red-letter day when China and Vietnam officially signed the Land
Border Treaty, fulfilling the task assigned by the general
secretaries of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that it was a big event of great historic
significance in the relations between Vietnam and China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong belief that the event would contribute
to further promoting the friendly and cooperative relations
between the two countries well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Tang conveyed the warm regards from Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
to Khai.

President Bill Clinton's statement on developing a real Russian-U.
S. partnership in the 21st century, said Vladimir Rakhmanin,
spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CBS last Tuesday, Clinton said that there
is every reason to expect relations between the U.S. and Russia to
take on the character of real partnership in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this consistent and principled position of the U.S.
president," Rakhmanin said, stressing that it "coincides with our
assessment of the prospects for Russian-U.S. cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said, "The positive and predictable development of
Russian-U.S. relations in the 21st century meets the vital
national interests of both nations, and is a major factor in
consolidating international security and stability."
</P>
<P>
Referring to repeated statements by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Rakhmanin said, "Moscow
's main policy lies in strengthening the equal and mutually
advantageous cooperation between the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Russia Should Be Powerful Democratic Federal State: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia must become a strong
democratic federal country, said Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin in an article published on the government Internet web site
this week.
</P>
<P>
"Russia needs strong government power and should have it," he
said in the policy-making article titled "Russia at the Turn of
the Millennium."
</P>
<P>
"This is not a call for a totalitarian system. Strong power in
Russia means a democratic, law-governed efficient federal state,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Putin's opinion, such a state can be developed by
rationalizing the power structure, raising the professionalism and
discipline of officials, intensifying anti-corruption efforts,
changing the personnel policy, strengthening the role of the
judicial branch of power, improving federal relations and
effectively fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not think constitutional amendments a pressing
task. The conformity of new legislation to the constitution is an
important related task, and the Justice Ministry, prosecutors'
offices and judicial bodies should help carry it out effectively,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Putin believed "the traditional values of Russians" such as
patriotism, social solidarity and adherence to a strong state are
a foundation for the consolidation of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"To my mind the new Russian idea will be born as an alloy, a
harmonious combination of universal, general human values with
traditional Russian values that have stood the test of time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Putin said it would be wrong to deny the indisputable
achievements of Soviet Union time.
</P>
<P>
However, "responsible social and political forces should offer
the nation a strategy of revival and prosperity in the process of
reforms, which should be carried out by gradual balanced steps in
conditions of political stability and no decline in the living
standards of the Russian people," said the premier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Fall Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department reported that 274,000 Americans filed new claims
for unemployment benefits for the week ending Dec. 25, down by 9,
000 from the previous week. It was the lowest level since Dec. 11,
when claims were at 267,000.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims also was down last week
to 279,750. That marked the lowest level since Dec. 15, 1973, when
claims were at 256,750.
</P>
<P>
Initial jobless claims have been running below 300,000 each
week since early October. So economists and members of the Federal
Reserve shared concern that employers scrambling to find scarce
workers lure them with higher wages and benefits, increased costs
that could drive up product prices.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this
year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. One of
the Fed's chief concerns is that the tight labor market could lead
to wage and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report also said that for the week ending Dec. 18,
23 states and territories reported decreases in new jobless-claims
applications, while 28 reported increases. The state data lag one
week behind the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest decrease in claims was Georgia, down
3,700, while the state with the biggest increase was Virginia, up
4,547.
</P>
<P>
With jobs plentiful and stock prices soaring, consumer
confidence rose in December to the highest level in three decades,
according to the latest report of the Conference Board, a New York
private research firm.

<P>
BRUSSELS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is supporting an
awareness-raising campaign to combat the trafficking of people
from Kosovo, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Junior Minister for Development Cooperation Eddy
Boutmans earmarked seven million Belgian francs (some 175,000 U.S.
dollars) for the program, which is also cooperated by Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at preventing women and children from
being smuggled abroad on payment of large sums of money, which
often go to well-organized "people smugglers".
</P>
<P>
The program intends to make the Kosovar people realize that it
is pointless to come to the West, from which "only the smugglers
benefited."
</P>
<P>
The campaign, staged via local women's organizations and the
media, is followed on the spot by the International Organization

<HEADLINE> Aquatic Wild Animals To Get Better Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- When the National People's
Congress (NPC) revises the Fishing Law next year, priority will be
given to protection of aquatic wild animals, according to a top
NPC official.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenhuai, vice-chairman of the NPC's Agriculture and Rural
Affairs Committee, said at a recent work conference on protecting
endangered Chinese sturgeons that long-term social development
depends on rational use of natural resources and maintaining a
balanced ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Yang asked departments of agriculture, fishery, water
conservancy, hydroelectric power generating, water transportation,
environment protection and research to join efforts to protect the
country's aquatic wild animals.
</P>
<P>
China's waters are rich with many wild species, such as the
white-finned dolphin and Chinese sturgeons, many of which live
along coastal areas and are under top state protection.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many of the aquatic wild animal populations
were on the decline because of water pollution, rampant illegal
fishing and building of dams in major rivers.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the protection of the animals, the Ministry of
Agriculture has issued the Regulations on Protecting Aquatic Wild
Animals, and under approval of the State Council, more than 60
nature reserves were set up, including seven at state-level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, localities nationwide have issued regulations and
publicized lists of aquatic wild animals under local protection. (

With cooperation from departments of public security,
transportation and other relative organs, fishery authorities have
cracked down on poaching and illegal trading in the wild animals.
</P>
<P>
During a recent joint action to halt on illegal fishing in the
Yangtze River, more than 1,000 cases were investigated and 41
illegal fishermen were sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
China has also stepped up the research, propagation and
monitoring of rare aquatic wild animals. After years of work, a
breakthrough was made in breeding Chinese sturgeons and since 1983,
near 6 million artificially-bred minnows were released into the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
This week, 100,000 young sturgeons measuring more than 10
centimeters were released into China's longest river, and experts
believe the move will play a substantial part in keeping the fish
from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, China has monitored white-finned dolphins,
obtaining a great amount of data on them. Based on the statistics
gathered, the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture has
drafted a plan to protect the fish, which are on the verge of
extinction.

</P>
<P>
The 108 bells, arranged in tiers, are divided into three
symbolic categories.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the bells, on the bottom row, represent the
historic periods that the Chinese nation has passed through since
the pre-historic age.
</P>
<P>
China's 56 nationalities are represented by 56 mid-size bells
in the middle tier, and 34 bells on the top row symbolize the
country's 34 provinces, municipalities, autonomous and special
administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
The set "has reached state-of-the-art level for both
contemporary and ancient times," said the review panel which was
composed of experts in the fields of science, culture and arts.

<HEADLINE> State Council Calls for Improving Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government wants
more to be done to improve product quality so as to push forward
the healthy development of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
In a decision on issues of product quality which was made
public here today, the State Council noted that upgrading product
quality is of paramount significance to the revitalization of the
Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
The economy has entered a new phase of development and major
product items have shifted from the seller's market to the buyer's
market, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing product quality will not only meet the needs of the
domestic market, but also help to promote exports and raise China'
s economic efficiency, comprehensive national strength and
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
All enterprises should be market-oriented and put more effort
into upgrading their product quality, the document said.
</P>
<P>
They should do more basic research on product quality, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, government departments and institutions should
strengthen supervision of product quality in line with the rules
of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Supervisory and judicial departments should hand down heavy
punishments for those enterprises that make shoddy or substandard
products.
</P>
<P>
The document also calls for the media across the country to do
more to raise the awareness of quality standards among enterprises
and the general public.

WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The hijackers of an Indian Airlines jet dropped Wednesday
two of their key demands, a 200-million-U.S.-dollar ransom and the
return of a Kashmiri rebel fighter's body, after Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban militia convinced them the requests violated the
tenets of Islam.
</P>
<P>
-- German prosecutors declared Wednesday they will conduct a
criminal investigation of former chancellor Helmut Kohl for breach
of trust after he admitted taking illicit cash donations and
operating a system of secret slush funds during his 16 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As the Indian Airlines hijacking entered its sixth day
Wednesday, growing attention is turning to the Taliban, the
Islamic movement that rules most of Afghanistan but has been
scorned by the world.
</P>
<P>
-- After several weeks of delay, Israel released 26 Palestinian
prisoners Wednesday as part of the latest interim peace accord
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq Composite Index, after nearly a week of trying
and with only two trading days to spare in 1999, at last closed
above the 4000 milestone. The new record was a fitting cap to a
year of victories for the technology-stock-heavy index and its
aficionados.
</P>
<P>
-- The index of leading indicators of the U.S. economy rose 0.3
percent in November, suggesting economic growth will continue at
least through spring, which would mark the longest boom in U.S.
history.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Improve Economic Efficiency (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission(SETC) has so far
provided three recommendation lists, involving 600 enterprises,
for asset management companies which handle the conversion
business.
</P>
<P>
The government has also appropriated a certain sum from
treasury bonds to finance technical upgrading of SOEs. Official
figures show that this year's investment in key sectors including
textile, metallurgical, petrochemical, machinery building, and
telecommunications industries for technical upgrading amounts to
172 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that about 3,000 SOEs had been turned
around by the end of this year. It is generally acknowledged among
economists that China's promise to reverse losses in most SOEs by
year 2000 is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the reform, the Chinese government has
put development of a sound social security system high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The government has raised the minimum of unemployment insurance
and lowest income of urbanites by 30 percent as of July 1 this
year. A framework for a social security system consisting of
pensions, unemployment and medical insurance is expected to come
into being by the end of next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
China's industrial sector registered a 61 percent jump in net
profits in the past eleven months and reduced the losses of the
slumping enterprises by 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed this indicates that the government's struggle to
pull state-owned firms out of difficulties have scored a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, Minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, predicted that the total profit of SOEs this year will
surpass 70 billion yuan, 40 percent more than the figure planned
at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The progress in reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has
been considered one of the major factors behind the steady growth
of the economy. China witnessed a 7.1 percent of economic growth
rate this year, 0.1 percentage point higher than the figure
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the Chinese government has
taken a series of determined steps to turn around money-losing
SOEs, including swapping debts of the enterprises for shares of
banks.
</P>
<P>
This year, China made better use of the funds for writing off
bad assets and non-performing loans, directing the money mostly to
key sectors such as the textile and metallurgical industries. A
number of money-losing and debt-ridden enterprises with a bleak
future have been forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 billion yuan was used in this regard, and about
800 loss-making SOEs were closed or merged.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a new debt-equity conversion strategy was
introduced to help some of the promising large and medium-sized
state enterprises, currently heavily in debt, out of trouble.  (

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Public Agencies Reaffirm Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Several Egyptian public agencies
have reaffirmed that their computer systems have been secured
against Y2K problems with the advent of the new millennium, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agencies have also announced that they have
worked out emergency plans to prepare for any eventuality, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a
year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said its government ministries and agencies and the
public sector have been Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect any mishaps (to be caused by Y2K problems) but
we need to be prepared," Sameh el-Torgoman, chairman of the
Egyptian bourse, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that an integrated transition plan and contingency
plans have been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
A market-wide mock trading session will be held on Saturday,
January 1, 2000, to check the computer systems of the bourse to
ward off any mishaps on Sunday, the first trading day of the new
year, el-Torgoman said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmi announced on
Wednesday that his ministry's computers and electronic devices are
Y2K compliant and well prepared for the advent of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Integrated tests have been conducted on all oil fields, networks
and generating stations to ensure Y2K compliance, Fahmi said.
</P>
<P>
Seven emergency operation rooms and main control center would
begin work on Thursday and submit a report about the operations of
the computer systems in an hour till Sunday morning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport and the Egyptian Railway Authority
have also said that they have been ready for the new millennium.
But as a precaution, Cairo's subway will stop operation between 22:
00 local time (2000 GMT) on Friday and Saturday morning.

<P>
MANILA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
has upheld only 66 death sentences or 42 percent of the 158 death
verdicts reviewed as of December 15, a pro-life lawmaker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing number of death verdicts being thrown out by
the high tribunal indicates a pattern of abuse and recklessness by
some lower court judges who have become dangerously overzealous in
resorting to capital punishment," House Representative Roan
Libarios told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Of the 158 death verdicts reviewed, Libarios said, 61 were
nullified and modified by the high court to life imprisonment due
to lack of qualifying circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Libarios said 23 other death sentences were voided after the
tribunal acquitted a number of death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
He said eight other death penalty cases were sent back by the
high tribunal to the lower courts for retrial due to substantial
and grave procedural lapses committed by judges.
</P>
<P>
Of the 66 death verdicts upheld by the high tribunal, six were
carried out last year.

<HEADLINE> India Increases Duty on Sugar, Edible Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Thursday increased import duty on sugar and refined edible oil to
40 and 27.5 percent respectively in order to check imports which
were said affecting domestic producers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Affairs Minister Shanta Kumar told the media here that
the countervailing duty of 850 rupees (approximately 20 U.S.
dollars) per tons on imported sugar remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The import duty hike on sugar is 12.5 percent as it goes up
from the present 27.5 percent to 40 percent while the duty hike in
refined edible oil is 10 percent in addition to the 10 percent
surcharge which makes the total increase to 17.5 percent from the
present 15 percent, Kumar said
</P>
<P>
However, the import duty on crude edible oil has been retained
at 16.5 percent and the differential duty rate would help the
domestic oil processing units in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government also dispensed with discretionary quota for free
sale sugar from January 1, 2000, to do away with ad hoc release of
additional quantities over and above the monthly release to
individual sugar mills, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to bringing imported sugar on par with domestically
produced sugar, the government has issued fresh notification
directing importers not to sell without getting permission in
writing.

<P>
The ministry also forecast that the per capita income is
expected to hit 11,000 U.S. dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for the year 2000 is based on this year's 10-
percent economic growth, the average exchange rate of 1 U.S.
dollar against 1,189 South Korean won and the average annual
consumer price increase of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of South Korea stood at 8,998 U.S.
dollars in 1994, surpassed 10,000 dollars in 1995 and rose to 11,
380 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the per capita income fell to 10,307 U.S. dollars in
1997 and plunged to 6,832 dollars last year after South Korea was
gripped by a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and
bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
After two year's effort, South Korea has overcome the
financial crisis and achieved an economic growth rate of 10.2
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Calls for African Century in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African
National Congress (ANC) Thursday called on all Africans to lay a
solid foundation in the year 2000 to achieve the goal of the
African century in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"As Africans, we must seek to rid ourselves of those labels and
misconceptions imposed by the rest of the world. Throughout the
year 2000 we must strive to ensure that peace and stability reign
through the length and breadth of the continent and that we
endeavor to bring an end to wars and conflicts which plague our
continent and hamper our prospects of growth and development,"
said an ANC statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement urges all Africans to make more efforts to
eliminate poverty and human deprivation, and tackle the scourge of
HIV/AIDS and other diseases threatening the survival of most
African people.
</P>
<P>
It said the government of South Africa, an integral part of
Africa, would be dedicated to building a better life for all South
Africans, speeding up delivery of basic needs, combating crime and
corruption, rehabilitating the national economy and creating more
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Leboeuf Charged with Misconduct by F.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf
has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association
following his sending off against Leeds earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The French international was sent off by referee Jeff Winter
for a second yellow card offense but appeared to stamp on Leeds
winger Harry Kewell before leaving the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Leboeuf, who could face a four-match ban, subsequently
apologized to his team mates for the dismissal in a clash which
Chelsea lost 2-0. It was the second time he has been sent off this
season.
</P>
<P>
A FA spokesman confirmed Thursday that the incident had been
mentioned in the official's report on the match, which took place
on 19 December.
</P>
<P>
News of the charge came just hours after Leboeuf collected his
eighth yellow card of the season during Chelsea's 3-0 home win
against Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Manager Gianluca Vialli insisted that the decision to book
Leboeuf for a foul on Niclas Alexandersson was harsh.
</P>
<P>
"I just want him to be treated in a fair way. I don't want to
protect him because sometimes I've had to admit he has made
mistakes. I'm the first to say when he does and I want to say he
didn't deserve that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vialli said it appeared Leboeuf had become "a kind of target"
for referees.
</P>
<P>
He added: "He didn't touch the player, the referee didn't see
the tackle and as soon as he realized it was Frank Leboeuf, he
booked him. It's not fair.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me at the moment everybody wants to have a go at
him, even the opponents. He got booked at Southampton for nothing
after 10 minutes and he got booked tonight.
</P>
<P>
"I saw other players do worse things than Frank who didn't get
booked."
</P>
<P>
Chelsea chairman Ken Bates has, meanwhile, confirmed that the
club is taking steps to improve the team's disciplinary record.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the match program, Bates said: "We are aware that we
have to address our disciplinary record. Suffice to say that these
matters are being addressed but these are internal matters."

<HEADLINE> China Plans New Crackdown on Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Video pirates in China won't
be full of cheer on the first day of the new millennium, as the
nation will launch a new crackdown on illegal VCDs and other
pirated products beginning January 1.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Culture told Xinhua today that
the anti-piracy campaign will mainly target video and audio
products which are smuggled, pirated or illegally published.
</P>
<P>
Sellers of audio and video products will have to stop selling
pirated products and turn in them to administrative departments
before January 15, 2000. Otherwise, they face heavy fines and
license suspension, said Liu Luping, with the ministry's
department of culture.
</P>
<P>
The action is expected to last about 15 weeks. The ministry has
published a telephone number and an e-mail address for the public
to report violations.
</P>
<P>
Liu acknowledged that software piracy and smuggling became
rampant this year, a situation which has "seriously threatened the
domestic industry of publication."
</P>
<P>
Pirated video discs of the latest Hollywood blockbusters show
up in Beijing street sellers' collections shortly after overseas
release. For example, the new U.S. hit "Anna And The King," which
debuted in November, is now for sale illegally in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture organized a similar action in October,
in which a total 3.16 million pirated laser video discs were
confiscated, Liu added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak should have successfully
overseen the passage of his first state budget by midnight Thursday
since he has secured the support of the key coalition partner,
Shas.
</P>
<P>
Barak garnered the support of Shas' 17 seats in the parliament
when Shas leader Eli Yishai agreed to a 175 million-shekel payout
to his Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbollah, or Party of God, will reveal information about
Israeli Air Force navigator Ron Arad, who went missing 13 years ago
in south Lebanon, in return for Israel's release of five Lebanese
prisoners earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The details have not yet been conveyed to Israel and are due to
be communicated through German mediation.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has promised that he would
meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak after progress was made in
the ongoing Israeli-Syrian talks. He told European sources that
Barak is a partner and it is possible to talk with him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police and security facilities are prepared
to prevent extremists from sabotaging bridges on the Golan Heights
during resumption of talks next week.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven Palestinian prisoners from East Jerusalem are to be
released Thursday as a good-will gesture for the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The release would possibly signal a shift in the government's
policy, which has so far been against releasing Jerusalem prisoners
within the framework of agreements with the Palestinian National
Authority.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM in Cairo for Talks on Negotiations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa arrived in Cairo Thursday morning for talks with Egyptian
officials on the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his lightening visit, al-Sharaa is expected to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and their talks are to focus on
the progress of the resumed Syrian-Israeli peace talks, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also touch upon the general situation of the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations and issues of mutual concern, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak resumed
negotiations in Washington on December 15-16 after a freeze of
nearly four years. They agreed to continue talks on January 3 on
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights that Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, security arrangements and
normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been playing an active role in mediating the Mideast
peace process. It has expressed keenness on coordinating with Syria
and forging an unified Arab stance in a bid to support Damascus in
its negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Prisoners from East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel released seven
prisoners from the Arab East Jerusalem Thursday in a move some say
might signal a shift in the government's policy toward this
occupied land.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted by family members and friends at a welcome
ceremony outside the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Six of the freed are members of the Fatah movement established
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the other one is affiliated
with the Palestinian Liberation Front. They had been charged of
various security offenses which did not cause fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Israel let the seven go as a goodwill gesture for the Muslim
holy fasting month of Ramadan. It freed 26 Palestinian prisoners
Wednesday in the third and last batch of release under an interim
agreement signed with the Palestinians in September.
</P>
<P>
The latest release marked the first time that Israel has freed
residents of East Jerusalem, which it seized from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, Haaretz, said Thursday that this move might
signal a shift in the government's policy to the controversial
territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed the whole city of Jerusalem as its eternal
capital and regards all affairs of the East Jerusalem as its
internal business.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians reject the Israeli claim and want East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under signed Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, the status of
Jerusalem should be discussed in the ongoing final-status talks,
which were launched in September.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Bullish HK Stock Market Expected to Be Whipped Up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Index rebounded
steeply in 1999, smashing the all-time high record set on August 7,
1997 with a 16,833-point close on August 24. Many analysts believe
that there is still much room for the index to rise in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The market has already jumped from a low of 6,000 to 16,000
and this is typical of the first stage of a bull market," said
Delta Asia Securities research manager Ricky Tam Siu-hing.
</P>
<P>
The market has moved out of its previous consolidating range
and is now in a new range, said Asia Financial Securities head of
research James So.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 16,660 on December 29, 1999, 6,612 points,
or 66 percent, up from the close on December 31, 1998, and 10,000
points, or 150 percent, up from the five-year low registered on
August 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong stock market became the 10th largest in the world
with market capitalization amounting to 537 billion U.S. dollars
as of November 1999, 51 percent up from the amount registered in
the same month of last year, when Hong Kong's ranking fell to the
11th from the ninth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The main propeller for the market surge this year is the
continuous inflow of external money and the inflow will go on next
year, according to a research report of the Bank of China Group.
</P>
<P>
Whether the inflow will remain in the future is mainly decided
by investors' weighing of the prospects of the Hong Kong market
and the U.S. market, said the report.

Analysts believe that China's expected entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) is significant for pushing Hong Kong
market.
</P>
<P>
China's admission to the WTO will pull in foreign investors to
Hong Kong, said South China Brokerage Vice Chairman Howard Gorges.
</P>
<P>
It will create extra demand for Hong Kong's space and service
and also bring in more money for listed companies in Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that a possible increase in the interest rates
in the United States early next year could trigger selling
pressure in the U.S. markets, subsequently bringing Hang Seng
Index to a trough.
</P>
<P>
However, the market is expected to rebound on further global
liquidity inflow as domestic growth progresses.
</P>
<P>
"The mentality that has driven the market has switched from
being driven by the Fed and interest rates to a mentality driven
by growth, recovery of earnings and economic growth," Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter Managing Director Peter Churchhouse said,
referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong saw a 4.5 percent economic growth in the third
quarter of this year, and the research by the Bank of China Group
forecast the growth to be 1.8 percent for the whole 1999 and 4
percent for 2000.

For the investors who pursue better return and less risk, the
Hong Kong market seems more attractive than the U.S. market, as
the former has registered yearly growth of more than 20 percent
for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
DBS Securities head of Hong Kong research Frederick Tsang Sui-
cheong said the successful launch of the Growth Enterprises Market
(GEM), the second stock market of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
(SEHK) for technology and innovation based companies to raise
capital, will attract more institutional investment to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The GEM had raised 1.58 billion HK dollars (203 million U.S.
dollars) for the seven listed companies as of December 23 since it
commenced trading on November 25, with a market capitalization of
6.25 billion HK dollars (801 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To attract more investment, the SEHK plans to introduce
overseas-listed index funds next year.
</P>
<P>
"The funds should be tracking globally-recognized indices, such
as the Nasdaq 100 Index, so that they could attract international
investors," said Alec Tsui Yiu-wa, chief executive of the SEHK, at
the year end review.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the plan followed last month's successful
initial public offering of the 33.33 billion HK dollar (4.3
billion U.S. dollar) Tracker Fund.
</P>
<P>
The SEHK also plans to introduce the market-making system to
enhance the market liquidity of securities and the third
generation of the Automatic Trading and Order Matching System to
enable straight-through ordering of trades via Internet and mobile
phones.
</P>
<P>
The listing by introduction of seven Nasdaq companies,
including Microsoft and Intel, is expected to be implemented in
the first quarter of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Official Given Life Sentence for Accepting Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A former high-ranking Chinese
official was sentenced to life in prison today after his appeal of
a bribery conviction was denied.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingsong, former vice-chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in south China, was sentenced to a life term
this past August by the Intermediate People's Court of Nanning
City, the regional capital, on charges of accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
Xu was found guilty of taking advantage of his post to get
money and material goods totaling 550,000 yuan (66,400 U.S.
dollars) from 1995 to 1997, and using his influence to benefit
those who had bribed him.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Xu, a native of Taishan City, south China's
Guangdong Province, became vice-chairman of the Guangxi regional
government in January 1993. He was detained for allegedly taking
bribes on May 22, 1998, and was arrested on June 3.
</P>
<P>
According to today's ruling by the Higher People's Court of
Guangxi, Xu was also stripped of his political rights for life and
had 100,000 yuan in cash confiscated, as well as a number of
valuables such as home electronics items and digital cameras
bought with the bribe money.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda's New Budget Cuts Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 national budget
passed by the Rwandan parliament recently has been the first ever
in the country to cut its recurrent expenditures of RWF 500
million (1.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money will be transferred to development projects, the
Rwanda News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Eliphaz Karenzi, chairman of the State Budget and
Property Parliamentary Committee, the budget is a unique one,
which is realistic and designed and scrutinized to fit the ability
of the Rwandan government without having to increase the debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
He said that some budget cuts have been made especially in the
areas of recurrent expenditure and re-located to areas of
expenditure that will benefit the poor people.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of these cuts is to instil into the Rwandan people
the culture of using the little resources available, to break the
vicious circle of borrowing and dependency by laying a firm
foundation that will help us not only manage our debt burden but
also lead us to self reliance in future", said Karenzi.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 national budget is 169 billion RWF (500 million
dollars), with the donor funding for the development budget as
high as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government of Rwanda suffers from a debt burden amounting
to 1.2 billion dollars now.

<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China today reiterated that
the Kosovo issue can only be solved politically on the basis of
respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and with assurances for the legal rights and interests of all
ethnic groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at today's press conference, foreign
ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said that the United Nations
should play its due role in the process of seeking a political
solution, and that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 should be
earnestly implemented.
</P>
<P>
Characterizing the Kosovo issue as a complicated ethnic and
religious contradiction in a part of Yugoslavia, Zhang said the
military action of U.S.-led NATO against the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia severely violated the U.N. Charter and the norms of
international law, created the very dangerous precedent of
interfering in a country's internal affairs, and further
complicated the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
She added that the U.N.'s civil organizations and peace-keeping
troops have been in Kosovo for more than half a year, and the
situation there is still not yet stable, and furthermore, Security
Council Resolution 1244 was not implemented in an earnest manner.
</P>
<P>
"China is worried about this," Zhang said.

China is also deeply sympathetic over the great economic losses
inflicted on Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO's bombing, and

homes by relying on themselves, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the Chinese government supports Chinese
enterprises that undertake various forms of cooperation with
Yugoslavia according to market rules to actively participate in
the rebuilding of that country.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic's
recent China trip, Zhang said this was a complete success, and she
believes the visit will help promote the smooth development of
bilateral relations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, the two sides discussed bilateral relations,
China's participation in the rebuilding of Yugoslavia, the
situation in Kosovo, and other issues of mutual concern, and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Danaharta Manages 7.9 Bln Dollars of NPLs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's National Asset
Management Company (Danaharta) is currently managing a total of 30
billion ringgit (7.894 billion U.S. dollars) of non-performing
loans (NPLs), according to Bank Negara (State Bank) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The amount acquired from the banking system in regard to the
financial sector restructuring accounts for approximately 36
percent of the total NPLs of the banking system, the central bank
said in its "Monetary and Financial Developments November 1999"
report released here.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta conducted its first open tender on 44 properties with
total indicative value of 122.6 million ringgit (32.263 million U.
S. dollars) in November, as part of its loan and asset management
process.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta is currently conducting the second sale by restricted
tender of foreign assets of 251.7 million U.S. dollars, which the
tender closes on February 22, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Danamodal Nasional Bhd (National Capital Fund
Company), parallel to Danaharta for financial sector restructuring,
injected 4.6 billion ringgit (1.21 billion U.S. dollars) as at
December 10, 1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
Net NPLs ratio of the banking system at the end of October 1999
was 7.9 percent based on six-month classification.
</P>
<P>
The cental bank said the risk-weighted capital ratio of the
banking system remained strong at 12.5 percent at the end of
November 1999, well above the minimum requirement of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"This provides the banking system with a more than sufficient
cushion to absorb any potential shocks to the system," it said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the core capital ratio of the banking system
remained high at 10.2 percent, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Navy Receives Most Modern Frigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN)
Thursday received its most modern frigate "KD Jebat" at the naval
base in Lumut, the northwestern state of Perak.
</P>
<P>
RMN's newly-appointed Fleet Operations Commander Rear Admiral
Mohamad Anwar Mohamad Nor received the vessel in a ceremony,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The KD Jebat was built together with another RMN frigate "KD
Lekiu", which was delivered recently, by Scotland's Yarrow
Shipbuilding Ltd under an arms deal worth 1.2 billion ringgit (315.
79 million U.S. dollars) signed between Malaysia and Britain in
1988.
</P>
<P>
Both vessels are said to be the world's most sophisticated in
their class, boasting a combination of the latest state-of-the art
electronics and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
The KD Jebat's weaponry includes eight anti-ship Exocet MM40
missiles, six under-surface warfare torpedoes and 57MK2 cannons.
</P>
<P>
Both the KD Jebat and KD Lekiu could also facilitate helicopter
operations.
</P>
<P>
In line with this, Malaysia signed this year a deal worth 700
million ringgit (184.21 million U.S. dollars) with Britain's
Westland for the purchase of six Super Lynx helicopters.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Directs Murder Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Thursday ordered an immediate inquiry into the
reported gang-rape and murder of a young mother in the northern
Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga resumed her duties after returning home on Thursday
morning from London where she received treatment for facial
injuries she sustained in an assassination attempt by a suspected
Tamil suicide bomber earlier this month, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed her concern on hearing the incident as
reported in some media Thursday, the Government Information
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga directed Secretary to Defense Chandrananda de Silva
to initiate an inquiry and report back to her immediately. "
Deterrent action" will be taken against the culprits irrespective
of the ranks or status if any of the security forces personnel are
involved in the incident, the department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, Sarathambal
Saravanbavananthakurukal was gang-raped and murdered Tuesday night
by unidentified gunmen in Punguduthivu, an islet off the Jaffna
peninsula. Her body was found Wednesday morning about 100 meters
from her house.
</P>
<P>
Local people suspected some navy personnel were involved in the
incident as a naval detachment is based in Punguduthivu.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna peninsula, the former stronghold of Tamil rebels, was
captured by government troops in 1996 and has since been heavily
guarded against rebels' infiltration.
</P>
<P>
The president flew to London on December 22, hours after being
sworn in for a second six-year term, for treatment of her facial
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Thursday
that she was still prepared to talk to Tamil rebels even though
the assassination attempt may have left her permanently blind in
the right eye.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Foils Attempt of Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has foiled an attempt to
smuggle drugs with a market value of 3 million U.S. dollars into
the country in cooperation with Greece, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It would have been the most dangerous attempt to smuggle drugs
into Egypt in its history, the English-language paper quoted an
unidentified official of the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three suspected drug traffickers have been arrested in a joint
effort between the Egyptian Drug Combating Authority and the Greek
authorities, the paper said, without mentioning the date of the
arrests.
</P>
<P>
The arrestees were 65-year-old Salah Eddin Toni, a former
maritime captain who have been living in Greece for 30 years, his
54-year-old wife, Mona Fares Guindi, and George Boutas, a Greek
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian police detained Toni in Cairo while the Greek
authorities arrested the two others and extradited them to Egypt,
the Interior Ministry official said, adding that they have been
referred to the prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
The suspects began criminal activities in 1993 and have used a
variety of different tricks to smuggle drugs into Egypt, including
hiding the drugs in wooden doors, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repeats Opposition to Legitimizing Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran has reiterated its
opposition to any efforts to legitimize Israel while expressing
welcome to return of the occupied lands to Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Iran welcomes any attempt to put an end to occupation of
Islamic and Arab lands, particularly the Qods (Jerusalem),
restoration of the rights of the Palestinian nation and
establishment of an independent Palestinian government," said the
Foreign Ministry in a statement on the eve of the International Day
of Qods to fall on January 7.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued on Wednesday evening said that Iran regards
such an attempt as a step toward the eradication of oppression and
occupation of the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini announced the last Friday of the Islam holy fasting month
of Ramadan as the International Qods Day, calling for international
support for the Palestinians to "liberate" Jerusalem from the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Slamming Israel's expansionist and oppressive policies, the
statement cited Israel's occupation of Arab lands as the main cause
of crisis in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Praising the efforts of Palestinian people against Israel, the
statement voiced Iran's support for the rights of the Palestinians
to put an end to the Israeli occupation of their land.
</P>
<P>
It also voiced strong support for the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state on the whole Palestinian land,
including Jerusalem, and for the return of all Palestinian refugees
to their historical homeland.

<HEADLINE> India Agrees to Release Some Kashmiri Militants:  Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian negotiators in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar had agreed to release some
Kashmiri militants, but were haggling over the numbers with the
hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane, Taliban sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers Wednesday dropped their demands for a 200 million
U.S. ransom.
</P>
<P>
However, the hijackers have refused to budge on the release of
35 Kashmiri fighters in Indian jails as well as a Kashmiri
activist, also in jail in India, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Indian negotiators resumed talks with the hijackers
Thursday and indicated they were willing release some Kashmiri
militants, but they are bartering over the number of prisoners to
be freed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters,
said Thursday that six Taliban trucks took their positions around
the hijacked Indian Airlines plane at the Kandahar airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the trucks carrying Taliban soldiers
took positions some 100 meters away from the plane which has
remained stranded at the airport for the sixth day.
</P>
<P>
An army personnel carrier with anti-aircraft guns also arrived
at the airport, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Mutawakkel was
quoted as saying that the new deployment was simply for the
security of the plane.

<HEADLINE> hke123025--Roundup: Bangladeshi Speaker Fails in Millennium  Session Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- As Bangladesh's opposition is
almost certain not to appear in the coming parliament session
scheduled for January 1, 2000, Speakers Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury
has given up his plan for a "millennium session."
</P>
<P>
"That (the initiative) has failed ... I've given up the idea as
the opposition is not going to join the ceremony," Chowdhury was
quoted by The Daily Star as saying on Wednesday night. "Now it
will be an ordinary session. The House will be adjourned after the
president's address."
</P>
<P>
Both the speaker and the ruling Awami League had attempted to
woo the opposition back to parliament since President Shahabuddin
Ahmed earlier this month summoned the 16th session of the country'
s Seventh Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) for the first day of the new
year and of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance, led by the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which has been staging an oust-
government movement, has gone on an unofficial boycott of
parliament this year.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury wrote twice to Begum Khaleda Zia, the leader of the
Opposition in Parliament and chairperson of the BNP, explaining
the significance of the "millennium session," urging her to attend
it and offering to mediate a government-opposition dialogue to end
the political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
In reply, the BNP chief set five preconditions to go back to
parliament, including the implementation of a previous agreement
with the ruling Awami League, a public apology from Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina for her remarks in parliament about the BNP chief
and the creation of a favorable atmosphere for a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on Monday, the prime minister, who is also
AL president, said she had phoned the opposition leader thrice,
but could not reach her. "I am expecting a call-back from her,"
she said, ruling out a written, formal invitation for talks with
Zia.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan termed the phone
calls as a "political stunt" to bluff the people of the country,
arguing that the prime minister was not "sincere" in having a
dialogue to break the political crisis as there was not even a
formal invitation from the prime minister for talks.
</P>
<P>
It was planned earlier that the opening session on January 1
would be a different one to welcome the new millennium. The
speaker had planned to deliver his "millennium speech" and allow
the leader of the House and the leader of the Opposition to speak
before the presidential address explaining the government's
policies and strategies to face challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
It was also planned that the lawmakers would be greeted with
flowers while entering the parliament, an arrangement to greet the
new millennium that could probably be the only example in the
world, according to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Wednesday, the Business Advisory Committee of
the parliament finalized the schedule of the session without
adopting any special agenda to mark the new millennium, and
decided for a usual session as the plan for a "millennium session"
failed, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the president's address, the session would be adjourned
till January 12 and then resume to continue for the rest of the
month.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African
National Congress (ANC) Thursday called on all Africans to lay a
solid foundation in year 2000 for achieving the goal of the
African century in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"As Africans, we must seek to rid ourselves of those labels and
misconceptions imposed by the rest of the world. Throughout the
Year 2000 we must strive to ensure that peace and stability reign
through the length and breadth of the continent and that we
endeavor to bring an end to the wars and conflict which plague our
continent and hamper our prospects of growth and development," the
ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urges all Africans to intensify their
efforts to eliminate the poverty and human deprivation, and tackle
the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other diseases threatening the
survival of the most African people.
</P>
<P>
Referring to South Africans' own future, the ANC said South
Africa was an integral part of the Africa continent, vowing that
the ANC government would be dedicated to the central objective of
building a better life for all South Africans, speeding up
delivery of basic needs, combating crime and corruption,
rehabilitating the national economy and creating more jobs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Confides in Technological Breakthroughs in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- "Friendship bridges distance"
is a much quoted classic line written by noted Chinese poet Wang
Bo of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), over 1,000 years ago. Today's
Chinese scientists believe that information technology will make
the same contribution in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) say that
during the next century a click on your computer screen at home
will help you communicate with whoever you want to talk to, at any
time and anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
They also hold that the mankind will be able to immigrate to
outer space and travel to other planets, solve acute energy,
material, and environmental issues facing the Earth through outer
space development, and build industrial and military bases beyond
this planet.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, they say, a manned landing on Mars may become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhenxing, CAS member and a research fellow at the CAS Space
Science and Application Center, told Xinhua he believes that in
the depths of this mysterious red planet, evidence of life left
some one billion years ago from the oceans of Mars will be found.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, he predicted, the mankind is expected to establish
their first research center on the moon, which will serve as a
natural platform for earth observation, an outpost for deep space
probes, and a transfer post and experimental center for mankind.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, solar power stations may also be built on the moon,
Liu said.

And the mankind may contact other living beings beyond our
solar system sometime in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists believe that breakthroughs will also be made in
research on cultivating human organs during the next 15 to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Botanist Hong Deyuan, also a member of the CAS, said
serious food shortages and fatal diseases that have plagued the
mankind for so long may also be ended in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
"The mankind will have whatever ideal plants they can imagine,
including drought-resistant and pest and disease-free ones," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists attribute these prospects to the expected rapid
progress to be made in information technology, outer space
technology, and life sciences in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Bio-technology may be the most controversial field, as an
increasing number of people are concerned with the abuse of
cloning technology and trans-genetic technology.
</P>
<P>
CAS President Lu Yongxiang, nevertheless, holds that in the
field of medicine the huge potential of cloning technology and the
transplantation animal parts into the human body will be tapped,
along with appropriate laws and ethical conduct.
</P>
<P>
This will enable the repair and restoration of damaged nerves,
and the cure of diabetes, cancer, and heart and Parkinson diseases,
he added.
</P>
<P>
An international convention on the peaceful use of bio-
technology will help do away with concerns about the negative
impact that trans-genetic technology may have on both the
environment and humans, just as they have done with nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
Lu said progress in science and technology, which has created
tremendous material and cultural wealth, will surely continue to
do so in the coming century.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Records One of Driest Decembers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- When the clock turns into
January 2000, Cyprus will have recorded one of its driest Decembers
ever, local newspapers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Cyprus has 25 percent more water - 28,602,000
cubic metres - behind its dams this year than this time last year,
bringing its total storage up to 10.5 percent of reservoir
capacity.
</P>
<P>
But this winter's rainy season, which began on October 1, is
shaping up to be one of the driest on record, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Only 42.2 millimeters of rain have fallen over Cyprus since
December 1, a figure representing about 40 percent off the 105.6 mm
average rainfall that Cyprus gets in a normal December.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent storms, last December's runoff was 12-times this
December's total.
</P>
<P>
So while dams may be fuller this year than last, this December
has been so dry that only 972,000 cubic metres of rainfall actually
made its way into the island's dams, compared to 11,381,000 cubic
metres last December.

<HEADLINE> Injured S.Lankan President May Lose Right Eye  -Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, who sustained facial injuries in an assassination
attempt earlier this month, has been told by doctors that she will
probably be permanently blind in the right eye, said reports
reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Kumaratunga, whose right eye was
still bruised and closed, said she was not "hysterical" about her
injury despite the loss of sight.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is in London for medical treatment, narrowly
escaped the assassination attempt but sustained facial injuries
when a suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber attacked her campaign
rally on December 18.
</P>
<P>
The attack in central Colombo and another bombing at an
opposition rally in suburban Colombo killed at least 35 people and
injured more than 100 others including the president herself and
three cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga flew to London hours after she was sworn in as Sri
Lanka's fifth president on December 22, the same day when the
election result was announced.
</P>
<P>
She said in her BBC interview: "Medically I can carry on but
probably I have lost the sight of one eye."
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday the Sri Lanka High Commission in London sent a
medical report on the president's health to Colombo, saying that
Kumaratunga could resume normal duties forthwith.
</P>
<P>
"After all available extensive investigations, it was decided
that no surgical intervention was required," said the medical
report, adding that the injury to the right eye is receiving
further attention and will be under constant review.
</P>
<P>
Despite the attempt on her life, President Kumaratunga said she
was determined to continue negotiating with the Tamil Tigers who
have been fighting for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north
and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said she also planned to go ahead with devolving
power to Tamil-dominated areas to resolve the long-running ethnic
conflicts between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels.

ISLAMABAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A truck carrying Taliban
soldiers and a tank were positioned Thursday at Afghanistan's
Kandahar airport where a hijacked Indian airliner has been
grounded over the past six days, Pakistan's state-run television
PTV reported.
</P>
<P>
"This unusual situation has emerged for the first time since

<P>
It said medical staff in Kandahar, the headquarters of the

hijackers and the plane out of its territory if India fails to
find a quick solution to the crisis.

The plane landed at the Kandahar airport last Saturday morning

PTV earlier reported that talks between Indian negotiators and
hijackers would resume sometime on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Output Expected to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce
slightly less grain and cotton this year than in 1998, but more
oil-bearing seeds, vegetables, fruits and aquatic products,
according to an official report released by the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The report says China's summer grain output rose 4.4 percent
from last year to 118 million tons, but the autumn grain output is
expected to drop 2.4 percent, mainly due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The planned cut in grain acreage is another factor for the drop
in grain output, it says. The acreage of grain for the year dipped
0.6 percent from last year to 113 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The acreage of cotton and sugar crops was reduced by over 600,
000 hectares and 330,000 hectares from last year, respectively,
with their output for the year expected to drop 11 percent and 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the acreage of oil-bearing crops and vegetables
increased by 930,00 hectares and 1.3 million hectares,
respectively, with their output expected to grow 11.9 percent and
8 percent on an annual basis, and fruit output is likely to rise
about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's township enterprises have
maintained steady growth momentum so far this year. From January
to November, they reported a total output value added of 2.273
trillion yuan, up 14.6 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters this year, the average cash income
of farmers reached 1,460 yuan, up 4.8 percent in real terms, and
farmers' net income this year is expected to continue to grow, the
report says.

NEW DELHI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government

<HEADLINE> South Africa Gives New Year Message to Angolans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Wednesday showed
its solidarity with the Angolan people, saying it hopes Angola can
obtain permanent peace and begin its economic construction as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"South African Embassy would like to give a new year message to
the Angolan people," said a document issued by the South African
Ambassador to Angola here Reddy Manpane.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in the message that he hopes Angola can
have permanent peace around the country so that the Angolan people
can engage themselves in economic construction and improve their
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a regional power and the richest country in
southern Africa, expressed its will to participate in the Angolan
economic construction and social development in the new year
message.
</P>
<P>
The document also suggested that bilateral relations between
the two countries should be developed and consolidated, so as to
benefit the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was considered by the Angolan government as the
main rival in the competition for the regional leadership in
southern Africa. In late July, the Angolan government accused
South Africa of using forces against Angola.
</P>
<P>
During the long-term Angolan Civil War, the Angolan rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by
Jonas Savimbi gained diverse military supplies and logistics from
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Per Capita Income to Hit 8,500 Dollars This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The per capita income of South
Korea is estimated to reach 8,500 U.S. dollars this year, up 24.6
percent from last year, said the Finance and Economy Ministry
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also forecast that the per capita income is
expected to hit 11,000 U.S. dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of 11,000 U.S. dollars for next year is based on
this year's economic growth of 10 percent, the average exchange
rate of one U.S. dollar against 1,189 South Korean won and the
average annual consumer price increase of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of South Korea stood at 8,998 U.S.
dollars in 1994, and it surpassed 10,000 U.S. dollars in 1995 and
rose to 11,380 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the per capita income fell to 10,307 U.S. dollars in
1997 and plunged to 6,832 U.S. dollars last year after South Korea
was gripped by a financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies
and bad loans of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
After two year's effort, South Korea has overcome the
financial crisis and its economic growth rate topped 10.2 percent
this year.

<HEADLINE> First Place On Chinese Mainland to See the New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shitang Town is located at 121 degrees, 36 minutes east
longitude, and 28 degrees, 15 minutes north latitude, and Usu Town
is at 135 degrees, 5 minutes east longitude, 48 degrees, 30
minutes north latitude.
</P>
<P>
Though Shitang is located west of Usu it will enter the year
2000 earlier because of its geographic position and atmospheric
refraction, said Wang Junjie, an associate researcher at the
National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The first place in the world to see the sun every new year
varies, and the calculation of this spot involves many complicated
astronomical and geographical factors, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
So the National Astronomical Observatories of the CAS have
organized a team of experts and researchers employing high-tech
methods to determine the exact time for the sun will rise on this
new year in several hundred places in China.
</P>
<P>
As a result, scientists have calculated that the Haima Islet in
the Nansha Archipelago, which is located at 117 degrees 40 minutes
east longitude, and 10 degrees 43 minutes north latitude, will be
the first site on Chinese sovereign territory to enter the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern hemisphere, two places located at the same
latitude, the one which is closer to 180 degrees east longitude
will see the sunlight earlier than the other, while, in the
northern hemisphere, of two spots located at the same longitude,
the one which is closer to the equator will see the sunlight
earlier than the other, explained Zhao Fuyuan, deputy director of
the Committee of Science and Technology Popularization under the
Chinese Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
As the orbit of the Earth around the sun is affected by a
galaxy of factors, the exact first place on the Chinese mainland
to see the first rays of sunlight on January 1, 2001 will be
slightly different from January 1, 2000, but it will still be
close to Shitang Town in Zhejiang Province.

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Airlines based in China

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of the new
millennium, the president said, "the most important situation we
have to face in the next millennium is how to build the trust
between peoples from different countries and also peoples who live
in different systems."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the third millennium due to start on January 1,
2000 belongs to the entire world, not just a single system. "So,
we don't want to impose anything on other people and we don't want
other people to impose anything on us either."
</P>
<P>
Refusing to accept any country's role as the world policeman,
Wahid noted, "No nation, large or small, populous or not populous,
could rule the world alone."
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Indonesia and China, the president
said, "Indonesia and China have been close to each other in the
past... and we would like to continue in this way....It is the
time (for Indonesia and China) to work closer and closer."
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that the differences between the systems of China
and Indonesia should not be regarded as a constraint to firming up
their bilateral ties, because the two countries have the same
target of enhancing the living standard of their people.
</P>
<P>
The president also said some discriminative laws against the
minority ethnic Chinese in the country are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
He believed that if obstacles could be removed, the all the
races comprising the Indonesian population would be in better
understanding of each other and would make common efforts to make
the world a better place to live.

<HEADLINE> Problem Loans Decline Steadily in Thai Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 30, (Xinhua) -- Problem loans in Thai
financial sector have reduced to 2.36 trillion baht (63.7 billion
U.S. dollars)by the end of November 1999 due to corporate debt
restructuring, according to a press release of Bank of Thailand
received Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans in Thai financial sector stood at 42.27 percent of
total outstanding credit on November 30, 1999, down from 43.82
percent in October,or a decline of 95.4 billion baht (257.8
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Private banks reported non-performing loans (NPLs) of 1.1
trillion baht (29.7 billion dollars), or 36.37 percent of
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Foreign full branch banks had the NPLs balance of 74.3 billion
baht(two billion dollars), or 10.92 percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials say improved economic recovery and
continued debt restructuring will reduce NPLs next year.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs of Thai financial sector in June stood at 46.48
percent of total outstanding credit.
</P>
<P>
Corporate debt restructuring is considered crucial by
economists to help sustain the Thai economic recovery and allow
the financial sector to return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
Several banks have expressed optimism about economic prospects
in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank, for instance, expects to complete debt
restructuring for nearly 100 billion baht (2.7 billion dollars)
held by major borrowers in the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
So far, Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial bank,has
restructured more than 100 billion baht (2.8 billion dollars) in
bad loans for the year to date, helping to bring NPLs level down
from a peak of 49 percent of total loans to about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
A senior executive of the bank said if the trend continued, bad
loans for the bank should fall to 30 percent of outstanding loans
next year, not including write-offs or loans possibly transferred
to an asset management company.

<HEADLINE> Sports Yearender: Chinese Soccer Seized by Yugoslavian Craze by sportswriter Liu Guang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Gone are Englishman Bobby
Houghton, Brazilian Lazaroni and South Korean Che Bum Kun. Having
stayed or are coming are a contingent of Yugoslavians.
</P>
<P>
Among those from the Balkan country are Milorad Kosanovic,
Slobodan Santrac, Ljupko Petrovic, Milovan Djoric and Miloljub
Ostojic.
</P>
<P>
Houghton's failure to lead China's national under-23 side
through the Asian Olympic qualifiers spelled the end of his high-
profile stint with the national coaching post.
</P>
<P>
And it dawned on both Lazaroni and Che that their glamorous
records would turn out nothing if their philosophy was not adapted
to the conditions of local clubs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese soccer seemed to be an uncompromising Waterloo for
foreign coaches.
</P>
<P>
The only exception was Santrac who recently celebrated his
first season in China with a double success, in both the First
Division League title and the Chinese Football Association (CFA)
Cup.
</P>
<P>
But Santrac, who resigned from the Yugoslavian national team
after last year's World Cup, brought about more than a historic
glory for China's Shandong Luneng Club in taking for the first
time the country's pro soccer League.
</P>
<P>
The impressive feat he achieved in his debut season in China
was so persuasive that some Chinese clubs became all the more
steadfast in belief that Yugoslavians might be the very choice for
Chinese soccer.
</P>
<P>
Kosanovic signed former League champions Dalian Wanda although
he failed to keep the lowly Wuhan Heart K from being delegated
this season.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an also opened its arms to Djoric as well as his assistants
-- Milos Miljanic and Milovan Rajevac.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Hainiu went with the fashion by signing Miloljub
Ostojic along with his assistants Branislav Jovannov and Branko
Vojinovic.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian craze might be capped by Bora Milutinovic who
is rumored to take, currently as the only contender, the post of
national head coach left vacant since Houghton left.
</P>
<P>
The selling point of the Yugoslavian, nicknamed "Miracle Coach",
was his track record as the only coach to take four different
teams into the second round of World Cup finals, which has long
been a far cry for soccer-crazy Chinese.
</P>
<P>
But the flux of Yugoslavian coaches have received cautious
greetings from the Chinese media and officials who witnessed the
ups and downs in China of foreign coaches.
</P>
<P>
Lang Xiaonong, director of the CFA's competition department,
admitted the popularity with Yugoslavians was mostly caused by the
success of Santrac, the first foreign coach to mastermind a
Chinese club to win the League title.
</P>
<P>
"His success drew more attention to Yugoslavians. Many local
coaches held that the Yugoslavians are more suitable to China.
</P>
<P>
"And they have more in common with Chinese in terms of ideology
and ways of thinking, which make themselves much easier to adapt
to the local situation.
</P>
<P>
"The clubs of course make choices in line with their interests.
But the rightness of their choices will be put to test in the
future, through the League competitions," Lang added.
</P>
<P>
While the sharp-tongued media might thinks the other way. The
China Sports Daily, for example, warned that a variety of coaching
styles are necessary for China, a country with vast area and
varied conditions.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese sports daily Sports Express pointed out that
Chinese soccer has been hesitant in adopting any new playing style
after the aggressive South Koreans and flamboyant Brazilians went
from a once domination in domestic competition to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The paper criticized clubs' unwise judgment of such a "fashion"
when they turn a blind eye to what they most need.
</P>
<P>
But Beijing-based Guo'an, who has announced the appointment of
Djoric as their head coach, thinks different way. "We did it in
light of our own situation and we did as the law of soccer demands.
We have cherished the idea of employing Yugoslavian coaches long
before the so-called fashion took shape," said club manager Zhang
Lu.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavians also showed their confidence in proving to be
competent. "Though successful, Santrac will not exert pressure on
me. Instead I feel encouraged," said Djoric. "With Kosanovic in
Dalian, Santrac in Shandong and Petrovic in Shanghai Shenhua, a
real competition will soon kick off," he added.

BUCHAREST -- The Romanian government announced important reform
policies in the tax system Wednesday, including slashing the
profit tax, adjusting the value-added tax, and the imposition of a
personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
As the first major economic reform action since Mugur Isarescu,
former central bank chief, was appointed prime minister earlier
this month, the profit tax rate will be cut from 38 percent to 25
percent, while the value-added tax rate was unified to 19 percent
instead of the current 22 and 11 percent, Isarescu's adviser
Adrian Vasilescu said. The government has also created a new tax
on personal income, which is currently tax free. The income tax
will be imposed as of January 1, 2000, together with the new
standards on profit tax and value-added tax. A declaration of
personal income will be required in 2001. (Romania-Tax System)

consulting firms. "As confidence rebounds in global markets, (U.S.)
manufacturers are building global networks that link research,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Western Power Plants to Operate Less on News Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Authorities Wednesday
ordered major power plants across the western United States to
operate at reduced rates on New Year's Eve as a precaution against
any possible Y2K trouble.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which takes effect around 9 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time on Friday, is to allow more power plants to operate, thereby
reducing the impact should a unit trip off line during the
transition in any case of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"We're limiting the amount of generation out of some of the
larger base load plants," said Bill Comish, Y2K coordinator for
the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC), a regional
electric reliability council for 14 U.S. states, two Canadian
provinces and a small part of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Comish said that all power plants able to generate more than
300 megawatts have been asked to cut their output to a maximum of
80 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Generation has to match the load," Comish said, noting the
region's demand for power around midnight is expected to total
around 82,000 to 83,000 megawatts, lighter than normal for a
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Some customers plan to shutdown as a precaution and some would
normally shut down for the holiday anyway," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two exceptions have been granted, both to nuclear power plants.
The Palo Verde plant, at Winterburg, Ariz. will reduce output to
around 95 percent and the San Onofre plant at San Clemente, Calif.
will remain at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region's other nuclear power plants, Diablo Canyon, near
Avila Beach, Calif. and WNP-2 near Richland, Wash. will reduce
their output to no more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Early on Saturday morning, the WSCC expects to be able to lift
its restriction and allow normal operations to resume.
</P>
<P>
"By two o'clock Pacific time in the morning we will have a
pretty good idea of where we are going. At that time we expect to
make a decision to go back to normal operations," Comish said.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Explosives in U.S. Raise Fear of Millennium Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Authorities were
concerned Wednesday after they learned that about 90 kilograms of
explosives had been stolen from a police bomb squad bunker in
Fresno, California.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great concern, and we're not going to hide that
concern," Fresno Police Chief Ed Winchester said.
</P>
<P>
The explosives, which included about 56 kilograms of dynamite
and the military explosive C4 as well as 34 kilograms of gunpowder,
were taken out sometime between Sunday and Monday from a small
concrete bunker in a rural area outside Fresno, about 250
kilometers east of San Francisco, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The weekend theft of explosives in central California raised
fears Wednesday of a millennium attack, prompting authorities to
strengthen security plans.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned," Fresno County Sheriff Richard Pierce said
Wednesday. "The millennium is coming up, and the explosives could
destroy a large building."
</P>
<P>
In addition to gun powder, the materials require blasting caps
or fuses for detonation, but none of that was stolen, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Extra officers will be placed in and around the jail and around
all county buildings as 1999 gives way to 2000 at midnight Friday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Govt Tolerant for Different Religions: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday although Malaysia is governed by a
predominantly Malay Muslim government there has been no attempt to
oppress the non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Malaysia is very tolerant and shows respect
for the religious observances of the different religious groups.No
one can say that by being so it is not Islamic," he said when
opening the "International Conference of Religious Studies:
Meeting the Millennium" here.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for Muslims in Malaysia to practice their
religion not in seclusion but in full view of all people of the
country irrespective of their faiths, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while non-Muslims should not be required to
participate in any religious rituals, they should not be denied
their presence when such rituals are carried out.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said if Islam, as Malaysia's official
religion, is mysterious and its practice is hidden, there is bound
to be suspicions and fear that the teachings of the official
religion would be imposed on the followers of other religions.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, carrying the theme "Religions in the
21st Century: A Civilizational Perspective," is aimed at promoting
world peace and inter-religion understanding of the 21st century
through academic exchange and study of religions.
</P>
<P>
About 500 local and international participants from China,
Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore, among others, are
attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Exporters Eye Chinese Tea Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exporters will try
to open the Chinese tea market next year by participating in a
beverage fair, government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to take part in a big food and beverage fair,
Food China, in Beijing in June next year," said a spokesman for
the Tea Board.
</P>
<P>
The Tea Board is expected to sponsor tea exporters at the fair,
which Sri Lanka is taking part in for the first time.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the main tea growers in the world. But only
nine percent of China's tea production is black tea, the bulk of
it being green tea.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's position is that it will not be competing directly
with China's main tea industry, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the target market for Ceylon tea is the growing number
of Chinese youth who are moving away from drinking green tea.
</P>
<P>
Recent research carried out under sponsorship of U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization has confirmed growing scientific evidence
of the health benefits of tea drinking.
</P>
<P>
Black tea is believed to reduce the risk of developing
cardiovascular disease as well as certain types of cancer, while
drinking green tea may diminish the risk of cancer of the
digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the world's largest exporter of black tea. Brokers
said they expect Sri Lanka's total net tea export volumes this
year to surpass last year's exports of 265 million kilograms by
three million kilograms.

ROME, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema highlighted his government's achievements in 1999 and voiced
optimism for the coming year in his year-end press conference on

</P>
<P>
Looking back on his year at the helm, D'Alema said the Italian

He said that Italy was beginning to see the "fruits of
sacrifice made in previous years," and could look forward to the
year 2000 with "reasonable optimism."

recovery."

On the political front, he said the recent governmental crisis
had been "indispensable" for clarifying issues, and said that his
government was now supported by a "slimmer but more united"
majority.

<HEADLINE> Official: Inflation Rate Under Control in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The rate of inflation in
Yugoslavia as of December appears to be under control, with most
markets showing signs of stability, said Milovan Zzivkovich,
director of the Federal Statistical Institution of Yugoslavia on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zzivkovich told a press conference that although prices in
December increased by nearly 50.1 percent against the same period
last year, it was up only 0.8 percent from the figure in November
1999.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is taking measures to contain
inflation and stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, in the Serbian markets, the food supply is abundant
and prices are reasonable, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Zzivkovich said that due to the heavy losses caused by NATO's
bombing earlier this year, Yugoslavia saw a general decline of 22
percent from last year in industrial output; social products or
services were down 19.3 percent; imports were down 30.8 percent
and export were down 46.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Poland Sees Low Population Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland has a population of 38.
654 million as of this year's end, a decline of 13,000 compared to
last year, with a negative 0.02 percent of natural population
growth, the lowest since World War II, a report released by the
Polish national statistics bureau said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, by the year 2005, the Polish
population is expected to fall to 35 million by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
Some persons are concerned about the declining growth trend in
the population in Poland. A woman professor from the University of
Poland in Lodzkie, said those over the age of 65, account for 11.7
percent in Poland. The elderly group in the population is growing
faster than expected in the Eastern European country.
</P>
<P>
Population experts say the reason for the negative rate of
population growth is that people will not marry due to lack of
housing, for the young in particular.
</P>
<P>
A Polish TV station said most couples in Poland prefer a one-
child family because of their low income. This is one of the main
reasons leading to a population decrease.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) deputy secretary-general Hussein Argasasmita said
athletes qualified for the 2000 Olympics would be allowed to
compete in the 15th National Games (PON) next year, with some
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Some sports organizations have indicated that their athletes
will compete in PON, but we require (the athletes) to compete only
in the discipline they will compete in at the Olympics," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, Hussein said women's sprinter Irene Joseph
could only run the 100 and 200 meters at PON, while men's swimmer
Richard Sam Bera would only be allowed to compete in the 50 and
100 meters freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian Archery Association assured us that their
programs in PON would be exactly the same as their Olympics
program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Yachting and Windsurfing Association said men's
windsurfer Oka Sulaksana, who has qualified for the Olympics, can
compete in PON as long as it won't disturb his overseas training
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"But I think it might be better for him to skip PON because we
fear the possibility of injury if he competes in PON," hussein
said.

Quoting an announcement of Myanmar's Gems Supervisory Central

New proposals for the gem mining plots in the areas of Mogok,

<HEADLINE> Romania Improves Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
announced important reform policies in the tax system Wednesday,
including slashing the profit tax, adjusting the value-added tax,
and the imposition of a personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
As the first major economic reform action since Mugur Isarescu,
former central bank chief, was appointed prime minister earlier
this month, the profit tax rate will be cut from 38 percent to 25
percent, while the value-added tax rate was unified to 19 percent
instead of the current 22 and 11 percent, Isarescu's adviser
Adrian Vasilescu said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also created a new tax on personal income,
which is currently tax free. The income tax will be imposed as of
January 1, 2000, together with the new standards on profit tax and
value-added tax. A declaration of personal income will be
required in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Vasilescu said the taxation reform will move toward the goal of
cutting tax rates but expanding tax categories, in order to check
tax dodging.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu has vowed to reform the tax system to attract more
foreign investment. he also promised to end the three-year slide
in economic growth by the end of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government's target for next year is 1.3 percent economic
growth, an inflation rate within 25 to 30 percent, half of that
this year, and a fiscal deficit not exceeding 3 percent of the
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Strives for Social, Economic Stability, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic said Wednesday that the major task of the Yugoslav
government in the new year is to change the international
community's unfair attitude toward Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, Bulatovic
said in the new year his government will also strive for
rebuilding the country, ensuring social and economic stability and
raising the people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
After the NATO airstrikes, Yugoslavia's external and internal
environment has become frigid, but Yugoslavia will stick to the
road of achieving sustainable national development and maintaining
national dignity, Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic said that his government will continue to draft a
reform bill early next year to create a favorable condition for
market economy. Further cooperation with Russia, China, India,
Middle East and African countries was a prerequisite to fulfill
the country's new economic goals.
</P>
<P>
He said in the course of negotiations on resuming normal
relations with international financial organisations, Yugoslavia
insisted that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia was
illegal and NATO must make war compensations for Yugoslavia in
accordance with international law.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reaffirmed that Kosovo is part of Yugoslavia,
and this is recognized by the international community. Yugoslav
army and police must be allowed to return to Kosovo to maintain
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Manufacturers' Foreign Direct Investment Reaches New High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers in the
United States are expected to register a record 46 billion U.S.
dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1999, despite a
decline of 1.4 billion dollars in 1998, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estimates for the first three quarters of 1999 show levels of
investment significantly exceeding those of 1998, said the report
from Deloitte Consulting, one of the U.S. top management
consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
"As confidence rebounds in global markets, (U.S.) manufacturers
are building global networks that link research, manufacturing,
distribution, and customer service," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But contrary to common belief, according to the study, cheap
labor does not drive U.S. manufacturing FDI. Instead, U.S.
manufacturers' global expansion strategies are driven in large
part by relative economic stability, well-developed
infrastructures, lucrative market potential, and talented and
skilled workers. Access to lower cost labor and raw materials are
important, but not the primary driver, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, high-wage countries accounted for 80 percent of U.S.
manufacturing FDI. Europe remained the destination of choice for U.
S. investment, receiving 62 percent of the 1998 total. Canada
retained its number two spot, receiving 2.9 billion dollars from U.
S. manufacturers, just behind the United Kingdom which received
over 8.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers viewed the Asia-Pacific region with
skepticism in 1998, investing about half as much as they did in
1997, 2.8 billion dollars, the report said, although often at a
significantly lower cost due to currency and asset depreciation in
the region. Investments by U.S. manufacturers in export-oriented
high-technology sectors in the region, however, remained strong
during 1998. Investments are on the rise in 1999, with
manufacturers increasingly regarding long-term benefits as greater
than short-term risks.
</P>
<P>
Singapore received the most U.S. manufacturing FDI of any
nation in Asia, despite a decrease of almost 40 percent from the
year before. China received more investment than any other
emerging market worldwide in 1998. "The fact that the country
appeared relatively unscathed by the economic crisis made China a
logical choice for executives seeking to expand in Asia," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturing FDI into Latin America totaled 3.5 billion
dollars 1998, a decrease of 45 percent from 1997. The region's
economic instability and decreased consumer demand scared away
some investors, said the report, adding investment is on the rise
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which is earning a reputation as a leading center of
high-tech innovation, received 800 million dollars in investment,
far exceeding previous years' levels.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Accept New Training Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian shuttlers have
finally agreed to the decision of the Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) to change the training system at the Indonesian
Badminton Center in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
PBSI's players board chairman Rexy Mainaky said on Wednesday
that all shuttlers met PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo in a
meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Pak Bagyo (mr.Subagyo) explained to us that changes in the
training system were needed as a part of our strategy to achieve
our goals in the Thomas and Uber cups and the Olympics next year.
This is not a final decision. PBSI will observe if the players can
adapt to the new system. Maybe in 2001 PBSI will set up another
new system to achieve a different target," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
PBSI plans to halve the number of shuttlers in the center in
January to focus the top players on retaining the Thomas Cup for
men and bringing home the Uber Cup for women, and winning the
Olympics men's singles and men's doubles gold medals in Sydney in
September.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two of 66 shuttlers will remain in the center while the
other 34 will be sent to PBSI's four provincial chapters in
Jakarta, West Java, Central Java and East Java.
</P>
<P>
"We all can understand Pak Bagyo's explanation. We specially
asked him to meet us because we don't believe in other PBSI
officials anymore," said Rexy.
</P>
<P>
The players board vice chairman Hendrawan said PBSI would
observe the shuttlers' form in the center for the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
"PBSI can consider either to move on or stop the new program if
the players feel dissatisfied with the condition in those chapters,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said that the association discussed with Jakarta,
West Java and East Java chapters and they approved preparing the
new system by April at the latest.
</P>
<P>
He said officials from the three chapters made four decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The first is that all chapters agree to conduct the decision
on applying the new system. Secondly, we all agree that we need
several months to promote the new system, especially to players to
avoid them feeling they have been expelled from the center.
</P>
<P>
"Third, fielding the players in some chapters is meant to groom
young talented athletes in our provincial chapters. They can be
promoted to join the center if they can win national tournaments.
On the other hand, players in the center can be moved to the
chapters if their performance declines.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth is shuttlers in the center will compete in the four,
five and six star tournaments while players in the chapters are
scheduled to compete in the one, two and three star tournaments,"
he said.

"Following a request by Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina, the
control command was handed over from Maluku Police Chief Brig. Gen.
Dewa Astika to Pattimura Military Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela,
effective 06:00 a.m. eastern Indonesian time, as of December 29,"

<P>
Tamaela confirmed in Ambon that he received orders to instill

President Wahid said the decision to deploy forces and the
takeover of security command in Maluku by the TNI from the police

</P>
<P>
"I'm not considering putting martial law into effect there but
in one or two days military intervention will be needed," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>

Wahid also reiterated that military intervention could not
resolve the bloody feud, but it could mediate between the
conflicting factions, adding that the problems have to be settled

<P>
The latest reports from Ambon reveal that 63 people have died
since Sunday, raising the total number of casualties since the
outbreak of conflict in January to about 850.

Ambon resembled a war zone on Wednesday as volleys of gun shots
and explosions of grenades and homemade bombs were heard in
various corners of the city, the reports said.

Violence broke out Sunday night after a bus driven by a
Christian hit a 14-year-old Muslim in Ambon, about 2,400

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Reaffirm Commitment to Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have
reaffirmed their full commitment to the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his visiting Rwandan
counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu made the pledge during talks at the
State House here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after their one-day talks, both leaders
expressed support for the mediation of former Botswanan President
Katumile Masire in the DRC's civil war. They also expressed
confidence in the full implementation of the agreement in the
coming year, which calls for the deployment of observers and the
disarmament of rebel armed forces as well as a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the peace process in Burundi and pledged
full support to efforts to bring an end to the armed clashes
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, which started in
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
They said the conflict has definitely strained their bilateral
relations, adding that they had acted in time to prevent the
situation from deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda sent troops to the DRC to support the DRC
rebels soon after a rebellion broke out in the third largest
African country in early August 1998. DRC President Laurent
Kabila has accused them of backing the rebels in the fighting to
topple his government, a charge categorically denied by both
Kigali and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have come to support the rival factions of
the DRC rebels due to their strategic interests in the country.
The Kisangani clashes have plunged the two countries' relations to
an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the clashes, the two sides have tried to
mend their relations by jointly investigating the cause of the
shoot-out between them.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Builds Largest Freon Substitute Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China plans to invest 290 million yuan to build China's largest
production base for freon-free substance R134a, a freon substitute.
</P>
<P>
The project has been listed by the State Development Planning
Commission as a "high-tech trial project". Construction of the
project will start in the first half of 2000 and be completed by
2002.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of China's campaign to save the ozone layer,
which protects the environment from direct exposure to ultraviolet
sun rays.
</P>
<P>
Annual domestic demand for R134a has reached 2,000 tons. The
figure is expected to increase to 50,000 tons if all freon are
replaced by R134a.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has stipulated that all car air
conditioners produced by China use the freon substitute R134a as
of January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have banned the use of freon as it is suspected
of destroying the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
China will totally phase out the use of freon by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Fossil Provides New Evidence for Birthplace of Hadrosauridae Cope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A dinosaur fossil found in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in July 1998 has
added new evidence to the assumption that China is very likely to
be the birthplace of hadrosauridae cope, a species of dinosaur
that inhabited the earth some 70 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fossil is an earlier species of the Hadrosauridae cope and
estimated to be three meters high and over ten tons heavy. It is
quite different from the previously discovered Mandschurosuarus
mongoliensis and the Bactrosaurus johnsoni, the two other species
of the Hadrosauridae cope, said Zhang Xiaohong, deputy director at
the Research Center of Stratigraphy and Paleontology.
</P>
<P>
"The new discovery provides another evidence to prove that the
Erlian Basin where the dinosaur fossil was excavated, may be the
birthplace of the Hadrosauridae cope," said Zhao Xi, a member of
the International Dinosaur Society. Zhao has devoted over 40 years
researching dinosaur fossils.
</P>
<P>
The Erlian Basin is often referred to as the "tomb of dinosaurs".
V.A. Cbruchev, a Russian geologist, first discovered dinosaur
fossils here in 1893. Numerous other finds in the area have been
excavated.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery will be of great value in the study of animal
evolution, the extinction of dinosaurs and stratigraphy.
</P>
<P>
The fossil will be on display at the Tianjin Natural Museum
early next year.

<P>
PARIS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- General Robert Guei, the leader
of the coup d'etat in Cote d'Ivoire, Wednesday warned France
against interference in the affairs of his country and threatened
that such interference would face "extremely grave consequences."
</P>
<P>
In a speech to prefectural government officials, Guei accused
Michel Dupuch, the presidential advisor at the Elysee palace and
former French ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, of attempting to make
President Henri Konan Bedie return to power, said a report by
Agence France-Presse from Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
Bedie was overthrown in a coup d'etat on December 24 and has
gone into exile.
</P>
<P>
"I have firmly asked our great masters, especially France, to
let Ivorians solve their own problems. I have told them that the
French interests are great in Cote d'Ivoire... The scenes of
settling scores risk to have extremely grave consequences," Guei
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, I have been trying to approach his (Bedie's)
chiefs who are much more understanding, who have already begun to
take measures to avoid the worst," said the general.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Stan Collymore's move to
Montpellier has collapsed after the controversial Aston Villa
frontman reportedly refused to play in a practice match.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old had flown to France to discuss a move to the
struggling First Division side in a bid to revive his stalled
career.
</P>
<P>
But Montpellier boss Michel Mezy said Collymore had refused to
play in a practice match that had been arranged to mark his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
According to Aston Villa's official website, Mezy said: "I don'
t think he will join the club - I organised a match to have a look
at him and he did not want to play."
</P>
<P>
Collymore is now set for showdown talks with the Midlands club -
but manager John Gregory has made it clear the former England
striker has no part in his future plans.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Collymore insisted he was looking forward to the
chance to kickstart his career on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He had said: "Maybe it's a good time to go abroad and start
afresh, a change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
"I've come out here to look at the facilities and I'm showing
willing regarding clubs. I think it's the right way to do it," he
said.

WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Leslie Price who sued
George Shinn will not fight a jury's decision in favor of the
Charlotte Hornets owner in her lawsuit that accused him of forcing
her to have sex, her lawyer said today.
</P>
<P>
"We're satisfied we had our day in court and it's over," Price'
s attorney, Paul Dominick, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision ended Price's more than two-year fight. She
sought monetary damages and contended Shinn sexually assaulted her
at his home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shinn had admitted a sexual encounter with Price, but said he
did not use force. He sued Price for slander and extortion in
North Carolina, but he agreed to drop that, Price agreed to drop a
counterclaim in that case, Dominick said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) - - After 20 years as general
manager, coach and then president of the NBA's Utah Jazz, Frank
Layden is retiring.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to know when to pack it in," Layden, 67, said
Tuesday. "When you get to my age, time is precious."
</P>
<P>
Layden was 277-294 in six-plus seasons with Utah, turning the
Jazz into a playoff contender. Layden's retirement is Utah's third
front-office departure this year, following Son Scott's move to
become the New York Knicks' General Manager and Tim Howells'
resignation last week to run a restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the passion I used to have," Layden said. "So I
must be doing this at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Layden plans to write a book and spend more time with his
family and wife.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Major Sectors Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Communications and
Works Minister Averof Neophytou said Thursday that his country is
ready to face the Y2K computer problem, also known as the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with representatives from the civil
aviation, hospitals, telecommunications, electricity and police,
Neophytou said that a special committee was set up in 1997 to
monitor developments concerning Y2K and "today's meeting proved
that all measures and actions were taken."
</P>
<P>
Civil aviation representatives said that flights to and from
Cyprus will be cancelled by the national carrier Cyprus Airways and
international airlines during the hours between New Year's eve and
the noon of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Cyprus Electricity Authority spokesman Tasos Rousos
said the authority is also ready for Y2K, adding that a number of
staff will be on duty during New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry, the police and the fire department have
also made up contingency plans to handle problems that might arise.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said the cabinet and
the government organizations will be on standby for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem stems from the fact that old computers
recognizes a year only by the last two digits. When the clock of
the computer ticks to the year 2000, the computer will take it as
the year 1900, thus causing confusion in all calculations and
operations which take a date into account.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes New State Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
passed Thursday night the year 2000 state budget with a vote of 60:
46 with six abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting by the 120-member Knesset, Finance Minister
Avranham Shohat explained to the plenum in detail about the budget
allocations to government ministries, saying the overall state
budget did not break the planned figure of 227.426 billion shekels
(54.149 billion U.S. dollars), despite some new arrangements have
been made for some ministries.
</P>
<P>
But several opposition members still took turns to attack the
government, accusing Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Finance
Ministry for using the state money to buy support for the passing
of the budget among other coalition partners and certain political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The budget was formulated on the basis of a projected 3 percent
economic growth rate next year, and the social welfare spending
constitutes 30.7 percent of the total budget, debt servicing 28.8
percent, security 17.9 percent, civil expenditure 16.2 percent and
investment 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset started its debate on the budget Monday evening,
with most of the time spent on debating and passing clause by
clause the economic arrangements bill, which stipulates in detail
about the government economic policies and the next year's national
spending packages.
</P>
<P>
To secure a safe passage of the budget, Barak and the Finance
Ministry reached separate agreements on Monday and Tuesday with
coalition partners and some other small political parties on some
financial demands raised by them.
</P>
<P>
Knesset members of the coalition partners including Meretz, the
Center Party, the National Religious Party and Shas, voted in favor
of the budget. But another coalition partner, Yisrael Ba'aliya
headed by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, refused to give its
full backing.
</P>
<P>
The party is fighting against Barak's plan to remove powers from
the Interior Ministry to establish a new national planning body in
the prime minister's Office, while demanding 300 million U.S.
dollars for public housing, immigrant absorption and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the budget has paved the way for Barak to
continue his peace talks with the Syrians. Barak is scheduled to
fly to the United States on Sunday for talks there with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Bombing Wounds 14 in South Lebanon, Bomber Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 30 (Xinhua) -- At least two Israeli soldiers
and 12 Lebanese civilians were wounded Thursday in a Hezbollah
suicide bombing in south Lebanon. The bomber himself was killed
instantly.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers of the Lebanese Red Cross who rushed to the site for
rescue estimated the casualties at 12, including seven children
aging from 12 to 16. They were wounded by flying glass and
shrapnels.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said when the bomber's car overturned, rockets blasted
and struck a nearby house.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that one of its members blew up
himself and his car, which was filled with explosives, at 17:17
(1417 GMT) on Thursday, when an Israeli patrol was passing on a
road in Qlaiaa village inside the Israeli-occupied border zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place 20 meters away from the patrol, which was
made up of one military truck, two cars and one tank.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah statement claimed that at least 15 Israelis were
wounded or killed in the explosion which was the biggest of its
kind carried out by the militant group in three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the TV station of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
(SLA) said that only two Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded,
denying civilian casualties in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, Israeli warplanes launched a massive raid
on suspected Hezbollah targets along the eastern and central
sectors of the border zone, but causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading a
guerrilla war in an effort to liberate southern Lebanon from
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer there in 1985 with the declared aim of
shield its north from Lebanese guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM in Favor of Business Climate Beneficial to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Prime Minister
Mugur Isarescu on Thursday announced that his cabinet seeks "to
create in Romania a friendly business climate", which will be
beneficial to investors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here on Thursday, Isarescu
cautioned that the first shock of the new fiscal measures will be
price rises in January, as a result of the decision to introduce a
unique value-added tax. "The beneficial effects are to be seen
only afterwards", he said, apparently referring to the fact that
as much as 90 percent of the legal acts granting tax exemptions is
to be repealed.
</P>
<P>
As it was reported, the new cabinet on Wednesday announced
important reform policies in the fiscal system, including slashing
the profit tax, unifying the value-added tax, and the imposition
of a personal income tax, as the first major economic reform
action since Isarescu, former central bank chief, was appointed
prime minister earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu promised to end the three-year slide in economic
growth by the end of year 2000, stressing that his target for next
year is 1.3 percent economic growth, an inflation rate within 25
to 30 percent and a fiscal deficit not exceeding 3 percent of the
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Two Nicaraguan Volcanoes Increase Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Telica and San Cristobal
volcanoes have increased their activity in the recent days,
Nicaraguan Territorial Studies Institute (INETER) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Telica volcano increased its activity considerably, since
Wednesday four times more than in the previous days, according to
the INETER report.
</P>
<P>
This colossus intensified the emission of gases and ashes that
affected points as distant as Posoltega and Chichigalpa, in the
west of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The San Cristobal volcano is also increasing its seismic
tremors since Wednesday at a level 40 percent higher than the one
registered November 20.
</P>
<P>
Peasants of this zone are afraid of losing their coffee, sesame
peanuts, and corn harvest because the gases and ashes wilt their
crops.
</P>
<P>
However, the Army's Civil Defense authorities said that up to
this moment there is no need to evacuate the people who live near
the volcanoes, since gas and ashes emissions are minimal.
</P>
<P>
The INETER volcanology office said that the seismologists
maintain a permanent watch of the volcanic activity and seismicity,
to inform the population of any important event occurring in the
Nicaraguan volcanic chain.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Honduras Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Organization of American
States (OAS) mediator Luigi Einaudi announced that Nicaragua and
Honduras agreed Thursday on an immediate separation of their
military forces in the border to prevent more incidents.
</P>
<P>
The OAS official also said in a report received here from Miami,
United States, that the two countries agreed to define a zone of
exclusion in the Caribbean area.
</P>
<P>
Einaudi called the communication media after the conclusion of
the first talks between the two sides early this morning to assure
them that this agreement thaws the relation between Honduras and
Nicaragua, since "it opens the way to a peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministers Eduardo Montealegre and his
Honduran counterpart Roberto Flores will meet January 12 and 13,
as part of the agreement, to continue the talks in the OAS
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Einaudi said that both foreign ministers described in this
second meeting the technical bases of what will be the military
exclusion zone, and will define the ways to implement measures of
confidence, among them a Verification Commission.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached has six basic points. The first one is
about the immediate separation of the military forces at the
border; the second is to negotiate the ways to implement the
measures of confidence for the civilian sector.
</P>
<P>
The third is to solve in a peaceful way the differences before
the International Court of Justice of The Hague, and the fourth is
to take advantage of the jurisdictional agencies and mechanisms to
solve the differences.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the fifth refers to the meeting scheduled for January,
and the sixth is about the role to be played by the mediator to
announce the advances in the process to be started.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nicaragua and Honduras have soured after the
Honduran congress ratified a treaty of maritime limits on November
30 with Colombia, which Managua alleges that it takes off 130,000
square kilometers of Atlantic waters rich in fishing and potential
oil and natural gas resources.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan New Constitution Goes in Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The new Venezuelan
Constitution approved in the December 15 referendum went into
force Thursday after its publication.
</P>
<P>
Some of the main innovations in the new constitution text,
formed by nine chapters and 350 articles, are the change of the
name of Republica de Venezuela to Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
the Congress restructuring, which now is named National Assembly,
the creation of two new public powers, and the figure of vice-
president or prime minister
</P>
<P>
The military right to vote and the extension of the
presidential mandate to six years, instead of five, with the
possibility of an immediate reelection, are also among the
innovations.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly is reduced now to a single chamber (of
deputies).
</P>
<P>
The new constitution expands the citizens participation by
creating the Citizen's Power, a body that embodies the General
Attorney Office, the General Comptroller Office, and the new
figure of defender of the people.
</P>
<P>
The referendum as an instrument for matters of special national
transcendence is also institutionalized, and the president is
given power to dissolve the Congress in situations of crisis, or
when congressmen reject more than twice the candidates appointed
for the vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
The new structures of the government and the Congress will go
in force by the middle of 2000, after an electoral process in
which the members of the National Assembly, the president of the
Republic, and the governors of the 23 states of the country will
be elected.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice were immediately
dissolved December 15. Legislative functions were assumed by the
Constitutional Assembly, which will function until February 1 of
2000, when it will be substituted by a legislative commission or
little congress, that will act until the new deputies are elected.

<HEADLINE> London Millennium Wheel Fails Safety Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- London's official millennium
celebrations suffered last minute hitches on Thursday when an
historic first ride on the world's biggest ferris wheel was
scrapped and many guests did not get invitations in time for the
capital's biggest party.
</P>
<P>
The 450-foot (140 metres) high wheel of 32 capsules, which
gives a panoramic 40-km (25-mile) view of the city's skyline, is
not scheduled to open to the public until February.
</P>
<P>
The 20 million pound (33.23 million U.S. dollars) project was
delayed several months ago when an engineering problem stopped for
days a process which pulled the wheel vertical.
</P>
<P>
Organizers say the inaugural ride on the wheel - officially
called the British Airways London Eye - will not take place on New
Year's Eve after one of the 32 passenger capsules failed a final
safety test.
</P>
<P>
British Airways confirmed there was a problem with the clutch
and its driving mechanism which keeps the pod stable during
rotation.
</P>
<P>
No members of the public will now be allowed on the observation
wheel until the opening at the end of January.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people marched
Thursday in Santiago de Cuba to demand the return to the island of
Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez, who survived a wreckage last month and
is now in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators walked along the Las Americas Avenue and
paraded past the monument to Antonio Maceo, one of the highest
ranking military heroes of the Cuban independence, where they
shouted "glory to Maceo, let us save Elian."
</P>
<P>
Photographs of Elian, in which he is seen behind two blue bars
with small white stars that look like the bars of a prison, were
exhibited during "the march of the combating people."
</P>
<P>
"Open forums" have been organized at which the "kidnapping" of
Elian by "Yankee imperialism" and "the counter-revolutionary mafia
of Miami" are denounced.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez was rescued in the sea where he was holding to
an inflated inner tube after surviving the sinking of a raft in
which some Cubans pretended to reach the United States soil. Elian
's mother and other 11 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government has insisted that Elian must return to his
father, who is in the island.

<HEADLINE> WWF Warns Italy of Risk From Oil Spills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Mediterranean Sea has seen
more than 1,300 incidents since 1955 involving oil tankers and
Italy is one of the countries most at risk from potentially
disastrous oil spills, the World Fund for Nature (WWF) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WWF, in a report on the dangers posed by the large number
of oil tankers using the Mediterranean, said that a quarter of the
oil transported across the globe was shipped through this
relatively tiny sea, the equivalent of some 20 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
It said that Italy, situated in the middle of this over-busy
shipping lane, was particularly at risk from ecological disasters
like the one caused by the sinking of the oil tanker Erika, which
broke in half off Brittany on December 12 and has since spilled an
estimated 8,000 tons of oil into the sea.
</P>
<P>
It said that some 60 percent of the total amount of oil
transported across the Mediterranean passed through Italian ports.
</P>
<P>
The Fund called on the Italian government to tighten its checks
and controls on tankers and "finally install an integrated system
of radio, radar and satellite controls similar to those used for
aircraft, which would allow the authorities to monitor sea traffic.
"
</P>
<P>
The Maltese-registered chartered tanker Erika sank about 50km
off Brittany and over Christmas, massive oil slicks started
polluting large stretches of the French coastline, whose rugged
cliffs, magnificent beaches and varied marine wild-life, not to
mention the oyster and shellfish beds now at their peak in the
shallow coastal waters, make it one of France's major tourist
attractions.
