<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairman on Implementing Food Hygiene Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), Wu Jieping,
today called on governments at all levels to put the
implementation of the Food Hygiene Law high on their work agenda.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the call this morning at the 26th session of the 8th
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress made so far to carry out the law,
which was passed and went into effect on October 30, 1995 at the
16th session of the 8th NPC Standing Committee, could be viewed as
an important way of measuring whether governments of various
levels really care for the people.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman was presenting a report on the work on the
law done by the Standing Committee's law-enforcement inspection
teams.
</P>
<P>
During the April-June period, the NPC Standing Committee
dispatched three inspection teams to over 50 food products
factories and companies in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang
and Jiangsu, as well as two cities of Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The review covered the manufacturing, processing and management
of food products for the general public as well as food products
for infants.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that since the promulgation of the law, China has made
tremendous achievements in the fields of supervision and
management of food hygiene, with the percentage of certifiably
hygienic food rising steadily.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall situation of food hygiene across the
country still doesn't look good enough, the vice-chairman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
He noted that many Chinese people pay little attention to food
hygiene and do not know how to use the legal system to protect
their own interests and strike out against such unlawful practices
as the manufacturing and selling of fake and sub-standard food.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that the incidence
of intestinal infectious disease resulting from poor food hygiene
in China accounts for over 80 percent of all infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman urged departments concerned to solve those
food hygiene problems which have a wider social impact and pose a
greater threat to people's health in a planned way, stressing that
priority should be given to the examination of food sold by street
vendors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the supervision of food hygiene is
comparatively weak in rural areas and outlying areas of cities
which harbor numerous illegally-operating manufacturing plants
that make substandard food products.

<HEADLINE> London Futures Exchange Trades Half-Year Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded a total of 100.99
million contracts during the first half of this year, a rise of 22
percent over the same 1996 period, hitting an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today showed that the LIFFE saw its busiest
June ever, trading a record of 17,044,483 futures and options
contracts, 35 percent up on June 1996. Average daily volume
amounted to 811,642 contracts, representing a daily nominal
turnover of 166 billion pounds (272 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, chairman of the LIFFE, said, "In this, its
15th anniversary year, LIFFE has set a new half-year volume record
and was the second largest futures and options exchange in the
world for the half-year."
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the market's confidence in the exchange and the
continuing demand by our membership and end-users for the wide
range of products available at LIFFE in the uncertainty
surrounding the advent of Economic and Monetary Union," he added.
</P>
<P>
The LIFFE and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) launched their
linkage agreement in May 1997 whereby the 30-year U.S. Treasury
Bond and the German Government Bond (Bund) futures and options
contracts are available for trading at the LIFFE and the CBOT
respectively during European and U.S. business hours. Since then,
the LIFFE has traded a total of 153,651 Bund futures and options
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Move to Rescue Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief peace negotiators from both
the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) would soon have their first face-to-face meeting, TV
monitored here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said chief government negotiator Fortunato Abat and
MILF vice chairman for political affairs Ghadzali Jaafar were due
to meet in Cotabato City in southern Philippines to revive the
stalled peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Bloody clashes between government troops and MILF rebels
erupted after the military launched a war against MILF members in
the second half of June.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 100 rebels and five soldiers were
killed in the fighting. As a result, the MILF boycotted its sixth
round of low-level peace talks slated for June 29-30 with the
government.
</P>
<P>
A father in a university in Cotabato City has been proposed by
Jaafar as a peace mediator for the two sides. He said the two
chief peace negotiators would discuss a proposed comprehensive
ceasefire, the overall situation in Mindanao and the settlement of
thousands of civilians displaced by the recent clashes.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member rebel group which refused to accept
the peace agreement signed last year between the government and
the Moro National Liberation Front.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Oppositions Launch Protest March in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of five Lesotho
opposition parties today defied a government ban on protest
marches to the Royal Palace in Maseru, capital of the kingdom,
when they led hundreds of supporters to the Office of King Letsie
III, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organised by the Basotho National Party and
supported by other leading opposition groups, was the latest in a
series of demonstrations against the government of Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The protesters presented a petition to the King's private
secretary Mabote Lerothodi, who promised to pass it on to the
head of state.
</P>
<P>
The petition said Mokhehle's establishment of the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) and his installation of the LCD as
the new governing party were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mokhehle resigned as leader of the ruling
Basutoland Congress Party and formed a new party, the LCD, to
which he transferred governance immediately following its
installation.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's political moves were rejected by a coalition of
opposition parties, vowing to launch a series of protesting actions to
make Lesotho ungovernable and parliament unworkable.
</P>
<P>
In the petition, the oppositions once again called on the King
to dissolve Mokhehle's administration and appoint an interim
government to ensure the democratic rule in the small land-locked
kingdom surrounded by South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President's Speech Draws Nationwide Support (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An inspiring speech made by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin here last night has aroused a high
sense of patriotism throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
People from all ethnic groups and walks of life have expressed
their belief that China would not have regained Hong Kong so
smoothly if the motherland had not been growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally here to celebrate Hong Kong's homecoming on
July 1, President Jiang said the unruffled return could ultimately
be attributed to the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people
and the country's increasingly prominent international status.
</P>
<P>
"It is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the
guidance of the Party's basic line that has taken China to
prosperity," a Beijing resident told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"With the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we'll concentrate on
economic development, stick to the four cardinal principles, and
continue reform and opening-up," he said.
</P>
<P>
83-year-old Zheng Guochang, a member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and professor at Lanzhou University, said two events in
his life have filled him with "pride and joy." One was the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and the other
was the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong was the result of the growing strength
of the motherland, said Lin Shouqi, a sixth-generation descendent
of Lin Zexu, regarded in China as a national hero who burnt the
opium confiscated from the British traders before the start of the
Opium War.
</P>
<P>
"The imperialist countries had always tried to have their
figures in the affairs of Tibet when the motherland was weak and
poor," said Cedan Pinco, a Tibetan historian. "It was only until
the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951 that we were able to
smash their attempts."
</P>
<P>
History has proved that a powerful and prosperous motherland is
the fundamental guarantee of the unity of the country.

<P>
Many people hailed Jiang's remarks that China must persist in
opening up in order to keep up with the progress of the times and
development trends.
</P>
<P>
"His remarks on the need to draw upon the fine fruit of world
civilization by adhering to the policy of reform and opening up
have given voice to our intellectuals' innermost feelings," said
agronomist Yuan Longping, father of hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zhuyin, general manager of a Shanghai-based wool company,
said that it is reform and opening up that helped the firm
introduce advanced technology and management expertise from
overseas -- moves which have also enabled the national economy to
develop rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhai, general manager of the Jiangnan Ship Building
Company, said reform and opening-up have made it possible for
the company to sell its products to some 20 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
"It is the reform and opening up that really make a country
prosperous and strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many people said that they will carefully review Jiang's
comments on implementing the Party's basic line and following the
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics charted by
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhiyang, a railway worker from Henan Province, attributed
the great changes of the nation and the return of Hong Kong
to the adherence to the Party's basic line and Deng's theory.
</P>
<P>
Sun Sigao, a farmer from Shangdong Province, said that the
farmers owed what they are today to the theory about building
socialism advanced by Deng Xiaoping. "Our life will become better
and better so long as we continue along the road charted by Deng
Xiaoping," he said.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Deng Xiaoping to Rousing Welcome in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- At the Hong Kong handover
ceremony, a respectable woman with greying hair in her 80s came
to the fore among emissaries, both Chinese and foreign. Her name
was Zhuo Lin, widow of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Deng once said he wished to take a trip to Hong Kong after its
return to the motherland, Deng said on a number of occasions. "I
very much want to take a short walk and stay just for a while even
if I'm in a wheelchair."
</P>
<P>
But Deng, the founder of "one country, two systems" concept,
passed away at the age of 93 in late February before his ardent
aspiration comes true. However, it was Deng who announced to the
world China's firm belief to resume its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong 18 years ago, and included the concept of "one
country two systems" into the annals of history.
His concept eventually led to Hong Kong's return to China on July
1 while maintaining its capitalist system and way of life,
</P>
<P>
"I have make this trip on behalf of Xiaoping," said Zhuo Lin,
who is here with her children for Hong Kong's handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As part of her preparations for her trip and make it more
meaningful, Madame Zhuo Lin bought a Hong Kong atlas and read it
repeatedly with great care. She strove to acquaint herself with
this part of the Chinese territory, which had been under the
British colonial rule for 156 years. "It is a great red-letter
event for the entire Chinese nation to resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and I sincerely hope that the future
for Hong Kong will be still more splendid," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the five-star national rose side by side with regional
bauhinia flag of the Hong Kong SAR at zero hour on July 1, Madame
Zhuo and her children moved to tears. For Zhuo lin, she could
hardly control herself and all sorts of feelings welled up in her
heart.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural ceremony for the establishment of the HKSAR
government at 10 sharp am on July 1, President Jiang Zemin
descended the rostrum especially to greet and shook hands with
smiling Zhuo, who was then seated at the second row of the rostrum
.
</P>
<P>
During his address at the inaugural ceremony, Tung Chee Hwa,
who was just sworn in as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
said with excitement, "I'm very glad that Madame Zhuo has come,
and we would like to extend her our full respect."
</P>
<P>
At Tung's proposal, the entire hall of the inaugural ceremony
burst into rousing applauses. Zhuo Lin rose and made several bows
to the audience.

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra said here
today that the Nepali government will prepare concrete programs
focusing on poverty eradication, employment and food security
under the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint session of the Nepali parliament, the king
said programs at the grassroots level will be launched in order to
put into practice the concept of balanced development in which
activities related to literacy, clean drinking water, small and
cottage industries, small-scale hydroelectricity development and
universal primary health will complement each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy on making villages self-reliant through
programs of village development in accordance with the concept of
"Build Your Village Yourselves" will continue.
</P>
<P>
And the government will make special efforts to uplift the
economic and social conditions of the people living in the most
remote parts of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's policies in the fiscal year 1997-98
beginning on July 15, Birendra said development programs will be
implemented to gain high economic growth rate, and the policy of
reducing government involvement in public enterprises and
embracing participation of the private sector will be continued.
</P>
<P>
He said a long-term agricultural development plan will be
implemented by utilizing irrigation, fertilizers, rural
agricultural roads, rural electrification and modern agricultural
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also implement the policy of
investment promotion by creating a congenial environment for
private sector development and investment.
</P>
<P>
The king noted that his government will launch programs to
directly link production-oriented areas with the commercial sector
in order to reduce trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
On the development of the country's huge water resources, the
king said a long-term strategy will be prepared in this effort,
and more encouragement will be given to the private sector and
foreign investors.

</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Qi Zhijia said China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Hong on July 1

<P>
At the reception, Qi said Hong Kong's peaceful return not only
was of significance for the unification of China, but also may
serve as a solution to problems left over from the history between
countries.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems", "Hong Kong People governing Hong
Kong", and "a high degree of autonomy" were China's policies to
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he said.

tomorrow," said the Chinese ambassador.

<HEADLINE> EC Repeats Ban on British Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) today
repeated its ban on British beef exports after the country
allegedly exported more than 1,000 tons of beef to various nations.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said today an EC inspection team at work in
Britain has verified suspicions that Britain fraudulently exported
its beef to many countries in defiance of an European Union
embargo imposed in March 1996 amid fears of "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
Emma Bonino, the EU commissioner responsible for consumer
policy, has informed the British government of the inspection
team's findings and blamed the manifest inefficiency of British
checking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which refused to disclose the findings, is
contacting nations which have imported British beef in a bid to
help them deal with beef smuggled from Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is also discussing whether to punish Britain because of its
inefficient checking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The French weekly "Le Canard Enchaine" Wednesday reported that
the international police force Interpol had began an investigation
of illegally exported beef via Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The weekly cited an Interpol telex as saying that British
soldiers were involved in beef smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Deng Xiaoping to Rousing Welcome in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- At the Hong Kong handover
ceremony, a respectable woman with greying hair in her 80s came
to the fore among emissaries, both Chinese and foreign. Her name
was Zhuo Lin, widow of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Deng said on a number of occasions that he wished to take a
trip to Hong Kong after its return to the motherland. "I very much
want to take a short walk and stay just for a while even if I'm in
a wheelchair," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
But Deng, the founder of "one country, two systems" concept,
passed away at the age of 93 in late February before his ardent
aspiration comes true. However, it was Deng who announced to the
world China's firm belief to resume its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong 18 years ago, and included the concept of "one
country two systems" into the annals of history.
His concept eventually led to Hong Kong's return to China on July
1 while maintaining its capitalist system and way of life,
</P>
<P>
"I have make this trip on behalf of Xiaoping," said Zhuo Lin,
who is here with her children for Hong Kong's handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As part of her preparations for her trip and make it more
meaningful, Madame Zhuo Lin bought a Hong Kong atlas and read it
repeatedly with great care. She strove to acquaint herself with
this part of the Chinese territory, which had been under the
British colonial rule for 156 years. "It is a great red-letter
event for the entire Chinese nation to resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and I sincerely hope that the future
for Hong Kong will be still more splendid," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the five-star national flag rose side by side with regional
bauhinia flag of the Hong Kong SAR at zero hour on July 1, Madame
Zhuo and her children moved to tears. For Zhuo lin, she could
hardly control herself and all sorts of feelings welled up in her
heart.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural ceremony for the establishment of the HKSAR
government at 10 sharp am on July 1, President Jiang Zemin
descended the rostrum especially to greet and shook hands with
smiling Zhuo, who was then seated at the second row of the rostrum
.
</P>
<P>
During his address at the inaugural ceremony, Tung Chee Hwa,
who was just sworn in as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
said with excitement, "I'm very glad that Madame Zhuo has come,
and we would like to extend her our full and special respect."
</P>
<P>
At Tung's proposal, the entire hall of the inaugural ceremony
burst into rousing applauses. Zhuo Lin rose and made several bows
to the audience.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Loyalists Threaten Murder If March Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF),
an outlawed Protestant guerrilla group, today threatened to kill
Irish Catholic civilians if Britain bans a controversial
Protestant parade in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The LVF said in a telephoned statement to Downtown radio
station near Belfast that it would carry out the murders if the
parade of the ancient Orange Order, scheduled for next Sunday, is
barred from going on through the Garvahgy Road in the Catholic
town of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"If the Orange parade does not go down the Garvaghy Road on
Sunday, the Irish government may expect civilians to be killed in
the Irish Republic," LVF said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This threat will be carried out immediately if the parade is
banned," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The LVF was banned last month by the British government on
suspicion of carrying out bombings and shootings.
</P>
<P>
Catholic residents, who favor the independence of Northern
Ireland from the British rule, said they are against the annual
parade because they feel intimidated by the Orange Order.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order, an exclusively Protestant brotherhood which
holds hundreds of processions across the province each summer, is
a lawful body which condemns violence.
</P>
<P>
Last year's parade turned into a bloody clash between the
Protestants and the Catholics. The British government has recently
vowed to guard against the repeat of last year's violence.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both Protestants and Catholics met last
week to seek ways easing tension in the march season but they
failed to reach an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Talks with Mubarak on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat will meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Thursday to discuss the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that Arafat will
arrive here later today for the consultations with Mubarak,
following brief visits to Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had held talks with Tunisian and Algerian top leaders on
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that collapsed in March after
Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Zohdi al-Keddrah, Palestinian ambassador to Egypt, said that
Arafat and Mubarak will explore the latest developments of the
paralysed Mideast peace process, Israeli intransigence and its
insistence on going ahead with settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also focus on the volatile conditions inside
the occupied Arab territories, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian efforts are continuing to patch up the peace-making
process and they are highly appreciated by the Palestinian
leadership and people," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as the main mediator between the
Palestinians and Israelis over the past few weeks as a result of
what many Arabs perceive as a lack of U.S. interest in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had sent his senior advisor Osama el-Baz to shuttle
between the two sides several times in a bid to bring them back to
the negotiating table. But their gap persists.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said Tuesday that he hoped the
Palestinians and Israelis can conclude something within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in an interview with the French newspaper "Le Monde"
today, accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of
blowing up the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called upon the U.S. to shoulder its political and moral
responsibilities to force Israel to abide by the signed agreements
and urged France and Europe to contribute to salvaging the
stalled peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Discusses Economic Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) had a discussion about benefits and
drawbacks of the economic globalization at a high-level panel here
today.
</P>
<P>
Heads from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Bank made statements at the
panel on important developments in the world economy and
international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, Managing Director of the IMF, said that
globalization and its attendant availability of massive amounts of
private capital had opened new opportunities for investment and
growth in an ever larger number of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
But it had also brought new problems, such as the ignorance of
the less developed countries by the markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus stressed the importance of macroeconomic
stabilization, and of the trade liberalization, price reform,
privatization and other reforms which make stabilization possible.
</P>
<P>
Renato Ruggiero, Director-General of WTO, said that more needed
to be done to help the least-developed countries in relation to
the effects of globalization and the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that more than 50 percent of the world's
population had less than five percent of global income. He told
the panel that WTO members had responded by adopting a Plan of
Action for the Least-Developed Countries, a major objective which
was to ensure that all such countries had a strong voice in the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, Secretary-General of UNCTAD, warned in his
statement a backlash that would jeopardize recent economic reforms
in both developed and developing countries due to increasing
inequality between them.
</P>
<P>
Practically all developing countries were inadequately prepared
for globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jean-Francois Rischard, Vice-president of Finance
and Private-sector Development of the World Bank, said that the
World Bank tried to help countries get their "enabling
environments" right in the context of the new world economy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Crisis Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The government crisis in
Israel continued as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu failed to
patch up his feud with Foreign Minister David Levy in their
meeting today.
</P>
<P>
This was the third meeting between the two in the past week
aimed at finding a solution to the crisis caused by Levy's
complaints about his exclusion from the government
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was originally scheduled on Sunday, but Levy
angrily canceled it after local media exposed that National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon held a secret meeting with
Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) on June 16 without his knowledge. Levy threatened to
resign, a move that could bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after today's meeting at Netanyahu's office in the
Knesset (Parliament), Levy described it as a "serious and
responsible" discussion on all issues. He said he had aired
his position regarding his future role in the cabinet, but
adding nothing had been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Levy did not disclose details of his demands made during
the meeting, but he reportedly told Netanyahu that he must
be the No. 1 person in charge of the foreign affairs and
talks with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, his Gesher Party
demanded more funds on social welfare from the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Gesher's lawmaker Michael Cleiner warned that Levy was still
considering resignation because of the failure of today's
meeting. He said Netanyahu must crystallize the autonomy of
the Foreign Ministry, which often complains about the takeover
of its responsibility by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Levy apparently also failed to solve their
differences over the dissolution of the so-called inner security
cabinet, or Ketchen cabinet, which now included Netanyahu, Levy
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
In his plan to reshuffle the cabinet following the Bar-On
scandal not long ago, Netanyahu wanted to transfer Sharon from the
 Infrastructure Ministry to the finance portfolio. But Sharon
conditioned the transfer on his inclusion into the inner cabinet
in order to have a bigger say in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Levy, worried about the possible takeover by Sharon of his
position in charge of the peace talks, strongly opposes Sharon's
inclusion and demands the dissolution of the inner cabinet.
</P>
<P>
If Levy resigns, the Netanyahu government is unlikely to
continue because it could lose its majority in the 120-seat
Knesset. The Gesher Party has boasted five of the 66 seats in the
coalition, which has already been plagued by several important
resignations.
</P>
<P>
Former Science Minister Benny Begin resigned in January to
protest the signing of the agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron, and Dan Meridor resigned as the Finance
Minister last month due to his rift with Netanyahu in policies.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, the government will step down if it
loses the 61 majority in the Knesset to pave the way for
new elections for both the prime minister and the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leading opposition parties Labor and Meretz wasted
no time in intensifying its campaign to topple the Netanyahu
government. They accused the government of being preoccupied
with "childish" debate on the dissolution of inner cabinet at
a time when Israeli soldiers and Palestinians clashed in
Hebron and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Meretz decided today to table two no-confidence
motions in Netanyahu over the current explosive security
situation in the Palestinian territories. The Knesset is to vote
on the motions early next week and the Netanyahu government is
facing another tough challenge of survival.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Youth Killed in Clashes in Gaza </HEADLINE>

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An 18-year-old Palestinian youth
was shot dead by Israeli soldiers near Morag Jewish settlement in
the Gaza Strip today, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

Palestinian demonstrators near the settlement.

obstruct an Israeli bulldozers moving on a plot of Palestinian
land and threw stones at the soldiers, the troops opened fire in
response. The youth was hit by rubber bullets on the chest and
died of injuries later.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents have held protests for days running
against Israeli attempts to confiscate the land for expansion of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Hebron, Meanwhile, violence ruled
the streets again today. The Israeli army deployed snipers on
the rooftops in the city in an attempt to scare away
Palestinian protesters. They also blocked with cemented barrels
the alley where a home-made explosive charge was thrown at
them Tuesday. Two soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
During today's clashes Palestinian youths tossed Dozens of
petrol bombs along with rocks against the heavily armed
soldiers. No Israeli soldiers were hurt. But seven Palestinian
stone-throwers were wounded by live ammunition and 12 others
by rubber bullets.

<HEADLINE> Gaps between Greek, Turkish Cypriots Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Gustave Feissel, UN resident
representative in Cyprus, admitted here today that big differences
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides remain in a number of
important issues.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the local press, Feissel explained that major
differences exist in issues such as the future federal executive,
how the federal government takes decisions, sovereignty, security,
territory and displaced persons and property claims as well as
Cyprus' European orientation.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is also divergence of views on the basic
freedoms of settlement and the right to property, while their
positions on freedom of movement do not seem to be too far apart.
</P>
<P>
Feissel made the statement just a week before the
U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot leaders, due to take place from July 9-13 at a rural
retreat called Troutbeck, 145 kilometers north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
He denied the existence of a reported document which
U.N. Secretary-General's special representative for Cyprus, Diego
Cordovez, will submit to both sides at the beginning of the New
York face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the first closed meeting July 9 with the
leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, Cordovez
intends to make "an oral presentation of his thoughts which will
be designed to help launch the discussions."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez intends to give President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash the talking points on his
presentation, the UN official added, underlining that the
U.N. goal is to "help the talks out of a possible impasse and act
as facilitator" to the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Denktash threatened Tuesday that he will not attend the
upcoming direct talks if he is not informed of the reported
document beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, former foreign minister of Ecuador, was appointed as
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy for Cyprus
earlier this year. He will be in New York early next week for
preliminary contact with Feissel ahead of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan will open the talks on July 9 with a statement and then
negotiations will be conducted behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Greece will be represented by its former ambassador to Cyprus,
Alexandros Sandis, and Turkey by Inal Batu, alternate deputy
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Five permanent members of UN Security Council and the European
Union will also send their representatives to the wings of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash held two informal meetings in Nicosia in
October 1994 under the U.N. auspices, which ended in
deadlock. They have not met ever since.

<HEADLINE> Blair Asks for Strict Observation of Hong Kong Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said today his country was determined to ensure that the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration is strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interests of Britain, of China and the people of
Hong Kong that we make sure the joint declaration is kept to
strictly, and we will, and secondly that we build upon that a
strong and good relation with China for the future, and we will do
that too," Blair said in a speech to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said it was vital Britain use the Joint
Declaration on how Hong Kong is governed for the next 50 years to
develop relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Under the Joint Declaration, Britain handed Hong Kong back to
China on June 30 after 156 years of colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"The basis of a strong and stable relationship with China,
which we want, is adherence to the Joint Declaration," said Blair,
who returned Tuesday from Hong Kong where he attended the handover
ceremony and met with Chinese President Jiang Zeming.
</P>
<P>
"That is the basis of the freedoms of the people in Hong Kong,
and that is the basis which we will expect to be adhered to," he
added.

AMMAN, July 2 (Xinhua) - Jordanian policemen here today
detained a supermarket owner for putting up a sign on the door of
his shop saying "no entrance for dogs and Jewish."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Yemen to Solve Border Dispute Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi and Yemeni officials
will hold talks soon to solve their 60-year old border dispute,
according to reports from Saudi capital city of Riyadh today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayif Bin Abdel Al-Aziz made the
statement last night after his return from two-day official visit
to Yemen, according to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the border dispute between his country and Yemen
might be solved once and for all in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh told him while he
was staying in Yemeni capital of Sanaa that "we will arrive at a
final solution in the coming days or weeks" to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Saleh wrote a reply letter to the Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul
Aziz pointing out "the gap has been bridged to a larger extent,
we have only little more to go."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi prince also delivered a message from King Fahd
to President Saleh dealing with negotiations between the two
countries on the border demarcation and issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Saleh paid in early February his second visit
to Saudi Arabia in two years to discuss issues of border
demarcation between the two countries and hold talks with the
Saudi leaders on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been locked in border disputes since
1934, but in February 1995 when a Memorandum of Understanding
concerning the solution of the border issues was concluded
between them, tensions were eased and bilateral ties have been
improving.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation negotiations have been conducted through
joint committees formed in accordance with the Memorandum of
Understanding which defines the basis for ending the border
dispute between the two Arab neighbors on the Arab peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said in a statement at the beginning of this year
that although the border question remains one of the "most
complicated issues in the region, we are confident the two
countries' leadership would overcome all pending issues in a
brotherly spirit."
</P>
<P>
According to the Saudi prince, officials of the two countries
would also discuss soon the activation of the security accord
signed between the two countries last year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement which was signed in July 1996 stipulated that the
two countries would work together to fight drugs smuggling,
terrorism and infiltration and to extradite criminals. The pact
would serve the security interests of both countries as they
share large areas of land and marine borders.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Support to Solving Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia today reiterated its
readiness to offer support to the UN effort for a Cyprus
settlement and hoped the preliminary work done so far would help
lead to necessary compromise solutions.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Russian Embassy here today said
Russia hopes that the serious approach of the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides, as described in June's U.N. Security Council
resolution, would help reach the goal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution reaffirms its position that a Cyprus
settlement must be based on a state of Cyprus with a single
sovereignty and international personality, and a single
citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that the state of Cyprus will comprise two
politically equal communities in a bicommunal and bizonal
federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole
or in part with any other country or any form of partition of
secession.
</P>
<P>
This island state has been divided since 1974 when Turkish
troops occupied its northern third in the wake of a short-lived
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Russian statement considered particularly important the
call on the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
to cooperate actively and constructively with the U.N.
Secretary-General at next week's direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations between Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides are due to take place from July 9 to 13, at
a rural retreat called Troutbeck, 145 kilometers north of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
The interest of the international community in achieving
progress toward a Cyprus settlement is proved by the dispatch of
special envoys from twelve states and the European Union to New
York to work on the outer circle of the talks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will be represented to the talks by Vladimir Tchizhov,
head of the Third Directorate for European Affairs of the Russian
Foreign Ministry, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Criticizes Israel for Obstructing Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
today strongly criticized Israel for obstructing the peace
process, the Algerian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here earlier today, made the criticism
after his meeting with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's attitude was responsible for placing the peace
process in a deadlock. Israel's endeavors to Judaize Jerusalem,
he said, is part of a continuous plot against the Palestinians and
Arabs as well as Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the last phase in the plot was the
defamation of Islam as was the case in Hebron, referring to
leaflets distributed by Jewish settlers insulting Islam.
</P>
<P>
President Arafat added that his talks with President Zeroual
were important and essential, dealing with the current situation
in Palestine in the light of Natanyahu government's rejection to
pursue the peace process or to adhere to what had been signed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian President visited France and Tunisia before he
came to Algeria for talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left Algiers this afternoon following a brief visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas
will pay a one-day visit to Turkey Friday for a meeting with
Turkish leaders on the Cyprus issue, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
It said Denktas will hold talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem as well as State Minister
Sukru Gurel, who is responsible for the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement is expected to be issued before Denktas
returns to the northern part of the divided Cyprus island Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
Denktas' Ankara visit comes a week before UN-brokered direct
talks between Denktas and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, which
is scheduled on July 9-13.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry issued on Tuesday a statement
declaring that Turkey supported the proposed face-to-face talks,
but warned against "external pressures."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that any settlement to the Cyprus problem
can only be achieved through the free will of both sides. It
condemned the Cypriot military build-up on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
In a clear deviation from the Cyprus policy of the previous
governments, the statement emphasized that Turkey was concerned
about the security of Turkish Cypriots but Cyprus was also
important for the security of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
control of the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side unilaterally declared a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in November 1993,
which was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktas held two informal meetings in Nicosia in
October 1994 under the U.N. auspices, which ended in
deadlock. They have not met ever since.

<HEADLINE> UK's Labor Government Unveils RadicaL Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the British chancellor
of exchequer, unveiled today a tax-raising budget designed to cool
the over-heated economy, boost investment and phase out the
government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Brown told the House of Commons that the main theme of the
first budget by a Labor government in nearly two decades was to
provide "stability, investment, work and opportunity for all."
</P>
<P>
The chancellor promised 3.5 billion pounds (5.6 billion US
dollars) for his Welfare-to-Work scheme to get young people out of
benefit and into jobs.
</P>
<P>
Brown confirmed that he was imposing a windfall tax of 5.2
billion pounds (8.32 billion US dollars) on the excess profits of
utilities that Labor believes were privatized too cheaply by the
previous Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
He said the controversial tax would be used to finance a deal
for 250,000 young jobless by offering them a "ladder of
opportunity" into work.
</P>
<P>
Warning that rapid consumer spending risked sparking an
unsustainable boom, Brown said he would raise an extra 5.5 billion
pounds (9.1 billion US dollars) in tax this year and 4.75 billion
pounds (7.5 billion US dollars) next year to put Britain on the
road to long-term financial stability.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's poor investment record, which the chancellor said
had lagged that of its main competitors since 1980, Brown cut the
main rate of tax on company profits from 33 percent to a record
low of 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
As far as small business, which Brown said would be the main
engine of job creation, are concerned, the chancellor also cut the
tax rate on small companies to 21 percent from 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of encouraging firms to plough more profits
back into investment instead of paying them out in dividends,
Brown also said he was abolishing tax credits paid to pension
funds, estimated to be worth more than 3 billion pounds (4.8
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The chancellor's budget speech was delayed by up to half an
hour owing to a question from shadow chancellor Peter Lilley's
complaint of Budget leaks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here tonight on a lightning visit
to Egypt, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with President Hosni Mubarak tomorrow to
discuss the stalled peace process, which the Palestinian leader
described as "dead."
</P>
<P>
In an interview granted to French newspaper "Le Monde" today,
Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu of
blowing up the Mideast peace process which collapsed three months
ago when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called upon the U.S. to shoulder its political and moral
responsibilities to force Israel to abide by the signed agreements
and urged France and Europe to contribute to salvaging the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew here at the end of his brief visits to France,
Tunisia and Algeria, where he held talks on the staggering
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador here Zohdi al-Keddrah said that the two
leaders will explore the latest developments of the peace process,
Israeli intransigence, its insistence on going ahead with
settlement construction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak-Arafat talks will mainly focus on the volatile
conditions inside the occupied Arab territories, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian efforts are continuing to patch up the peacemaking
process and they are highly appreciated by the Palestinian
leadership and people," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is always looking forward to meeting Mubarak to get
acquainted with his view," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as the main mediator between the
Palestinians and Israelis over the past few weeks as a result of
what many Arabs perceive as a lack of U.S. interest in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has sent his senior advisor Osama el-Baz to shuttle
between the two sides several times in a bid to bring them back to
the negotiating table but the gap remains.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said Tuesday that Egypt would not for the
time being resume its negotiating efforts but contacts between the
tow sides would materialize in progress soon.
</P>
<P>
"Let them work: I hope they can conclude something within one
week, 10 days," he told reporters during an inspection tour to the
Western Desert.

ANKARA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ankara State Security Court
today released Bekir Yildiz, a former mayor of Sincan city who
was arrested for supporting illegal religious activities, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz was arrested on February 13 for encouraging
discrimination between Islamists and non-Islamists and for
leading the "Jerusalem Night" activities.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that five others, who were arrested with
Yildiz on the suspicion of being involved in the anti-secular
activities, were also released.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled for the continued detention of Selam
newspaper journalist Nurettin Sirin who had allegedly supplied
the pictures of Hizbollah leaders that were displayed at the
sports hall in Sincan city, 40 kilometers west of Ankara, where
the Islamic evening festivities were held.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara Muhammed Reza Bagheri was also
involved in the incident for his disputed religious remarks
against Turkey's secularist system at the festivities.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-Term Interest Rates Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
policy-makers decided today to keep the short-term interest rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Fed announced that it had adjourned a two-day meeting of
its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee and had nothing
further to say. The statement means that the U.S. central bank
left the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between
banks at 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been widely expected in advance by many
economists although some believed a modest increase in short-term
rates would do little harm and would help prevent inflation from
accelerating later this year and next.
</P>
<P>
The Fed made the decision at a time when the U.S. economy has
slowed down sharply from the quick 5.9 percent growth rate in the
first quarter of this year while the inflation was being kept in
low level. Nearly everything fell into place to buy Fed's
policy-makers time to watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the country has decelerated even though the
economy expanded at the fastest pace in nearly a decade and
unemployment dropped to 4.8 percent in May, nearly a 24-year low.
</P>
<P>
Falling energy prices held consumer inflation to a scant 1.4
percent annual rate during the first five months of this year,
down from 3.3 percent for all of last year. Even stripping out
volatile food and energy costs, the inflation rate is just 2.6
percent so far this year, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
A variety of statistics, most notably retail sales, suggest
that U.S. economic growth in the April-June quarter slowed sharply
to around a 2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Still, some economists have cautioned the U.S. Fed that now is
no time for complacency about inflation and that growth will
rebound in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
But other analysts believe that the second-half bounce-back in
the U.S. won't be strong enough to aggravate price pressures and
see little need for higher rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed raised the federal fund rate on March 25, the
first time in two years, and left the rate unchanged in its May 20
policy-making meeting.

Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 115 million U.S.
dollar loan to the state of Ceara, Brazil, to help finance
multiple highway improvements.
</P>
<P>
The works of the project include converting 52 km of access
roads to metropolitan Fortaleza into a four-lane, divided roadway
with a bikeway and sidewalks along the entire length.
</P>
<P>
Some 420 km of highways will receive conventional paving and
another 450 km low-cost paving to assure all weather access to
municipal seats.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 510 km of road will be rehabilitated and improved,
with sealing and small works on another 350 km of road.
</P>
<P>
The program will shorten travel times between Ceara's main
production centers and expedite the supply of agricultural and
industrial products to the state and national markets. The state's
tourism industry and competitiveness in world markets will also be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan will also assist the Department of Buildings,
Highways and Transportation in consolidating a modern approach to
road administration and planning.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 250 million dollars. The
local counterpart will contribute 115 million dollars.

</P>
<P>
A Kenyan governmental official said that the two-day summit to
be hosted by IGAD Chairman, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
would also cover Sudan's relations with neighbouring Eritrea,
Ethiopia and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, peace talks weres held in Kenya between
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Sudanese President Hassan
el Bashir to iron out their long-standing differences.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the peace talks, the two
presidents requested President Moi to convene a IGAD summit to
pursue the course of peace in southern Sudan and in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In southern Sudan, the Sudan People's Liberation Army led by
John Garang has fought since 1983 for greater autonomy of the
Christian south from the Moslem north.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan Minister for Environment and Natural
Resources Henry Kosgey today called on IGAD member states to
strengthen the organization's financial base in a bid to
undertake peace initiatives in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at the on-going session of IGAD Committee of
Experts here that efforts must be made in order to ensure funding
for all the identified programs as IGAD's mandate has been
expanded to covering food security, environment, infrastructure
development and conflict prevention, management and resolution.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Press Allies to Accept Three New NATO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
resist pressure from its allies to invite more than three
countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
when he attend the Madrid summit next week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will leave late on Friday for Spain to attend the
special summit of the alliance, scheduled on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>
He has already declared publicly that he wants NATO to extend
membership only to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. But
France and Italy are pressing the alliance also to invite Romania
and Slovenia during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, White House National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said, "I would think there'd be some lively
discussion of this (at the summit) but at the end of the day... I
think it's fair to say that there will be a consensus on the
three."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the admitting Romania and Slovenia, Berger
said, "The answer is not no, but no at this time."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the summit, Berger said Clinton's view "is that
America must remain anchored in Europe, that NATO was the most
important vehicle of that anchoring."
</P>
<P>
Clinton wanted to "recreate and adapt NATO for a new era in
order for it to be relevant for the American people and relevant
for the security threats that we faced," Berger added.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, Clinton was expected to visit Poland,
Romania and Denmark.

<HEADLINE> World Tea Production Expected to Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The world tea production for 1997
is expected to decline and consumers will face higher tea prices,
said a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in Sri Lanka and in most tea producing
countries of Africa, extremely dry weather is adversely affecting
tea growing.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that as one of the major tea producing
countries, Kenya's tea output in the first quarter is about
37 percent lower than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO, world tea production reached a record 2.69
million tons last year, 3 percent increase compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, tea production increased in almost all major tea
producing countries.
</P>
<P>
In India, tea production increased by 4 percent to set a new
record of 778,900 tons while in Africa, Uganda reported an
increase of 26 percent, Malawi 8 percent and Zimbabwe 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a record harvest, exports from India declined by 6
percent to 154,000 tons due to rising domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
Total tea imports by developed countries rose by nearly 5
percent in 1996 to 612,800 tons while total imports by developing
countries rose from 484,300 tons to 495,800 tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Photo Show on HK Opens in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- About 200 glossy photos displayed at
an art house here this evening inspired the admiration of many
visitors who came to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to its
motherland China.
</P>
<P>
The photography exhibition that opened this evening at an art
center in the Egyptian Opera House is designed to give a
comprehensive and detailed account of Hong Kong today and
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the picture show, entitled "History and
Development of Hong Kong," was started a year ago, according to
Luo Hansheng, Cultural Attache at the Chinese Embassy, a
co-sponsor of the event.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibit is of a very high level, in photos, presentation
and content," said Mohamed Ghoneim, first under-secretary of state
for foreign cultural relations of Egyptian Ministry of Culture,
who spent over 30 minutes roaming around the exhibition to
appreciate those pictures, with the accompany of Chinese
Ambassador Yang Fuchang.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua, the Egyptian official sang
highly of the significance of China's resumption of sovereignty
over its once-lost territory after 156 years of British colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
Ghoneim said he found a spontaneous overflow of powerful
feelings to say congratulations to the Chinese people on this
glorious occasion.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the occasion a valid and remarkable symbol of the
emancipation of any occupied land that one day the rights will go
to its owners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We Egyptians and Arabs feel perhaps more than any other
people, if we can say, the sufferings from injustice and
occupation, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Ghoneim hailed the return of Hong Kong as a "glorious day and a
hopeful day for people under occupation to feel hope that one day
through struggle, insistence and persistence that they will gain
their rights back."
</P>
<P>
"Egypt hopes that Hong Kong will join the march of China toward
prosperity, justice, peace and love," said the Egyptian official,
who expressed good wishes on behalf of the Egyptian Ministry of
Culture.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day picture show is co-sponsored by the Egyptian

<HEADLINE> Schneider Admits Fraud in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Former real estate tycoon Juergen
Schneider today admitted in trial that he had cheated loans of
banks before the collapse of his multi-billion dollar company in
1994, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
But as on Monday when the trial began in a Frankfurt court, he
again tried to make the banks bear some of the blame in accepting
faked documents he presented to seek loans.
</P>
<P>
Schneider, 63, is tried on three charges of serious fraud and
two charges of credit fraud in five real estate projects in
Berlin, Leipzig and Frankfurt, which were linked with the collapse
of his company -- the biggest real estate bankruptcy scandal in
post-war Germany.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last until mid-September and will has
its third session on July 8.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony today, Schneider said the banks had
"generously accepted" the fraudulent documents he presented in
seeking loans. The banks knew about the faked documents and he had
used middlemen in borrowing money, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schneider also denied that his creditors -- some 50 banks --
had been damaged to the extent charged.
</P>
<P>
When Schneider and his wife Claudia suddenly went missing in
April 1994, they left behind a company 5.4 billion marks (3.2
billion US dollars) in debts.
</P>
<P>
The pair were found living in Florida, the United States, 13
months later and were extradited to Germany in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, separate proceedings were set later on for the
Schneiders on a charge of fraudulent bankruptcy involving about
245 million marks (145 million dollars) which they allegedly
diverted to Switzerland for their escape.
</P>
<P>
Schneider began his business in real estate in 1981. In the
prime of his career, he was involved in prime-location projects in
14 cities, building luxury hotels, office buildings and shopping
arcades. His company based near Frankfurt once owned 168 real
estate properties.
</P>
<P>
Most of these assets have been sold off, still leaving 2.6
billion mark (1.534 billion dollar) debts uncovered. It was
reported that the chief creditor Deutsche Bank had some 1.2
billion marks (708 million dollars) in loan to Schneider when
Schneider's company collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Huge Oil Painting "Festive Day" Sold in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Oil painting artist Liu Yuyi's
huge masterpiece "Festive Day" has been sold at price of 23
million Hong Kong dollars (about 2.9 million US dollars), it was
announced at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The oil painting, a sister-piece of the artist's another
masterpiece "Festive Evening," was sold to the Hong Kong Parkview
Group Limited.
</P>
<P>
Taking as its theme the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997,
Liu Yuyi, with rich representation and skillful techniques,
portrays in the huge oil painting Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping,
Jiang Zemin and others joining the massive crowd of people from
the inland areas and Hong Kong to celebrate this historical event.
</P>
<P>
The painting, which took three years to complete, from 1993 to
1997, represents Liu's philosophy of art -- the combination of
reality and romance. Set in the background are images from the
magnificent landscapes of both the inland areas and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuyi, born in Nanjing in 1940, was settled down in Hong
Kong in 1991. His "Festive Evening" was sold in Hong Kong at a
price of 8.36 Hong Kong dollars.

<HEADLINE> Higher Inflation for June Expected in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Inflation for June in the
Philippines would be higher than last month's 4.2 percent, which
was the lowest in 10 years, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Economic Development Cielito Habito said the
inflation rate was expected to rise during the month due to higher
spending brought about by the opening of schools.
</P>
<P>
He did not explain further whether food prices had any effects
on the expected higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, the month-to-month inflation would again start going
down during the second half of the year due to higher bases in the
third and fourth quarters last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The slightly higher inflation target for June is still within
the 6.4 percent target for the month, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this would not also distort the country's
inflation target for the full year of 5.2 to 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of the year, the country's
inflation averaged at 4.6 percent.

HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on the future
identity of Hong Kong athletes taking part in Olympic Games was
reached here today between the International Olympic Committee and
the Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong
(ASF&AMP;OC).
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch

to enable the people of Hong Kong to continue taking part in the
Olympic Games and generally in sports competitions everywhere as a
separate and independent entity."
</P>
<P>
The parties agreed that the ASF&AMP;OC will retain its recognition
as an NOC and will function according to the Olympic Charter.
</P>
<P>
In practice, the agreement provides that the Country (China) be
added to the Region "Hong Kong" in the designation of the ASF&AMP;OC;
Hong Kong will fly the flag of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region with a bauhinia in the center at all times.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese National Anthem will be played on
official occasions such as flag-raising and victory ceremonies;
the initials "HKG" will be maintained; and the emblem will feature
the flower Bauhinia with the Five Rings and the Chinese characters
of Hong Kong, China all within a circle followed by "HONG KONG"
with "CHINA" underneath.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch flew to Hong Kong yesterday after a meeting in
Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Peng and Wu Shaozu, minister of
the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Rises to 5 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
United States bounced to five percent in June after a 24-year low
in May, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the most dramatic evidence yet that the U.S. economy has
slowed from the quick growth pace of 5.9 percent in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. joblessness rate rose from 4.8 percent in May, the
lowest since late 1973, and 4.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The report said U.S. employers added seasonally adjusted
217,000 jobs to their payrolls in June. That was slightly less
than the 236,000 average for the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
About 151,000 of the jobs came in private industry. And an
increase of 82,000 state and local government jobs more than
offset a decline of 16,000 federal jobs.
</P>
<P>
Job growth in service industries, particularly health care,
slowed in June, compared with continued strong expansion in
computer services, engineering and management services.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the slowdown, the average factory workweek
edged down by a tenth of an hour to 41.9 hours. Overtime fell to
4.7 hours. But both remained near historic highs.
</P>
<P>
For whites, the jobless rate rose to 4.2 percent from four
percent in May. For blacks, it edged up to 10.4 percent from 10.3
percent and for Hispanics to 7.6 percent from 7.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks Russia to Help lift UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hammadi has called upon Russia
to help Iraq get the U.N. sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today that Hammadi, who
is now leading a delegation on a seven-day visit to Russia, made
this appeal in Moscow Wednesday during a meeting with Russian
First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Hammadi told Nemtsov that Iraq has met all its
commitments to the relevant U.N. resolutions related to the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
He said that now it is incumbent upon the U.N. Security
Council to lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Russians to talk to the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on Iraq to report Iraq's full cooperation in disarmament
to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Russian first deputy prime minister described his talks with
Hammadi as "intensive and meaningful."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the INA after the meeting, Nemtsov said
that the Russian government will keep its call to get the
sanctions on Iraq lifted and try to resume the trade and economic
relations between the two countries to the previous level prior
to the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Russian-Iraqi economic ties are "historical"
and the sanctions can not hold up Russian companies from doing
oil business with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N.-imposed sanctions for nearly
seven years. The sanctions can not be totally lifted before the
UNSCOM in charge of disarming the country releases a report to
certify that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM issues a report on the disarmament every two
months. It has always been accusing Iraq of still hiding a
considerable number of such weapons, which are denied by the
Iraqi government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is a
service-oriented one, Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition center, Tsang said that the service sector accounts for
over 83 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product and over 78
percent of the employment of the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the 9th largest service exporter, the largest
container port, the fifth largest center in external banking
transactions and foreign exchange transactions in the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that Hong Kong has a powerful and prosperous
service-oriented economy, and many of its service industries are
internationally competitive, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also at the briefing, Brian Stevenson, chairman of the Hong
Kong Coalition of Service Industries, outlined the key challenges
facing the service sector in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the competitiveness of the service sector, he said,
"We have to make better use of our existing land resources and
premises," to make greater use of technology to improve
efficiency, and to offer better service to customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Service industries should regulate their own operations by
ethical, legal and moral standards, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to optimize the potential afforded by the development
of the service industries in China's inland areas, "We must look
beyond China to the wider region and the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
At another press conference today, Chau Tak Hay, secretary for
Broadcasting, Culture and Sport, briefed reporters on the radio
and TV sector in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has become the southeast Asian regional headquarters
of many international broadcasters and TV stations, such as the
Cable News Network of the United States and the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the after Hong Kong's return to China, TV
stations in Hong Kong can still retain their English channels, as
a good English environment can help strengthen the region's status
as an international financial, shipping, trade and tourism center.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong To Shake Off Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Economically-developed Guangdong
Province in south China has sent 130,000 officials to
disadvantaged areas to help the 600,000 poor people there shake
off poverty by the end of this year -- three years ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The province has spent 230 million yuan on 220,000 poverty
relief projects since the beginning of the year. Each official
participating is charged with helping one of the 120,000 poor
families to get adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The most needy families were offered 1,000 yuan each to buy
chemical fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
And outside assistance for poverty relief is going strong, as
the eight coastal boomtowns, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Zhuhai, and Shantou, are helping 16 poor counties, while 100 rich
townships in the Pearl River Delta area are doing the same for
another 100 townships in the northern mountain area.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has spent four billion yuan over the past 12 years on
aid-the-poor programs, building 1,800 agricultural production
bases and lifting 3.4 million people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
China is fighting a nationwide anti-poverty campaign, in an
effort to help its remaining 58 million poor people have
sufficient food and clothing by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-Communist Parties Hail Jiang's Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Central committees of China's eight
non-Communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce have met over the past few days to discuss Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's three Hong Kong handover speeches made in
Hong Kong and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that President Jiang's speeches had declared
clearly the determination of the Chinese government and people to
stick to the socialist road and reunify the country in line with
the principle of "One country, two systems" conceived by late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and to safeguard regional and world
peace.
</P>
<P>
China now has eight non-Communist parties: the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League,
the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China
Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and
Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiu San
Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese
Kuomintang, said she believed that the "one country, two systems"
principle applied in Hong Kong has set an example for tackling
Macao and Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, daughter of a senior Kuomintang official, urged the
Taiwan authorities to treat Jiang's speeches seriously and make
positive responses.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jiaxi, a renowned scientist and chairman of the China
Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, called for greater efforts
to inspire patriotism in the people -- a point Jiang emphasized in
his speeches.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen education in patriotism among all the
people, and promote China's traditional virtues to rejuvenate the
country with a practical approach," he said.
</P>
<P>
All non-Communist parties urged their party members to study
Jiang's speeches and turned the encouraging words into action.

<HEADLINE> Gun-battle Follows Monarchy Rally in Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A gun-battle broke out in downtown
Tirana, on Thursday, soon after a rally and a march by supporters
of Albania's self-claimed king Leka, and at least one person
appeared to have been injured.
</P>
<P>
About 500 supporters of the self-claimed king marched from the
main Skanderbeg Square to the headquarters of the central
electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
Firing broke out as the marchers converged on the election
headquarters. Witnesses said the shooting, which carried on for
about 10 minutes, appeared to be aimed into the air.
</P>
<P>
The incident erupted as Albanians awaited the final results
from Sunday's parliamentary elections which officials hope can
help end months of chaos triggered by high-risk investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Leka has charged electoral fraud in the elections, which also
included a referendum on returning the monarchy to Albania. He has
insisted that monarchy was supported by the majority of the voters
in the referendum, but the central electoral commission said on
Wednesday about 35.7 percent voted in favour of this and some 64.2
percent against.
</P>
<P>
Leka, who has worked as a businessman in Johannesburg, South
Africa, is the son of an army officer who became Albania's king in
1928.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary election results showed that in Sunday's elections,
the Socialist Party defeated the Democratic Party of President
Sali Berisha. Berisha had already conceded defeat despite a second
round of voting on July 6.
</P>
<P>
And today, the president reiterated that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
"I will resign. I know you want a date, but it's very difficult
because there's a process involved," Berisha said at a news
conference. He pledged earlier this year that he would step down
if the rival Socialists won the elections.

HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market staged
an active performance on the first trading day after the
establishment of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on July
1.
</P>
<P>
This morning, some brokers on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange put
national flags on their desks, marking the start of the new era in
Hong kong.
</P>
<P>
After a five-day holiday, trading began at 10:00 AM with the
Hang Seng Index, the key indicator of blue chips, setting a record
of 15,345.
</P>
<P>
Soon after, it climbed to the daily high of 15,363 points. The
financial sector performed well, climbing to 18,779, a rise of 445
points over the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
However, trading fluctuated later because of investors' worries
about a change of the government policy on properties and closed
at 15,055, down 141 points from the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume was 24.5 billion HK dollars, close to

<HEADLINE> HK's Ties with Home of Terracotta Warriors Closer After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's state policy to boost the
development of west and central regions will further the economic
cooperation between the province of Shaanxi, home of the ancient
terracotta warriors, and Hong Kong after its return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Andong, governor of this northwest China's province,
recently told Xinhua that Shaanxi is abundant in natural and human
resources. "After the handover, the cooperation between the two
regions can speed up the commercialization of high-tech research
findings in Shaanxi. The province can also give play to Hong
Kong's role as an international trading hub," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong, regarded as a shopping paradise and the
world's culinary center, can enhance its tourist exchanges with
Shaanxi, which is "not just the home of terracotta warriors but
also the location of many other world-famous places of interest,"
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the air route between Xi'an and Hong
Kong will become more popular than ever.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international financial hub while Shaanxi is
the regional financial center in northwest China. The financial
exchanges between the two localities in the future can improve the
use of capital market for Shaanxi, "thus presenting a stronger
financial support for the development of the local economy," Cheng
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, a total of 1,280 enterprises with Hong
Kong investment had been registered in the province by 1996, with
an aggregate investment of 2.3 billion US dollars. The trade
volume between Shaanxi and Hong Kong hit 800 million dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Globalization Brings Opportunities and Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Wednesday that economic
globalization has opened new opportunities for investment and
growth in most developing countries, but also brought challenges
like marginalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a high-level discussion on Wednesday organized by
the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Camdessus
said challenges remain for both developing countries and the less
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"For emerging market economies, one problem was how to maintain
market confidence and deal with the economic policy complications
that often accompany large capital inflows," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For less developed countries, often ignored by the markets, an
important question was how to deal with marginalization,"
Camdessus continued.
</P>
<P>
The IMF head said the IMF shared the ECOSOC's aim of fostering
an enabling environment for development in its mandate and
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF's strategy started with helping countries
re-establish basic macroeconomic equilibrium and complete the
structural reforms needed to achieve a more efficient allocation
of resources and "jump-start" the engines of growth.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said an increasing number of countries had adopted
comprehensive programs of adjustment and reform in recent years,
many of them with IMF advice and support.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that a second generation of reforms was
necessary, including fiscal adjustment, bolder structural reforms,
better government and strengthened financial institutions, if
countries of all stages of development wanted to grasp the
opportunities of globalization and minimize the risks.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told the meeting the IMF and the World Bank had
recently begun to implement a strategy to resolve the external
debt problems of heavily indebted, low-income countries, including
their large multilateral debts.

TIRANA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
on Wednesday ordered the police to strengthen public security in
order to make sure of a smooth second round of the parliamentary
election, scheduled on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Fino issued the decree immediately after President Sali
Berisha, who is also commander-in-chief of the country's armed
forces, ordered the republican guardsmen to undertake the
responsibility of maintaining public order.
</P>
<P>
Fino criticized Berisha's deployment, saying the republican
guardsmen's duty is to protect the president, the prime minister
and the speaker of parliament, instead of maintaining public
order, which is the duty of the police.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that Berisha is still commander-in-chief of
Albania's armed forces, but this does not mean he can break the
rules," Fino said.
</P>
<P>
The central electoral commission was still busily working on
the result of the first round of the election, but in a televised
speech on Monday, Berisha conceded the defeat of his party.
</P>
<P>
The commission said counting was complete in 72 of 115
constituencies run by majority voting but could not say how many
seats had been won by each party. Run-offs in districts where no
candidate reached 50 percent will be held next Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies Shooting Dead Villagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities today denied
that they had shot dead 58 villagers in Shan state of the country
as claimed by the Shan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said a story by Reuters, entitled "Shan Rebels
Say SLORC Shot Dead 58 Villagers", appeared on July 2 in The
Nation, a Thai newspaper.
</P>
<P>
SLORC is an acronym for Myanmar's ruling State Law and Order
Restoration Council.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities said they believed the insurgents, from
a breakaway group of the former Mong Tai Army (MTA), are
deliberately spreading false information in a bid to cover up a
June 13 incident in which the group ambushed civilians, killing 25
of them and wounding five others.

<HEADLINE> Macao To Establish Special Body to Upgrade Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to establish a special
committee to help upgrade its traditional industrial sector with
new technology.
</P>
<P>
Today's Macao Daily News quoted Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira as saying that the government plans to establish a
Technology Reform Committee, which will take charge of making
policy to modernize Macao industry.
</P>
<P>
It said that the governor made this announcement at a two-day
seminar that ended today. But the governor did not elaborate when
the committee will come into being.
</P>
<P>
The proposed committee will be composed of government
departments, representatives of companies and other institutions
related to technology upgrading, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Macao's industrial sector, mainly textile and garment making,
has been challenged by strong competitors from neighboring
regions. Its toy-making industry is dying out.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Macao's industry is in desperate need of
technological upgrade to survive.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he hope the new committee will help local
firms get more access to new technology and data. He also hopes
that more private firms will join in the committee so that it can
work effectively.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is planning many work," he told those attending the
seminar at the University of Macao. "The work includes increase of
contacts with international institutions and the introduction of
new technology. I hope Macao can benefit from it," he added.

<HEADLINE> A Normal yet Special Day for Banks in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Banks in this international
financial hub has had a normal but special business day today,
which is the first working day after Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 a.m., half an hour prior to the business hour,
Alexander S K Au, vice-chairman and chief executive of the Hang
Seng Bank, the second largest in Hong Kong, entered into his
office.
</P>
<P>
"During the morning meeting, the first thing I did was to brief
the senior executives on the speeches made by President Jiang
Zemin and Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa during the celebration
ceremony for the inauguration of the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)," Au told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a very special day for Hong Kong since it marks a new
chapter for Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much encouraged by President Jiang's speech in which
he reiterated the "one country, two systems" concept, a "high
degree of autonomy", and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong, as
well as by Tung Chee Hwa's remarks that all the successful
formulas of Hong Kong will remain unchanged."
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that Hong Kong people will be fully capable
of rising to the challenges and build a brighter future, and my
colleagues also share my feeling", he said.

were seen forming long queues in rain, awaiting to buy gold and
silver handover commemorative coins issued by the People's Bank of
China.

<P>
"At least they have to queue for a dozen hours before getting a
serial number for the purchase, and actually many of them have
been here for more than 20 hours," said Yen Sai Change, manager of
Business Promotion Department of the PO Sang Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the limited issue, gold coins are actually only
available to a few lucky ones and most of the people can only buy
one silver coin for each", Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is worthwhile spending the time for the coin, since it is a
souvenir for the handover," said a young woman named Lee, who is
holding a baby in her arms.
</P>
<P>
Long queues also appeared in the business halls of major banks,
with all sorts of transaction, such as savings, lending, gold
trading and money changing being done in an orderly manner.
Friendly and polite service people are helping the clients in
Guangdong dialect, English and Putonghua (standard Chinese).
</P>
<P>
It is only normal for Hong Kongers to flock to banks after a
five-day holiday and in the beginning of a month, said Cecillia
Ko, a spokeswoman for the Hong Seng Bank and Dan Dan Chang,
External Relations manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
</P>
<P>
For Eddie T S Wang, assistant general manager and chief
executive officer China of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank,
described today as "an especially busy day".
</P>
<P>
"I've been kept receiving calls from clients who want to expand
 business in China, and this signals a good beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his bank's business momentum the interior
areas remains brisk.
</P>

seven branches, three representative offices and a sub-branch in
China.

branches and busy training personnel for the expansion of China
business", he said.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Down Sharply during Handover Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- No crimes were reported in the
seven hours of celebrations of Hong Kong's return to China on July
1, according to the Hong Kong police.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer said that police sent out nearly 5,000
police officers to maintain order during Hong Kong '97
Spectacular, a celebration event that drew 800,000 residents in
Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon alone, 500,000 more than the historical
record.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of crimes over the past three days was also
sharply lower than in normal times, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure security during the handover ceremonies, the police
started to make preparations more than a year ago, and purchased
and leased a large amount of advanced security equipment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
From June 30 to July 2, more than two thirds of the Hong Kong
police were mobilized for security during handover ceremony and
celebrations, 2,200 police officers were dispatched to the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center alone, the venue for the
handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that during the five-day public holiday for
the handover from June 28 to July 2, Hong Kong was constantly
drenched in torrential rains, which resulted in severe traffic
jams and caused bigger difficulties for the police to carry out
its duty.
</P>
<P>
But all police officers are in high spirits because everyone
wants to contribute to maintaining Hong Kong's stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> First Work Day of HKSAR Justice Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- "I am so excited," Elsie Leung
Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), told a roomful of journalists in
her office with a smile.
</P>
<P>
Leung, one of the three leading departmental secretaries of the
HKSAR government, arrived at her office in the Queensway
Government Offices building at 8 a.m. today, the first working day
after the establishment of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much time for you, because I have to visit all
the offices to meet every staff member of my department," Leung,
in a dark elegant suit, apologized to the reporters, who were busy
at shooting pictures.
</P>
<P>
Leung, a barrister, is the first Chinese as well as the first
female in the Hong Kong history to serve as head of the Department
of Justice, which is charge of providing legal advice for the
administration, drafting legal documents, lodging criminal
prosecutions and handling other legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Chinese and foreign journalists came to the
Department of Justice to cover its first working day. In order not
to disturb the work of the department, TV reporters had to wait
outside in the lift lobby, while print reporters were admitted
first.
</P>
<P>
S. Hoosain, chief information officer of the Secretary of
Justice's Office, gave his name cards to the reporters when they
entered the office area.
</P>
<P>
While one reporter said that he had already got his card
previously, Hoosain said seriously: "These are new ones -- I'm now
working with the HKSAR Department of Justice."
</P>
<P>
In every office with its door open, staff members were busy
working and didn't take a glance at the passing-by journalists.
</P>
<P>
"The nearly 1,000 staff members of our department all came to
work in time this morning," Hoosain said, "They are now busy
handling business piled up over the past five public holidays."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Law Officer Bob Allcock, who is a foreign national, told
the reporters that the legal system of the HKSAR would not
experience great changes in accordance with the Basic Law, and
that the Department of Justice would continue to serve the
community.
</P>
<P>
Allcock, who said he had cooperated with his new boss Elsie
Leung before in preparing the Reunification Bill, added that the
maintenance of Hong Kong's current bi-lingual legal system has
enabled non-Chinese-speaking foreign lawyers like him to continue
to work without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"For us, life and work will go on as usual," he said. "I will
continue working here as long as possible."
</P>
<P>
Information officer Hoosain said that a quarter of the nearly
300 government lawyers of the Department of Justice are foreign
nationals. Two of the five of Law Officers, who are next to the
Secretary of Justice in position, are foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
"All of them have retained their posts and will continue to
serve the SAR," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Smuggling Egyptian Antiquities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy here has denied any
involvement in the largest ever antiquities smuggling in Egypt,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Neither U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker nor any of his
predecessors have ever been involved in such operations," an
embassy source was quoted as saying. "This applies to all of the
present and former employees of the U.S. Embassy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian police have foiled an attempt to smuggle to
Switzerland a cache of 3,000-year-old antiquities which include
the head of a statue of Pharaoh Ahmose, the founder of the 18th
dynasty, and a rare collection of glassware.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers had tried to disguise the 210-kilogram
antiquities shipment as the personal belongings of the incumbent
U.S. Ambassador before it was intercepted by the Antiquities
Police and the Cairo Airport Police.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Interior Minister for Tourism and Antiquities Police
Mohammed el-Sham told a press conference Tuesday that
investigations showed that the smuggling gang including a custom
official forged letters from the U.S. Embassy and the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry and mentioned the name of Edward Walker in them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ali Hassan, the secretary-general of the Supreme
Council for Antiquities, told the press conference that the
recovered items will be put on display at the Egyptian Museum here.
</P>
<P>
Egypt bans the export of all antiquities but smuggling is
rampant.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Fails to Move on Rates, Australian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia's
(RBA's) failure to cut interest rates this morning spurred the
Australian dollar to a new high, but couldn't lift it above its
previous finish against its US counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 75.30 US cents, down
from yesterday's close of 75.48 US cents, but higher than its
opening level of 75.19. Overnight, it was traded as high as 78.56
US cents in London.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank's manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart
Moore said the local currency moved up to between 75.30 US cents
and 75.40 US cents this morning after the RBA, the central bank,
was silent on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The bank held its monthly board meeting on Tuesday and the
market has since been keeping an eye out for a possible
announcement on easing official cash rate. The bank eased rates to
5.5 percent on May 23 bringing in line with the US official rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank economist Michael Blythe said in a
statement that assuming the Australian dollar can successfully
navigate the next few weeks, interest rate fears are expected to
be appeased by the stronger activity that forward indicators
suggest is on the way.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was 86.13 yen from 86.47 yesterday, and
at 1.3102 marks from 1.3170.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
this afternoon with Juergen Sarrazin, chairman of the board of
directors of the Dresdner Bank Group of Germany, the first
financial institution from Germany and Europe to open a branch in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Premier spoke highly of the long-term fruitful cooperation
between China and the German Bank Group and congratulated on the
opening of the Bank's branch in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, with the growth in economic strength since the
introduction of reform and opening up policy, China's demand for
capital has been rising rapidly. As the biggest developing country
in the world, China does not only need to expand its domestic
financial and capital markets but also need to import a large
amount of foreign capital for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the Chinese and German sides would
further strengthen their financial cooperation and that Dresdner
Bank should take an active part in financing China's
infrastructural projects and technical transformation projects of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The German banker said that his bank has a close business
relationship with its Chinese counterparts, and the opening of the
bank's branch in Beijing will make it more favorable for the bank
to provide good and comprehensive service in financing,
consultation and training.
</P>

Sarrazin is here as a guest of China's Ministry of Finance.

to improve and expand trade and economic ties between Hong Kong
and Peru by regularly exchanging information and views on
expansion of trade and major economic and trade issues.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Wraps up Two-day Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt pledged to continue its
mediation efforts to revive the deadlocked Mideast peace process
as Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
wrapped up a two-day visit here today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here for Gaza after talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak at the presidential palace this morning, but he made
no remarks at the end of the 75-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
told reporters that the summit talks focused on the worsening
conditions in occupied lands and the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Egypt's contacts with Israel and the PNA will
continue, but stressed that the two sides have to exert more
efforts to move forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts will go on but the basis for their continuation
would depend on the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli contacts,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that contacts between the Palestinians and Israelis
will continue over some of the issues raised for discussion at the
negotiating table such as "confidence-building steps, settlements
and others."
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the results of these contacts," he said,
pointing out that conditions at present are "still the same."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he cannot predict at the moment if there will be "a
progress, an improvement or any new development."
</P>
<P>
International mediating efforts have failed to bring the two
sides back to the negotiating table three months after the Israeli
peace talks collapsed when Israel began building a new
neighborhood for Jews.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian teenager
in clashes over a disputed strip of land in the PNA-ruled Gaza,
while 37 Arabs were wounded during a protest against anti-Muslim
posters.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said Tuesday that Egypt would not for
the time being resume its negotiating efforts but contacts between
the two sides would materialize in progress soon.
</P>
<P>
"Let them work: I hope they can conclude something within one
week, 10 days," he told reporters during an inspection tour to the
western desert in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew here Wednesday night at the end of his brief
visits to France, Tunisia and Algeria, where he held talks on the
staggering Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit was aimed at briefing Mubarak on the details of
the present crisis facing the peace march in the region and
ongoing endeavors to get out of this crisis, PNA Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation Nabiel Shaath said in
statements today.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of holding a tri-partite summit
among Mubarak, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu within one week.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as the main mediator between the
Palestinians and Israelis over the past few weeks as a result of
what many Arabs perceive as a lack of U.S. interest in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has sent his senior advisor Osama el-Baz to shuttle
between the two sides several times in a bid to revive the peace
talks but the gap remains.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges Warring Afghan Factions to Take </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today urged the Afghan
Taliban militia and the opposition northern alliance to take some
confidence-building measures to remove the mistrust existing
between them.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are far apart, our effort is to try to narrow
their differences," said Iftikhar Murshed, Additional Secretary of
the Foreign Ministry, when briefing newsmen about his shuttle
diplomacy on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Murshed said he launched his shuttle diplomacy at the behest of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who wanted Afghan groups to sit across
a negotiating table to hammer out their differences.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great mistrust between them and there is a need for
taking confidence-building measures to bridge that gap," he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of his meetings with Afghan leaders, Murshed
said he met with a delegation of the north-based Afghan opposition
led by Younas Qanooni in Dubai on June 18.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition delegation, which included
representatives from the ousted Afghan government of Professor
Burhanuddin Rabbani, Hezb-e-Wehdat of Karim Khalili and
Jumbish-e-Milli of General Malik, proposed the formation of a
political commission to ponder over the establishment of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, he said, also proposed that the political
commission should meet in Kabul, for which the capital should be
demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
Murshed said he visited the Taliban leadership in Kandahar on
June 26 to convey the proposals of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's "Foreign Minister" Mulla Jalil and Acting
"President" Mulla Rabbani favored a peaceful political settlement
of the Afghan conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Taliban suggested that formation of any
political commission should be preceded by a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"How do you expect us to talk when rockets are falling around
us," he quoted Taliban officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban leaders also called for the release of
their prisoners including former "Foreign Minister" Mulla Ghous
and State Bank governor Mullah Ehsanullah.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani diplomat said the Afghan opposition confirmed
that the arrested Taliban officials are alive, and they promised
"to get back to us in a couple of days about their release."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Murshed said,
"I have got the impression they are agreeable to ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
"Each side says it will stop fighting if the other does so," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Museum Gets Face-Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Some of the world's most fascinating
antiquities are seeing the light of the day for the first time as
the Egyptian Museum began interior improvements to make itself a
better place for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made this summer to develop the Egyptian
Museum's second floor, where the treasures connected to the
family of Akhenaten (1370-1352 BC), the pharaoh famed for his
monotheistic beliefs are stored, Egyptian Al Ahram Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The mask of Yuya, Akhenaten's grandfather, has been restored
from the basement and put on permanent display for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The cartonnage-made mask, painted in gold and decorated with
semi-precious stones and colored glass, is one of the most
intriguing exhibits in the museum.
</P>
<P>
Another improvement in the museum is the renovation of two
jewelery rooms, where royal treasures from the three "great"
periods of Ancient Egyptian history, the Old, Middle and New
Kingdoms, are displayed.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to provide a new layout and decoration for
both chambers, as well as to install new lighting, ventilation
and air-conditioning systems, and specially designed showcases.
</P>
<P>
The project, carried out at the cost of 180,000 Egyptian
pounds (more than 52,900 U.S. dollars), is being financed by the
museum's budget, together with the donations of Egyptian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Museum is currently preparing for a major
overhaul of collection of Pharaoh Tutankhamun (who was during the
reign of 1361 BC to 1352 BC) in order to upgrade the displays
before next November's celebration of the 75th anniversary of the
discovery of the tomb by the British archaeologist, Howard Carter.
</P>
<P>
Experts in art, education and museum design from the Dutch
Cultural Foundation, and the American Research Center in Egypt
will collaborate to implement the project, scheduled to be
completed by November.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Museum houses a collection of paintings and
sculptures on the history of Egypt from the prehistoric periods,
ancient Egyptian, Greco-Roman, Coptic and Islamic to the
present.

COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30,000 tons of food and
other essential items worth 23.1 million US dollars were sent to
Sri Lanka's Northern Jaffna Peninsula during the last three
months, a military spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have waged a
14-year-old war for a separate state in the north and east of the
country. Government troops recaptured the peninsula in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, the spokesman said every effort
was made to ensure that the North was adequately supplied without
a break and the authorities in the North are satisfied with the
supply situation.
</P>
<P>
More shipments and lorry loads of goods will be sent to the
North in the coming weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a gesture of goodwill, the Jaffna Traders
Association has donated 2,300 kilograms of red onions produced in
Jaffna Peninsula for distribution to displaced families in the

world-acclaimed Chinese singers, musicians and dancers presented
solos, duet, Chinese folk dance "Peacock," pas de deux, and
concertos for cello, piano and violin.
</P>
<P>
A good combination of Chinese and Western music was
demonstrated by an erhu (a two-string Chinese instrument) concerto
of the Hungarian csardas, and violin concerto of the Chinese
romance Butterfly Lovers. Highlighting erhu and other Chinese
instruments, the orchestra also performed suite on themes of
Chinese folk music.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the area's magnificent climate, concerts are held at
the 75-year-old Bowl almost every evening throughout the summer,
together with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's traditional fireworks also had a Chinese meaning in
it: emerging from the smoke were the patterns of dragon and
phoenix, both Chinese mascots, as well as a bell tower and
pagoda. When the words "Bravo China" finally appeared on top of
the stage, the concert came to an end amid applause and music.
</P>
<P>
On the second floor of the theater, folk artists from China's
Shanghai gave a live performance of papercut, embroidery and
carving. Paintings by overseas Chinese artists also were
exhibited.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Situation in Malaysia Worrying: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS situation in Malaysia
is worrying, Malaysian AIDS Council President Marina Mahathir said
today.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of AIDS cases being detected is likely to
diminish the country's younger generation unless anti-AIDS
measures are effectively enforced, Marina said when launching an
AIDS Awareness Week organized by Malaya University.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21,026 HIV carriers and AIDS cases had been detected
since 1993 till last March, Marina said.
</P>
<P>
"These are reported cases, but there are probably many more
unreported," she said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting reports, Marina said some 300 AIDS and HIV cases were
detected each month, and the number rose to 380 last month.
</P>
<P>
Those within the 18 and 39 years age group accounted for the
largest number of the patients, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Council has devised various programs in its
fight against the killer disease, including a study on its effects
on the national economy and social life.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The fire that raged at
Terminal One departure hall of the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Subang this afternoon has been put out.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties, airport authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which occurred at 3:30 pm (local time) today, raged

<HEADLINE> Namibia Breweries Raps S. African for Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibia Breweries (Nambrew)
has accused South African Breweries (SAB) of dumping inferior
products on the Namibian market, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing on Wednesday in Windhoek, capital
of Namibia, Nambrew Managing Director Bernd Masche said the
accusation was referring to the SAB's recent introduction of a
non-returnable 750ml bottle into the Namibian market.
</P>
<P>
Mashce said the SAB bottles could be confused with Nambrew's
750ml returnable bottles, adding SAB's bottle were also made of
thinner glass, which could result in the bottles exploding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nambrew Marketing Director Ernst Ender said the
SAB's new bottles added a pollution factor, which he said was
highly irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to promote the returnable bottle concept in
Namibia, but now SAB has brought in a pollution factor. Their
adverts also don't say that the bottles are non-returnable," said
Ender.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports published on the Namibian newspapers
today, the new SAB bottles, which were only marketed in Namibia
and not in South Africa, would cause confusion in the local
market and lead to financial losses for Nambrew.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's Population Down; Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Central
Statistical Service (CSS) announced earlier that by last October
9, the population in the country was estimated about 37.9
million, which is lower than the 1991 official count.
</P>
<P>
The result of the latest census has apparently brought
surprise to many people, who expected the total population in
South Africa should be more than 42 million estimated five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Some people hailed the result as "good news indeed", saying
the population reduction would undoubtedly alleviate pressure
resulted from over population.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations last year, South Africa's
previous estimated population of 42.4 million would have grown to
71 million by 2025.
</P>
<P>
However, based on the new census, South Africa's population
will probably be something less than 65 million by the first
quarter of next century, census experts said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa used to be a country with high fertility rate.
Now, with an annual growth rate that has already been reduced to
22 percent, it is among the slowest growing nations in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
While satisfied with the current census results, the
authorities have warned that the downgrade of population should
not be used to lull people into false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
There is a great deal to be done, analysts said, not only to
further decelerate growth but to prepare for the growth-related
strains and stresses which assuredly await the country in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
It has been warned that growing illegal immigrants in South
Africa is making the country experience unprecedented
difficulties in employment, housing and education, etc.
</P>
<P>
South African Home Affairs Minister Mangosutho Buthelezi put
the number recently at five million aliens. But the police
believe that immigrants in the country stand somewhere between
four and nine million.
</P>
<P>
In fact, illegals are still pouring into the country, many
with false documentation, which no doubt has brought the
country's total population well over the 40 million, informed
sources warned.
</P>
<P>
However, the CSS said that despite some inaccuracy, the final
estimate of the total population may differ slightly from the
census result released a fews day ago.
</P>
<P>
The CSS officials also said that the preliminary estimate of
population would be helpful to the central government in
adjustment of financial planning.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A new territorial dispute has
emerged between Nigeria and Cameroun which have already engaged
in hostilities over the territorial sovereignty in the oil-rich
Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, Cameroun is
claiming the territorial sovereignty over the fertile Darak
Island in the northeastern state of Borno near Lake Chad.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has taken steps to defend the new case
of border dispute instituted against it by Cameroun at the
International Court of Justice, the official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A team of legal experts defending Nigeria in the case has
already visited Borno for a physical inspection of the disputed
island, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Darak case is the second instituted against Nigeria by
Cameroun after that of Bakassi Peninsula in the southeastern
border. Both countries have troops stationed in the peninsula, an
oil-rich territory of about 1,000 square km in the Gulf of
Guinea. Repeated clashes have been reported between the two
countries in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The Bakassi case is pending the judgement of the world court.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Form New Ties with Russia: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit of
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan to Russia is "part of
our efforts to forge new linkages with Russia," a Foreign Office
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about Gohar's visit to Russia, the
spokesman told a weekly news conference that it would be a two-day
working visit, which will take place on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>
"We considered Russia as an important neighbor of us and we
consider Russia a country who can play a very useful role in
maintenance of peace and stability in this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it is important for our government that came to
power a few months ago to establish an understanding with the
leadership in Russia as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
To another question, he said a Russian deputy foreign minister
during his recent visit to Pakistan gave a positive response to
Pakistan's proposal for holding a conference involving the
region's countries on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Afghanistan will figure in the foreign
minister's visit in Moscow," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed that Pakistan had carried out a
test of the Hataf missile, saying "it was a routine test and had
no military component."
</P>
<P>
The test was carried out by SUPARCO, a civilian organization,
whose activities were geared towards the civilian sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on a report that Pakistan test-fired the
Hataf-III missile, the spokesman said that the SUPARCO is engaged
in a peaceful research for the development of rocket motor
technology.
</P>
<P>
The organization carried out the routine test of rockets from
time to time and "these rockets are aimed at peaceful uses of this
particular technology", he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Turns Down Proposed Mediation in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A top Philippine government peace
negotiator today turned down a proposal by the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) for an independent foreign group to
mediate in the stalled peace talks between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"I do not approve of such proposal," Fortunato Abat, chairman
of the government peace negotiating panel, told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for that," said Abat, adding that the MILF
should return to the negotiating table and talk peace with the
government "if they want peace."
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, had
proposed that a foreign third party mediate in the peace talks
between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF panel has also asked that the peace talks be
postponed indefinitely, in view of the recent bloody clashes
between government troops and MILF forces in central Mindanao, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The battles between the military and the MILF broke out when
the MILF took hostage some 100 passengers of two buses and one
trailer along a main highway in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting also killed more than 100 rebels, soldiers
and civilians, forcing some 65,000 civilians to flee their homes
at the height of clashes.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives Message From Saudi Monarch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today received a message from King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz of Saudi
Arabia on coordinating Arab stance, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The message was handed over by Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal Al-Saud during his meeting with the president this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Faisal told reporters that the
message came within the context of sustained consultations and
coordination between the two countries regarding challenges facing
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi top diplomat played down the possibility of holding
an Arab summit in the face of the present deadlock in the Mideast
peace march, saying that the resolutions approved by the last
pan-Arab summit held here a year ago reflected a clear-cut Arab
stance on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Faisal made it clear that it is the Israeli policy, instead of
the Arab stance, that poses a major threat to the peace march and
poisons the necessary atmospheres for the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia does not seek adopting a certain stance regarding
any topic but rather it is the Israeli policy which poses a
threat," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister, who arrived here Wednesday night,
also met with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa. Later today,
they will co-chair the meetings of the Egyptian-Saudi Higher Joint
Committee, which are aimed at discussing cooperation between the
two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is Egypt's largest trade partner in the Arab
world, with the volume of trade exchange totaling 2 billion
Egyptian pounds (588 million U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also discussing the possibility of
setting up a trade free zone on the coast of Red Sea that will open
to all Arab investors.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Cautions on ECOMOG Strike against Koroma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A Liberian diplomat here has called
for caution in the proposed use of force by the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to oust coupists in Sierra Leone to
avoid spill-over to neighboring countries, local newspaper
Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG should assess its ability to carry out a "surgical
military operation" in Sierra Leone and take out its target
within a short period, said Sabato Wiah, press and cultural
counsellor of the Liberian Embassy to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) leaders to do their best to prevent a spill-over of the
crisis in Sierra Leone to Liberia, saying that the proliferation
of arms in that country could cause instability in Liberia
because the two countries share a common border.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, with more than 11,000 troops operating in Liberia for
about seven years, has tightened security corridors in the
country and put in place its security dragnet to prevent any
group from using the country's territory as a launching base.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiah said the porousity of most African borders,
including Liberia, should be of concern, adding that he preferred
the resolution of Sierra Leone's crisis in a manner that would
not create refugee problem in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS is in talks with Sierra Leone's military junta led by
Major Johnny Paul Koroma, which seized power in a coup on May 25.
According to a decision reached at an ECOWAS foreign ministers
meeting on June 26, an embargo and use of force will be
implemented to oust the junta if peaceful settlement cannot be
achieved during two weeks' talks.
</P>
<P>
Only two days ago, ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor
Malu said the sub-regional force was capable of flushing out the
coupists in Sierra Leone.

are being smuggled into Uganda every week, reported the local

</P>
<P>
Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Kingunge N.

people to do the same in the efforts to save the nation from
famine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwiru said 80 percent of peasants in Dodoma Region will not
harvest because there was insufficient rains. "I visited the
region last weekend," said the minister, adding, "there was no
hope to harvest enough food crops."

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Calls for Help For Least-Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Renato Ruggiero has called on major international
organizations to make further efforts to help least-developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a high-level discussion on Wednesday organized by
the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Ruggiero said that
more needed to be done to help least-developed countries foster an
enabling environment for development in the course of world
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral trading system was itself a key element in
fostering an enabling environment for development, Ruggiero told
the meeting. It helped all countries relate to the basic fact of
globalization within a framework which opened opportunities and
provided the security of agreed rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
"To fully reflect the interests and objectives of
least-developed countries, these countries have to be able to use
it (the multilateral trading system) fully," Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
"A key contribution of the WTO, working closely with the UNCTAD
(the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) and the
International Trade Center, is technical assistance for building
trade policy expertise in these countries. We are also employing
new technologies much more extensively to extend the reach and the
effectiveness of that assistance, and to make technical
information more relevant to specific economic needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The WTO, with the UNCTAD, the International Trade Center and
other major multilateral institutions, will organize a high-level
meeting for least-developed countries to forge an integrated
response to the challenges facing such countries, Ruggiero said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets New Date for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's presidential and
governorship elections have been rescheduled to come up on the
same day -- August 1, 1998, according to an adjusted transition
to civil rule timetable released on Wednesday in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the president will be sworn in and the
National Assembly inaugurated on October 1.
</P>
<P>
In the revised timetable, the National Assembly election has
been fixed for April 25, 1998, while the State Assembly elections
will take place on December 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Party primaries at state and national levels for the
nomination of governorship and presidential candidates are to be
held between June 8 and 20, next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the military administration's three-year
transition to civil rule program announced in October 1995,
governorship elections would take place in the fourth quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The five political parties registered in October last year,
together with the Transition Implementation Committee and the
National Electoral Commission of Nigeria, asked earlier this year
for a shift of governorship elections as it would be undemocratic
to have elected governors at the state level and the military at
the center.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Ruling Council, the highest decision-making
body of the country, gave its final approval to the proposal last
week.
</P>
<P>
The latest amendment is one of a series of changes to the
transition program. And the flexibility of the timetable has
aroused concern both at home and abroad over the genuine
intention of the military administration.
</P>
<P>
Although official explanation of the amendment is yet to come,
the authorities have repeatedly vowed the hand-over date of
October 1, 1998 will not change even if other things changed.
</P>
<P>
With many of the key items on the revised timetable having
specific time pegs on them, what is urgently needed is the
government's activities to keep faith with the present schedule.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia are holding talks
here to discuss an agreement on bilateral nuclear cooperation,
according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
The official English daily Tehran Times reported that the
agreement aims at exercising control and supervision of the
design and execution of the Bushehr atomic power plant.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the first round of the talks between the
two sides was held on Wednesday following the Russian delegation's
arrival Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention who heads the Russian
delegation. It said that the head of the Supreme Government
Atomic Supervision Organization of the Russian Federation arrived
in Tehran at the invitation of the Iran Atomic Energy
Organization.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, Iran and Russia signed the nuclear power
contract to complete a 1,000 megawatt power nuclear plant left
unfinished by a German company.
</P>
<P>
The 1 billion U.S.-dollar contract was signed here by Russian
Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov and Reza Amrollahi,
Iranian Vice-President and head of Atomic Energy Organization of
Iran (AEOI).
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Russia will help Iran complete the Bushehr
nuclear power plant in southern Iran by supplying equipment and
facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel for operation.
</P>
<P>
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov said on
June 24 this year that Russian contractors are proceeding with
a nuclear power plant commissioned by Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plant which is under construction in Bushehr
would be delivered to Iran on schedule. Russian contractors have
no problem with the building of the plant and the project is also
under the surveillance of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.

<P>
-- One day after the death of Hollywood star Robert Mitchum,
another legend of American movie, James Stewart, died on Wednesday
in Beverly Hills at 89. Stewart symbolized the idealism of the

</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Wednesday reached a compromise on whether France should continue the

alliance is held on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is more and more inclined to
raise taxes upon French enterprises in order to balance the budget.
The government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said on Wednesday
that the government could ``require the effort of enterprises which
have made profits'' to improve the situation of public financial
situation. The Paris Bourse reacted negatively to the news with its
CAC 40 index dropping by 1.17 percent Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes Attack Guerrilla South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out this
morning an air raid at suspected targets of Lebanese resistance
guerrillas in the Saida area in the western part of south Lebanon
without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli warplanes launched the
air raid at 5:40 a.m. local time (02:40 GMT) and fired two
air-to-surface missiles at the vicinities of Kfar Melki, 59
kilometers south of the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was the last of a series of exchange of fire
between Hezbollah guerrillas on the one side and the Israeli
forces and their client militia of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) on
the other since this week.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced
that its guerrillas fired a volley of Katyusha rockets at the
Israeli position of Demashigiyeh in Jezzine in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" over the night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio claimed that the Galilee panhandle in northern
Israel was hit by mortar shells this morning.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli warplanes launched an air raid on
Wednesday night at guerrilla targets in the eastern sector of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
General Amiran Livine, chief of Israel's Northern Command,
confirmed that dozens of mortar shells and probably Katyusha
rockets, were fired into the buffer zone in south Lebanon and
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
He warned of an escalated violence against south Lebanese
villages, threatening that the Israeli forces would not stand
with bound hand and foot if the guerrillas continued opening fire
from these villages.
</P>
<P>
Amid the escalating tensions, Lebanese guerrillas waged a
bombing attack on a convoy of the Israeli-backed SLA militia on
Wednesday night in Jezzine, where one SLA officer was killed and
three other militiamen were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israel radio also said that one guerrilla was killed and
several others wounded in a clash with the Israeli occupation
forces on Wednesday night near Maidoum, Western Beqqa.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that its fighters foiled an infiltrating attempt by
Israeli commandos in the Nabatiyeh area in western sector in the
south.
</P>
<P>
A civilian was injured Wednesday when dozens of shells
slammed into villages southeast of Nabatiyeh in retaliation of an
earlier resistance attack on an Israeli motorized patrol.
</P>
<P>
Five houses and five cars in Kfar Tibnit were also damaged as
Israeli gunners fired around 70 shells at the village and the
nearby areas of Arnoun and Yohmor, a Lebanese police spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Invents New Method to Diagnose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
invented a new method to distinguish between malignant and benign
tumors that may also help establish the prognosis of cancer and
monitor therapy's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The non-invasive method was developed by Professor Hadassa
Degani from the Weizman Institute, the July issue of the Nature
Medicine magzine published today reported in its cover story.
</P>
<P>
The method consists of injecting a contrast-enhancing dye-like
material into the patient's bloodstream and using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to follow the way this material is
absorbed and evacuated by the tumor. Because the uptake and
clearance differ in cancerous and benign tumors, such monitoring
makes a diagnosis possible.
</P>
<P>
A computer shows an image on a screen in various colors,
reflecting the distribution of the contrast material. The color
patterns for malignant and benign growths are strikingly
different, Degani said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the method thus could reduce the number of
biopsis performed to diagnose tumors. "Most breast tumors
detected by mammography prove to be benign in a biopsy, so that a
non-invasive method like MRI could help reduce the rate of
unnecessary procedures," Degani said.
</P>
<P>
The method could also tell doctors the prognosis of cancer
because it reveals tiny blood vessels that feed the cancer (in a
process called angiogenesis) and allow the tumor to grow and
spread. Knowing their density and ability to deliver materials to
the tumor may make it possible to determine the tumor's potential
aggressiveness, said Degani.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring the blood vessels and the spaces between cells may
also help evaluate the efficiency of treatment. A reduction in the
vessel's density and an increase in intra-cellular spaces could
point to successful therapy, She added.
</P>
<P>
In conventional MRI, signals emanating from the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms that make up water in the tissues are too weak to
produce a resolution comparable to that under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
But in Degani's method, resolution is very high because the
water-tissue signals are recorded over an extended period - two
to four minutes instead of the usual several seconds, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Goes Ahead With Regional Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 3 (Xinhua)-- Qatar will go ahead with
preparations to host the fourth Middle East and North Africa
Economic conference in November despite of pressure from other
Arab countries to cancel or postpone it, a local newspaper said
today.
</P>
<P>
"Our main task at present is to make arrangements for the
conference and we are going ahead with it," Gulf News quoted
Qatar's Minister of State For Foreign Affairs Ahmed bin Abdullah
al Mahmoud as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Qatar minister made the remarks Wednesday after signing a
contract with Qatar Airways appointing it as "official carrier"
for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who attended the Damascus Declaration meeting in
Syria last month, denied reports that the foreign ministers at the
meeting had opposed the holding of the conference due to take
place in the Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
"I personally attended that meeting and was happy at the
proceedings. The ministers did not take any such decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and some of other Arab countries have tried to mobilize
oppositon to the conference where Israel's participation is
expected, to protest against Israel's hardline policy in the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria boycotted the previous three because of Israel's
participation. It said that Israel should not obtain economic
rewards from such meetings.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said that it was not decided whether Israel will be
invited to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, we are only occupied with making
arrangements...invitations will go out only a few weeks before
the conference date," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has expected between 2,500 to 3,000 delegates from the
world including Israel to conference, saying the meeting is just
an economic forum.
</P>
<P>
"It is a purely economic forum and we expected Israel to
participate in it," a senior official in Qatar's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said in May.

product (GDP) this year, a local daily Sowetan reported today.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said on Wednesday that higher
export figures of 2.74 billion U.S. Dollars in May, and an
apparent downward trend of inflation figures currently at 9.5
percent, pointed towards better chances of the government to meet
its targets.
</P>
<P>
Manuel discounted recent criticism of the government's Growth,
Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy, saying the targets
of the GEAR were still on track, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that there was an urgent need to,
among other things, accelerate employment creation as well as to
reverse income and wealth inequalities, which he said was
characteristic of the apartheid economy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government is still facing the tough task
of achieving a four percent deficit target after last year's
deficit rose to 5.6 percent of the GDP, defeating earlier
projections in the process, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Better Phone Service for Scenic City in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou, in east China's Jiangsu
province, has been modernizing its telecommunications network to
provide better service, according to Wang Jirong, director of the
Bureau of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
It now has computer-controlled switchboards capable of handling
two million lines at once. By the year 2000, there are expected to
be 50 telephone lines per 100 persons, and the city will have
computer-controlled switchboards with a combined handling capacity
of 2.5 million lines.
</P>
<P>
Phone service is available in the city's 1,107 villages, and
there are 15.59 telephones per 100 people in rural areas. Taicang
City, which is under Suzhou's jurisdiction, is China's first
county-level city with telephone service available everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou Industrial Park, a Sino-Singaporean joint venture, and a
local new development area have caused the city to pay greater
attention to its telecommunications infrastructure for a better
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Switchboards capable of handling 46,000 lines have been
installed for the two development areas. The telecommunications
network for Suzhou Industrial Park is of the highest level,
providing video phone, home PC, and cable TV network services.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province has a highly developed rural industry, and
living standards there, especially for villagers, are higher than
many parts of the rest of the country. Suzhou is a
prefecture-level city that used to be referred to as "paradise on
earth". It and Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, were
known for their uniquely beautiful scenery.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Banks in Africa Said Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The privatization and
restructuring of banks in Africa in recent years have proved
successful, reports from the on-going first Commonwealth African
banking policy seminar today quoted Kenyan bankers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Executives of two banks in Kenya told the seminar in Mombasa
Wednesday that plans to privatize their banks have led to floated
shares being oversubscribed and the better performance of their
banks.
</P>
<P>
"Having gone public for the last three years, the National
Bank of Kenya (NBK) has continued to record good performance with
impressive growth in profits and assets," NBK Executive Chairman
NBK John Simba said.
</P>
<P>
The financial results of the NBK, the fourth largest bank in
Kenya, recorded an increase of 42.7 percent in 1996 compared with
the previous year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Deposits also increased by 37 percent and these are
indications that the bank has a clear vision in its business,"
Simba said.
</P>
<P>
"A bank changing from state-owned to private-owned needs to
become more market-oriented and customer-focused," he noted.
</P>
<P>
State-owned banks in Africa require detailed transformations
when changing to private ownership and need to streamline their
operation systems, re-package existing and introduce new
products, plus initiating a cultural overhaul, he said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman of the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) A. T.
Kaminchia said in a paper presented to the seminar that the
success of the privatization process in his bank was based on the
1996 sale of 11.8 million KCB's governmental shares.
</P>
<P>
"This share issue is important because it satisfied 97 percent
of applicants and it attracted record amounts from foreign
institutional investors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Issues Ultimatum to PNA to Quell Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel has issued an ultimatum
to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) demanding an end to
the escalation of Palestinian violence in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued overnight to the PNA by Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai through the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that Israeli forces would react with an "iron
fist" policy, unless the Palestinian police intervened to quell
the confrontations in Hebron and Gaza Strip,
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Ministry officials also warned that the recent
escalation of Palestinian violence in the West Bank city of
Hebron could jeopardize the efforts to resume the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani also demanded the
Palestinian police to put an end to the violence, otherwise
Israel would change its tactics in dealing with the
stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Knesset (Israeli parliament) Wednesday,
Foreign Minister David Levy also urged the PNA to halt the
violence. "It (Israel) can not tolerate such things," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warning came in the wake of escalation of
Palestinian-Israeli violence in Hebron and Gaza Strip Wednesday,
where Palestinians threw stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in response. Some
reports said Israel deployed snipers on rooftops in Hebron to
shoot Palestinian demonstrators in the legs.
</P>
<P>
At least 38 Palestinians and one Israeli policeman were
injuried in Hebron. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one
seriously, in Tuesday's clash in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Clashes also erupted near the Gush Katif settlement in the
Gaza Strip, leading to one Palestinian youth killed and six
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence was sparked by the provocative
leaflets posted in Hebron area by a Jewish woman from Jerusalem,
which depicted the Islamic prophet Mohammed as a pig.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli and Palestinian security officials continued
efforts to resume the security cooperation despite the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak held a meeting in
Gaza Wednesday with PNA preventive security chief Mohammed
Dahlan.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security chief in the West Bank Jibril Rajoub
toured Hebron Wednesday, warning that the Hebron situation would
explode if the stalemate in the peace process continued.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have been deadlocked since March
when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State in the
President's Office for Planning and Investments Ali Juma Shambuna
has urged that donor assistance toward poverty eradication
programs should be unconditional and free from political strings.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Zanzibar, opening a
two-day seminar on poverty alleviation whose theme is "Building
government - NGO Alliance in Poverty Alleviation" in the town of
Zanzibar on Wednesday, Shambuna said more support should be
sought to assist in our poverty alleviation projects.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that such assistance should be given in
good faith and free from any conditions, including political
strings.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the seminar participants, drawn from various
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), government departments,
religious leaders, donors and the private sector, that the
Zanzibar Revolutionary Government will continue to give priority
to all poverty eradication programs.
</P>
<P>
He said despite all efforts made so far, poverty was still a
big problem in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that the government would eliminate
hurdles likely to hamper implementation of poverty eradication
programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged all parties involved in the programs to
chart better policies and strategies to ensure success.
</P>
<P>
It was only through collective efforts and through close
cooperation between the government and NGOs that poverty
eradication programs could make any notable achievements, the
minister stressed.

Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen also expressed his
excitement to work for the HKSAR, and said he believed that with

<HEADLINE> Increasing Urban Population Causes Problems in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Increasing rural Malawians leaving
their rural areas for towns are causing a series of problems such
as malaria.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the center for Social Research and the
United Nations Children's Fund, Malawi's urban population is
growing by five to 15 percent a year compared with the national
population growth rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that 2,000 people are coming to live in the towns
each week and that within the next three years 30 percent of the
population will be in the four major towns of Mzuzu, Lilongwe,
Blantyre and Zomba of the country.
</P>
<P>
The surge to the towns has led to the growth of squatter camps
and caused government concern.
</P>
<P>
The main problem is a lack of basic social amenities such safe
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions have made squatter dwellers prone to a number
of preventable infections such as cholera, diarrhoea and
malaria," said a chief researcher for the study.
</P>
<P>
He also notes that there is also very little access to schools
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Because there are very few jobs families have been reduced to
begging, prostitution and stealing.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges ASEAN to Attract More Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines today urged the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to
consolidate themselves economically to attract more investments
inflows.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 4th meeting of ASEAN heads of investment
agencies held here, Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar
Bautista said the agencies must start working now to strengthen
the region's competitive position on the global market.
</P>
<P>
"While the initial step in our ASEAN borderlessness experience
has been successful in trade, this time around, we should look for
the same success in the field of investments," Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ASEAN investment agencies can be instrumental
in attracting the types of investments that can serve as vital
tools for bringing economic vitality in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, he said, benefited from growing intra-ASEAN
investments where 31 percent of the total investments from 1991 to
1996 came from ASEAN partners.
</P>
<P>
In the area of trade flows, Bautista said, the country's trade
with ASEAN partners accounted for 12.5 percent in 1996 from 7.7
percent in 1992 in its overall trade worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Economically stronger ASEAN countries must support weaker
economies to enable them to gain strength, become integrated and
benefit from the mainstream of ASEAN economic vitality, Bautista
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifty members of the Provisional
Urban Council were sworn in here today, the first working day
after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 this morning, Dr. Ronald Leung, chairman of the
pre-handover Urban Council, arrived at the Urban Council Chamber
in central district to become the first to pledge his allegiance
to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
With right hand up, he uttered the oath: "I take the office as
member of the Provisional Urban Council upon myself and will duly
and faithfully fulfill the duties of the office according to the
best of my ability." Leung also promised to uphold the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In the same place, 37 members of the interim body had taken the
oaths of office before 10:15 am today, while 13 had sworn the
oaths in various districts in Hong Kong. All the 50 members were
appointed in June by the HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
As an interim arrangement, the Provisional Urban Council was
formed in order to fill a vacuum in the district organization
since the pre-handover Urban Council ceased to function on June
30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Urban Council consists of no more than 50
members and serves no later than December 31, 1999. The interim
district organization provides municipal services to some 3.3
million people in the urban areas, or half of the population of
Hong Kong. It plays a key role in safeguarding environmental
hygiene and public health, as well as providing cultural programs
and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
Following the swearing-in ceremony, all the 50 members cast
secret ballots to elect Dr. Ronald Leung and Ip Kwok Cheung as
chairman and vice chairman of the Provisional Urban Council.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Refugees in Zambia Longing for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ngaule Mwambi is extremely
concerned about the new development in his home in Zaire, now the
Democratic Republic of Congo, hoping the vulnerable peace will be
consolidated so that he can return and start a new life there.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his family members are living an unhappy life
in the Meheba Refugee Settlement in the Northwestern Province of
Zambia, 700 kilometers from Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Because of too much rainfall during the last crop season, they
now have not enough food and no money for clothes and blankets as
it is getting cold.
</P>
<P>
Mwambi and 12 other family members fled the bloody tribal
strife in their home town to Zambia in 1994. Mwambi is wondering
what has happened to two of his daughters and their family
members, who failed to flee to Zambia together with him.
</P>
<P>
Meheba Refugee Settlement was established in 1971, mainly for
Angolan refugees fleeing the Angolan liberation war. At its
inception, the settlement had a population of 8,000, while
today's population tops 31,500 comprising various nationalities,
including about 28,000 Angolans, 3,400 Zaireans and 184 Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are engaged in farming as each family is
allocated 2.5 hectares of land as well as some tools and seeds
upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Most crops are doing well, particularly maize, cassava, sweet
potatoes, and a variety of vegetables. The refugees sell their
surplus products within and outside the settlement.
</P>
<P>
In the settlement, there are five primary schools, one
secondary school and five clinics set up by the Zambian
government, which also pays the teachers, doctors and nurses it
installed to work there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the implementation of care and maintenance
programs, some international organizations such as the UNHCR have
completed preparations for repatriation of Angolans and some
16,000 Angolan refugees have expressed their intention to return
this year.
</P>
<P>
All the refugees in the settlement are longing for peace so
that they return. "Here is not our territory, not our homes,"
they answered, when asked if they want to return to their home
country.
</P>
<P>
Old man Kamanda Timotee told Xinhua that 10 of his family
members were killed in the tribal conflict in formerly Zaire and
the survivors fled to Zambia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A former Zairean university student, Luku George, fled alone
to Zambia in April this year when fierce fightings broke out
between the forces led by Laurent Kabila and Mobutu Sese Seko's
troops.
</P>
<P>
He said he is missing his parents and wants to continue his
study but cannot do so because peace has not been really achieved
in his country. He does not know what to do, complaining there is
nowhere to stay, no job and no alternative but to stay in the
refugee settlement.
</P>
<P>
Angolan refugee Madeus Kahaku is good at agricultural
production and his family lives faily well on what the plot of
land they own can produce. He said although they have a good life
there, they want to return to Angola, build new houses and start
a new life when peace is consolidated.
</P>
<P>
Another Angolan refugee who has been in the settlement for
over 10 years frowned on the word of refugees, saying it is a
"bad word, I don't want the label of refugee. I want to go home
after peace is won."
</P>
<P>
Gahigi Elen, along with her sister and mother fled to Zambia
from Rwanda in 1996. Elen's father is Tutsi while her mother,
Hutu. Her father and other family members of her four brothers
and three sisters were massacred in the ethnic conflicts between
Tutsis and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
She said both tribes consider them alien and try to kill them.
Elen, who is employed in the guest house of the settlement, said
at present she doesn't want to return to her home country,
alleging that killings are still going on there.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The general inflationary trend
that has been on the rise in Kenya since the beginning of this
year came down by 4.4 percentage points to 12.8 percent in June
compared with 17.2 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation in Kenya also dropped from 6.93
percent in May to 4.76 percent in June, according to the lastest
report released by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quarterly underlying inflation in the eastern
African country saw a reduction of 1.14 percentage points to 1.44
percent in June, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The current downward trend is caused by the fact that the
January-March severe drought has eased off, the recovery in food
supply following the arrival of rains and the containment of
monetary expansion by the government, said the report.
</P>
<P>
On interest rates, the report revealed that the yield rate on
the government's 91-day Treasury bill fell by 0.25 percentage
points to close at 18.96 from 19.25 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly yield on the bills was also lower by 0.91
percent to 19.44 percent last month compared to 20.35 percent the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, the lending rates by commercial banks persistently
remain high, said the report.

HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
announced that it will continue the multi-million Dollar child

this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps told a
meeting of donors who help the government fund the program on
Wednesday that at least 416,667 children countrywide would be
given supplementary feeding during the 18-month financial year
which started on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "the government intends to continue
supplementary feeding in areas affected by localized droughts,
water-logging, pests and crop diseases."
</P>
<P>
He said, "no child should be allowed to suffer from hunger and
malnutrition in Zimbabwe when there is a localized drought just
because in some areas there are bumper harvests."
</P>
<P>
During drought years, the government had been giving rural
children under the age of five daily food supplement.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.2 million children benefited from the program
during the 1995 drought, and another half a million were
registered as beneficiaries during the 1996-97 phase

HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has warned that Zimbabwe has a lot to learn from
challenges coming from globalization and competition as its
economy becomes more market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
UNDP resident representative Carlos Lopes said on Wednesday
the world is witnessing remarkable convergence of opinion on
challenges and potential solutions facing decision-maker despite
obvious and continued differences between nations and regions.
</P>
<P>
"As most developing economies, especially those in sub-Saharan
Africa, adopt market-based economic systems, the behavior of
local business entities are increasingly determined and
influenced by events and trends at the global level," he told a
joint Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe and Friedrich Nauman
Foundation seminar on human resources.
</P>
<P>
He said there is now a growing recognition, in both public and
private sectors, of crucial linkages between economic growth,
human development, social cohesion and environmental
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
He added there is equally strong recognition that the new
global challenges could no longer be tackled by rules of
government alone as there is growing importance of the private
sector and good corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "business leaders, like their political
counterparts, are facing a period of unprecedented change and
complexity. Geo-political transformation and increasing
integration of the world, accompanied by the emergence of new
technologies, markets and competitors are creating threats and
opportunities for business which were unthought of the years
ago."

<HEADLINE> Manila Calls for Resumption of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A top Philippine government peace
negotiator today called for the resumption of peace talks between
the government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
However, government chief peace negotiator Fortunato Abat said,
the resumption of talks will depend on the decision of the MILF to
return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio station, Abat said the peace talks
will only resume if the MILF "calls for it first."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is only logical for the MILF to make the first
move since "it is the one which called-off the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"The government is only waiting until they are ready," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abat also reiterated that last week's military operations in
the southern provinces of North Cotabato and Maguindanao were not
directed to the MILF but to kidnap-for-ransom groups.
</P>
<P>
The MILF called off the six-round of its low-level peace talks
with the government scheduled for the end of June after the
military launched an all-out assault against it in Central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maguidanao Governor Zacaria Candao, a former MILF
leader, said the MILF agreed to talk to him this coming July 5 to
discuss a possible schedule for the resumption of peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say that the MILF has not changed its position
to continue talking with the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by Ghadzali Jaafar and Al Haj
Murad, MILF vice chairmen for political and military affairs
respectively, and other central committee members.
</P>
<P>
Candao said he will also ask the MILF in their meeting to
cooperate in the government's anti-kidnapping campaign in Central
Mindanao to finally erase doubts on their alleged connections with
lawless elements in the area.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's PAC Registers Name and Logos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) of South Africa has registered its name as a trademark with
the registrar of trade names in Pretoria, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
PAC General Secretary Mike Muendane was quoted as saying the
move would ensure that disgruntled and expelled members of the
PAC be barred from using the party's symbols.
</P>
<P>
The move would also effectively ensure that former PAC leader,
including its former president Clarence Makwetu not use logos and
phrases protected by the law, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Symbols that may not be used without the mandated authority of
the PAC leadership include the party's logo, its slogans, the
flag and all other distinguishing features and phrases
traditionally associated with the PAC.
</P>
<P>
Muendane said the PAC leadership would fight tooth and nail to
ensure that discredited "elements" within the party not be given
an opportunity to destabilize the organization.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, he warned that the PAC would act ruthlessly
against former members who illegally used the party's symbols.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Opening-up Goes Deeper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Overseas financial institutions
have become an important component of the Chinese banking system
as financial opening-up goes deeper in China, according to a
senior central bank official.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable progress in opening its financial
sector to the rest of the world since it first allowed an overseas
bank to set up a representative office in Beijing in 1979, Chen
Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, said at a
recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
"To date overseas financial institutions have become an
important part of China's banking system, either in terms of their
number and business scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's cabinet, has designated 24 special
economic zones and cities where overseas financial institutions
are allowed to set up operational agencies.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that overseas financial institutions had
established a total of 527 representative offices in China by the
end of last year, which include 288 by overseas banks, 152 by
insurance companies and 53 by securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The number of operational overseas financial institutions in
China reached 156 by the end of 1996, including 131 banks, 11
overseas-funded banks registered in China, five financial
companies, eight insurance companies and one Sino-overseas
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
The 131 overseas banks have been set up by 63 banks in 16
countries and regions. In terms of number of bank branches in
China, Japan led all other countries and regions with 29, followed
by Hong Kong's 25 and France's 15.

Shanghai, the country's leading economic and commercial center,
has the greatest concentration of overseas bank branches with
37. The special economic zone of Shenzhen, neighboring Hong Kong,
and Guangzhou, capital city of south China's Guangdong Province,
have the second and third largest number of overseas banks, with
24 and 13 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that overseas banks play an important role in making
investment capital from overseas sources available to China's
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the 140 overseas banks operating
at the end of last year had assets totalling 29.9 billion US
dollars, up 56 percent on the previous year. Their outstanding
loans and deposits rose by 53 and 24 percent on a yearly basis to
19.4 billion and 3.9 billion US dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks now account for 3.13 percent of China's total
financial assets and nearly 14.2 percent of the foreign exchange
assets of Chinese financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that overseas banks can generally begin making
profits after their initial two years of operation. Providing
loans to their clients, mainly solid overseas-funded enterprises,
is a low risk business.
</P>
<P>
Post-tax profits of overseas banks jumped 31 percent last year
to 183 million US dollars, according to official statistics.

<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today held talks with visiting Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori on anti-terrorism, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways to prevent recurrence of
terrorist acts such as the four-month hostage crisis at the
Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima last year.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about safety measures for Japanese nationals
and companies operating in Peru, Kyodo quoted officials as saying.

Hashimoto told Fujimori that Japan will provide Peru with some
42.6 billion Japanese yen (about 380 million U.S. dollars) in
low-interet loans for infrastructure projects, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders agreed to strengthen relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants to Peru, arrived in

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Enforces Half-day Strike Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) today enforced a countrywide half-day
strike to protest what it termed anti-people and anti-investment
national budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year, which was passed in
Parliament on June 30.
</P>
<P>
It was the second major anti-government street protest against
the one-year-old government of Awami (people's) League (AL). The
BNP first enforced a half-day strike on March 23 across the
country to protest, among other issues, the government's pro-India
policy.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said more than 5,000 security forces,
comprising armed police and paramilitary forces, have been
deployed at different strategic points of the capital Dhaka to
maintain order during strike time.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia, Chairperson of the BNP, in a statement called upon
the countrymen to observe the strike and build a strong resistance
against imposition of taxloads in the budget.
</P>
<P>
She said the government imposed heavy tax and all-grabbing
surcharge on essentials. The ruling party hatched conspiracy to
make the country dependent on others and jeopardize the economy by
imposing new and extended taxes on industrial raw materials,
machinery and spares, she alleged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AL General Secretary Zillur Rahman Wednesday accused
the BNP of conducting a "false and shameless campaign" against the
budget in a bid to mislead the people.
</P>
<P>
"They (BNP) are calling it a budget to kill the people while
the budget has given maximum protection to the interests of the
common masses," he told a big rally in Dhaka on Wednesday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> South-South Mayors Conference Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A four-day South-South Mayors
Conference opened here today to develop solutions for the cities
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
About 300 city leaders and planners from countries in the South
are attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on quality urban life is being held alongside the
conference with more than 120 companies from 13 countries taking
part.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the conference, Malaysia's acting Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim highlighted the daunting challenge of nurturing
caring cities in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the mayors from South-South countries is to
prevent cities in the South from growing into "brutal, cold and
menacing" metropolises, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
A city must be geared to meet the needs of the teeming
multitude rather than the privileged few, he said, adding that
thus education and health care for all, public housing, public
transportation, public recreational facilities must take
precedence.
</P>
<P>
He said the re-greening of cities today was not only for beauty
sake but has become a matter of psychological necessity.
</P>
<P>
He said "to bring nature into city and creating city within a
garden will restore man's relationship with nature and create the
ambiance for the renewal of human society."
</P>
<P>
"We must take our cities into the frontier of technological
discovery. We must discard the attitude of merely trying to catch
up with cities in the North," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Gainers, Losers From Baht Floatation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- There will be gainers and losers
after the government put into force the decision to float the Thai
currency on July 2.
</P>
<P>
The floatation will lead to devaluation of the baht and will
first of all benefit Thai exporters of agricultural products and
other goods with low import content.
</P>
<P>
Thai businesses investing overseas will bring home more money
in terms of the baht.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors may find investment in Thailand less costly
and more profitable because of the floated exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry will gain as foreign tourists will find
Thailand a cheaper destination to visit as their currency will
exchange for more Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai importers will have to pay more for their
purchases from abroad: industries heavily reliant on imported raw
materials, goods and capital will suffer as they must pay more in
terms of baht.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand will pay an estimated 700 million US dollars more
for imported petroleum this year, big users of energy are bound to
have more bills to pay.
</P>
<P>
Firms with high unhedged foreign loan exposure are likely to
face severe repayment problems as costs soar in the wake of the
baht's managed float. In this aspect, the Thai private sector has
about 60-80 billion dollars or the equivalent outstanding in
foreign currency loans, with many unhedged against currency
fluctuations after years of the baht being virtually fixed by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors in Thailand repatriating profits abroad will
have to pay more for the foreign currency they buy.
</P>
<P>
Thai people will think twice before they book air tickets for
overseas trips, as they will have to pay more because of the
weaker baht.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said Thailand will gain in the
long run as the baht floatation would mean a healthier economy and
more cash would flow into the country.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating, he said that in the past when the US dollar was
weak, Thailand, which had pegged its exchange rate system to the
basket of currencies largely dominated by the dollar, benefited as
foreign investors were attracted to set up production bases in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, lately the baht appreciated when the dollar
strengthened against other major currencies, slowing capital
inflow into Thailand.

<HEADLINE> India's Cotton Textiles Exports up By 20 Percent </HEADLINE>

NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua)-- India's export of cotton textiles
registered a 20 percent increase in US dollar terms during the
first two months of the current financial year starting April 1
over the same period of the previous year, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
And textiles exports between January and May this year rose by
29 percent, touching 55.86 billion rupees (1.574 billion US
dollars) against 43.26 billion rupees (1.22 billion US dollars)
recorded in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cotton yarn export, which has been witnessing a
buoyant trend since the last three years, increased by more than
50 percent during January-May and accounted for 47 percent of the
cotton textiles exports, which include fabrics, sewing thread and
made-ups.
</P>
<P>
Exports of cotton made-ups comprised 21 percent of the total
cotton textiles export and it went up from 9.83 billion rupees
(276.90 million US dollars) to 11.97 billion rupees (337.18
million US dollars) during the first five months of the annual
year.
</P>
<P>
Cotton fabrics exports also rose by 13 percent during the first
two months of the current financial year.

<HEADLINE> India Government to Go Ahead With Wheat Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government would go
ahead with the import of contracted wheat despite high estimates
for domestic output during the 1996-97 crop year, Agriculture
Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Although over one million tonnes of wheat have arrived in the
country, it has been decided to import the targeted two million
tonnes of wheat. The priority of the government is to ensure
abundance foodgrain stock in the country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra has made it clear that
the government would not hesitate to think in terms of import of
wheat during 1997-98 if it was confronted with the problem of
black marketing and hoarding.
</P>
<P>
Although there would be no need to import wheat this year to
help sustain the public distribution system, the government could
still import wheat if market prices were manipulated beyond
reasonable levels, the minister has said.
</P>
<P>
India's wheat production stood at 65.77 million tonnes during
1994-95, but declined to 62.62 million tonnes during 1995-96,
which was one of the major factors for the government decision on
wheat imports, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> KEDO to Start Building Nuclear Reactors for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) today signed an agreement in New York, giving
the go-ahead to the building of two nuclear reactors in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was the culmination of two years of negotiations
between the DPRK and KEDO following a 4.5 billion U.S.-dollar
framework agreement signed in Geneva in 1994 between Washington
and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Under today's agreement, KEDO, an international consortium
based in New York, is providing two 1,000-megawatt light-water
nuclear reactors in exchange for a pledge by the DPRK to freeze
its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The project is to be started in August and is expected to be
completed by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will bear most of the cost of the project, now
estimated at some 5 billion dollars, KEDO officials said.
</P>
<P>
Executive director of the consortium, Stephen Bosworth, said
the agreement resolved technical details about the project, such
as transport, labor, customs, communications, medical and
financial services.
</P>
<P>
Working out the practical arrangements has been difficult
because the project is not only commercially complicated, but also
politically sensitive, Bosworth said.
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established in 1995 in New York to implement the 1994
framework agreement between the DPRK and the United
States. Members of KEDO include the United States, South Korea,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and some European Union
states.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Baht's Value Plunges After Allowed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- After the Thai central bank's
announcement on Wednesday morning to allow the Thai currency to
float, the baht's value plunged from about 26 baht to the US
dollar on Monday, to 30.36 baht at its peak on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local baht trading was volatile, with many banks suspending
trade because of the lack of a benchmark midrate, which had been
fixed on a day-to-day basis by the central bank until June 30.
</P>
<P>
Some commercial banks quoted the baht at 29.80 per dollar, down
about 15 percent in value, before easing to 27.50.
</P>
<P>
Chaos reigned in some banks, where tellers refused to exchange
baht for foreign currency while tourists fumed.
</P>
<P>
The currency is expected to swing wildly for a few days, but
the authorities are banking on a cheaper baht to stimulate
exports, along with a return of investor confidence in an economy
that analysts said "had lost its way".
</P>
<P>
The decision on a "managed float" of the baht came after the
prime minister and the Bank of Thailand had repeatedly insisted
that the baht would not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand had spent about 6 billion dollars out of
its 39 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves in recent
months to defend the currency against speculators.
</P>
<P>
The decision to let the baht move with real market forces put
an end to the 13-year-old exchange rate system, in which the baht
was pegged to the basket of currencies dominated by the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Although a "managed float" is not a devaluation, the baht has
depreciated strongly on the first day of the baht seeking its real
value.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors welcomed the baht devaluation, with the
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 41.51 points, or 7.8
percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Defending the new move, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
said, "we have been through the illusion for far too long. Now we
must adjust to reality."

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- More fossils, which were found in
Myanmar by four individuals, have been handed to the authorities
for paleontologists to study, official paper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fossils included modern age elephant molar, crocodile bone,
mammal leg bone, ox molars, goat lower jaw and molar and turtle's
shell.
</P>
<P>
Experts at home and abroad are being encouraged and supported
by the government for exploration of fossils to link up the
history of Myanmar, disclosed Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt who received the donations here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is first secretary of the Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council, also disclosed that the experts have
already discovered evidence that Stone Age human beings lived in
Myanmar and there also existed creatures in the country prior to
the period of humans.
</P>
<P>
Experts of Myanmar universities discovered pieces of fossilized
remains of a primate in Pondaung area in Sagaing division,
northwest of the country, in March-April this year.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar experts said that the discovery in Pondaung belongs
to 40-million-year-old formation, a higher primate helpful for

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Expanding National Industrial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will have 50 industrial
cooperation projects with other parts of China this year, the
Shanghai Municipal Economic Committee has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
These will involve two billion yuan in investment, with
Shanghai's stake amounting to 51 percent. They are in the
electro-mechanical, textile, metallurgical, building materials,
and chemical industries, and others. The partners are from central
and western parts of the country and the Yangtze River Basin.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has accelerated the pace of cooperating with other
regions in the 1990s while restructuring its industries. In the
past seven years, the municipality has built 1,100 industrial
projects in cooperation with other parts of the country, involving
six billion yuan in spending.
</P>
<P>
The city can produce 2.35 million bicycles, 550,000 TV sets, 52
million batteries, 80,000 tons of detergent, 1.67 million tires,
and 100,000 diesel engines a year in these cooperative
arrangements, with annual sales exceeding four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some areas have benefited enormously from the cooperation.
Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, for one,
has been helped by Shanghai in gaining a strong foothold in a
number of industries in more than 80 projects.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Kunming went to Shanghai this May to look for
new partners for 38 major projects. The purpose of their visit was
to explain how to use Kunming's resources, step up development of
quality products, and expand markets.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Cuts 1.35 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino-driven pattern of
widespread dry weather could set back the pace of economic growth
in the financial year of 1997-1998, with a projected cost so far
of 1.35 billion US dollars, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE), El Nino would lead to a slump in crop yields
and production, accounting for a fall of almost 1.35 billion US
dollars in crop values.
</P>
<P>
The current El Nino pattern was similar to that experienced
during the 1982 drought, which reduced the country's gross
domestic product by 2 percent, a leading weather forecaster told
the national newspaper The Australian yesterday.
</P>
<P>
While winter crop plantings remain high despite dry conditions,
ABARE forecasted overall production levels in the financial year
of 1997-1998, which started on July 1, 1997, will be well down on
the record set in 1996-1997 with average wheat yields down by 29
percent.
</P>
<P>
The new official forecast for the rural sector will undermine
the budget prediction of 3.75 percent economic growth for 1997-98,
which assumed farm output growth based on "normal seasonal
conditions".
</P>
<P>
In its Australian Crop Report, published yesterday, ABARE said
the plantings would "remain historically high" at just over 18
million hectares in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"A major factor contributing to this is the expectation of high
grain and oilseed prices in 1997-98 relative to the expected
returns for wool and beef," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the extended spell of dry weather would hit
most crops across the country.
</P>
<P>
Production levels of wheat, barley and oats were expected to be
down in each mainland state and yields were forecast to fall below
the five-year averages for those crops.
</P>
<P>
Bill Kininmonth, head of Australia's National Climate Center,
said there was a high likelihood of "significantly below average
rainfall" for the southern and south-west Queensland, southern New
South Wales (NSW), Victoria, south Australia and Tasmania states.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of NSW, 10 percent of Queensland and
Gippsland, Victoria was declared drought-affected.
</P>
<P>
He said the current El Nino had "all he characteristics" of the
1982 drought.
</P>
<P>
El Nino refers to changes in temperature across the Pacific
Ocean, measured by the South Oscillation Index (SOI), the
difference in air pressure between Tahiti and Darwin. A low SOI
means drought.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Newspaper Hails Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's peaceful return to
China is a symbol of the success of the Chinese revolutionary
process, a Nicaraguan newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The "Barricada" paper dedicated a whole page to articles on
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
An article written by Augusto Zamora said that 156 years of
British rule came to an end with the transition of power over Hong
Kong to a powerful and revived China, led with a firm hand by the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
It said Hong Kong's return to its motherland closed an era of
imperialism and colonial rule in Asia by the West, and marked the
beginning of a new era, during which Asia will become the center of
the world economy with "China as one of its epicenters."
</P>
<P>
Another article carried in the paper, with the headline of
"China's Big Strategic Objective", said Hong Kong's handover
marked the ending of China's most humiliating period, and the
rebirth of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese communists knew how to position China in the
world's vanguard. This is well proved by the fact that China had
Mao as one of the greatest leaders in its thousand-year
history .... Hong Kong will be the symbol of this success," the
article concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States today began a
round of controversial underground nuclear weapons-related tests
in the Nevada desert, an Energy Department spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
In the subcritical experiments, code-named "REBOUND", a total
of 73 kg of chemicals were exploded in a tunnel 293 meters
underground, to measure the impact on plutonium under high
pressure, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 44 U.S. congressmen wrote to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, urging him to stop the experiments.
</P>
<P>
They said that the move violated the spirit of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, signed last year by nuclear
powers, including the United States, to outlaw all types of
nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. administration argued that it was not violating
the the treaty and said the tests, which involve massive
supercomputer calculations, were needed to assess how age would
affect materials in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and predict weapons
performance without actual explosions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which conducted its last nuclear weapons explosion in
1992, will conduct another test later this year and four more next
year.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's trade deficit
soared to 4.7 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months, or 85
percent of the 1996 total.
</P>
<P>
Statistics published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Industry,
Commerce and Tourism said that exports for the period totaled

</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the trade deficit for the whole year

</P>
<P>
Brazil's trade deficit has been on the rise since July 1994
when the government took measures to encourage imports and
restrict exports in order to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the government decided to boost exports to
cut down trade deficit but has made no notable achievements.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Welcomes Talks on Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia welcomed every effort to
resume the dialogue between the governments of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea in a bid to
solve differences, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome every positive step toward peace in the region,"
Political Affairs Director General of the Indonesian Foreign
Ministry Nugroho Wisnumurti here Wednesday told a seminar on Korea
and Southeast Asia in the 21st century, sources at the seminar
said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reports said the negotiations between the two sides
will be resumed in August 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
The condition in the Korean peninsula, Nugroho believed, could
not be separated from stability in the wider Asia Pacific region,
and therefore has the potential to effect developments in the
Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia and other non-aligned countries are concerned
over the development of the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we hope that the four-party talks should be
convened, and will hopefully become a turning point from the
current situation there," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that ASEAN's (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
achievements in the political, security, economic and social
fields could not have been as successful as they are without
support from the two countries (DPRK and South Korea).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Issue Rules on Partnerships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to move ahead with its plan to requite large companies to
form partnerships with small and medium companies and
cooperatives, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto had ordered the Ministry of Cooperatives and
Small Enterprises and related agencies to prepare a regulation to
encourage the partnerships, Coordinating Minister for Production
and Distribution Hartarto said here last night.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry and related agencies are working on the criteria
for the obligation of large companies to help small businesses,"
Hartarto said after the cabinet meeting on poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Soeharto, who chaired the meeting, as
saying partnerships were needed to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has been promoting linkage between
large and small firms as part of its poverty alleviation policy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Soeharto launched the Jimbaran group, a gathering of
41 tycoons, which aims to develop programs to help small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia at present has 22 million poor people, or 11 percent
of the country's total population, and every year the number is
aimed to go down by at least two percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is resolved to fully eradicate poverty by the
end of the 7th Five-Year Development Plan (1999-2004), officials
said.

<P>
CARACAS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelans spend on average just
over half their income on food, with some spending up to 72
percent, double the normal average, a Venezuelan market research
company said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is a sharp rise on the 36 percent registered in the
past, and much higher than the 31 percent the Datanalisis company
said should represent the norm for the proportion of income spent
on food.
</P>
<P>
Housing and services account for 11.58 percent of average
income spending, followed by 11 percent on transport, 4.6 percent
on education and 4.3 percent on health.
</P>
<P>
The survey by Datanalisis also shows that the proportion of the
population falling into the lowest income bracket has risen to 78
percent, with the middle-class falling to 18.5 percent of the
population.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
today that Bonn would support Romania's bid to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) soon.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said, "he and the German government are considering with
much sympathy and give their support to Romania's wish to soon
integrate into NATO," said government spokesman Peter Hausmann.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor held talk here today with visiting Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu on Bucharest's bid to join the
Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kohl confirmed that a consensus by all 16
existing NATO members was necessary to open to the door to Romania
at the upcoming NATO summit in Madrid which starts on July 8,
Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has made clear its intention to invite only
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join the NATO in the
first wave. But most of the European Union member states including
France and Italy also want to see Romania and Slovenia to join the
alliance.
</P>

<HEADLINE> White Pollution Getting Trashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's railways in the last year
have picked up some 20,000 tons of plastic fast food containers
and other wastes discarded by passengers along the nation's more
than 60,000 kilometers of rail lines, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Officials said volunteers and railway workers have cleaned
about half of the rail lines.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways and several other related government
ministries a few years ago began a national campaign to end the
so-called "white pollution," once a serious problem along railways
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the problem is being successfully
alleviated and promise further geared-up efforts on the rest of
the railway sections," said Ding Qingxue, a Railway Ministry
official in charge of cleaning up the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Besides persistent publicity and education to raise the
awareness of the public, Ding said his ministry has since 1994
operated clean-up campaigns, "gathering waste food containers in
trains, organizing rail staff and volunteers to collect discharged
food containers, and replacing non-biodegradable plastic
containers with biodegradable ones made of paper or plastics."
</P>
<P>
"Today, fewer and fewer train passengers throw their used food
containers and other trash out of the windows. Instead, more and
more people conscientiously put the rubbish into trash bags
prepared on the trains," Ding said yesterday in an interview with
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 150,000 tons of waste were released by
passenger trains in China a year, including about 400 million
plastic containers for fast food sold on trains.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the food containers were thrown along the
railways without being treated. The non-biodegradable containers,
together with plastic instant noodle bowls and other plastic
packages, have been an eyesore in railway stations and along rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
Most railway stations in China have managed to clean up the
waste daily, and sanitation work has been exceptionally good in
major hubs such as Guangzhou and Zhengzhou, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 2 million people have been organized
nationwide annually to clean the waste along the railways,
collecting an average of 20,000 tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Trash bags are also available on more and more passenger
trains, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1 last year, biodegradable food containers have been
introduced on all passenger trains to replace the
non-biodegradable plastic containers.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Treasurer Peter Costello seized on good economic figures
yesterday to promise a "benign interest-rate climate" and stronger
economic growth in an apparent bid to boost flagging business
confidence.
</P>
<P>
He explained a favorable budget assessment from US ratings
agency Moody's, the biggest monthly rise in retail sales for six
years and a lift in building approvals made it a "good news for
the Australian economy".
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- New South Wales government agencies have known for nearly 20
years that drums of dioxin-contaminated waste are buried at the
Homebush site near where major Olympics venues are now being
built, including the athletes village.
</P>
<P>
The state government last month unveiled a plan to clean up the
site before the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard has held out the prospect of big
income tax cuts for low to middle-income earners as a result of
tax reform.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Internet trading may be costing Australian retailers and the
government up to 1.5 billion US dollars a year in lost sales and
uncollected taxes, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
The figures could rise dramatically if authorities adopt US
President Bill Clinton's proposal, launched yesterday, to
establish a global free-trade zone on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Russian Girl Storms into Wimbledon Quarterfinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, third seed Jana Novotna of Czech Republic and Spanish
tennis veteran Aranxta Sanchez Vicario have cruised into the
Wimbledon semi-finals. But it is Russian teenager Anna Kournikova
who stole the limelight by becoming a surprise semi-finalist.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Russian girl disposed of French Open Champion
Iva Majoli of Croatia in straight sets 7-6 6-4, paving the way for
a spectacular semi-final clash with world number one Hingis, who
trounced Denisa Chladkova of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, ranked 42 in the world, battled her way into the
last eight by beating 7-seeded German player Anke Huber and
doubles expert Helena Sukova in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the coming battle with Kournikova, a confident
Hingis, only nine months older than her opponent, said: "She's a
different player on grass and she is much better here."
</P>
<P>
"Until now I always have beaten her pretty easily," a smiling
Hingis added.
</P>
<P>
In another women's singles semi-final match, Novotna will take
on Sanchez Vicario to fight for the other semi-final position. The
two tennis veterans, both once Wimbledon finalists, are expected
to go all out in collecting a precious Wimbledon trophy.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles events, British player Tim Henman, 14th
seed, created the most dramatic upset by knocking the defending
Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands out of the most well-known
tennis championships in a fierce battle 7:6 6:7 7:6 6:4.
</P>
<P>
In another men's singles clash, world number one Pete Sampras
of the United States moved with obvious difficulties into the last
eight after defeating 16-seeded Czech player Petro Korda in
five-sets 6-4 6-3 6-7 6-7 6-7.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Sampras said: "I could have made it a
lot easier on myself. It just goes to show that if you get a
little careless, all of a sudden he's back in the match."
</P>
<P>
On his semi-final battle with German veteran Boris Backer, also
three-times Wimbledon winner, Sampras said: "It doesn't get
easier. Boris and I have had some unbelievable matches over the
years and hopefully we can play some great tennis tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to walk into it like a final. He has a presence that
not too many players have," he added.

<HEADLINE> Six IRA Men Jailed 35 Years Each for Plotting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Six IRA men were sentenced for 35
years each today for plotting to bomb London electric power
stations, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the six activists were convicted of conspiracy
to cause explosions likely to endanger life.
</P>
<P>
They were charged of plotting to bomb electricity stations and
paralyze power supplies to London and south-eastern England in
1996 to humiliate the British government for its rule in the
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said six bombs were to be attached to
transformers at each of the six electricity power stations ringing
London in what the IRA had intended to be its biggest operation
since the end of its 17-month ceasefire six months previously in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The gang was arrested in London in July 1996 after a
surveillance operation by police and secret service agents as the
activists prepared for a practice run.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, however, had denied the charges, claiming they
were merely planning a hoax to force British authorities to shut
down electricity supplies themselves, and cause chaos in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Hanratty, a self-confessed IRA activist, said the IRA
had intended to bring more chaos to London than at any time since
the Blitz during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
"The electrical impact would be total disruption in London. All
the traffic lights would be out. It would result in chaos. All
industries would be starved -- rail, tube and travel," Hanratty
told the court.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls on Arab Countries to Attend Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
called on Arab countries not to boycott a regional economic summit
to be held in Qatar in November after Saudi Arabia had said it
would not attend the meeting because of Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage all Arab countries to participate in the Doha
economic summit. Those Arab governments who said they won't
attend, we hope they'ss reconsider their positions," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said
in a article, published on Monday, that his country would not
attend the Doha summit and advised Qatar to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Tuesday that his
country had not yet decided whether to attend the meeting. Egypt
hosted the gathering last year.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is now in an impasse as the
Israelis insisted in keeping on with their housing construction in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem in spite of strong opposition
from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Qatar said on Wednesday that it was going ahead with
preparations for the summit.

<HEADLINE> British Pound Rallies Sharply, Pulling Dollar up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell to a
six-month low against the British pound but ended mostly stronger
in other foreign-exchange dealings Wednesday, indirectly pulled
higher by a powerful rally in the British currency.
</P>
<P>
Many said it was increasingly likely that the Bank of England
would raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting next week.
Rising rates in Britain have been a major force propelling the
pound higher.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7550 marks, its fourth
straight high against the German currency since February, 1994,
before settling in New York at 1.7536 marks, up from 1.7467
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar cost 114.49 yen, down from 114.88 yen. The pound
cost 1.6731 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6581 U.S. dollars and the
highest level since January 16.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday: 1.4700
Swiss francs, up from 1.4653; 5.9040 French francs, up from 5.8845;
1,705.00 Italian lire, up from 1,700.50; 1.3774 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.3790.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Race Advisory Board to Convene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The advisory board for U.S.
President Bill Clinton's initiative on racial relations will meet
July 14 to plan its work schedule, the White House announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A notice in the Federal Register says the seven-member panel
will convene at a conference center near the White House to
consider an agenda for the coming months.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said the board will lay out the scope of
its work and accept statements from the public but will not yet
hold a hearing.
</P>
<P>
The board, chaired by historian John Hope Franklin, will launch
a series of town hall meetings for Americans to voice their
feelings on race relations in the United States. The White House
expects the first gathering in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Town meetings are a central feature of the national dialogue on
race that Clinton announced last month in San Diego, California.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Cartoonized Mohammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
denounced a caricature that mocked Mohammed the founder of Islam,
calling it vulgar and offensive.
</P>
<P>
The founder of Islam was drawn as a pig stomping on the Koran,
the Muslim holy book on a leaflet, which was posted in Hebron over
the weekend by an Israeli woman.
</P>
<P>
"That cartoon is vulgar. It's offensive," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We want to assure the Palestinian population in Hebron and
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, throughout the Muslim
world, that the United States rejects the offensive, vulgar and
brutal attacks on the religious sensibilities of Muslims," Burns
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The person who wrote it and the people who support it ought
to be repudiated in the strongest possible terms. It's really
outrageous," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli police commander in Hebron, the woman
was arrested and was to be indicted on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Garlic Helps Keep Heart Healthy, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Garlic can do more than just ward
off vampires, it can help keep your heart healthy, according to a
study reported at a cardiology conference in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
A German clinical trial found that people who take daily garlic
supplements have more flexibility in their major blood vessels and
a lower incidence of heart disease than those who don't take
garlic or use it in cooking.
</P>
<P>
"The effect is very striking," Dr. Gustav Belz, a German
cardiologist, was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
Stiffening of the vessel walls, a condition called
arteriosclerosis, makes blood flow less freely and puts a greater
load on the heart. Stiffening occurs naturally with age.
</P>
<P>
Yet, people who take garlic can slow the hardening process by
20 percent. "The effect is like delaying by years the stiffening
that comes with aging," Dr. Belz said.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the first study to look at garlic's effect on
the arteries. Previous research has shown garlic can lower
cholesterol and blood pressure and this could explain part of the
result.
</P>
<P>
He believes that garlic could reduce the rate of blood
clotting, which is a factor in the buildup of blockages on the
inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
The 202 Germans in the study were between the ages of 50 and
80. Half took daily supplements in the form of garlic powder
tablet and their results were compared with the other half who had
similar diets but didn't take garlic.
</P>
<P>
The garlic users taking 600 to 900 mg a day had an average
reduction in serum cholesterol of 12 percent. And this was
estimated to have lowered their overall risk of heart attack by an
equal percentage.

<HEADLINE> Dow Close to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied to new
highs today after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations by
not raising interest rates to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 73.05 points to
7,795.38, ending about a point shy of June 20's record high.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1
margin, with volume totaling 526.78 million shares as against
539.41 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures rose enough to close at new highs.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list added 13.01 points to
904.04, closing above the 900-mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Also setting new highs were the NYSE composite index, up 5.70
to 471.71; and the Nasdaq composite, up 17.37 to 1,455.62. The
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.45 to 630.06, just
0.04 shy of record territory.
</P>
<P>
While the stock market was mostly higher since the open, the
Dow had been trading slightly lower until Fed officials concluded
a two-day strategy meeting with no change in the central bank's
key lending rates.
</P>
<P>
In the latest suggestion that the robust U.S. economy may be
slowing enough to ease inflationary pressures without a Fed rate
hike, the Commerce Department reported this morning that orders to
U.S. factories fell a bigger-than-anticipated 0.7 percent in May.
On Tuesday, blue-chip shares rose amid similarly mild readings on
factory activity and construction spending.
