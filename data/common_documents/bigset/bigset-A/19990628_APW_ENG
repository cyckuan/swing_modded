<HEADLINE> DiCicco Finds More Talent on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When U.S. coach Tony DiCicco looks down his bench, he sees  
enough talent to form another Women's World Cup team. In the end, 
that could prove a decisive edge. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Americans head into Thursday's quarterfinals matchup with  
Germany at Landover, Md., many of their key players will be rested. 
The reserves who have gotten a chance to play have looked sharp. 
And the inexperienced backups who were called upon in the first 
round won't be so green if they are needed in the knockout rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are as good as anyone in the field,'' DiCicco said  
after Sunday's 3-0 victory over North Korea gave the U.S. team a 
3-0 record in the opening round. ``I think we're capable of beating 
anyone and of winning the tournament. But there are some very 
strong teams that feel the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those teams, most notably Norway and China, don't have the depth  
of the Americans. The Norwegians have been plagued by injuries in 
the last week, with captain Linda Medalen's bruised nose and face 
the most worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Koreans, DiCicco rested starters Michelle Akers and  
Kate Sobrero for the entire game. He gave Tiffeny Milbrett and 
Julie Foudy the first half on the sideline, while Mia Hamm and 
Cindy Parlow took off the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	And while it was Milbrett and Foudy who sparked the second-half  
rally after an 0-0 first 45 minutes, backups Shannon MacMillan (a 
goal and two assists) and Tisha Venturini (two goals) finished off 
the scoring plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got into every practice fighting for starting roles,'' said  
MacMillan, who was a regular for the 1996 Olympic team that won 
gold. She had two game-winners in her three goals in the Atlanta 
Games and is a proven commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be among these 20 women. It's an awesome team.  
I'm ready to contribute, whether it's starting or coming off the 
bench or not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan played in all three first-round games. Venturini made  
her '99 World Cup debut against the Koreans and didn't do much in 
the first half. But in the second, the eight-year veteran of the 
national team was sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've achieved what we wanted in the first round, and now we  
have a chance to move closer to our goal,'' Venturini said. ``As we 
proved in our last two games, whoever we play, if we play our game, 
we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And whomever DiCicco puts on the field, it appears those players  
are capable of leading the United States to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best coaching job in the world,'' he said with a  
smile. ``We have a lot of weapons on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, we have an opportunity to do something  
that has never been done before, and that's what is driving this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He meant following an Olympics title with a world crown.  
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about this team,'' said Sara Whalen, who  
replaced Sobrero on defense Sunday, ``is we all are pulling for one 
another and we help each other. I want Kate to be healthy and to 
play. But if she can't go, she knows she can count on me. Tony 
knows he can count on all of us. And we all know we can count on 
each other.''

<HEADLINE> Today In History  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Today is Tuesday, June 29, the 180th day of 1999. There are 185  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On June 29, 1767, the British Parliament approved the Townshend  
Revenue Acts, which imposed import duties on such things as glass, 
lead, paint, paper and tea shipped to America. Colonists bitterly 
protested the Acts, which were repealed in 1770. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1776, the Virginia state constitution was adopted, and  
Patrick Henry made governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941, Polish statesman, pianist and composer Ignace Jan  
Paderewski died in New York at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, British authorities arrested more than 2,700 Jews in  
Palestine in an attempt to stamp out alleged terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the government of South Africa enacted a ban against  
racially mixed marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission voted against reinstating  
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer's access to classified information. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, the United States bombed fuel storage facilities near  
the North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, Jerusalem was re-unified as Israel removed barricades  
separating the Old City from the Israeli sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, the United States ended a two-month military offensive  
into Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty, as it was  
being meted out, could constitute ``cruel and unusual punishment.'' 
(The ruling prompted states to revise their capital punishment 
laws.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the Supreme Court, in a 7-1 decision, upheld the power  
of independent counsels to prosecute illegal acts by high-ranking 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The U.S. House of Representatives voted  
unanimously in favor of new sanctions against China because of its 
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: In a British TV documentary, Prince Charles said  
he was faithful in his marriage to Princess Diana ``until it became 
irretrievably broken down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Students at Beijing University peppered President  
Clinton with polite but critical questions about America's human 
rights record, Taiwan policy and views on China in an exchange 
televised live across the vast nation. With negotiations on a new 
labor agreement at a standstill, the NBA announced that a lockout 
would be imposed at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Actress Ruth Warrick is 84.  
Dancer-choreographer Fred Kelly is 83. Actor Ian Bannen is 71. 
Movie producer Robert Evans is 69. Actor Gary Busey is 55. Singer 
Little Eva is 54. Comedian Richard Lewis is 52. Actor Fred Grandy

learns to think security, and not progress, the highest lesson of 
statecraft.''--James Russell Lowell, American essayist (1819-1891).

<HEADLINE> Mariners Bid Farewell to Kingdome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Diego Segui was on the mound when the Seattle  
Mariners played their first game in the Kingdome on April 6, 1977. 
So it was appropriate that his grandson, 7-year-old Corey Segui, 
drew the curtain on the stadium with a ceremonial ``last pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a strike.  
</P>
<P>
	Players thanked a sellout crowd of 56,530 for turning the last  
Mariners game Sunday in the Kingdome into an intense, 
playoff-caliber 5-2 victory over division rival Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said they'll miss the drab, gray stadium the  
Mariners called home for 22 1/2 seasons. Others look forward to moving 
across the street to $517 million Safeco Field on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized it as I was coming in early this morning and there  
were already people here,'' designated hitter Edgar Martinez said. 
``It was kind of sad. (The Kingdome) has been good for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ``The Edgar'' is ready to take his game to new digs at  
Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a first-class stadium. I'm excited to go there,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners second baseman David Bell, whose father and grandfather  
were major leaguers, will miss the close-knit atmosphere in the 
small clubhouse behind the team's Kingdome dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has an intimate feel to it. It's nice for the camaraderie  
of the team,'' Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bell looked forward to his first workout at  
state-of-the-art Safeco Field on Monday, before boarding a flight 
for Oakland as the Mariners begin a road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners closer Jose Mesa has a particularly fond memory, but it  
came while he played for a different team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa got the last out for the Cleveland Indians, who beat the  
Mariners in the 1995 American League Championship Series and dashed 
Seattle's hopes of advancing to the team's first World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``But today was one of my best memories -- all the old timers,  
57,000 fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also admired Ken Griffey Jr.'s first-inning home run and  
spectacular fourth-inning catch Sunday to rob Juan Gonzalez of a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for Junior, who knows where this organization  
would be?'' Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, the All-Star center fielder who helped put Seattle  
baseball on the map, said his best memory happened Aug. 31, 1990. 
That's when Griffey and his father, Ken Griffey Sr., became the 
first father and son to start in the same major league lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to do something nobody else has ever done,'' Griffey  
said as he again shared the stage with his father during a 
post-game ceremony. ``Everybody else hits home runs (and) robs 
people of home runs. But I got to run out on the baseball field 
with my dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superstar Alex Rodriguez hasn't been a Mariner as long as  
Griffey or Martinez, but the slugging shortstop will miss the 
stadium with a reputation as a hitter's park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm truly, definitely going to miss this place, especially  
when I'm in the batter's box,'' Rodriguez told the crowd with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Dan Wilson, who can count two inside-the-park home runs  
among his Kingdome memories, thanked the crowd for being the ``10th 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to go out on a winning note, and give the fans what  
they deserve -- a 'W','' he said. ``That building across the street 
-- you're a big part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus, who has called nearly every  
game since the franchise's inception, served as master of 
ceremonies after the game as he welcomed such Mariner greats as 
Gaylord Perry, Julio Cruz, Dave Henderson, both Griffeys, Harold 
Reynolds and Alvin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``My oh my, what a way to end this thing,'' Niehaus said, using  
his trademark call. ``This place has been called an ugly duckling 
by a lot of people. Let me tell you, she'll always be beautiful to 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Leeson Faces Uncertain Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- During Asia's economic boom in the early 1990s,  
cocky young financial traders showed off by setting fire to money 
at Harry's Bar in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Leeson became Harry's most famous customer with a bigger  
stunt. His spectacular futures trading gambles lost $1.4 billion. 
They brought down Barings, Britain's oldest bank, in 1995 and sent 
Leeson to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson will leave Singapore's Changi prison on Saturday, having  
served nearly four years for hiding his disastrous bets. The 
32-year-old Briton will walk into a vastly different financial 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's a lot more responsible now. If Nick did anything,  
he taught them all a lesson,'' Harry's general manager, Margaret 
Woodward, said of the bankers and traders who frequent the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's 2-year-old economic crisis has sobered the mood at  
Harry's -- and Leeson's exploits helped slap the financial world out 
of a stupor that blinded some bankers to the dangers of a rogue 
trader. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodward said she saw Leeson's fellow traders tear up and burn  
Singapore 1,000-dollar bills, each the equivalent of $600, for 
kicks during the heady early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nick was always with a group of guys who were big rollers, big  
spenders. They all were in those days,'' she said. ``But they were 
nice guys, never any trouble -- just boisterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson had a reputation in Singapore as a good-natured, working  
class rogue who flunked math in high school and became a high-flyer 
at Barings largely through brashness and taking huge risks. 
</P>
<P>
	His downfall came on complex bets that the Japanese stock market  
would remain stable. But the Tokyo market crashed after an 
earthquake hit the commercial city of Kobe. But Leeson concealed 
his losses, kept on trading and continued losing. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say he has, if unwittingly, left a positive mark on the  
trading industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial world has become a safer place. It has become a  
little more difficult for someone to sit there and hide 
transactions in a desk drawer,'' said Bernhard Eschweiler, head of 
research in Asia for J.P. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore has adopted stricter guidelines for trading  
management, and regulators have a stronger presence in the field, 
Eschweiler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You literally have the regulator visiting you,'' he said.  
``They don't come with much of an early warning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson will be freed and deported Saturday, according to Clive  
Alderton, first secretary of the British High Commission in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some newspapers have reportedly offered Leeson a six-figure sum  
for an interview, but British diplomats say he wants to slip out of 
Singapore without press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he has attained celebrity status. In London last  
week, Mick Jagger and other big names turned out for a premier of 
``Rogue Trader,'' a film in which Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel play 
Leeson and his now ex-wife, Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics panned the film, and Leeson is in line for less than 5  
percent of any profits it makes. A $700,000 advance for Leeson's 
book, upon which the film is based, has reportedly gone toward his 
huge legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	While Leeson was in prison, his wife divorced him and married  
another trader. Last year, Leeson was diagnosed with colon cancer. 
He had surgery, and doctors give him a 70 percent chance of 
surviving the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Harry's, where tourists can order the ``Bank Breaker,'' a  
cocktail named for Leeson, his release will be commemorated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a Nick Leeson hour, with free beer,'' manager  
Woodward said.

<HEADLINE> Minister Convicted in Murder Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A former minister was convicted today of  
suggesting to a parishioner that they kill each other's wives. 
</P>
<P>
	James Elrod Ogle entered so-called Alford pleas to charges of  
attempted capital murder and solicitation of a felony. In an Alford 
plea, a defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that 
prosecutors have enough evidence for a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle, 46, of Sterling, former pastor of the defunct Bull Run  
Bible Fellowship in Manassas, will remain jailed without bail until 
his Sept. 3 sentencing. He could get up to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that during a Feb. 24 telephone conversation, Ogle  
suggested to Scott Jinks that they commit murders for each other. 
Ogle was counseling Jinks and his wife about their marriage at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jinks told police, and testified against Ogle during a  
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ogle typed instructions on how Jinks should kill  
Ogle's wife, suggesting a drive-by shooting at night while Ogle was 
driving and his wife was in the passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also instructed Jinks to wear gloves to avoid  
leaving fingerprints, prosecutors said, and asked how much it would 
cost to buy a silencer, adding that he would ``be glad to pay for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Should Wait on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republican  
lawmakers Monday to use projected budget surpluses to shore up the 
retirement system before they enacted tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic fund-raising luncheon in suburban Westport,  
Conn., Clinton noted that his affluent audience would benefit from 
an across-the-board tax cut, but urged his listeners to think about 
the future of such government program as Medicare and Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of you would be better off, in the short run, being at a  
Republican fund-raiser,'' Clinton said, but added: ``There's 
something to be said about looking to the long run, as well as the 
short run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was the featured guest in a lunch for 50 people at the  
Westport home of Sandra Wagenfeld, a frequent contributor to 
Democratic causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunch and a special matinee of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman  
Cometh'' at a Broadway theater helped raise more than $1 million 
for Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea had been  
expected to attend the performance with the president, but the two 
instead went house-hunting in the New York area as Mrs. Clinton 
edged ever closer to becoming a candidate for the Senate from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the performance, which drew some 1,000 Democratic  
contributors, Clinton entered from the rear of the stage to thank 
the cast, greeting Kevin Spacey, star of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' 
with a giant bearhug. He said the tale of besotten souls living on 
lies they tell to themselves gave him and the audience ``too much 
to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the Stonewall riots, a watershed event for the gay  
rights movement had occurred just blocks away 30 years ago, the 
president said he was proud that the Democrats have backed hate 
crimes legislation and worked for the rights of all minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged GOP lawmakers to address public concern over violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hoping that members of the other party will decide  
they really are the candidates of law and order and will join us 
... passing sensible restrictions to keep guns out of the wrong 
hands,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Leaves Imprint on US Skiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- This was a ``loonie'' year for the nation's ski  
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The best snow fell after many resorts closed, and thousands of  
skiers headed north to take advantage of the cheap Canadian dollar, 
which is called the ``loonie'' because it bears the image of a 
loon. It was worth about 65 U.S. cents this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, the glitz that draws the Kennedys, the Hollywood  
crowd and their followers wasn't even enough to overcome cheaper 
Canadian hotel rates and lift tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could travel from Britain to Banff (Alberta) for the same  
price as going to Europe,'' said Vanessa Haines of the Ski Club of 
Great Britain. ``And once you get to Canada everything is much 
cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are flooding across the border,'' said David Perry,  
marketing vice president for Vancouver-based Intrawest Corp., which 
operates several major U.S. and Canadian resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia lured thousands of  
destination skiers from U.S. areas because the bargains were just 
as obvious to American skiers, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were snow woes from Vermont to Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time it snowed it rained. I started getting depressed,''  
said Ben McLeod, spokesman for Ski New Hampshire, a state ski 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's resorts are too high to see much rain in the fall or  
winter, but snowfall levels were below normal until after the 
Christmas peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Mont Tremblant in eastern Canada experienced the same warm  
weather that even made snow cannons useless in New England and 
Colorado, but its skier visits were up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada and, in particular, Western Canada hit the weather  
lottery,'' said Jim Felton of Breckenridge, which reported a 6 
percent increase in skier visits for the season because of 
better-than-average snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire and Maine skier days were down 5 percent, and  
Vermont 7 percent. Colorado, the nation's No. 1 ski state, saw a 5 
percent decline in skier-snowboarder days, and destination visits 
were down 7 percent. A skier day, or visit, is the equivalent of a 
full-day lift ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``A local skier spends $45 a day. A destination skier spends  
$189,'' said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Resorts close to Denver offered the deal of the past two decades  
to attract local skiers. Season passes were sold, in advance, for 
$200 apiece, compared with a typical price of $700 to $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of the passes were never used when Colorado skiers  
stayed off the slopes during a relatively balmy early winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colorado is synonymous with skiing. Colorado's position as a  
ski destination is very secure,'' Perry said. Nevertheless, it will 
be hard for Colorado and other American resorts to win back 
destination skiers because the strong American dollar has `made it 
far less competitive.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Roberts, executive director of California's ski industry  
organization, said skiers are more savvy customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can watch Internet video cams showing the snow falling at  
a resort,'' he said. ``They're looking and booking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California resorts saw near-record snowfalls this year, and some  
posted record skier totals. Its market is driven by local skiers, 
who make up 85 percent of the numbers. If they decide to stay at 
home it's bad news for Colorado, where two-thirds of its skiers and 
boarders come from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah skier visits were up 1.5 percent, but the resorts draw less  
than a third as many skiers as Colorado's resorts and only half as 
many as Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado also is losing its edge in ski facilities as others  
match the high-speed lifts that eliminate long, cold rides. The 
industry does not have much money to advertise because state voters 
banned funding for tourism promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it hurts Colorado to have people go and see  
other places because I think it reflects well on Colorado,'' said 
John Norton, Aspen's chief operating officer. ``You can go to the 
Northwest and Canada and get rained on once or twice a week.''

	CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Angelo B. Bertelli, who was the  
third-oldest living Heisman Trophy winner, died Saturday of brain 
cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli won the Heisman Trophy in 1943 while at Notre Dame  
during a season shortened by service in the U.S. Marine Corps. He 
played six games for the Fighting Irish before being called to 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelli's shortened season at Notre Dame was undefeated with a  
collective score of 261-31. He was elected to the College Football 
Hall of Fame in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as a captain in the Marines, Bertelli played  
professional football for the Los Angeles Dons. A knee injury ended 
his career.

<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mary Brogan, the wife of Lt. Gov. Frank  
Brogan, died Sunday of breast cancer. She was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan often had called his wife ``my partner in life.'' The two  
were high school sweethearts in Cincinnati, where Mrs. Brogan was 
born. They married in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	She began her career as a third-grade teacher at Port Salerno  
Elementary School in Stuart and later worked as an assistant 
principal at both Port Salerno and Pinewood Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	On orders of Gov. Jeb Bush, government flags were lowered in her  
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brogan has worked recently to promote breast cancer  
awareness. She led a women's 5K race to benefit survivors and made 
calls of support to breast cancer patients.

	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Hugh Alton Carter Sr., a former state  
senator and first cousin of former President Carter, died June 24. 
He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired Army colonel and World War II veteran owned and  
operated Carter's Worm Farm for many years. He also operated the 
Plains's Mercantile, founded by his father. The store on Main 
Street in Plains became known as Hugh Carter's Antiques in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was a secretary-clerk, deacon and song director of the  
Plains' Maranatha Baptist Church.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Carolyn J. Craig, a former personnel executive for  
The Associated Press who touched hundreds of AP staffers worldwide 
with her concern for their lives and careers, died Saturday of 
cancer. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	For a dozen years after she joined the AP's Personnel Department  
-- now Human Resources -- in 1981, Mrs. Craig was probably the 
department's most recognized name and face. Hundreds of job 
applicants credited her for launching their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was host to scores of staffers who visited AP headquarters  
in New York, often inviting a guest to her home, a restaurant or a 
Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
	She participated in labor negotiations, established orientation  
and training programs, coordinated the transfers of hundreds of 
staffers across states or oceans, and listened patiently to their 
complaints and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 1985 kidnapping in Beirut of AP Middle East  
Correspondent Terry Anderson, Mrs. Craig was the AP's liaison with 
his family in Beirut, New York and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, a sister, four stepchildren, two  
nieces and a nephew.

<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Former major league relief pitcher  
Tim Layana, part of the Cincinnati Reds team that went to the 1990 
World Series, died Saturday after his sport utility vehicle was 
broadsided. He was 35. 
</P>
<P>
	His passengers -- brother Michael Layana, 37, Gregory Hoel, 34,  
and Bruce Taylor, 35 -- were treated at Kern Medical Center and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome had been heading home from a charity golf  
tournament to raise money for juvenile diabetes, said another 
brother, John Layana. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in the other car was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Layana, who pitched for the Reds and San Francisco Giants, was a  
baseball coach at a Catholic high school in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana's professional career started in 1986, when the New York  
Yankees drafted him from Loyola Marymount University. He spent four 
seasons in the Yankees' farm system. The Cincinnati Reds drafted 
him in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was 5-5 with a 4.56 ERA and two saves in 78  
career relief appearances. His best year was 1990 with the World 
Series champion Reds when he went 5-3 with a 3.49 ERA and two saves 
in 55 games.

                           *Marion Motley    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pro Football Hall of Famer Marion Motley, a  
Cleveland Browns fullback who was of the first black players of the 
modern era, died Sunday of prostate cancer. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound fullback, rushed for 4,720 yards  
in nine professional seasons in the All-America Football Conference 
and National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NFL in rushing with 810 yards on 140 carries in 1950,  
the Browns' first season in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley was also the AAFC's leading career rusher with 3,024  
yards. He helped the Browns win the AAFC championship all four 
years the league existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Motley, pro teams in the modern era didn't have black  
players. The Browns made history in 1946 when they signed Motley 
and teammate Bill Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had a number of black players in the 1920s, but an  
unspoken ban left them out of pro football in the '30s and '40s 
until Motley signed with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Motley was slowed late in his career by knee injuries. He took  
the 1954 season off and attempted a comeback in 1955 with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, but retired after carrying the ball just 
twice.

<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Former Col. George Papadopoulos, who rose  
from obscurity to become the feared ringleader of Greece's 1967-74 
military dictatorship, died Sunday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately announced by hospital  
officials, but Papadopoulos had been under medical care for three 
years for a degenerative muscle disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Imprisoned and chronically ill, Papadopoulos had been out of the  
public eye for years. But his name still stirred intense emotions 
among Greeks, especially the thousands of leftists and 
intellectuals who fled during the junta or endured imprisonment and 
persecution at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Papadopoulos masterminded the bloodless 1967 military coup that  
toppled the parliamentary government after years of political 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
	He was toppled by his military police chief, Brig. Dimitris  
Ioannides, in November 1973 after a student uprising was quelled by 
army tanks. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later 
commuted to life in prison.

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Jiri Pelikan, a former communist who was stripped of  
his citizenship by Czechoslovakia after the failed attempt at 
sweeping government reform in 1968, died Saturday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelikan was head of Czechoslovakia's state-run television during  
the ``Prague Spring,'' the popular reform movement that ended with 
the Soviet-led invasion of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Moravia in 1923, he grew up in a family of intellectuals  
and artists. In 1939, he joined the Czech Communist Party and took 
part in the resistance against the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, Pelikan was the head of a Communist party youth  
commission that screened students for admission to universities and 
denied admission to thousands of non-communists. Pelikan later 
called the episode the ``greatest shame'' of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Soviet tanks rolled through Prague in 1968,  
Pelikan fled to Italy, where he eventually became an Italian 
citizen and went on to serve in the European Parliament as a 
Socialist.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, Dozens Hurt in 2 Bus Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two unrelated tour bus crashes in Southern California -- one in  
Buena Park and the other near the Mojave Desert -- left one person 
dead and several other people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The first crash Sunday involved a sight-seeing bus tour to  
Tijuana, Mexico. The California Highway Patrol said a Chevrolet 
Malibu veered in front of the bus, killing the car's driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 bus passengers were not injured. The car's driver, whose  
name was not released, later died at Whittier Community Hospital, 
Montanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly before 9 a.m. on Interstate 5,  
about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, said Officer Gary 
Montanez, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared,'' said 13-year-old Lali Quezada, a bus  
passenger. ``I saw the car hit the divider and the bus hit it and 
dragged it all the way to the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second crash occurred more than an hour later, near Baker,  
about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles. A tour bus carrying 37 
passengers overturned on Interstate 15 about 10:20 a.m. as it 
returned from Jean, Nev., from a gambling trip, Officer Willie 
Hailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bus driver Louis Auther Jackson, 59, of Lynwood, apparently lost  
control of the vehicle as a tire blew out. The bus crashed into the 
center divider and then flipped several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers rushed 12 people to area hospitals. Two victims  
suffered moderate injuries.

<HEADLINE>  Degas Pastel of Dancer Sold for $28M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An anonymous telephone bidder paid $28 million  
Monday for a pastel drawing by Edgar Degas, a record price for a 
work by the French artist, Sotheby's auctioneers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dancer at rest,'' comes from a series of acclaimed studies  
Degas began in the late 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
	The picture had been expected to raise up to $11 million in the  
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art.

<P>
	A second Degas pastel, ``Woman sitting behind a piano,'' a study  
of a woman at a piano dating from around 1882-85, sold for $4.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two works were sold by descendants of Jules-Emile Boivin,  
the French businessman who bought them in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
	The last record price for a Degas was $13.6 million paid for

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against other currencies  
Monday as traders held back ahead of this week's meeting by the 
Fed's interest rate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0351, down  
from $1.0428 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 121.21 
Japanese yen, down from 121.43. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is expected to nudge interest rates higher during its  
two-day meeting this week, but some traders are holding back to see 
how much of a change the Fed makes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5450 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5324, and 1.4683 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4662. The British 
pound slipped to $1.5823 from $1.5873. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8896 German

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish prime  
ministers launched a determined bid today to transform the 
long-postponed hopes of Northern Ireland's peace accord into 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	In daylong talks, Britain's Tony Blair and Ireland's Bertie  
Ahern were confronting twin obstacles: Protestant refusal to form a 
new coalition government that includes Sinn Fein politicians unless 
their Irish Republican Army partners start to disarm first, and 
Sinn Fein's refusal to deliver any IRA disarmament promises at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Good Friday accord, accepted last year both by the  
Protestants of the Ulster Unionist Party and the Catholics of Sinn 
Fein, didn't explicitly link formation of a Protestant-Catholic 
government to any advance IRA moves. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blair, with Ahern's support, was pushing a compromise that  
would require the IRA to provide a timetable outlining how the 
outlawed group would disarm by May 2000, the deadline set in last 
year's accord. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for this comprehensive commitment, Ulster Unionist  
leader David Trimble would be expected to accept Sinn Fein 
politicians in two of the government's 12 posts before any 
disarmament actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
	As they arrived for the negotiations at Stormont, the center of  
British administration in east Belfast, both Trimble and Sinn Fein 
leader Gerry Adams blamed each other for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not, any of us, underestimate the seriousness of  
this last critical phase of negotiations,'' said Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble noted that Adams earlier this year said both sides  
should ``jump together'' and make simultaneous compromises on IRA 
arms and the government's formation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll, I'm ready to go,'' Trimble said. ``But, since, then Mr.  
Adams appears to have gotten cold feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making the week's diplomatic efforts even more fraught was the  
fear that any deal could be quickly undermined by street violence 
connected with the annual Orange Order marches of early July. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three summers, Catholic militants have tried to  
block Protestant Orangemen from marching through the main Catholic 
section of the town of Portadown, raising sectarian passions and 
sparking riots across Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's march, scheduled for Sunday, was likely to be barred  
from the disputed area, as was the case last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A government-appointed Parades Commission assigned to rule on  
applications for marches postponed its verdict to allow for 
last-minute negotiations involving the Orange Order, Northern 
Ireland's major Protestant fraternal group, and the Catholic 
protesters.

<HEADLINE> Energy Trading Software Firms Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Energy software maker Altra Energy Technologies  
Inc. has capped a recent spate of acquisitions by buying rival 
TransEnergy Management Inc., the privately held companies said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with both Houston firms say the purchase, along with  
others Altra has made, will allow the enhanced Altra to offer 
customers software to facilitate energy trading, intra-office needs 
and risk management. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of end-to-end solutions -- soup-to-nuts -- to that  
extent, I do believe we are in a leadership position,'' Altra 
chairman Rusty Braziel said during a teleconference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Bourke, chief executive officer, did not reveal details  
about the transaction, saying only that the deal pushes Altra's 
overall value ``closer to the $100 million range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two venture capital investment firms bought Altra in December  
1997 from co-owners Duke Energy and The Williams Cos. and, in 
recent months, the firm has bought software companies such as 
Atlanta-based Energy Imperium and Calgary, Canada-based QuickTrade 
L.L.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Altra probably will take a break on the acquisition front at  
least for the next few months as it absorbs TransEnergy and its 120 
employees, Bourke said. He added that Altra, which has 220 
employees, expects both companies to shed some jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to TransEnergy's own figures, it laid off about 30  
workers during a reorganization in May not related to the merger, 
which Braziel said has been in the works for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Altra will continue to service TransEnergy products but will

<HEADLINE> Worker Accused of Calling Psychics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cheryl Burnham should have seen it coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Burnham, a clerk at a county juvenile facility, has been accused  
of racking up $120,000 worth of telephone calls to psychic hotlines 
while at work. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial for the 39-year-old woman on charges of felony grand  
theft and commercial burglary has been scheduled to begin in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Burnham faces a maximum sentence of four years in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things to wonder about this case,'' Deputy  
District Attorney Robert Dver said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has no prior record, so it's unlikely in the extreme that  
she would get the maximum sentence,'' Dver said, adding Burnham 
probably will be ordered to pay back the cost of the calls if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham's attorney, Deputy Public Defender E. John Myers,  
refused to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone calls -- about 2,500 of them -- were discovered during a  
routine audit. They were made at night and on weekends between June 
1997 and November 1998 from McClaren Hall in El Monte, about 10 
miles east of here. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls were traced back to Burnham's work area, at times she  
was alone, said Marion Romeis, head of the special investigations 
unit of the county auditor-controller's office.

<HEADLINE> Russia Lowers Grain Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's 1999 grain harvest will be lower than  
forecasted, reaching just 61 million to 66 million tons, a news 
agency reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous official forecast was for 77 million tons in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	The harvest may be even smaller than the new, pessimistic  
forecasts in the Rostov, Stavropol and Volga regions because 
water-tables have fallen disastrously due to drought, said Georgy 
Zelinsky, Director-General of the Khleboproduktprogress 
Association, a grain company. 
</P>
<P>
	Even consistent good weather won't be enough to push the 1999  
harvest much above last year's 53 million tons of grain, said an 
official in the State Bread Inspectorate, the Interfax news agency 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the unseasonably warm weather of recent weeks will  
improve the gluten content of the wheat crop and could bring the 
share of the crop fit for human consumption to a level higher than 
the 60 percent average, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials insist that the country will not import any  
more grain than usual this year, about 3.3 million tons, according 
to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the European Union are supplying large  
amounts of food aid to help Russia cope with the shortages caused 
by the 1998 harvest, which was the worst in decades.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Savings Rate at All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's savings rate hit another all-time  
low in May as Americans' spending rose faster than their income. 
Economists said the figures give the Fed more ammunition to justify 
an expected interest rate increase this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending, which has repeatedly outpaced incomes this  
year, rose 0.6 percent in May, the Commerce Department said Monday. 
Americans' personal income, which includes wages, interest and 
government benefits, went up 0.4 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	That trend has helped to drag the nation's savings rate --  
savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- to a string of record 
lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the savings rate fell to a minus 1.2 percent, even worse  
than the previous record of minus 1.0 percent in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's economy grew at a brisk annual rate of 4.3 percent  
in the first three months of this year -- powered by strong consumer 
spending. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though economists believe both economic growth and consumer  
spending slowed in the current second quarter, they don't believe 
it is enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve from beginning to 
raise short-term interest rates at its meetings Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures released by the Commerce Department on Monday  
``confirm what the Fed already thought ... that consumer spending 
remained quite robust in May so it was more of a confirmation,'' 
said economist Paul Kasriel with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
``It just reinforces their presumed decision to raise the federal 
funds rate'' this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe that the Fed is likely to raise its  
target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge 
each other, from 4.75 percent to 5 percent in an effort to slow the 
economy and keep inflation under control. And that could be 
followed by one and possibly two more quarter-point increases in 
upcoming months, many analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union economist David Orr said the Fed wants to raise  
consumers' borrowing costs so that they will slow their spending 
down and close the gap that currently exists between income growth 
and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.6 percent increase in spending in May followed gains of  
0.5 percent in April, 0.6 percent in March, 0.9 percent in February 
and 0.5 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last at  
least three years such as washing machines and cars -- rose 2.2 in 
May. That followed two months of declines 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products such as food and fuel increased  
0.5 percent and spending on services rose 0.3 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years  
and high demand for labor -- with labor shortages in some regions 
and industries -- helping to boost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, wages rose 0.5 percent, following a 0.6 percent increase  
the previous month. However, wages for farm proprietors dropped 
13.8 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that one of the major reasons why the savings  
rate is so low is because the stock market is at record highs, 
boosting Americans' net worth and making them feel more comfortable 
about spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 25 percent of American households' total assets were  
in stock market investments -- the highest percentage in the postwar 
period, Kasriel said. ``If there was a dramatic drop in the stock 
market, household wealth would suffer significantly and that would 
probably cause people to want to save more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Gains at European Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAU, France (AP) -- Russia handed Yugoslavia its first loss at  
the European Championship, beating the two-time defending champion 
76-68 behind Zakhar Pashutin's 20 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Le Mans, Germany advanced to the final eight with a stunning  
102-85 victory over Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia, which defeated Russia in last year's World  
Championship final, watched as Pashutin made seven of eight field 
goal attempts and nailed all three of his 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss made little difference for Yugoslavia, which still won  
its second-round pool with a 5-1 record. Russia also qualified for 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia took an 8-0 lead at the start of the game, but the  
Russians soon went on a 17-4 run that gave them a 30-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavs regained the lead early in the second half, but  
Pashutin sank a 3-pointer with 8:40 minutes left for a 53-47 lead 
and Russia never looked behind again. 
</P>
<P>
	Dejan Bodiroga had 14 for Yugoslavia, while Sacramento Kings  
center Vlade Divac got 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Divac's Sacramento teammate, forward Predrag Stojakovic, made  
his debut at the championship, missing three shots and committing 
three turnovers in five minutes of play for Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	With its loss to Germany, Croatia was eliminated and failed to  
qualify for next year's Olympics in Sydney, a bitter blow to one of 
Europe's most respected teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Croatians got 14 points, eight assists, three steals and  
three rebounds from Toni Kukoc, the winner of three NBA 
championship rings with the Chicago Bulls. But Kukoc made only five 
of 13 field goal attempts in what was likely his final game for the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Shooting guard Drazan Tomic, a Croatian-born naturalized German,  
burned his former countrymen with a tournament-high 32 points on 
13-of-16 shooting from the field, including 6-of-8 from the 3-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks scored 21 points for  
Germany, going 4-of-5 from the 3-point range, and added five 
rebounds. Three other Germans scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Le Mans, Turkey beat the Czech Republic 78-73 behind  
Mirsad Turkcan's 17 points to qualify in third place, ahead of 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia will face Germany and Turkey plays France in  
Thursday's quarterfinals in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain beat Israel 88-74 and awaits the outcome of the last match  
between France and Slovenia to know whether it had qualified.

<HEADLINE> Mom Pleads Guilty To Killing 8 Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A 70-year-old woman pleaded guilty Monday to  
smothering eight of her young children decades ago but won't go to 
jail so researchers can learn more about why new mothers sometimes 
kill newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Noe admitted killing the children between 1949 and 1968  
and was sentenced to 20 years' probation, the first five of which 
must be served under home confinement. Mrs. Noe also must undergo 
mental health treatment sessions with a psychiatrist to determine 
the cause of her repeated infanticide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to get this matter finalized,'' said District  
Attorney Lynne Abraham. ``Is it perfect? We don't always get a 
perfect outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the sentencing, Deputy District Attorney Charles F. Gallagher  
said: ``It's important for the medical community and the legal 
community that she admit these murders and ... something good will 
come out of the analysis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The light sentence Monday also had to do with ``the unusual  
circumstances of the case and the age of the case'' and Mrs. Noe's 
being the sole caretaker of her ailing 77-year-old husband, Arthur, 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one of those situations where we have a heart of a  
killer,'' said defense attorney David Rudenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	With no evidence to show otherwise, doctors and investigators  
had reluctantly attributed the deaths of eight children -- none of 
whom lived longer than 14 months -- to sudden infant death syndrome. 
The Noes had two other children, both of whom died of natural 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police never closed the investigation, however, and Mrs. Noe was  
charged last August, a year after the case returned to the 
spotlight following the publication of ``The Death of Innocents,'' 
a book about SIDS. Also, a cover story in Philadelphia magazine 
brought to light the suspicions of a retired Philadelphia medical 
examiner who investigated the final two deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her arrest, Mrs. Noe had confessed in March to police  
that she suffocated four of the infants and said she did not 
remember the other four deaths. During a meeting with a state 
psychiatrist in November, she confessed to killing the other four 
children, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Mrs. Noe, walking with a cane and an electronic  
monitoring bracelet around her waist, answered the judge with 
deliberate ``yes'' and ``no'' answers but did not explain why she 
killed her children. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband sat in the courtroom looking flushed and shaking his  
head as the names of the eight babies were read. He was not charged 
in the case and had maintained her innocence. The couple refused to 
speak with reporters after Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot speak for him, but Arthur Noe sat in court as she  
admitted killing those eight babies,'' Rudenstein said. ``Does he 
believe that she admitted that she suffocated these babies? I trust 
that he does. Does he believe that his wife's some evil killer? I'm 
sure he does not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said numerous medical officials indicated that a  
medical study of Mrs. Noe could be valuable because so little is 
known about why women kill their babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know what possessed her to do it,'' Gallagher said.  
``When she made her admissions, she indicated she did it, but she 
didn't say why she did it. She said she doesn't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudenstein said it was important for Mrs. Noe as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before she passes onto the next world, she wants to understand  
what has occurred,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> WUG Coach: Better Defense Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- If the U.S. World University Games team  
wants to bring home the gold medal next month, it's going to have 
to step up its defense, the squad's coach says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have time to become a well-oiled machine on  
offense,'' said Coach Oliver Purnell. ``We have to improve our team 
defense. That's our ticket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the team won 94-93 over a collection of former Ohio  
college players at the University of Dayton Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin scored the  
winning basket with five seconds left and finished with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendan Haywood, a 7-foot-center from North Carolina, had 15  
points and five rebounds. Ohio State point guard Scoonie Penn 
dished out a team-high nine assists and finished with 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to work on a few things, like not turning the  
ball over so much, getting better shots and rebounding the ball,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purnell said his team did not have a defensive focus until the  
end of the game when it had to stop its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a long way to go to come together as a team,''  
said Purnell. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team led the entire first half and was ahead 49-47 at  
the break. In the second half, the Vagabonds, which featured former 
college players Mark Baker (Ohio State), Thad Burton (Wright 
State), Ryan Perryman (Dayton), Darnell Hoskins (Dayton) and Bobby 
Brannen (Cincinnati), pushed their opponents the entire 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vagabonds led 93-92 with 19.5 seconds remaining after  
Hoskins made one of two foul shots. The U.S. team answered with a 
basket by Martin, and Hoskins' desperation 3-pointer from half 
court missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave them a run for their money,'' said Hoskins. ``It was a  
lot of fun. They're definitely a talented group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said he doubts that the U.S. team will play a more  
individually talented group at the World University Games. But he 
doesn't expect the competition to be easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll run into teams that are better because they've  
played together for years,'' said Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member squad heads to Palma de Mallorca off the coast of  
Spain for the world games on Tuesday and is scheduled to begin play 
Saturday, against South Korea.

President Clinton. The president tomorrow will detail his proposal 
to save Medicare from bankruptcy through a combination of better 
management, more competition and dipping into the federal budget 
surplus. He was proposing today that $794 billion from

<HEADLINE> Transplants Could Treat Parkinson's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists may have found a way to generate  
unlimited supplies of brain cells for transplanting into 
Parkinson's disease patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are studying brain-cell transplants to help treat  
some Parkinson's patients. But the source of those cells is 
problematic. Getting them from aborted fetuses is controversial, 
and taking cells from animals raises concern about introducing new 
diseases into people. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work focuses on brain cells called neural stem cells.  
These cells, which can be grown in batches in the lab, can give 
rise to a variety of specialized brain cell types and scientists 
are studying how to control that process to produce the kinds of 
cells they want. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, reported in the July issue of the journal Nature  
Biotechnology, used stem cells from mice. Researchers said they 
were able to produce brain cells that pump out the chemical 
dopamine, and that's the kind of cell that is transplanted in 
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers are from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,  
Harvard Medical School and elsewhere. They gave the stem cells 
genes that encourage development of dopamine-making cells, and 
exposed them to other cells called astrocytes that provided 
chemical signals for proper development. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the resulting dopamine cells didn't survive well  
when transplanted into mice. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are important but there are some caveats, Dr. Olle  
Lindvall of the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, wrote in an 
accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	One is the poor survival after transplantation, which might be  
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is that human transplantation might require stem cells  
from people rather than mice. Finally, Lindvall wrote, it's not 
clear whether brain cells produced this way would really ease 
Parkinson's symptoms.

<HEADLINE> Bills Would Punish Intl. Sex Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- International traffickers in women and  
children often go unpunished because existing laws in the United 
States and other countries are inadequate, two members of Congress 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, and Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said  
they have introduced a bill that would boost penalties for people 
convicted of forcing women and children into the sex trade. Several 
other members of Congress have introduced similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trafficking in human beings is a form of modern-day slavery,''  
said Smith, chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. ``Although trafficking has long been a 
problem in some Asian countries, it was not until the end of 
communism in East-Central Europe and the breakup of the Soviet 
Union that a sex trade in the (area) began to develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Impose harsher penalties on people convicted of sexual  
trafficking inside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establish a new office in the State Department to report  
annually on foreign nations that fail to criminalize international 
sexual trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bar the federal government from giving nonhumanitarian help to  
foreign governments that tolerate the international sex trade. 
</P>
<P>
	--Help victims by authorizing grants to shelters and  
rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow some victims illegally in the United States to stay in  
the country if they face retribution in their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1356.

<HEADLINE> Orosco Just Short of Relief Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jesse Orosco hasn't been pitching forever. It  
just seems that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco was warming up in the bullpen at Comiskey Park this month  
when someone yelled from the bleachers, ``Hey Orosco, how did you 
pitch to Ty Cobb?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco never did slip a changeup past The Georgia Peach. And he  
doesn't receive Social Security, as some wisecracking teammates 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	But this much is true: No big league pitcher has made more  
relief appearances than 42-year-old Jesse Orosco. His 1,051 relief 
appearances is one more than Kent Tekulve. 
</P>
<P>
	And Orosco now is only 16 games short of breaking Dennis  
Eckersley's standard of 1,071 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relief record is very, very important. But total games is  
the one that means the most,'' Orosco said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco had only modest expectations 20 years ago after landing a  
spot on the opening day roster of the 1979 New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I was a little tot, my plan was to play in the  
majors,'' he said. ``Once that happened, I said to myself, `I'd be 
happy as anything if I could just play three or four years here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a time when Burt Reynolds was the biggest box office draw  
and ``YMCA'' was the hot song in the discos. Eddie Murray, now an 
Orioles coach, was in his third season with Baltimore and Sidney 
Ponson, now a key member of the Baltimore rotation, was just 
learning to walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco outlasted disco and Murray, and the left-hander has done  
more than just show up for work regularly. He has a 3.02 lifetime 
ERA, an 84-74 record and 140 saves. And few people remember that he 
won three games in the 1986 NL championship series before recording 
the final out in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Orosco, who made four starts early in his career, has made a  
living out of entering from the bullpen and retiring left-handed 
hitters. He doesn't stick around for long, but he does show up 
quite often -- he averaged 70 appearances the last two seasons and 
leads the team this year with 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know that if you use him for one or two batters you can  
use him five days in a row,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. 
``That's pretty remarkable for a guy 40 years old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players like to kid him about his age, but most realize the  
dedication it takes to put together such a career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's won a World Series. He's played 20 years and he's seen a  
lot of great players,'' Baltimore shortstop Mike Bordick said. 
``The man is dedicated to the game, but it's still amazing that 
he's been able do this for so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So very long.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm most happy about is the fact that I've been able to  
be out there every day. The manager knows I'll be there,'' Orosco 
said. ``There have been some ups and downs but I've been pretty 
consistent over the course of more than 1,000 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has an uncharacteristic 6.88 ERA this season, but Orosco  
plans to complete a contract that could keep him pitching through 
2001. That would enable him to join the handful of players whose 
careers covered parts of four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I pass (Eckersley's) record I still have to go out and  
do my job,'' Orosco said. ``I want to go 35, 50, 80 more games 
right through next year.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 84.22 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as investors grew  
more optimistic that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
by only a small amount at its meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 84.22 at 10,636.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 9.79 at 1,325.10, and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 9.13 to 2,561.79 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee is widely expected to increase  
short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point to slow the 
economy and prevent inflation from accelerating. Analysts say that 
rate hike is already reflected in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	More evidence of a robust U.S. economy surfaced today as the  
Commerce Department reported Americans' personal spending rose 0.6 
percent in May, outpacing personal income, which rose 0.4 percent. 
The continued rapid rise in spending, which boosts corporate 
profits, also does drive inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 70.8 million shares, 
down from Friday's session which had the lowest volume of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.00 at 627.34 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.65 to 773.67.

<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.0 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.8 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.8 percent.

	Personal Income Rises 0.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose again in May  
but their spending climbed much faster, contributing to another 
all-time low in the nation's savings rate. Personal income -- which 
includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose 0.4 percent 
last month, the Commerce Department said today. Spending, however, 
went up 0.6 percent in the same period. Because consumer spending 
has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the nation's savings rate -- 
savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- has set a string of 
record lows this year.

	Budget Surpluses Seen Growing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced a new proposal  
today for buttressing Social Security and Medicare, based on new 
White House projections that budget surpluses will be more than $1 
trillion bigger over the next 15 years than was envisioned earlier 
this year. Clinton proposed setting aside $794 billion over the 
next 15 years to strengthen Medicare, including providing new 
prescription drug benefits for the elderly. That is $108 billion 
more than he proposed in February, when he released his fiscal 2000 
budget. His plan included no dramatic increases in the targeted tax 
cuts he proposed earlier this year. But the president did not rule 
out considering deeper tax reductions in discussions with 
congressional Republicans later this year.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's vehicle exports fell 8.6 percent in May  
from a year earlier, dragged down by weak sales in Europe, Latin 
America and the Middle East. But exports to the United States rose 
19.7 percent. The drop to 308,661 vehicles was the fourth straight 
monthly decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association 
reported today. Japan's top three automakers; Toyota Motor Corp., 
Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. all suffered export declines 
for the month with Nissan posting the largest loss. Despite the 
overall decline, exports to the United States -- Japanese carmakers' 
biggest market -- remained strong, jumping to 108,598 vehicles in 
the ninth consecutive increase.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The government could decide this week what to do  
with the shares of major banks that it bought to strengthen the 
country's financial system, the minister for financial reform said 
today. The government poured $61.6 billion of taxpayers' money into 
major banks in late March to help them write-off huge loads of bad 
loans. In exchange, the government received preferred stock in the 
banks. The government is now a kind of silent owner in the banks -- 
preferred shareholders receive dividend payments first, but they 
don't have the right to vote for corporate officers or changes in 
company structure.

	Russia Lowers Grain Forecast  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's 1999 grain harvest will be lower than  
forecasted, reaching just 61 million to 66 million tons, a news 
agency reported today. The previous official forecast was for 77 
million tons in 1999. The harvest may be even smaller than the new, 
pessimistic forecasts in the Rostov, Stavropol and Volga regions 
because water-tables have fallen disastrously due to drought, said 
Georgy Zelinsky, Director-General of the Khleboproduktprogress 
Association, a grain company. Even consistent good weather won't be 
enough to push the 1999 harvest much above last year's 53 million 
tons of grain, said an official in the State Bread Inspectorate, 
the Interfax news agency reported today.

billion in stock and cash in the latest combination in the energy 
distribution industry. The combined company will serve 
approximately 921,000 gas customers and more than one million 
electric customers in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and 
have approximately 9,000 employees. ``The combination is expected 
to result in gas rates that will be lower over the long term than

15. The French firm's U.S. acquisitions will help Suez Lyonnaise

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Crisis Could Have Been Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defending the actions he and other  
policy-makers took to handle the worst global financial crisis in 
50 years, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a farewell 
interview that there were nail-biting times when he feared that the 
situation could spin out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old Rubin appeared relaxed with his tie  
uncharacteristically loosened as he met with a small group of 
reporters in his office for a final interview before his scheduled 
departure from Clinton's Cabinet next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Praised by President Clinton as the greatest treasury secretary  
since Alexander Hamilton, Rubin had to deal in his early days in 
office with the Mexican peso crisis of 1995 and for the past two 
years has struggled to fashion a rescue effort for the far worse 
Asian currency crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community faced an unprecedented situation  
and very complex situation of having the thing that we had always 
feared actually happen -- contagion on a large scale,'' Rubin said 
of the Asian crisis. ``There were a number of times when this thing 
could have become far worse than it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said was such time was December 1997 when South Korea came  
close to defaulting on its foreign obligations, and another time 
was last fall when Russia's default on billions of dollars of 
foreign loans badly rattled global financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics charge that the International Monetary Fund, which took  
the lead in assembling more than $100 billion in rescue packages 
for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil, wasted the 
money because it failed to keep the crisis countries from falling 
into steep recessions or halt the spread of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin disagreed with this view, arguing that the IMF's decisions  
were for the most part correct. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF was making them in very brief periods of time, in the  
context of very complex situations,'' Rubin said. ``Without the 
IMF, without the international community, the probability that this 
would have turned out very badly would have been much higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin announced in May that he would leave the administration  
around July 4. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a 
44-year-old former economics professor from Harvard, who has been 
picked by Clinton to replace Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers' nomination is pending before the full Senate, which has  
yet to act because of wrangling between Democrats and Republicans 
over health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin refused to speculate over whether he would remain past  
next weekend, should Summers not be confirmed by that time. Another 
possibility is that Summers, already the department's No. 2 
official, will simply step in and serve on an acting basis pending 
Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, one of the richest men in Clinton's Cabinet, worked for  
26 years at Goldman Sachs, rising to the post of co-chairman when 
Clinton tapped him in 1993 to take the job as director of the 
National Economic Council, the White House group Clinton created to 
coordinate his administration's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin took the lead in pushing Clinton toward a greater emphasis  
on deficit reductions, a policy that produced the first budget 
surplus in 29 years last year. Rubin's policies also helped keep 
the U.S. economy expanding for what is now a peacetime record of 
more than eight years without a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin raising interest  
rates this week to slow the economy and fight inflation. Rubin, 
while stressing that he would not break his long practice of 
refusing to comment on actions by the politically independent Fed, 
said he believed a rise in interest rates should not threaten an 
end to America's good economic times. But he said a slowdown in the 
red-hot U.S. economy would make it even more important for Japan 
and Europe to do their parts to boost growth to keep the global 
recovery on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond talking about a long-awaited summer vacation to his  
favorite trout streams, Rubin was vague on his future plans. 
</P>
<P>
	He emphatically ruled out ever running for elective office, but  
he suggested he stood ready to help first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton if she runs for a Senate seat from New York. He also did 
not rule out returning to Washington at some future time, but he 
sidestepped questions about whether his return trip might be as a 
successor to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose current 
term ends next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My views on Alan Greenspan are no secret. I think he has done  
an outstanding job,'' Rubin said. ``I don't want to get ahead of 
another president in making this decision.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Bigger Budget Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton planned to announce a new  
proposal today for buttressing Social Security and Medicare, based 
on new White House projections that budget surpluses will be more 
than $1 trillion bigger over the next 15 years than were envisioned 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan, described by a senior administration  
official, included no dramatic increases in tax cuts. But the 
official did not rule out considering deeper tax reductions in 
discussions with congressional Republicans later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal was expected to add new fuel to his budget  
fight with Republicans on Capitol Hill, who want to use surpluses 
for far bigger tax cuts than he has so far offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The new administration numbers are being released days before  
the Congressional Budget Office plans to unveil its own 
projections. Those CBO numbers are expected to show somewhat higher 
surpluses than the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will propose setting aside $794 billion over the next 15  
years to strengthen Medicare, including providing new prescription 
drug benefits for the elderly, the official said. That is $108 
billion more than he proposed in February, when he released his 
fiscal 2000 budget. The official provided no other details about 
how Medicare would be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also said Clinton would propose setting aside an  
additional $543 billion for Social Security over the next 15 years, 
which he said would assure the program's solvency until 2053. 
</P>
<P>
	To strengthen the massive pension program for the elderly and  
disabled, the official said Clinton would use all Social Security 
payroll taxes for reducing the national debt, making them 
off-limits for other spending. After a decade, he would also credit 
the interest savings from the debt reduction to Social Security, 
which the official said would further lengthen Social Security's 
solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Clinton will project a $5  
billion surplus on the non-Social Security side of the budget, the 
first such surplus in four decades. Over the next 15 years, 
surpluses will be $1.08 trillion bigger than he projected in 
February, including $715 billion more from the non-Social Security 
side of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	That is significant because it is the non-Social Security side  
of the budget that Republicans want to use for tax cuts -- and that 
Clinton has so far resisted using for such purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will also propose increasing spending for defense and  
domestic programs such as veterans affairs, environmental 
protection, medical research and agriculture. The increase will be 
$41 billion over 15 years above his February proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the president will propose establishing a  
``children and education trust fund,'' designed to ensure healthy 
financing for programs such as Head Start and school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current fiscal year, the administration now expects an  
overall budget surplus of $99 billion, the biggest ever and $20 
billion more than it projected in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements are due to a stronger performance by the  
economy than the administration projected in February, when Clinton 
released his budget.

last day of the U.S. Cycling Federation's Road Cycling 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Holden, a member of the 1999 Pan American Games team, has won  
four time trial titles during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	She won with a time of 39 minutes, 39.02 seconds, 32 seconds  
ahead of runner-up Elizabeth Emery of Albuquerque, N.M.

</P>
<P>
	Levi Leipheimer of Windsor, Calif., won his first national road  
cycling championship with a time of 35:31.49, beating runner-up 
Steve Hegg -- a 1984 Olympic gold medalist from Carlsbad, Calif. -- 
by 27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Uhl, of Persakie, Pa., and Kimberley Geist, of Emmaus,  
Pa., were the only riders to win all three events -- criterium, road

<HEADLINE> Martin Said Not a Crossover Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The songwriter behind ``Livin' La  
Vida Loca'' says Ricky Martin can't be considered a ``crossover'' 
success until more of America hears his songs in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Songwriter Robi Rosa, whose ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' propelled  
Martin to stardom, said he is saddened that Martin's previous work 
in Spanish -- including his breakthrough album ``Vuelve''-- has been 
ignored by U.S. fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ricky Martin were to sing in Spanish, if `Vuelve' were to  
become No. 1 in the American charts in Spanish ... that's a 
crossover,'' Rosa told Puerto Rico's El Mundo newspaper on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bit of racism in the game,'' Rosa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosa, a former bandmate of Martin's in the teen pop group  
Menudo, penned most of Martin's hits and the majority of songs on 
the English ``Ricky Martin'' album, now a best seller on the U.S. 
charts.

<HEADLINE> Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- While Ken Dryden never thought of  
himself as being a scholar-athlete, he's grateful to be honored as 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just somebody who loved to play and loved to learn,'' the  
general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs said Sunday as he and 19 
others were inducted into the new International Scholar-Athlete 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryden was among six inductees who attended Sunday's ceremony at  
the Hall, of Fame, located at the University of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Six inductees were honored posthumously on Sunday, including  
tennis great Arthur Ashe and Paul Robeson, a singer and actor who 
was an All-American football player and a top student at Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees included former Presidents George Bush and  
Gerald Ford, neither of whom attended the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Another inductee, presidential candidate Bill Bradley, visited  
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame pays tribute to people like Dryden who weren't  
just good athletes, but who also had outstanding academic careers 
or have made intellectual or artistic contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven NHL seasons, Dryden was the goalie that helped lead the  
Canadiens to six Stanley Cup championships in the 1970s. He also 
completed his law degree from McGill University while playing. 
Since leaving the game as a player, Dryden has written several 
best-selling books, including one about hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also addressed 1,500 teenagers participating in the U.S.  
Scholar-Athlete Games, the start of which at the University of 
Rhode Island coincided with the opening of the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a Rhodes Scholar who played for New York Knicks teams  
that won championships in 1970 and '73, said sports aren't 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``An athlete's body only lasts a short period. But an athlete's  
mind lasts forever,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a discussion before the induction ceremony, panelists  
lamented the condition of college athletics -- where Plato's idea of 
the mind being just as important as the body is sometimes given 
little weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never reach the theoretical epitome that we'd like,''  
said Dr. John Lucas, an Olympic historian and professor emeritus at 
Penn State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Lucas, ``I consider college athletics a worthy  
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Doyle Jr., executive director of the Institute for  
International Sport, which owns the Hall of Fame, said more needs 
to be done to encourage athletes to take academics seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the United States and around the world, we tend to honor  
the great athlete,'' said Doyle, a former college basketball player 
and coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile, we praise the scholar-athlete and never really  
honor him or her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame was built with  
the help of a $1 million donation from Rhode Island philanthropist 
Alan Shawn Feinstein, with additional funds raised by the Institute 
for International Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be used as a year-round educational and resource center,  
and includes an exhibition and museum showcasing memorabilia of the 
inductees, a library of books and periodicals, and a sports 
photography gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also serve as the headquarters for the quadrennial World  
Scholar-Athlete Games scheduled for June 2001, and for the U.S. 
Scholar-Athlete Games, which started Sunday and run through July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 scholar-athletes, including one from ancient times,  
will be inducted into the hall every two years.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar drifted higher against the yen  
early Tuesday following the release of mixed Japanese economic 
data. Tokyo share prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.49 yen in early trading, up 0.21 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.21 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 85.22 points,  
or 0.48 percent, to 17,695.80 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Monday, the average closed up 174.06 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry released  
preliminary industrial production data for May showing a 0.7 
percent drop in output from April. Market expectations had been for 
a 1.0 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Management and Coordination Agency said the  
unemployment rate eased to 4.6 percent in May from a record high 
4.8 percent in the previous two months, as some jobless people 
stopped looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	When people stop looking for work, they are no longer counted in  
the labor force in Japan, so it's possible for the jobless rate to 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agency said spending by Japanese wage-earners in May  
was 336,354 yen (dlrs 2,780) on average, up 1.5 percent from the 
year-earlier month in real terms despite declining incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can draw no conclusions from this data about the state of  
Japan's economy,'' said a Tokyo trust bank dealer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Early currency trading was thin, however, as many market players  
remained hesitant to take new positions ahead of this week's 
meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate committee 
starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to nudge interest rates higher during  
its two-day meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.72 yen, down  
from 126.43 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the better-than-expected jobless data led  
some investors to continue buying, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting Tokyo stocks was an overnight rise on Wall  
Street as investors there regained optimism about interest rates, 
surmising that the Fed would implement only a small increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 points, or 1  
percent, to 10,655.15 at Monday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.7700 percent from 1.7800 percent late Monday in 
Tokyo, driving its price up to 100.25 yen from 100.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> Ford Dealer Settles Harassment Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A car dealership has paid $125,000 to four men who  
claimed they were sexually harassed by their male boss, the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement resolves a complaint filed in U.S. District Court  
in Boston alleging that the four salesmen were subjected to 
continuing acts of sexual harassment between 1993 and 1995, said 
Katherine Bissell, an attorney at the EEOC's New York District 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The men worked at the H.J. Nassar Motor Company, Inc., in  
Lawrence, Mass., and were allegedly subjected to varying degrees of 
sexual harassment by their manager, including touching and verbal 
remarks, Bissell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales manager's name was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Ford dealership, Henry Nassar, confirmed the  
settlement but declined to comment further. His attorney, David 
Fox, did not immediately return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was approved on May 25. The men -- who will each  
get about $31,000 -- were paid last week, Bissell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men, as well as the sales manager, are no longer  
working at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely an unusual case in terms of the gender,''  
Bissell said. ``Most of the harassment cases are females 
complaining about men.''

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Full of Single Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Valley has earned a dubious  
distinction: it is now home to more unattached men than any other 
major metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	As of October, there were 5,372 more single men than women aged  
20 to 45 in Santa Clara County, according to census data and market 
updates compiled by Claritas Inc., a marketing information company 
in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech professions have traditionally attracted more men than  
women and the study gives the latest picture of the disparity in 
America's technology capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough scene out there,'' said Rich Gosse, chairman of  
San Rafael-based American Singles, a nonprofit organization that 
held a singles convention Saturday at a hotel in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I throw a party there or give seminars on  
relationships, you always see more men than women. And this is the 
only place in the whole country where this happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anchorage, Alaska, where 52 percent of the population is male,  
still has the largest guy surplus in percentage terms. But Santa 
Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, is 50.4 percent male, 
which means it reigns in sheer numbers of available bachelors. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston and  
Philadelphia all have single-guy deficits that run into the tens 
and even hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Men here complain they outnumber women 3-to-1 in bars and  
restaurants some nights. Guys who might be snatched up quickly in 
other cities have to work hard here just to get a date, the San 
Jose Mercury News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Browder, a software engineer in San Mateo with a nearly  
six-figure salary, Stanford degree and down-to-earth Midwestern 
manners, hasn't had a girlfriend in about a year, and has had only 
three or four dates since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are less receptive here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Grey, 29, an Internet sales representative in Mountain  
View who is happily single, says the solitude is often 
self-induced. When the choice is going out with a woman or 
debugging a program, many choose the latter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Valley's high-tech female workers also may contribute to  
the date deficit. Many make such good incomes that their standards, 
too, are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want somebody that has a good income and lives in a nice  
house, an entrepreneur,'' said Mindy Atwal, a mortgage broker who 
makes nearly $100,000 herself and would like to find someone who 
earns more. ``Otherwise, why bother with a man? I can be single and 
happy.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus May Be Even Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed buttressing  
Social Security and Medicare, using new White House projections 
that budget surpluses will be more than $1 trillion bigger over the 
next 15 years than were envisioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a chance to do even more to use the fruits of our  
prosperity today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow -- indeed 
for tomorrows well into the 21st century,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan included no dramatic increases in the targeted tax cuts  
he proposed earlier this year. But the president did not rule out 
considering deeper tax reductions in discussions with congressional 
Republicans later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the framework of achieving these objectives, obviously  
I'll be working with the Congress to achieve them,'' Clinton said 
before departing for political fund-raisers in New York and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal was expected to add new fuel to his budget  
fight with Republicans on Capitol Hill, who want to use surpluses 
for far bigger tax cuts than he has offered. Initial GOP reaction 
was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he means what he says, he's reversing Democratic plans to  
spend the Social Security trust fund on more Washington programs 
and following the congressional Republicans' lead in locking away 
Americans' retirement security,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman 
for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The new administration numbers were released days before the  
Congressional Budget Office plans to unveil its own projections. 
Those CBO numbers are expected to show somewhat higher surpluses 
than the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed setting aside $794 billion over the next 15  
years to strengthen Medicare, including providing new prescription 
drug benefits for the elderly. That is $108 billion more than he 
proposed in February, when he released his fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``By taking additional measures to increase competition, combat  
fraud and reduce costs, we can provide a new prescription drug 
benefit and still pay down our national debt,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president plans to offer on Tuesday the details about how he  
would change Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed setting aside an additional $543 billion for  
Social Security over the next 15 years, which he said would assure 
the program's solvency until 2053. 
</P>
<P>
	To strengthen the massive pension program for the elderly and  
disabled, Clinton said he would use all Social Security payroll 
taxes for reducing the national debt, making them off-limits for 
other spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security.  
Period,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade, he would also credit the interest savings from  
the debt reduction to Social Security, which a senior 
administration official said would further lengthen Social 
Security's solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing beside an oversized graph showing a plunging national  
debt, Clinton declared: ``We have now cut up Washington's credit 
card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By 2015, this country can be entirely out of debt ... if we do  
not squander the surplus by choosing short-term gain over long-term 
national goals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's reference was apparently to debt held by the public,  
which currently represents more than half of the $5.7 trillion 
total debt. The rest is debt the government owes itself, such as 
money it has already spent from Social Security trust funds that 
must be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Clinton will project a $5  
billion surplus on the non-Social Security side of the budget, the 
first such surplus in four decades. Over the next 15 years, 
surpluses will be $1.08 trillion bigger than he projected in 
February, including $715 billion more from the non-Social Security 
side of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	That is significant because it is the non-Social Security side  
of the budget that Republicans want to use for tax cuts -- and that 
Clinton has so far resisted using for such purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will also propose increasing spending for defense and  
domestic programs such as veterans affairs, environmental 
protection, medical research and agriculture. The increase will be 
$41 billion over 15 years above his February proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the president proposed a ``children and education  
trust fund,'' designed to ensure healthy financing for programs 
such as Head Start and school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current fiscal year, the administration now expects an  
overall budget surplus of $99 billion, the biggest ever and $20 
billion more than it projected in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements are due to a stronger performance by the  
economy than the administration projected in February, when Clinton 
released his budget.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Cops Urge Citizen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Committed to millions of dollars in overtime,  
stepped-up police patrols and the public posting of suspects' 
mugshots, the police chief of the nation's capital on Monday urged 
witnesses and anyone else with information about violent crimes to 
speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a few cases like the (Helen) Foster-El case where the  
citizens came forward immediately and helped,'' said Chief Charles 
Ramsey. Citizen tips have led to four arrests in the death of 
Foster-El, killed in the crossfire of a daylight gunbattle. She was 
hustling children to safety when she was hit by two of more than 20 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of the 55-year-old woman shocked the community, and  
broke what D.C. Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis called the 
``safety of silence.'' But Ramsey said in many instances, people 
still aren't coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage community help in tracking down criminals, the  
chief has rolled out plans for a ``D.C. Most Wanted List.'' The 
names, photographs and descriptions of up to 30 of the district's 
most dangerous suspects will be posted throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent violence, district officials say serious  
crime is 15 percent below last year's levels, continuing a downward 
trend that began three years ago. As of Sunday, 115 murders had 
been reported, compared with 119 for the same period of 1998. A 
total of 261 homicides were recorded last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's 3,500 police officers are working overtime in an  
effort to make the city safer. Ramsey extended the shifts of about 
300 officers by four hours on Saturday in response to Friday night 
shootings that killed one and wounded six, including a woman and 
her 5-month-old son who were injured when two masked men opened 
fire on an apartment building stoop, killing a man sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	In another incident, four people were wounded in what police  
describe as a gunfight between rival gangs following a dance at the 
Latin American Youth Center. As of Monday afternoon, there were no 
arrests in either case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since mid-April, when 16 people were murdered in a single week,  
Ramsey has supervised a $3 million anticrime initiative that has 
hundreds of officers working at least one overtime shift each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The force has made nearly 400 felony arrests and 939 misdemeanor  
arrests since April 28, said its commander, Capt. Mark Beach. 
``We've seized more than $94,000 cash, 37 guns, about $170,000 in 
illegal drugs, and 116 vehicles,'' Beach said, adding that the 
intent is to stop drug activity and find illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long-term impact is uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't solve a problem like street violence with $3 million  
in police overtime,'' said community activist Dorothy Brizill. 
``When the dust settles, it will still be there.''

<HEADLINE> 'Big Daddy' a Big Hit at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Adam Sandler is back on top -- again.  
</P>
<P>
	The funnyman's ``Big Daddy'' debut knocked off both Austin  
Powers and Tarzan to lead the weekend box office with $41.2 million 
in ticket sales, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The animated version of ``Tarzan'' moved to No. 2 with $23.5  
million. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' dropped to the 
No. 3 spot with $18.5 million in sales, according to industry 
estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This past weekend could become one of the biggest non-holiday  
weekends ever, said Paul Dergarabedian, a film industry analyst 
with Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. The top 12 films were up about 1 
percent over last weekend's banner showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of big films out there and the audience is  
expanding,'' Dergarabedian said. ``We're seeing astronomical 
numbers. There are films out there for every type of audience, 
combined with very effective marketing campaigns means very big 
numbers for all the films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This also means that staying No. 1 is difficult, he said. Each  
week, the top film is knocked off its perch but the No. 2 and No. 3 
films were still doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler plays a 32-year-old New York City  
tollbooth worker who's forced to grow up when he suddenly must care 
for a 5-year-old orphan, played by identical twins Cole and Dylan 
Sprouse. 
</P>
<P>
	As a new father, Sandler combines his two film personas -- the  
juvenile clown of the massive hit ``The Waterboy,'' and the likable 
romantic of ``The Wedding Singer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy'' was the second largest grossing comedy opening  
ever, just behind ``Austin Powers,'' which opened with $54 million 
two weeks ago, and was the biggest nonsequel comedy opening ever, 
Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tarzan,'' featuring the voices of Minni Driver, Rosie  
O'Donnell and Tony Goldwyn, and songs by Phil Collins, dropped only 
31 percent from its debut last weekend, said Chuck Viane, president 
of distribution of Buena Vista pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers,'' the quirky comedy sequel with Mike Myers  
returning as both the international mystery man and Powers' 
bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil, has become the highest grossing film for 
New Line Cinema. The film's three week total of $150.8 million beat 
its former biggest hit ``Rush Hour,'' which brought in $144 million 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta's ``The General's Daughter'' was No. 4 with $15.6  
million, while ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' 
remained strong, taking No. 5 with $14.6 million and a six-week 
total of $352.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the box office, the Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romance,  
``Notting Hill'' dropped one place to No. 6 with $5.1 million and 
``The Mummy'' was in seventh place with $2.1 million in ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instinct'' was in eighth with $1.9 million, ``An Ideal  
Husband'' moved to ninth in its second week with $1.1 million and 
``The Matrix'' dropped to No. 10 with $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Big Daddy,'' $42.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Tarzan,'' $23.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $18.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The General's Daughter,'' $15.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $14.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Notting Hill,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Mummy,'' $2.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Instinct,'' $1.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``An Ideal Husband,'' $1.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Matrix,'' $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Man Says He Fathered Baby To Kill It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- Ronald L. Shanabarger planned his revenge  
against his wife for several years: He wanted to father their son 
and then kill him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told police he planned the crime as a way of  
exacting punishment on his wife, Amy, who had refused to cut short 
a vacation to comfort him when his father passed away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shanabarger said he planned to make Amy feel the way he did  
when his father died,'' according to an affidavit prosecutors filed 
to support a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, just hours after the funeral of his  
seven-month-old son, Tyler, Shanabarger confessed to his wife that 
he'd killed their son. A coroner had ruled the infant died from 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Shanabarger allegedly told police he suffocated  
his infant son with plastic wrap. He told officers he dreamed up 
the crime after his father died in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit said Shanabarger's plan included marrying Amy and  
getting her pregnant. He then ``allowed time for her to bond with 
the child, and then took his life,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, 30, who begged officers to shoot him after he  
confessed last Wednesday, is being held without bail. He is due in 
court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson County Prosecutor Lance Hamner hasn't decided whether to  
seek the death penalty because the investigation is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most bizarre case that I've ever had any dealings  
with and probably the most bizarre motive I've ever heard of,'' 
Hamner said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his confession, Shanabarger said that on the evening of June  
19, he wrapped plastic wrap around his son's head and face, then 
left the boy's nursery to get something to eat and brush his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes later, he said, he returned, removed the plastic  
and placed Tyler face down in the crib before he went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Shanabarger, 29, had been working that night at her job as a  
cashier at a grocery store. When she came home, she went straight 
to bed, assuming that Tyler was asleep, and found the boy's body 
the next morning -- Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, who worked at a tire retreading center, told police  
he confessed because the image of his son's face -- flat and 
purplish from rigor mortis -- haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's confessed at least three times, Police Chief  
Harry Furrer said Sunday. Each time, the story has been the same -- 
that he hatched his plan because he was enraged by his 
then-girlfriend's refusal to cut short a cruise and return home 
after his father's death in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shanabargers were married the following May.  
</P>
<P>
	Detectives, who have interviewed relatives, confirmed that  
Shanabarger had long resented Amy's refusal to cut the cruise 
short, Furrer said. ``Their statements substantiate his 
confession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Randy Maynard, a volunteer chaplain for Franklin  
police, accompanied officers to the couple's home in this town 
south of Indianapolis on Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	While most parents of children who die from SIDS are weeping and  
consoling each other when authorities arrive, Maynard said 
Shanabarger was cold, distant and offered no comfort to his sobbing 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Mrs. Shanabarger's parents arrived later that morning,  
Shanabarger gave his father-in-law a Father's Day gift -- a 
gift-wrapped commemorative knife -- Maynard said. Shanabarger then 
passed the knife around, showing it to the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really struck me as odd,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maynard said he's still troubled by the image of Tyler's tiny  
face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a beautiful boy,'' he said. ``Even in death, he was  
just the most beautiful boy. I'm still getting goose bumps thinking 
about this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger's father-in-law, Robert Parsons, wears a tiny gold  
cherub pin to remind him of his grandson, who was born Thanksgiving 
Day. He won't discuss his son-in-law, but says his daughter, an 
only child, is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people to just to talk about a six- or  
seven-month-old infant -- a nameless, faceless infant. He was a 
little boy, he played, he laughed, he loved. We loved him dearly 
and that's what this is all about,'' said Parsons, 52. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want vengeance, but we do want justice.''  
</P>
<P>
	Neil S. Kaye, a forensic psychiatrist who specializes in  
investigating infanticide cases committed by fathers, said he's 
never heard of a similar crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times people say this or that crime was just too  
complicated of a plan to be anything other than a sign of pure 
wickedness,'' said Kaye, of Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	``But science would say otherwise, that this man was delusional  
and you have to wonder about his overall mental state, his mental 
capacity,'' said Kaye.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose again in May  
but their spending climbed much faster, contributing to another 
all-time low in the nation's savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government  
benefits -- rose 0.4 percent last month, the Commerce Department 
said today. Spending, however, went up 0.6 percent in the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In May the savings rate fell to a minus 1.2 percent, even worse  
than the previous record of minus 1.0 percent in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	Torrid consumer spending propelled the nation's economic growth,  
which rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three 
months of this year. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at an 
record high -- despite the prospects that the Federal Reserve will 
begin to raise short-term interest rates at its meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.6 percent gain in spending in May followed gains of 0.5  
percent in April, 0.6 percent in March, 0.9 percent in February and 
0.5 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last at  
least three years such as washing machines and cars -- rose 2.2 in 
May. That followed two months of declines 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel, also  
increased 0.5 percent and spending on services rose 0.3 percent in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years  
and high demand for labor -- with labor shortages in some regions 
and industries, helping to boost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, wages rose 0.5 percent, following a 0.6 percent increase  
the previous month. However, wages for farm workers dropped 13.8 
percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that one of the major reasons why Americans  
have let their savings rate fall into negative territory is because 
the stock market is at record highs, boosting Americans' net worth 
and making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to 
fund their spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong consumer spending has been the major factor pushing  
up economic growth this year. With unemployment at the lowest level 
in three decades, the Fed has begun to worry that tight labor 
markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave  
strong hints that the central bank would begin raising interest 
rates this Wednesday in an effort to slow the economy and keep 
inflation under control.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Returns Refugees to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After two weeks of watching  
displaced ethnic Albanians flood home on their own, the first 
refugees returned today to Kosovo in a U.N.-organized bus convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining Serbs observed a bitter anniversary, meanwhile, at a  
revered medieval battle site. 
</P>
<P>
	And under an agreement signed by NATO and the Kosovo Liberation  
Army on June 21, the rebels face a deadline of midnight tonight to 
establish secure weapons storage sites and vacate fighting 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the key day -- by midnight tonight we expect to have  
the KLA into those designated assembly areas,'' said NATO's supreme 
commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with BBC radio, Clark said the KLA commanders  
have been cooperating well with demilitarization since the 78-day 
NATO air war with Yugoslavia ended but the ``issue is how the 
individual members do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is terrible anger here, terrible things have been done  
to Kosovar Albanians,'' he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Busloads of Kosovo Albanians returned home today from tent camps  
in neighboring Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven buses with about 320 refugees, escorted by representatives  
of the U.N. High Commissioners for Refugees, left the Stenkovec 1 
camp. Dozens of others were picked up at Stenkovec 2 for the trip 
to Pristina, the Kosovo capital. 
</P>
<P>
	After less than three hours, the buses arrived in Pristina,  
where each of the refugees received an UNHCR daily ration. ``I am 
very happy we came back,'' said Luljeta Sherifi, 20, upon arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of refugees have ignored pleas to delay  
their returns until land mines can be cleared and the province made 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 415,000 ethnic Albanians have streamed home since Serb  
troops began leaving Kosovo and NATO peacekeepers started deploying 
two weeks ago under a peace plan, UNHCR officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 860,000 refugees are believed to have fled Kosovo in  
a Serb crackdown during NATO's bombing campaign that started March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees leaving today were carefully selected to ensure  
they wouldn't have any special problems on return. All had a house 
or relatives in Pristina with whom they could stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The swift and uncontrolled return of refugees has complicated  
NATO's efforts. Many ethnic Albanians brutally forced from their 
homes by Serb soldiers during a crackdown before and during NATO's 
bombing campaign are taking revenge as they return to find homes 
destroyed and relatives slain. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's Kosovo commander, British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, said he  
hopes the arrival of Russian peacekeepers will make Serbs feel 
safer, but reports of more revenge attacks did little to boost 
their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Russian cargo planes carrying troops, weapons and airport  
equipment left for Kosovo today as part of Moscow's peacekeeping 
efforts in the Serbian province, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, traditional allies of their Slavic brethren in  
Serbia, are preparing to send 3,600 peacekeepers to join a NATO 
force that eventually will include 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly Serbs -- many complaining of beatings -- sought shelter  
Sunday in a Serbian Orthodox monastery as ethnic Albanians burned 
and looted the village of Belo Polje in western Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unrest, Serbian Orthodox Church leaders celebrated  
Mass today to observe Vidovdan, or St. Vitus Day, the 610th 
anniversary of an epic battle against Ottoman Turks at Kosovo Polje 
near Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Gracanica, a historic monastery, Patriarch Pavle held  
an incense-scented Mass, reclaiming for his church the emotional 
anniversary he says had been hijacked by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb defeat in the 1389, followed by 500 years of Turkish  
domination, has taken on mythological symbolism over the centuries 
as the foundation of Serb nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Vidovdan differs from the previous ones,'' he was quoted  
on Sunday as saying. ``There will be no hypocrisy in it, (and) in 
its celebration the godless leaders of our people will take no 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was an apparent reference to Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic, whom the influential church earlier this month urged to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the church's holiest sites are in Kosovo. Since NATO's  
bombing forced Milosevic to accept a peace plan and withdraw his 
troops, the church has worried that monasteries and other holy 
sites will be left unprotected from vandalism by mostly Muslim 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the persisting violence and ethnic tensions in the  
battle-scarred province, the peaceful return of some 800 ethnic 
Albanians to return to work as former employees of Pristina radio 
and television stood out as an exception and a model for settling 
future disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Calmly and without violence, they entered the station building  
today after a deal was struck to have them return to their old jobs 
that they were either forced to leave or abandoned in protest of 
the Serb repression in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the radio began broadcasting in Albanian language, with  
an interview with the spokesman for the KLA press service. 
</P>
<P>
	Around that time, NATO peacekeepers cordoned off the block  
surrounding the radio after a group of young men yelled there was a 
bomb in a car and ran away, witnesses said.

hopes the arrival of Russian peacekeepers will make Serbs feel 
safer, but reports of more revenge attacks did little to boost 
their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Russian cargo planes carrying troops, weapons and airport  
equipment left for Kosovo today as part of Moscow's peacekeeping 
efforts in the Serbian province, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, traditional allies of their Slavic brethren in  
Serbia, are preparing to send 3,600 peacekeepers to join a NATO 
force that eventually will include 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly Serbs -- many complaining of beatings -- sought shelter  
Sunday in a Serbian Orthodox monastery as ethnic Albanians burned 
and looted the village of Belo Polje in western Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unrest, Serbian Orthodox Church leaders celebrated  
Mass today to observe Vidovdan, or St. Vitus Day, the 610th 
anniversary of an epic battle against Ottoman Turks at Kosovo Polje 
near Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Gracanica, a historic monastery, Patriarch Pavle held  
an incense-scented Mass, reclaiming for his church the emotional 
anniversary he says had been hijacked by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb defeat in the 1389, followed by 500 years of Turkish  
domination, has taken on mythological symbolism over the centuries 
as the foundation of Serb nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Vidovdan differs from the previous ones,'' he was quoted  
on Sunday as saying. ``There will be no hypocrisy in it, (and) in 
its celebration the godless leaders of our people will take no 
part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was an apparent reference to Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic, whom the influential church earlier this month urged to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the church's holiest sites are in Kosovo. Since NATO's  
bombing forced Milosevic to accept a peace plan and withdraw his 
troops, the church has worried that monasteries and other holy 
sites will be left unprotected from vandalism by mostly Muslim 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the persisting violence and ethnic tensions in the  
battle-scarred province, the peaceful return of some 800 ethnic 
Albanians to return to work as former employees of Pristina radio 
and television stood out as an exception and a model for settling 
future disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Calmly and without violence, they entered the station building  
today after a deal was struck to have them return to their old jobs 
that they were either forced to leave or abandoned in protest of 
the Serb repression in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the radio began broadcasting in Albanian language, with  
an interview with the spokesman for the KLA press service. 
</P>
<P>
	Around that time, NATO peacekeepers cordoned off the block  
surrounding the radio after a group of young men yelled there was a 
bomb in a car and ran away, witnesses said.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Deal Draws Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESSEXVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. calls a $3.2 billion  
proposal to settle silicone breast implant lawsuits the best 
compromise available. Lawyers for several groups, including foreign 
women, call it unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposing views emerged Monday during the opening of a  
hearing of Dow Corning's $4.5 billion bankruptcy restructuring 
plan. More than 170,000 women sued the company, saying implants 
made by Dow Corning or filled with Dow Corning material caused 
various health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the implant-settlement plan, Dow Corning will ``pay far  
more than it had ever offered to pay before, and more than it ever 
thought it needed to pay,'' company attorney Barbara Houser told 
the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for women who blame illnesses on Dow Corning  
silicone breast implants to get between $12,000 and $300,000 each. 
Women also could receive up to $25,000 for ruptured or leaking 
implants, and up to $5,000 for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan also proposes to pay about 23,000 women in foreign  
countries 40 percent or 65 percent less, depending on where they 
live. Dow Corning said that was due to lower medical costs and 
different economic conditions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for women in several countries said the reductions made  
no sense and the plan should be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we're the iceberg in front of the Titanic,'' said David  
Goroff, who represents 1,800 Australian women. ``Miss Houser tells 
us the plan is big, fast moving and a lot of people have bought 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys for foreign women argued the plan violated  
international treaties and put too many demands on Third World 
residents to produce medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized we were never going to break the logjam in this  
case ... without compromise,'' said Kenneth Eckstein, a lead 
attorney for the U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 112,774 women who earlier this year voted on the plan's  
terms, 94 percent approved. But women in countries where payments 
would be reduced 65 percent narrowly failed to approve the 
settlement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who reject the money and still want to sue, Dow  
Corning would set aside up to $400 million to cover any costs of 
defending such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial institutions that hold $1.3 billion in Dow Corning  
debt voted against their part of the plan even though it pays them 
in full, saying the interest rate set by the company was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Justice has objected, saying the plan is  
insufficient to pay for the health care the government has provided 
for people with silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is being held in the auditorium of Garber High  
School in Essexville, Mich., about 100 miles northwest of Detroit, 
because it is the largest space near the bankruptcy court in Bay 
City, Mich., that can handle an expected throng of lawyers and 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, nearly 30 lawyers were crowded on the stage,  
cross-examining witnesses. The hearing is expected to last several 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Nathan's Annual Holiday Chow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The year was 1916, the place Coney Island.  
Beneath the blazing Fourth of July sun, a crew of gastronomic 
pioneers gathered to launch the first Nathan's hot dog eating 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, Jim Mullen, lives only in hot dog history -- but 83  
years later, his legacy endures. Nathan's annual holiday chow-down 
survives as the granddaddy of publicity stunts, an event that's 
all-beef and pure Americana. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is THE great patriotic event -- hot dog eating! It's  
amazing!'' says the ever-understated George Shea, chief publicity 
man for the contest since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The dogged pursuit of the tube-steak title is now covered by  
television crews from Europe, Asia and South America. Last year, 
Sports Illustrated profiled Japanese wonder eater Hirofumi 
Nakajima, the two-time defending champion. Two years ago, a film 
crew did an award-winning ``dogumentary'' on the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Why all the fuss about an extravaganza where an upset stomach is  
as likely as an upset victory? 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sporting event for the everyman,'' explains  
filmmaker Mark Litman, co-director of the film ``Red, White and 
Yellow,'' its title an homage to the coveted mustard-colored belt 
that goes to the wiener -- er, winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You take a guy like Ed Krachie from Queens, and for one day,  
he gets the spotlight,'' Litman continues. ``He doesn't have to be 
Michael Jackson or Michael Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krachie is more like Jackson and Jordan combined: a 6-foot-7,  
360-pound man known affectionately as ``The Animal.'' After winning 
the title twice in the last four years, Krachie is taking a year 
off to ``reinvent himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, like Madonna does every couple of years,'' the  
mechanical engineer says, semi-seriously. ``Maybe lose 100 pounds 
and come out all buff for next year's contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not. Krachie was known to celebrate his victories by  
heading to a backyard barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Krachie's absence is quite a loss: He remains the American  
record holder with 22 1/4 dogs -- eaten with buns -- in the allotted 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the 5-foot-8, 135-pound Nakajima returns from Japan  
to challenge his own world record of 24 1/2 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	It's perfect that Nathan's endures as the home of the world's  
greatest publicity stunt, a bit of hype that has survived 
everything from World War I to Watergate, from Vietnam to 
vegetarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Handwerker, the founder of the hot doggery that still  
stands at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues, launched his 
business in 1916 with one of the all-time great stunts. He 
introduced a nickel hot dog, undercutting his competition's 10-cent 
frank. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition spread rumors that the cheaper dog was inferior.  
Handwerker responded by fitting a collection of local residents 
with white lab coats and announcing they were from Coney Island 
Hospital. The ``doctors'' dined and declared the dogs fit for 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The stand, and the stunts, survived. The eating contest has been  
canceled only twice since its 1916 debut: in 1941, to protest the 
war in Europe, and in 1971, to protest the hippie lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Free hot dogs, yes. Free love, no.  
</P>
<P>
	The event hasn't skipped a belch since, turning hot dog eaters  
into heroes each July 4th. Its honor roll includes examples of the 
everyman (and woman) cited by moviemaker Litman: Brooklyn carnival 
worker Peter Washburn ... '30s arch-rivals Stan Libnitz and Andrew 
Rudman ... the lone female winner, German-born winner Gerta 
Hasselhoff ... the aptly-named Frank Dellarosa. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dellarosa, nicknamed ``Large,'' retired in 1995, he made a  
speech that echoed New York Yankees' great Lou Gehrig's emotional 
farewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Michael Jordan, I have realized that once you reach the  
top, the game is no longer challenging,'' said Dellarosa, who 
pounded 21 1/2 franks in 1991. ``I consider myself the luckiest man on 
the face of the Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amen. And pass the Pepto Bismol.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Have Own Agendas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As they were saying before the interruptions --  
impeachment, then Kosovo -- President Clinton and Republican leaders 
of Congress both want to get things done. 
</P>
<P>
	On their own terms.  
</P>
<P>
	Their outlines haven't changed much in six months since the  
president and the Republicans posted their agendas, but there's now 
the prospect of more money than when those 1999 programs were first 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that ought to make it easier for them to settle on  
a bipartisan budget, a pressure point coming up in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growing budget surplus Clinton announced -- and earmarked  
-- on Monday won't end his differences with the Republicans on how 
to use it, for GOP tax cuts or administration programs or both. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is forecasting an additional $1 trillion in  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years, and the president said it 
should be used first for Social Security and Medicare, including 
his proposal to add prescription medicine coverage. He also wants 
more spending on education, environmental, farm and veterans 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton began his domestic program push on Friday, with a speech  
and a 75-minute news conference, to change the emphasis now that 
the Kosovo air war is over. He said Republicans should join him to 
enact legislation that will add up to a summer ``season of 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They countered that they've got the best agenda, and said they  
will fight for major tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about where the debate was before the Senate tried and  
acquitted Clinton on sex scandal impeachment charges, before the 
NATO air war against Yugoslavia. It hadn't really been suspended, 
it only seemed so because the focus was elsewhere. And because 
nothing much had happened beyond skirmishing on Social Security 
reform, and a congressional budget the White House said was too 
skimpy on domestic needs and too tilted toward tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton got the first word in the new round of debate when he  
announced the increased budget surpluses, and what he wants done 
with them over the next 15 years, including a new $156 billion 
trust fund for children and education and an increase of $41 
billion for ``other core functions of our government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said his ``new budget framework will use part of  
the surplus to provide substantial tax relief'' targeted to 
specific aims and groups, including retirement savings, child care 
and home care of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's open to negotiations with Congress for more, but  
wants his objectives met first. That's the collision point. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do is to make sure that before we go off and  
start cutting taxes by some arbitrary large amount, we take care of 
first things first,'' Clinton said Friday. He said it would not be 
responsible to enact a tax cut that would take money from such 
things as education, health care and environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans say tax cuts should be a priority. ``We will  
fight for tax relief for working Americans,'' said House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	They want to cut capital gains taxes by half, end the so-called  
marriage penalty on two-career couples, eliminate the inheritance 
tax, and reduce other rates, too. 
</P>
<P>
	That would add up to $778 billion in tax cuts over 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there's much more to be accomplished before the  
approach of the 2000 elections makes everything more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be plenty of time for politics in the months to  
come,'' he said. ``This summer should be a season of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thought so last winter, too, when he delivered his State of  
the Union message as his impeachment trial began. It was, he said, 
the moment for action on programs to meet 21st century needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as now, he said he would work with Republicans for  
bipartisan accord. He urged action on bills for a minimum wage 
increase to $6.15 an hour, to protect the government health 
insurance of disabled people who get jobs, to overhaul campaign 
finance laws and to guarantee the rights of patients in managed 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are still on his priority list. The season and  
circumstances have changed. Agendas, and political suspicions, have 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said Clinton  
tells Republicans he wants to work with them, but hasn't been doing 
so. ``I mean, he runs into town, throws out supposedly an agenda, 
does nothing to make it happen and off he goes again.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coffee Trader Helping Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For coffee drinkers with a social conscience, a share of each  
coffee dollar now goes to fill the pockets of poor farmers instead 
of corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	An importer called Equal Exchange pays Third World coffee  
growers a guaranteed minimum price for their beans, while cutting 
out brokers and other middlemen to deliver the coffee directly from 
tree to table. 
</P>
<P>
	By helping individual farmers, it seeks also to link consumers  
more closely with the people who grow their food. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first entered the coffee industry in 1986, people  
laughed at us. They said, 'You can't make social changes and still 
make a profit,''' says executive director and co-founder Jonathan 
Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we set out to do it all together. We set out to create a  
new model of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equal Exchange, based in the Boston suburb of Canton, Mass., is  
one of a small number of U.S. companies to adopt the principles of 
the ``fair trade'' movement already well-established in Europe and 
Canada. Like other fair traders, it offers small-scale producers 
the unaccustomed benefits of price protection, long-term contracts 
and affordable credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company distributes coffee under its own brand -- Equal  
Exchange -- to supermarkets, food cooperatives and colleges in the 
United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they began selling to Equal Exchange, some farmers earned  
as little as 20 cents a pound for their coffee, Rosenthal says. Now 
they receive a minimum price of $1.26 a pound, plus a 15-cent 
premium for coffee grown without the use of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers at one Mexican cooperative, UCIRI, have used their  
higher earnings from sales to Equal Exchange to build better houses 
and roads, says union co-founder Francisco Vanderhoff Boersma. 
</P>
<P>
	UCIRI, a Spanish acronym for the Union of Indigenous Communities  
of the Isthmus Region, has saved enough from the sales to build a 
blue jean factory and start a bus company to serve villages in the 
rugged mountains of Mexico's Oaxaca state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our dealings with Equal Exchange have been outstanding,''  
Boersma says. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor farmers in another Mexican cooperative, La Union Majomut,  
have also seen their incomes grow from doing business with the U.S. 
company, says Monika Firl, a former consultant to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	But the entry of companies like Equal Exchange into the market  
hasn't been welcomed by all. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders and brokers have traditionally earned much of the profit  
from coffee sales, and many objected when farmers began selling 
directly to companies such as Equal Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, gunmen killed 37 UCIRI coffee farmers from the late  
1980s to the mid 1990s. Boersma, the union activist, blames 
outraged middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mainstream coffee companies like Folgers and General Foods tend  
to rely on the traders and brokers, paying prices that more closely 
mirror short-term fluctuations in the global coffee market. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one gourmet coffee shop chain -- Starbucks -- says it  
buys beans in such large quantities that it can't rely on small 
players like Equal Exchange to supply its 2,000-plus outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Equal Exchange's strategy for staying competitive with other  
gourmet coffee importers is to make do with smaller profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking people to pay more. What we discovered is  
that the industry is operating on pretty large profit margins,'' 
says co-founder and sales director Rink Dickinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's founders seem little interested in making millions  
for themselves. Rosenthal earns $55,000 a year and takes public 
transportation to work. Dickinson earns slightly less and drives a 
1990 Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
	Their idealism appears, so far, to be have made for good  
business. Equal Exchange has earned the loyalty of its suppliers -- 
democratically managed farmers' cooperatives -- ensuring a steady 
source of high-quality beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Still Equal Exchange remains a small player.  
</P>
<P>
	Its annual sales are about $5 million although it is growing.  
Its work force has risen from three, when it began operating in 
1986, to 30, while its supplier network has expanded from a single 
source in Nicaragua to include nine countries on three continents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make a profit. But they also want to change the  
terms of trade in coffee, which are hugely unjust,'' says Firl. 
</P>
<P>
	Vital to Equal Exchange is the low-interest financing it  
receives from religious orders and social activists like the 
Sisters of Charity of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	This cash cushion has enabled the firm to weather downturns in  
the coffee market when it had to sell at a loss, as in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Players Practice at New Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners moved into Safeco Field on  
Monday, taking their first official batting practice in their new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to see as many home runs as you saw in the  
Kingdome, that's for sure,'' first baseman David Segui said. ``It's 
going to be a lot more difficult to hit it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Griffey Jr. refused to talk to reporters about the Mariners'  
new $517 million ballpark, which opens officially on July 15 with a 
game against San Diego. He sent several balls flying as the 
Mariners took BP on an off day. 
</P>
<P>
	``How far does the ball travel?'' asked All-Star shortstop Alex  
Rodriguez, who skipped the practice and walked around the field in 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey and a few others hit at Safeco last week, but Monday's  
90-minute session was the Mariners' first official practice at the 
ballpark, which features a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kingdome, where Griffey hit 198 of his 377 career homers,  
was 312 feet down the right-field line, 380 feet to right-center 
alley, 405 to center, 389 to left-center and 331 down the 
left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeco Field's dimensions are 326 down the line in right, 386 to  
right-center, 405 to center, 390 to left-center and 331 down the 
line in left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's warmer than I thought it would be,'' Segui said as the  
Mariners hit with the roof closed. ``It's pretty nice in here right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners will be on the road for 12 games against Oakland,  
Texas, Anaheim and Los Angeles before the All-Star game in Boston 
on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kingdome, which can be seen from home plate over the  
left-field wall at Safeco Field, will be destroyed after the 
Seattle Seahawks finish the 1999 NFL season.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Threatening E-mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who e-mailed racially derogatory death  
threats to Hispanics around the nation was sentenced Monday to two 
years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingman Quon, 23, was sentenced for seven misdemeanor counts of  
interfering with federally protected activities. He faced up to 
seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon, a Chinese-American, told the judge he was sorry for his  
actions in which he allowed ``immaturity and frustrations'' to get 
the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon will not be allowed to use a computer or the Internet  
without permission of probation officials for a year following his 
release, a prosecutor said. He begins his sentence July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	While a student at California State Polytechnic University,  
Pomona, Quon sent the same derogatory e-mail in March 1998 to 42 
professors at California State University, Los Angeles, and 25 
students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes More Cancer Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore proposed increasing  
fivefold the number of patients participating in clinical trials of 
cancer treatments, one of a handful of medical initiatives offered 
Monday on a campaign visit to Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also set ambitious goals of reducing the number of cancer  
deaths by 200,000 by 2010 and identifying every gene that 
predisposes people to cancer by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to swing open the doors to the latest cancer clinical  
trials for Americans of all ages who don't have the luxury of 
time,'' Gore told about 200 researchers, doctors and members of 
cancer victim advocacy groups at Thomas Jefferson Medical College. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also used the Pennsylvania trip -- his second in nine days --  
to raise an expected $900,000 at fund-raisers in Pittsburgh and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president called for combating cancer with more funding  
at every level. He said he would double funding for cancer research 
at the National Institutes of Health over the next five years, 
allot more money for school-based prevention programs and offer a 
new advertising campaign to fight youth smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proposed expanding public health prevention programs for  
minority groups and the elderly and making available low-cost 
mammograms and other screening methods. He also called for efforts 
to develop blood tests for every kind of cancer within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is popular on Capitol Hill, even among conservative  
Republicans who generally oppose big government spending. Others in 
Congress also have expressed support for doubling the $15.6 billion 
NIH budget over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can reach the day when cancer is not the dreaded scourge it  
has been but a manageable, even curable, condition,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a cornerstone of his plan, Gore proposed broadening clinical  
trial enrollment by letting Medicare patients participate and 
requiring health insurance coverage for patients in trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3 percent of the 1.2 million cancer patients diagnosed each  
year participate in clinical trials, medical experts say. About 
564,000 people die annually from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's participation in clinical trials is much higher than  
among adults, and the survival rate reflects that, Gore said. About 
70 percent to 80 percent of children cancer victims survive for at 
least five years, while the five-year survival rate for adults is 
about 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Meyer, whose 3-year-old son successfully battled  
cancer after participating in a clinical trial, said she found 
Gore's speech encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support more funding and getting the adults to participate  
in clinical trials,'' said Mrs. Meyer of Middletown, Del. ``The 
more people who participate, the more they learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing participation in trials is critical to advancing  
cancer research, said Dr. Ronald Haberman, director of the 
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a central bottleneck in progress in cancer research,'' he  
said. ``Right now, only between 2 and 3 percent of cancer patients 
go into clinical trials, so to be able to increase that in a major 
way would be to increase the progress in finding acceptable 
treatments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins welcomed  
Gore's support for doubling cancer research funding, but said, ``We 
just wonder where he's been the last six years.'' He said the 
GOP-led Congress has supported more funding in spite of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 protesters from ACT UP Philadelphia showed up at  
Gore's evening fund-raiser, contending trade policies he supports 
are making it difficult to get affordable AIDS drugs to people who 
need them in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Pittsburgh, about 150 people attended a  
$1,000-a-plate lunch organized by Mayor Tom Murphy and U.S. Rep. 
Frank Mascara, D-Pa.

<HEADLINE> Schwarzenegger at Special Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger was an hour late to  
the Special Olympics' weightlifting venue, but that didn't bother 
Dave and Iris Sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greensboro couple was there only to see their 46-year-old  
son, Marty, who was competing in his sixth Special Olympics. Sheets 
was one of only four athletes from North Carolina entered in the 
first Special Olympics held in Chicago in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy he gets the opportunity to compete,'' Iris  
Sheets said Monday. ``It means so much to him. It makes him happy, 
so it makes us happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The competition started at 10 a.m., and Schwarzenegger appeared  
at 11 a.m. from behind a curtain in an army-green T-shirt, khaki 
shorts and black gym shoes. He was greeted with a flurry of camera 
flashes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sheets, the lone North Carolinian entered in the  
powerlifting competition, drew the loudest cheers when he 
bench-pressed 154 pounds. After setting the bar down, he leaped off 
the bench, arms raised, and gave Schwarzenegger a vigorous 
handshake as he left the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted how far powerlifting has come in the Special  
Olympics,'' Schwarzenegger told the crowd. ``In 1976, I did this 
three-week program to study what impact powerlifting would have on 
Special Olympics. At that time, they were afraid to include 
powerlifting. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we ran that clinic and not only did it help the Special  
Olympians physically with their strength and conditioning, it also 
gave them tremendous self-esteem. Now, there are more than 200 
athletes in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzenegger, whose mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver  
started the Special Olympics, later participated in a clinic with 
Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski and N.C. State coach Herb 
Sendek for coaches of the Special Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski joked that he was Schwarzenegger's physical trainer  
in the former Mr. Universe's formative years. Schwarzenegger 
countered that they actually met for the first time when Krzyzewski 
asked to pose in a ``before'' photo for the action-movie star. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski told about 30 coaches that relationships that develop  
between athletes and coaches transcends the importance of winning 
and losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most beautiful thing developed in a relationship between a  
coach and an athlete is trust,'' Krzyzewski said. ``When you trust 
one another, you can help each other get past limits. That's what 
this event is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking at the clinic was Chris Antley, the jockey who  
rode Charismatic to victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
Antley, who has battled drug and alcohol addiction, likened his 
struggles to those of the Special Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it's like to dig down deep into yourself,'' Antley  
said. ``This year, I almost won the Triple Crown. I didn't get 
there but even though failing hurt, I think I've got it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the thrill in their eyes, I see their enthusiasm. This  
is therapy for me. I'm the one who's inspired here.''

<HEADLINE> Haskins at Peace With Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clem Haskins said he is at peace after  
resigning as the University of Minnesota men's basketball coach 
under pressure during an investigation into academic fraud 
allegations, the Star Tribune reported Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins gave the Star Tribune his first interview, which the  
newspaper made available on its Web site, since accepting a $1.5 
million buyout of his contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, using a walker after having double knee-replacement  
surgery June 8, was at his Minnetonka home resting in his master 
bedroom when interviewed. He said would have preferred to coach the 
final three years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got me when I was on my back,'' Haskins said. ``If I was  
up, I would have fought a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of the surgery and the thought that I would  
never coach the Gophers again was tough to take. But now I'm really 
at peace with myself. I feel good with the way things are going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers are in the early stages of looking for a new coach,  
and said they will try to contact Utah coach Rick Majerus this 
week. Other possible candidates, according to the newspaper, 
include Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker, Delaware coach Mike Brey, 
former Iowa coach Tom Davis and former Gophers player Jim Brewer, 
who is a Los Angeles Clippers assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins refused to condemn two of his accusers: Elayne Donahue,  
the former director of the academic counseling unit, and Jan 
Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the unit whose allegations 
about academic fraud led to his contract buyout. Gangelhoff said 
she completed more than 400 pieces of course work for at least 20 
players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, if I knew it was going on, we would have stopped it,'' he  
said. ``There's no way in the world we would have upheld that type 
of thing. Talk to all of the great players that played for me, 
they'll speak for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins said he enjoyed coaching the Gophers for 13 seasons,  
leading them to the Big Ten title and Final Four in 1997 and 
winning two National Invitation Tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think in the end, it's watching your players graduate  
and watching them be successful in life. That's the key measure of 
a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins said he appreciates that university president Mark Yudof  
announced that, at this point, the investigation doesn't show any 
evidence linking Haskins to academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins said he still has good feelings for the university.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed I'm not the head coach at Minnesota,'' he  
said. ``But I want to make it very clear that I want all these 
players to stay here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players said Sunday they wanted the next coach to be  
Bernie Bickerstaff, a former National Basketball Association coach 
whose son, J.B., will play for the Gophers this season. Some 
players said they would consider transferring if they don't like 
Haskins' successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, 55, said basketball has been his life since he was 11.  
He wants to wait a year before making any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want to coach in the pros,'' he said. ``But if it's a  
last alternative, I might take that. But at the present time, I 
enjoy the collegiate level. I think that's what I'm cut out to 
coach at. But again, I want to keep open all my options,'' he said.

<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Texas pitching coach Dick Bosman  
fractured his right hip Monday in a roller-blading mishap near 
Edison Field, where the Rangers started a series with the Anaheim 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosman, 55, was examined by Angels team physician Dr. Lewis  
Yocum, who took X-rays. The coach then was sent to UC-Irvine 
Medical Center to confirm the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosman will be sidelined for at least a month, but Texas  
spokesman John Blake said surgery isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas bullpen coach Larry Hardy will serve as pitching coach,  
and Hardy's duties in the bullpen will be handled by Butch Wynegar, 
the Rangers' minor league hitting instructor.

<HEADLINE> Telekom Raises $9.6B in Offering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- More than 250 million new shares of  
Deutsche Telekom AG started trading Monday, raising about $9.6 
billion for the German telecommunication company's international 
acquisition plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new shares, offered at Friday's closing of price of $38 a  
share, closed up 2 percent Monday to about $38.75 amid heavy 
trading in the first pan-European stock offering. Telekom said 
there was twice as much demand for shares than it was offering, 
partly from European retail investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a step made possible by the introduction of the single  
European currency this year, retail investors in the 11 countries 
using the euro were offered identical discounts and bonus shares in 
the early subscription period, reflecting Telekom's desire to 
expand beyond its German base. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the orders came from Germany, the rest from  
the 10 other euro bloc countries, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, seeking to become a major global telecommunications  
company, made its first major cross-border bid this year by 
attempting a friendly merger with Telecom Italia SpA, Italy's 
former telephone monopoly. But it lost to Olivetti SpA's hostile 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Undeterred, Telekom chairman Ron Sommer repeated Sunday that the  
new cash will be used for possible acquisitions and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Joachim Kroeske said the group will  
announce a deal at the end of the summer similar to this year's 
takeover of Max.mobil, Austria's second-largest mobile phone 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Deutsche Telekom increased its stake in Max.mobil  
to 81 percent from 25 percent for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the government was not selling any of the shares it  
still holds in the former telephone monopoly, the new stock issue 
effectively decreases its stake from 72 percent to about 67 
percent, a Telekom spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 250 million shares offered to retail and  
institutional investors, another 5.9 million shares were offered to 
Telekom employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking consortium led by global coordinators Deutsche Bank,  
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and Goldman Sachs also has an option to 
sell 30 million additional shares, held in reserve in the event of 
oversubscription. The consortium was to decide whether to release 
those shares in about four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Treated for Burns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Michael Jackson was treated for minor  
burns at a Munich hospital after a benefit concert and released, a 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson suffered burns from the fireworks used in the concert,  
according to the spokesman for his concert promoter, Mama Concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, had  
confirmed that the pop star had been treated and released, but 
would give no other details other than to say it was ``nothing 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has had brushes with pyrotechnics before: He was  
hospitalized with second-degree scalp burns in January 1984 after 
his hair caught fire when a smoke bomb misfired during the filming 
of a soft-drink commercial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson led a group of 30 international stars, including Andrea  
Bocelli, Luther Vandross and Boyzone, in eight hours of 
performances at Munich's Olympic Stadium. Luciano Pavarotti and 
Elizabeth Taylor dropped out at the last minute, citing health 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said more than 3 million marks ($1.6 million/1.5  
million euros) was raised for UNESCO, the Red Cross and the Nelson 
Mandela Children's Fund.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals TV Ratings at 18 Yr. Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jordan took the NBA Finals television  
ratings to a new high, but in the first season without him, the 
ratings fell to their lowest levels in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's five-game series average between the San Antonio Spurs and  
New York Knicks posted a 11.3 national rating and a 21 share, down 
40 percent from last year's final series. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 NBA Finals between Jordan's Chicago Bulls and the Utah  
Jazz went six games and had a 18.7 rating -- the highest in league 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the NBA Finals finished with a lower rating than  
this season was in 1981. However, none of the six games that season 
between the Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets were aired in 
prime-time by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew going in that the casual fan would be a much tougher  
draw without the best known man in the world,'' said NBC spokesman 
Ed Markey. ``We knew it would be an uphill climb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC acquired the NBA in 1990 and has broadcast every game in  
prime-time since the 1992 NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's Game 5, in which the Spurs wrapped up their first  
NBA title, recorded a 11.0/22, down 44 percent from last season's 
fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time that Jordan didn't play in the NBA Finals was in  
1995, when Houston swept the Orlando Magic. That series posted a 
13.9 national rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were beaten by the Rockets in 1994 and the seven-game  
average rating was a 12.4. But that was the same year when O.J. 
Simpson's freeway chase distracted viewers from basketball and Game 
5 received a 8.0 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous factors contributed to this year's low ratings, with  
the most important being Jordan's retirement. Sloppy play, the NBA 
lockout, the fact that San Antonio is the smallest NBA market and 
the series only going five games also impacted the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emergence of San Antonio and some other teams we saw in  
the playoffs will hopefully increase recognition as we get into 
next season and the year after,'' Markey added. 
</P>
<P>
	All five games in the series had significant dropoffs from last  
season. Games 1 and 5 fell 36 percent, Game 2 dropped 42 percent 
and Game 3 slipped 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Leeson To Leave Singapore Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Former trader Nick Leeson will be released  
Saturday from a Singapore prison and fly to London, a British High 
Commission official in Singapore said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson, jailed for fraud and forgery in connection with the 1995  
collapse of Britain's oldest bank, Barings, will likely leave 
Singapore's Changi prison around noon local time, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison authorities are expected to turn Leeson over to  
Immigration officers because he is being deported, said Clive 
Alderton, first secretary at the British High Commission in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration will hold Leeson at an as yet undisclosed location,  
before putting him on board a British Airways flight for London. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson, 32, made unauthorized futures deals worth $1.4 billion  
from his base in Singapore while working as a trader for Barings.

<HEADLINE> Internet Links Doctors, Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Researchers at the University of Utah have  
unveiled the first Internet-based system that allows doctors to 
match clinical findings with proven treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Physicians also can use the system to determine which treatments  
and medications are covered under their patients' health plans and 
file electronic claims with carriers and referrals with other 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system, called US MedNet, it is being marketed by a New  
York medical data company called US Medical Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Craig Timmons said the project will lead to  
``better medicine and greater administrative efficiency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet and this type of application in health care is  
tantamount to the ATM in banking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site allows physicians and insurance companies to  
communicate with each other while keeping the information 
confidential. Patients can also access their medical histories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's designed to take a lot of the mystery out of health care  
for the patient, to allow patients to view their own medical 
history in summary view in a usable format so they can actively 
participate in their health care,'' Timmons said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, managed-care companies will be able to use the site  
to process patient claims, for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors will be able to use the site to match up risk factors  
and clinical findings with the latest guidelines for specific 
treatments. With that information, they can plan a course of 
treatment using information from the patient's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the system can be used to determine which  
medications are most effective in treating high blood pressure and 
takes a patient's other conditions into account, said Geraldine 
Wade, a primary care internist and pediatrician at University 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The site would call up only those drugs covered by the patient's  
health plan and includes their costs and potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The physician then files the patient's medical claim with a  
simple click of the mouse, and insurance company employees can 
retrieve the claim from a central database.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Unveils First Midsize Sedan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn is using its biggest ad campaign yet in  
getting out the word that ``the next best thing'' is coming from 
the General Motors Corp. company -- its first midsize vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Saturn began airing the ads for the new L-series  
sedan and station wagon, which the automaker said will range from 
$15,450 to $21,800 and go on sale late next month. An 
invitation-only unveiling for Saturn owners will be held at dealers 
nationwide July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The L-series (L stands for ``larger'') is the first new model  
line for Saturn since it began selling its S-series subcompacts in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will be targeted over the coming month with ads meant  
to pique interest in the new model. Each ``teaser'' ad inserts the 
sedan's name, ``LS,'' among familiar clothing sizes: ``S-M-LS-XL.'' 
The TV, print and billboard versions do not show the car but 
promise ``the next big thing from Saturn'' is coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty- and 90-second TV ads showing the car will debut in August  
and will keep with the down-home feeling of Saturn's previous 
campaigns. The longer ads, with actor Danny Glover doing the 
voiceover, will retell Saturn's story as a leader in changing the 
way American cars are made and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new ads will not focus on Saturn's modern Spring Hill,  
Tenn., plant, portrayed in past ad campaigns as a harmonious place 
where happy workers built solid cars. That is because the new 
Saturn will be assembled at an older GM plant in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker has high hopes for the L-series.  
GM officials expect the model line to double Saturn's annual sales 
to around 500,000 within a few years. To do so, the L-series will 
have to take on the American-built Toyota Camry and Honda Accord -- 
the nation's best-selling cars -- in the industry's largest and most 
competitive segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn is betting the L-series' competitive prices and Saturn's  
reputation for providing a friendly, no-hassle buying experience 
will help it do that. Toyota and Honda also no longer make wagon 
versions of the Camry and Accord, a fact that Saturn plans to 
exploit as wagons show signs of staging a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has more midsize cars on the U.S. market than any other  
automaker, but Saturn officials have said they do not expect the 
L-series to pull customers from other GM models. Saturn maintains 
that a majority of its customers traditionally have bought Saturns 
after owning imports and other non-GM cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts are skeptical. Alan Baum of IRN Inc. predicted  
the LS will take away sales from similarly sized GM cars, such as 
the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an admirable product, reasonably priced, but not a  
breakthrough by any means,'' Baum said. ``We forecast it at a 
little under 200,000 cars a year at full production -- a significant 
number, but it will be at the expense of some Grand Ams and 
Malibus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	L-series prices will start at $15,450 for the base LS sedan with  
a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, manual transmission and air 
conditioning. The LS2 sedan, equipped with a 3-liter V6 engine, 
automatic transmission and several other features not standard on 
the lower-priced versions, will cost $20,575. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagons include the LW1 with a four-cylinder engine and automatic  
for $19,275 and the LW2, with the V6, for $21,800. All prices 
include the $440 destination charge. Saturn does not negotiate 
prices, though they can vary from dealer to dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn dealers have long wanted a midsize model to accompany the  
S-series line of subcompacts, notably in the last two years as 
sales of small cars have slumped. Through May, Saturn's sales were 
down 2 percent from the same period of 1998 in an otherwise robust 
market for new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's board last month also approved preliminary plans to produce  
a compact sport utility vehicle for Saturn at Spring Hill. It is 
expected to arrive in showrooms by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Though designed with Saturn's trademark styling cues, the  
L-series is based on the same chassis and major mechanical parts as 
the Opel Vectra, a model sold primarily in Europe by GM's German 
subsidiary.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, North Korea 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Three straight wins put the Americans into  
the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup. One loss will knock 
them out of the tournament they're favored to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure?  
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' said U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy. ``This is what  
World Cup's all about. You come to these games where you win or go 
home. That's the kind of pressure this team thrives on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans won Group A and move on after emerging from a  
scoreless first half against defense-minded North Korea for a 3-0 
victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they must face Germany in Landover, Md., on Thursday night.  
The Germans would have avoided the United States in that round, but 
gave up a last-play goal Sunday that produced a 3-3 tie with 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	That put Brazil in first place in Group B, setting up a  
quarterfinal Thursday against Nigeria. By finishing second in Group 
B, Germany gets the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to hide from the Americans,'' German goalkeeper  
Silke Rottenberg said. ``We just didn't want to have to book an 
early flight home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, though, are taking nothing for granted.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're very disciplined with great speed in the midfield,''  
Tisha Venturini, who scored two goals Sunday, said of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're lucky. We've played them before,'' said Shannon  
MacMillan, who had the other goal and added two assists. ``We're 
going to make them adjust to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans adjusted at halftime against North Korea, which  
needed a win to advance and played conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Koreans lost, Nigeria earned the second Group A  
quarterfinal spot by beating Denmark 2-0 Sunday at Landover. In the 
day's other game between two teams with no chance of advancing, 
Italy beat Mexico 2-0 in the first game of the Foxboro 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans entered the second game having virtually clinched  
a quarterfinal berth. So coach Tony DiCicco rested usual starters 
Foudy, Tiffeny Milbrett, Michelle Akers and Kate Sobrero. 
</P>
<P>
	Backups Venturini and MacMillan played the entire game, and  
Milbrett and Foudy entered at halftime. Those four made the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get fresh legs in there, it does spark your  
team,'' Milbrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millie creates things,'' Foudy said. ``We started to go at the  
defense and then they collapsed and we could go wider on them. We 
weren't doing that in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the second half, the Americans scored three goals in 20  
minutes -- MacMillan in the 56th minute, and Venturini in the 68th 
and 76th. Both started for the U.S. Olympic team that won the gold 
medal in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan scored on a low shot from 20 yards out on a pass from  
Foudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Venturini then headed in MacMillan's soft pass, making it 2-0.  
And MacMillan's free kick set up Venturini's goal on a header eight 
minutes later. Venturini did a backward flip in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I sealed my statement that I will give my heart and  
soul to this team,'' MacMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a strong group that has not been starting,'' DiCicco  
said. ``Today was a good chance to get them ready for the second 
round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. depth and talent was too much for North Korea, which  
kept the game tied into the second half and hoped for one rush that 
would produce a go-ahead goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USA is a very strong team,'' Korean coach Chan Myong Tong  
said. ``This is a good measure for us and to see what we need to 
develop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the United States went ahead, North Korea became more  
offensive-minded. And goalkeeper Briana Scurry was up to the task 
as she made several outstanding saves in the Americans' second 3-0 
win of the tournament. They also beat Nigeria 7-1 and have 
outscored opponents 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss by North Korea (1-2) allowed Nigeria (2-1) to become  
the first African team ever to qualify for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans made it to the finals in the first World Cup in  
1991, where they beat Norway, then lost to Norway in the semifinals 
in the second tournament in 1995. The Norwegians went on to beat 
Germany for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has no interest in seeing Germany advance that  
far again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased with where we are, but we definitely have to  
improve,'' DiCicco said. ``The stakes are just higher now. It's 
more demanding. We're playing better teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not such a big rivalry,'' Milbrett said, ``but it will be  
because it's the quarterfinals.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Unemployment Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate fell to 4.6 percent in May  
from a record high 4.8 percent the previous month, the government 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobless people declined to 3.34 million from a  
record high of 3.42 million in April. The number of employed people 
remained flat from a year earlier at 65.32 million, the statistics 
bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower jobless rate occurred as some unemployed people gave  
up looking for work. People are no longer counted in the work force 
once they stop seeking jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobless men rose to a new record high of 2.07  
million in May from 2.06 million in April. But the unemployment 
rate for men eased slightly to 4.9 percent from a record 5.0 
percent due to adjustments for seasonal factors, an agency official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobless men between the ages of 25 and 34 rose by  
100,000 from a year earlier, to a record high of 480,000. The 
unemployment rate for that age group increased to 5.3 percent in 
May, up 1.0 percentage point from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for men between the ages of 45 and 54 also set  
a new record high at 3.5 percent, up 0.6 percentage point from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for women decreased to 4.2 percent from 4.5  
percent in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's jobless rate has worsened in recent months, increasing  
pessimism about the nation's economy, which is struggling through 
its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the severity of Japan's job market, the Labor  
Ministry said Tuesday that the ratio of job offers to job seekers 
fell 0.02 point to 0.46 in May compared with April. That means 
there were only 46 jobs offered for every 100 workers seeking 
employment in May -- an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires in Tokyo had forecast  
the overall jobless rate would rise to 4.9 percent in May. The rate 
stood at 4.8 percent in March and April.

<HEADLINE> Sick Fla. Boy Meets Cher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Every day, 11-year-old Eric Campbell would  
listen to Cher's song ``Believe'' as he traveled to and from 
radiation treatments for an inoperable, life-threatening tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never thought he'd meet the singer, let alone get a warm  
embrace from her during a concert stop in Tampa on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She thought I was good,'' Campbell said after he and Cher  
kissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meeting was made possible with help from the Fulfill a  
Wish Foundation. Campbell gave the singer a tiny rose pin and a 
thank-you card. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy began radiation treatment after a tumor was discovered  
in his brain in December. Doctors say the therapy appears to be 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 53-year-old Cher, Campbell said: ``I like her music. I  
think it's good. And well, I think she's pretty ... even though 
she's older than my mom and dad.''

<HEADLINE> College Helps Immigrants Get Degrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NATIONAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- While teaching civics and  
government classes to new immigrants a few years ago, Reymundo 
Marin and his wife, Maria, stumbled across a disturbing trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We noticed a lot of educated immigrants who were working  
low-wage jobs because they didn't know where else to go. They were 
told their degrees from universities in their native countries 
weren't valid here,'' Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to step in to help, and founded InterAmerican  
College, a nonprofit school where immigrants who were professionals 
in their native countries are put on a fast track to earn a degree 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the first group of eight graduates received their  
bachelor's of arts degrees from the independent, four-year school 
five miles south of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the graduates, valedictorian Francisca Lopez plans  
to become a teacher and eventually a school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez had earned a master's degree in engineering at a Mexican  
university, and climbed the corporate ladder until she became a 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she immigrated to the United States, she couldn't get a  
job anywhere -- at least not one that required a degree and paid 
enough to support a family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knocked on many doors, but everyone turned me away. I had  
learned English, but they said my degree in Mexico wasn't worth 
anything here,'' said Lopez, a teacher's aide. ``They said I had to 
fulfill the college requirements here and that meant starting all 
over again. At 30, I just couldn't see that, wasting all those 
years of my life learning things I already knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 25.2 percent of immigrants  
who arrived in the United States after 1990 had college degrees. 
But many of them founder in low-skill, low-wage jobs, some because 
they are unfamiliar with the educational system and don't know how 
to ensure that they get the proper credit for the schooling they 
got in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't continue to keep allowing so much talent and  
education to go to waste,'' Marin said. ``These people can't 
continue to keep painting, cleaning houses or doing landscaping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At InterAmerican College, foreign college transcripts are  
evaluated by an independent panel that appraises course work and 
gives credit for up to three years of college work. 
</P>
<P>
	Students then take intensive one-month courses on weekends and  
at nights to complete requirements for a degree here. Each course 
costs $475. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is still in the two-year process of applying for  
accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, 
but has approval from the state's Bureau for Private Postsecondary 
and Vocational Education to grant degrees, Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's graduation leaves 28 people enrolled in the school,  
which has three offices, a small library and three classrooms at 
the National City Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatriz Ortiz, 60, a mother of five and grandmother who  
immigrated in 1970, was an elementary school teacher in Mexico City 
for 10 years but discovered her teaching credentials weren't valid 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the Marins) know that we're here to give, not to take.  
They're here to help others like us,'' Ortiz said. ``You're going 
to see how this school is going to grow. There's many more out 
there like us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Marin said she knows of nothing else like their school in  
California. And while they modeled the program after one adopted by 
the New York Board of Regents, that program is aimed at helping 
military enlistees continue their education overseas, not 
immigrants in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Gonzalez, president of California State University, San  
Marcos, said InterAmerican is serving a great need for immigrants, 
a population that statistically has lower earning rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``These folks are truly pioneers,'' said Gonzalez, who was the  
school's commencement speaker Saturday. ``InterAmerican is 
providing a different perspective at pedagogy and how we link that 
pedagogy to higher education.''

<HEADLINE> Santo's Heart Surgery a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quadruple bypass surgery on former Cubs star and  
current radio broadcaster Ron Santo on Monday was a success, 
doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed by Dr. David Fullerton, chief of the  
Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron did incredibly well,'' Fullerton said Monday. ``I  
anticipate a smooth recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santo, 59, suffered a mild heart attack while in Denver for a  
three-game series with the Colorado Rockies. He checked himself 
into a hospital there after experiencing chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cubs third baseman, a nine-time All-Star and  
five-time Gold Glove winner, has a history of diabetes and recently 
underwent an angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one 
artery. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Chicago on Thursday, Santo has been receiving  
treatment at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo became the team's radio announcer 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> French Utility Buys Nalco Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French utilities giant Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA  
has made its second splash of the month in the United States with 
its move to purchase Nalco Chemical Co., a water treatment group. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.1 billion agreement comes fast on the heels of the deal  
Suez Lyonnaise made on June 15 to buy Calgon Corp., a 
water-treatment company based in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Suez Lyonnaise chairman Gerard Mestrallet said Monday the  
company is keenly eyeing other opportunities in the 
rapidly-changing U.S. water sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to develop our presence in the United States with  
local partners and teams,'' Mestrallet told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Suez Lyonnaise will launch an all-cash offer of $53 a share for  
the Naperville, Ill.-based Nalco Chemical. The French company plans 
to merge Nalco with its water-treatment units, Calgon Corp. and 
Aquazur. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Nalco  
closed up $9 at $51.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will save $100 million over a one-year period and  
will make it the world leader in water-treatment services, Suez 
Lyonnaise said in announcing the deal. It still must be confirmed 
by the board of directors of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Suez Lyonnaise and its main rival, fellow French utility Vivendi  
SA, are competing fiercely with each other for market share in the 
United States, where municipalities are launching a wave of 
privatizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Vivendi paid $970 million this month to buy Superior Services  
Inc., a Milwaukee waste-management company. In March, Vivendi paid 
$6.2 billion for U.S. Filter Corp., a water-treatment concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Nalco provides on-site services to over 45,000 industrial and  
commercial customers in more than 120 countries. Its 1999 revenues 
were expected to be about $1.94 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Suez Lyonnaise intends to base its worldwide water treatment  
operating center in Chicago. The company provides drinking water to 
77 million people and wastewater services to 52 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the U.S. purchases, energy remains Suez Lyonnaise's  
core business, with water second and waste services third, 
Mestrallet said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I think it will remain the case,'' he said. ``The  
energy market is changing quickly in the United States and Europe, 
and we also want to be active in that market.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Help NHL Teams in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- With another team threatening to move to the  
United States, the federal government on Monday said it is ready to 
reverse past policy and provide financial help to protect Canada's 
six National Hockey League franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government is prepared to be part of a solution,  
but not the only part of the solution,'' said Industry Minister 
John Manley after an unprecedented one-day ``hockey summit'' 
devoted to the financial problems of the Canadian franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a new round of talks would be held next month to pursue  
specific financial remedies. These might include channeling a share 
of lottery revenues to NHL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the meeting were federal, provincial and local  
officials; executives of the six teams; the head of the NHL 
players' association, and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who says 
he wants the six teams to stay in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NHL, the six teams collectively lost more than  
$100 million from 1996 through 1998. Their problems include tax 
burdens that are higher than the league's U.S.-based franchises, 
plus having to pay player salaries in U.S. dollars even though 
their revenues are derived from weaker Canadian dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams based in Quebec City and Winnipeg moved to the United  
States in recent years, and the Ottawa Senators -- one of the 
league's top teams last season -- say they will move after next 
season if they get no government help with their tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators owner Rob Bryden, along with his fellow owners, emerged  
from Monday's meeting with newfound optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very encouraged,'' Bryden said. ``The meeting was more  
positive than I would have expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian teams are not lobbying for reductions in corporate  
or individual income taxes, but they do hope for breaks on local 
taxes. They say most of the U.S. franchises play in publicly 
financed areas and pay little or no local tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to help out the owners,'' Manley said. ``We're  
talking about the fact that hockey in general is one of the key 
elements of Canadian life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley indicated the federal government would be willing to  
pitch in to help only if local and provincial governments also 
contributed.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Rebuffs Qwest Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Qwest, the upstart telecommunications company  
that is trying to build a global network for high-speed Internet 
traffic, isn't giving up in its bid to acquire phone company 
Frontier Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the latest word from Frontier, Qwest Communications  
International Inc. may take its $11.4 billion cash and stock bid 
directly to Frontier's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made offers earlier this month to acquire Frontier, a  
long-distance and local phone company, and U S West Inc., a 
Denver-based regional phone company. Qwest sweetened its proposals 
last week after its first bids were not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, Frontier's board said it ``is continuing to  
evaluate the revised proposal by Qwest Communications to acquire 
Frontier'' but said it still plans to proceed with its merger with 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is trying to break up an agreement Frontier and U S West  
have made to be purchased by rival Global Crossing Ltd. Both Qwest 
and Global Crossing are building worldwide fiber-optic cable 
networks to carry radio, TV, e-mail and other data over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	If Frontier doesn't act soon, Qwest may try to go around the  
company's management by sending its buyout offer directly to 
shareholders, asking them to ``tender'' or offer their shares for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest sent letters Monday to all its investors to stress its  
determination to acquire U S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As circumstances change, we may consider adopting different  
strategies to encourage U S West and Frontier, or their 
shareowners, to accept our offers, and we may set a deadline by 
which they must do so,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman 
and chief executive, in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Hayward, portfolio manager for the Invesco Utilities fund,  
who received a copy of the letter, said, ``I understand the 
strategy behind what they (Qwest) are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``hostile tenders are never as good as the  
acceptance of a friendly offer, so we just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, however, may reconsider its prospects. Frontier also said  
late Monday that its profits for the second quarter and the year 
would fall far short of Wall Street's estimates. Frontier, based in 
Rochester N.Y., blamed its troubles on pricing erosion in the 
long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, Qwest said it ``will not revise its current  
proposal to acquire Frontier'' especially in light of its weaker 
financial state. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest maintained that its offer is ``superior'' to Global  
Crossing's, adding, ``We would expect ... Frontier's shareowners' 
best interests would be served by a prompt affirmation to our offer 
so that we can proceed together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will now shift their attention to U S West. The  
company's board of directors is scheduled to meet later this week 
to evaluate the new $34.7 billion stock offer from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has been facing political pressure from Colorado  
legislators to consider Qwest's offer because the combined 
companies would remain based in Denver. The union representing U S 
West's workers, however, is lobbying against Qwest's proposal out 
of fear of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has been putting on a full-court press to convince the  
boards of directors of both companies that its bids are superior to 
offers from Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing offered $10.9 billion in cash and stock for  
Frontier and about $31 billion in stock for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has 18,500 miles of cable in place. Global Crossing, based  
in Bermuda, is building an undersea network to link the continents. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire communications industry is being turned upside down  
by the Internet and its vast potential for transmission of 
information, electronic commerce and new forms of entertainment. 
Companies are trying to secure the technology and customers to 
compete in a new market. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made its initial bids for U S West and Frontier on June  
13, but its $55 billion stock offer collapsed when investors dumped 
Qwest shares, sending the stock down 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest revamped its offer Wednesday, and locked in the value at  
$69 a share in stock for U S West and $68 a share in cash and stock 
for Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest sent letters and presentations to the boards of U S West  
and Frontier to alleviate concerns about regulatory snags and 
growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no minefields,'' Nacchio wrote in a letter to the  
head of U S West, Solomon Trujillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would only have to shed 1 percent of its  
business to comply with legislation aimed at fostering competition, 
according to Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $34.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Global Crossing's shares dropped $1.25 to $44.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares rose 6 1/4 cents $57.81 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Frontier's shares fell $1.50 to $58.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> George W. Bush Courts Hispanic Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- When George W. Bush tours the ``Plaza  
de Mexico'' exhibit at a county fair this week he'll undoubtedly 
slip in a bit of Spanish. The Republican presidential front-runner 
is aggressively courting Hispanics, who make up 15 percent of the 
electorate in California and have traditionally voted Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, battles over illegal immigration, affirmative  
action and bilingual education that raged through most of the 1990s 
under then-Gov. Pete Wilson have created deep reservations among 
Hispanics toward Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fact that's not lost on Bush or his presidential rivals.  
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics make up America's fastest growing electorate group.  
Nationally 5 percent of the voting public is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last week in Detroit, Bush told his predominantly  
Hispanic audience: ``The message has got to be, 'The American dream 
has got to stand for you as well.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander gave a brief Spanish pitch  
to adult students in Los Angeles in March, but it backfired when 
his audience began to pepper him with questions in Spanish, which 
he didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona has long courted Hispanic voters and  
captured more than 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in his last two 
elections. ``Their support is my honor,'' McCain said at a GOP 
convention here in February. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, the front-runner, Vice President Al  
Gore, told a mostly Hispanic audience in Los Angeles last week that 
the Republicans were trying to divide Californians with ``demagogic 
tactics designed to turn one group against each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an apparent reference to the state's Proposition 187, the  
successful ballot measure five years ago that sought to bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving most forms of state aid. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two presidential elections, the Hispanic vote  
nationally went overwhelmingly for the Democrat, Bill Clinton. He 
got 72 percent in 1996, according to a Voter News Service exit 
poll. In 1992, the figure was 61 percent, but that probably 
underestimated his support among Hispanics because of the way the 
question was asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Bush won the Texas gubernatorial race last year with  
49 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a VNS exit poll. 
Another exit poll, by the William Velasquez Institute of San 
Antonio for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, 
a Hispanic interest group, put the figure at 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made a big push for Hispanic votes during that campaign,  
including Spanish-language advertising. Bush said issues such as 
education and family values were important to Hispanic voters, 
along with what he called the politics of inclusion. ``I believe I 
have set a tone that says to the Hispanic community, you're a part 
of the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor hopes to parlay this support into a broad  
victory in the primaries. States with heavy Hispanic populations 
include California, Texas, New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a 900-pound electoral gorilla,'' said Leslie Goodman, a  
Republican consultant volunteering for Bush's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The four states combined have 144 of the 270 electoral votes  
needed to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has an edge in Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor  
and is married to a Mexican woman. Jeb Bush says his son, George P. 
Bush, is in Mexico brushing up on his Spanish in preparation for a 
campaign swing through California with the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, though, Bush will find that the Hispanic  
political climate is different than in Texas, experts say. He plans 
to hopscotch the state Tuesday through Thursday, stopping in San 
Diego, Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, Palo Alto 
and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main difference is that the issues that divide  
Californians just don't play here in Texas,'' said David Lanoue, a 
political scientist and college professor who has taught in both 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``In California, so many people I talked to seem to say  
immigration was treated as some kind of invasion from foreign 
culture or country,'' said Lanoue, who currently teaches at Texas 
Tech University. ``Here, there's never been that sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While 80 percent of Texas Hispanics were born in the United  
States, less than half in California are U.S. natives, so there are 
many more new voters, said Harry Pachon, president of the Claremont 
Graduate University's Tomas Rivera Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, the roots of partisan attachment aren't that  
deep for new voters,'' he said. ``But these people came to be 
citizens at the height of the anti-immigration fervor'' that drove 
Proposition 187, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposition, put on hold by the courts, mobilized a new  
generation of angry Hispanics, many of whom saw Wilson, a 
Republican, as a symbol of demagoguery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush has got to give himself distance from the Wilson aura,''  
Pachon said. ``The challenges in this state are addressing 
substantive issues like education, which is numero uno in the 
Latino community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush staked that out as his top concern in his re-election bid  
last fall, and, foreshadowing his pitch this year, made direct 
overtures to his Hispanic constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is my first priority,'' Bush declared in a  
Spanish-language brochure distributed by his gubernatorial 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Freak Accident Kills 5-Year-Old Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Flower stems were woven through a chain-link  
backstop, balloons swayed on a warm breeze and bouquets lay 
scattered on the dusty infield of a tiny suburban baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no games scheduled Sunday at the park where  
5-year-old Andrew Cook collapsed and later died after being struck 
in the chest by a squeezable, soft-cored baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away, children and families gathered at Morton  
Elementary School, stunned that their fair-haired friend was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all in shock. This is just such a freak accident,'' said  
Suzanne Hinman, principal at Morton, where Andrew would have 
started kindergarten this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, standing on the mound next to an adult pitcher, asked  
an adult catcher to throw him the ball during a youth-league 
baseball game on Saturday, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrew glanced away as the ball was tossed, and it struck  
him in the chest. He staggered, then fell and stopped breathing. He 
died later at an Omaha hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinman said Andrew had no known history of illness. The Cooks  
have an older son, about 10 or 11 years old, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bystanders, including a doctor, came out of the stands and tried  
unsuccessfully to revive the child as his parents hovered nearby, 
police said. An autopsy was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts have said about one in 200,000 school-age  
athletes dies annually from accidents on playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said seemingly innocent blows to the chest can cause  
cardiac arrest if they happen at precisely the right moment in the 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth league was run by the Millard Athletic Association,  
which declined to release information about the adult who threw the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all thinking of the Cook family,'' Hinman said. ``This  
is definitely a community, and this is a tragedy for the community, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Association president Mike Carnazzo held a news conference  
Sunday, announcing that a memorial fund had been established. He 
declined to answer questions about the boy and asked reporters to 
leave the family alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a very private couple,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnazzo said the Cubs, Cook's team, have one game left but it  
probably will be canceled.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Devalues Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The U.S. dollar gained moderately  
against the Colombian peso on Monday after the government announced 
a radical plan to trim public spending and moved to devalue the 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempting to spur recovery from Colombia's worst economic  
crisis in 70 years, the central Bank of the Republic announced 
Sunday it was allowing the peso to fall further against the dollar 
before it intervenes in currency markets to support the Colombian 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets responded immediately, with the peso slumping about  
3 percent at Monday's opening to 1,790 per dollar from Friday's 
close of 1,737 pesos. Later in the day, the peso regained nearly 
all the lost ground, closing at 1,743 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said profit-taking, mostly by local investors, prevented  
further dollar gains, which they said they expected in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank sold $285 million in the foreign exchange  
market last week trying to shore up the peso, which has lost 11 
percent against the dollar this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its action, the central bank increased its target trading  
range for the peso by 9 percent before it would move to support the 
currency. Directors also agreed to allow the peso to fall 18 
percent against the dollar this year -- to a maximum of 2,046 pesos 
per dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't continue to face speculative attacks on the peso  
without provoking a major drain on international reserves,'' said 
Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo.

<P>
	Also Sunday, President Andres Pastrana announced a plan to trim  
the fat of Colombia's bloated public sector through the 
consolidation of government offices, reduced bureaucracy and the 
fusion of several state-owned financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia has always prided itself on steady economic growth  
despite its protracted guerrilla conflict and other social ills. 
But unemployment has risen to 19.5 percent and many economist 
project no growth in the gross domestic product this year.

	In the first quarter of 1999, the economy shrank 4.8 percent  
compared to the same period in 1998, the government said.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus May Be Even Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed buttressing  
Social Security and Medicare, using new White House projections 
that budget surpluses will be more than $1 trillion bigger over the 
next 15 years than were envisioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a chance to do even more to use the fruits of our  
prosperity today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow -- indeed 
for tomorrows well into the 21st century,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan included no dramatic increases in the targeted tax cuts  
he proposed earlier this year. But the president did not rule out 
considering deeper tax reductions in discussions with congressional 
Republicans later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the framework of achieving these objectives, obviously  
I'll be working with the Congress to achieve them,'' Clinton said 
before departing for political fund-raisers in New York and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal was expected to add new fuel to his budget  
fight with Republicans on Capitol Hill, who want to use surpluses 
for far bigger tax cuts than he has offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The new administration numbers were released days before the  
Congressional Budget Office plans to unveil its own projections. 
Those CBO numbers are expected to show somewhat higher surpluses 
than the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed setting aside $794 billion over the next 15  
years to strengthen Medicare, including providing new prescription 
drug benefits for the elderly. That is $108 billion more than he 
proposed in February, when he released his fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``By taking additional measures to increase competition, combat  
fraud and reduce costs, we can provide a new prescription drug 
benefit and still pay down our national debt,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president plans to offer on Tuesday the details about how he  
would change Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed setting aside an additional $543 billion for  
Social Security over the next 15 years, which he said would assure 
the program's solvency until 2053. 
</P>
<P>
	To strengthen the massive pension program for the elderly and  
disabled, Clinton said he would use all Social Security payroll 
taxes for reducing the national debt, making them off-limits for 
other spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security.  
Period,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade, he would also credit the interest savings from  
the debt reduction to Social Security, which a senior 
administration official said would further lengthen Social 
Security's solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing beside an oversized graph showing a plunging national  
debt, Clinton declared: ``We have now cut up Washington's credit 
card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By 2013, this country can be entirely out of debt,'' Clinton  
said, ``if we do not squander the surplus by choosing short-term 
gain over long-term national goals.''

<HEADLINE> Sunbeam Executives Awarded by Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Delaware judge has awarded former Sunbeam  
executives Albert Dunlap and Russell Kersh $1.4 million to cover 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor William Chandler of the Delaware Chancery Court made  
the decision last week, rejecting Sunbeam Corp.'s argument that it 
was only required to pay Dunlap and Kersh an actual ``judgment, 
fine or settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were fired in June 1998 following disappointing  
financial results. Sunbeam was forced to restate results from the 
preceding six quarters, which triggered a Securities and Exchange 
Commission investigation and several shareholder class-action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal fees sought by Dunlap and Kersh are related to their  
defense in the SEC and shareholder actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap, the company's former chairman, also is trying to collect  
$5.5 million he claims the appliance maker owes him in unpaid 
salary and benefits. Kersh, the former chief executive officer, is 
seeking $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunbeam makes consumer products under such brand names as  
Mixmaster, Oster, Coleman and Sunbeam.

<HEADLINE> More States Move Up Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States have been holding their presidential  
primaries and caucuses earlier in recent years to have more of a 
voice, but California's decision this year to move to early March 
helped open the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
	One political analyst says the primary scramble this year turned  
what used to be a grueling primary season marathon into a ``50-yard 
dash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When California moved, that shook everybody up,'' said Bill  
Jones, California's secretary of state. California's primary was in 
June for many years before switching to late March in 1996, and 
even earlier this time. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states, representing three-fourths of party  
convention delegates, will hold primaries and caucuses between the 
end of January and March 14 -- before many voters typically start 
paying attention to the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, comparable because no incumbent president was running,  
states with just under half the delegates held primaries or 
caucuses in a similar stretch of six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People on the streets, across America are not engaged,''  
William Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth in Massachusetts, 
said of the switch to earlier contests. ``This is being left to the 
big contributors, political activists and campaign strategists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescoped primary schedule, combined with expected record  
campaign fund raising, could give a huge advantage to front-runners 
like Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Republican Gov. George 
W. Bush of Texas. And it may give them an incentive to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a 50-yard dash, you can't stumble and still win,'' said  
political analyst Charlie Cook. ``This helps front-runners who 
don't stumble but could really penalize a front-runner who does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin is pushing for a rotating regional primary by 2004 that  
would allow a different region to lead off the process each 
presidential election season and give voters more time to consider 
the choices. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are recruiting support for that plan and want  
the backing of the Republican and Democratic parties. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, some states are still jockeying for position near the  
front of the pack, traditionally led by Iowa's caucuses and New 
Hampshire's primary. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Democratic Party rejected challenges to the  
leadoff positions of Iowa and New Hampshire by Michigan and 
Washington state, but it has several other requests pending. The 
scramble should wrap up in the next few weeks as national parties 
try to settle on a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana plans a Republican caucus, similar to the one it held  
in 1996, several days before Iowa. Iowa elections officials are 
reassured by the heavy attention their state is getting from the 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel like we're breaking tradition. Do they (Iowa  
officials) think they're going to be first forever? That's 
un-American,'' said Louisiana GOP chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire lawmakers are working to give their election  
officials the flexibility to move their primary to late 1999, if 
necessary, to hold the cherished spot as the leadoff primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in many states acknowledge civic self-interest is  
driving the stampede and say an early primary is crucial for 
building excitement and the state parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Virginia is the mother of presidents, it is the selector  
of none,'' said David Hummell, a Republican official in Virginia, 
where the GOP agreed to hold a primary at the end of February 
instead of choosing delegates at party events several months later. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Democrats want to move their primary up  
several weeks to Feb. 19. Party chairman Dick Harpootlian said 
Democrats want to hold their primary the same day as Republicans. 
He conceded the crunch may not be healthy, but said the elections 
process is changing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that the electronic media dominates this  
process,'' Harpootlian said. ``Going from state to state and 
showing the flag is getting irrelevant.''

<P>
	The United States media interest in Germany's Steffi Jones is  
sparked by more than her style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is the daughter of an American serviceman stationed in  
Germany. The press has been playing up the fact Jones' father, 
whomshe hasn't seen in five years, will try to attend the 
Germany-United States quarterfinals match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 3-3 tie with Brazil on Sunday, Jones was asked if  
meeting her father was as big a deal to her as the media were 
making it. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she said. ``I think it's exaggerated, because I haven't  
seen my father in five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell the truth it would be more important if my mother  
could be there, because she's the one that raised me for 24 years. 
My father is more like my friend than my father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said her mother is in Germany with Steffi's younger  
brother, Frank, waiting for her to get home so the family can take 
a vacation to France. 
</P>
<P>

	 *ELEPHANT WOMAN:* When Norwegian captain Linda Medalen injured  
her nose during Saturday's match against Japan, she didn't think of 
not playing in the quarterfinals against Sweden on Wednesday. It 
was her looks she was more worried about. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know, it is very painful and I look like the elephant  
woman,'' said Medalen. ``As a woman, you kind of think about your 
looks and I am not exactly happy about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's top defender expects to be playing in San Jose on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do anything to play, even if that means wearing a mask,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medalen did have a light practice with the team Monday and  
Norway's press officer, Jon Jamessen, confirmed her nose was not 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice black and blue around the eyes, but there's no  
problem,'' said Jamessen. He added it was almost certain she would 
play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Medalen was not the only Norwegian casualty in the 4-0 win over  
Japan. Forward Ann Kristin Aarones was injured when she collided 
with a Japanese player when they were going for a header. Even 
though she left the game, Aarones' injury isn't serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really dizzy at halftime, so we didn't take any risks,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player who won't play Wednesday is defender Anne Nymark  
Andersen, who injured her knee in Norway's second game of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FACTS &AMP; FIGURES:* Sissi's 28th-minute goal in Brazil's tie with  
Germany made her the top scorer of the tournament with six goals. 
China's Sun Wen is second with five goals, and third place goes to 
Norway's Ann Kristin Aarones and Pretinha from Brazil, who both 
have scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Norway are tied for most goals scored at  
13. The other favorites to win the Cup, China and Brazil, also have 
an impressive record with 12 goals each. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLYMPIC DREAMS SHATTERED:* For seven of the eight teams that  
didn't make it to the quarterfinals, it wasn't just their dreams of 
a World Cup that were shattered. The tournament is also a 
qualifying round for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the four quarterfinals winners and the best three  
quarterfinals losers will make the 2000 games, together with the 
host country Australia, which went out in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the departing teams also have to face the threat of  
funding withdrawal after they didn't make the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `If you don't make the Olympics, we'll cut your  
program,'' Canadian forward Isabelle Harvey said after losing to 
Norway on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Australian counterpart, Julie Murray, said the poor results  
of her team would be reflected in funding as well, even though 
Australia automatically qualifies for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finances will probably be lowered,'' Murray said.

<HEADLINE> Group Accuses Bush on Tax Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Like his father before him, George W. Bush  
is being accused of violating a pledge not to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers for Accountability, a Houston-based group that opposes  
tax increases, said Monday that Bush signed the no-new-taxes 
pledges during his first run for the Texas statehouse, in 1994. 
Mary Williams, head of the group, said Bush broke that pledge in 
1997 by proposing about $3 billion in new taxes, including a number 
of sales tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokesman David Beckwith said the Texas governor only  
proposed increases in some sales and other taxes in order to fund a 
property tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, a rival for the Republican presidential  
nomination, has seized on the issue to attack the party's front 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of shell games a lot of politicians like to  
play, but when you look at the details they were tax increases,'' 
Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller said Monday. ``When you pledge you're 
not going to raise taxes, no matter what the outcome is -- you don't 
try to raise taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those tax increases were part of a $3 billion tax reduction  
(proposal),'' Beckwith responded. ``It was a vehicle that was used 
to get the tax package through the Democratic House so it could be 
considered by the Republican Senate. Without that, the package 
might have died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's initial proposal included raising the 6 1/4-cent per dollar  
sales and motor vehicle sales tax by a half cent. He proposed 
eliminating the corporate franchise tax, which taxed a mix of 
capital and profits, and imposing a 1 1/4 percent tax on business 
sales over $500,000, minus the cost of goods and capital invested. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of legislative wrangling, Bush's proposal died in  
the final days of the 1997 Texas Legislature. In its place, 
lawmakers approved about a $1 billion property tax reduction funded 
from a budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say many taxpayers saw little of that reduction because  
it was eaten up by rising property values. But Bush has said a 
provision raising the homestead exemption from $5,000 to $15,000 
was real tax relief, particularly for owners of moderately priced 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's father, George Bush, pledged during the 1988 presidential  
campaign, ``I'm the one who won't raise taxes ... Read my lips, no 
new taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As president, the elder Bush agreed to what he called a  
``Democratic tax increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``tax revenue increases'' were needed as part of a broad  
package to address the budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Finance Official Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese finance official so influential he was  
known as Mr. Yen is stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, the Finance Ministry's vice minister for  
international affairs, will retire, sources close to the ministry 
and the Cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Dow Jones 
Newswires on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara will be replaced by Haruhiko Kuroda, the ministry's  
international bureau chief, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters Tuesday that the  
reshuffling of the top posts will become final before Obuchi visits 
China on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, outspoken and fluent in English, is among the few  
top Japanese officials whose comments sway currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, he has opposed what he called ``an excessively strong  
yen.'' A strong yen tends to hurt Japan's economy by making exports 
more expensive abroad and decreasing Japanese exporters' dollar 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Sakakibara, under instructions from Miyazawa, ordered  
dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan to keep the 
greenback at 120 yen, a senior monetary official told Dow Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara has also been a vocal advocate of governments taking  
more control of international markets to keep financial crises like 
the one that started in Asia two years ago from spreading around 
the globe.

<HEADLINE> Latest Scourge of El Nino: Rats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First it rained cats and dogs. Now El Nino  
has created a new scourge for Southern California -- rats. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's intense rainy season boosted the growth of  
vegetation, creating more food and places to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the region has a booming population of rats, mice  
and other rodents, said Gail VanGordon, an entomologist with the 
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Exterminators say their business is up 40 to 400 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``For most of the country, the rodent season is March through  
November. But in California, it's year-round,'' said Greg Baumann, 
spokesman for the National Pest Control Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The rodents even have a special affinity for the 90210 zip code,  
full of lush vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beverly Hills has a constant problem,'' said Michael Katz,  
vice president and general manager of Irvine-based Western 
Exterminator Co.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Gives Dogs a New Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sponge-like devices with genes implanted that  
are crucial to bone growth helped speed healing of broken bones in 
dogs. Researchers said the procedure could help the thousands of 
elderly Americans who suffer fractures every year. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of gene therapy and tissue engineering was  
developed at the University of Michigan Medical School and is 
reported in Tuesday's issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials in humans could come as early as next year, said  
Dr. Jeffrey Bonadio, the lead researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Team members used in their experiments the gene for parathyroid  
hormone, which regulates the amount of calcium in the blood by 
affecting the kidneys, intestines and bones, Bonadio said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much of the hormone coursing through the body can cause  
damage, he said. But, present in the proper amount in an area of 
damaged bone, it encourages bone growth and repair. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers took a structure in cells called a plasmid,  
which can reproduce and carry genetic instructions. They implanted 
it in a sponge-like material made of collagen, said Bonadio, now 
associated with Selective Genetics Inc., in San Diego. The plasmid 
they used codes cells to produce parathyroid hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	In tests on dogs with fractures, the scientists inserted the  
sponges into the damaged area, and bone cells began to grow into 
it, Bonadio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cells then took up the gene for parathyroid hormone ``and  
became growth factories, ... turning repair cells into local 
bioreactors,'' he said. The result was that bone increased at the 
fracture sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The process could prove particularly helpful for the many  
elderly who suffer fractures each year, most involving the hip, 
wrist or spine, Bonadio said. He estimated that 300,000 elderly 
suffer broken hips annually, particularly people suffering from the 
bone-thinning process called osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	'We're not trying to prevent ... fractures; we're trying to heal  
them,'' he said. ``We are hoping to initiate a clinical trial next 
year in which the elderly are the primary target population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, there is a secondary target: young people who  
suffer high-impact fractures of various types. These people include 
skiers, motorcyclists, bikers and others.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell To Plead Guilty in Ark. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of giving Kenneth Starr's office  
answers that investigators now regard as ``incomplete,'' longtime 
Clinton friend Webster Hubbell is getting ready to talk some more. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether Hubbell's answers will be any more  
useful than the first set he gave Starr in 1995 after pleading 
guilty to stealing $400,000 from his law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell will plead guilty Wednesday to concealing legal work  
that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton performed on a fraudulent 
Arkansas land deal known as Castle Grande and evading taxes on 
consulting payments from the president's friends, legal sources 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The concealment charge is a felony, while the tax charge is a  
misdemeanor, and Starr will recommend that Hubbell be given no jail 
time, the sources added. Starr also will close out the case against 
the other defendants in the tax indictment -- Hubbell's wife, Suzy, 
his accountant and tax lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A no-jail-time request to U.S. District Judge James Robertson  
could mean Starr regards Hubbell as having little of value. It also 
could mean prosecutors regard the evidence he holds as significant 
after what the legal sources describe as meetings Hubbell has had 
with Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's legal team has let Starr's office interview Hubbell in  
connection with the Castle Grande indictment, which refers to Mrs. 
Clinton about three dozen times, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Hubbell's plea would erase a headache that a  
public trial could have caused for Mrs. Clinton as she considers a 
run for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. Starr's prosecutors had 
listed Mrs. Clinton as a potential witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell lawyer John Nields would not comment Monday night as he  
and Starr's prosecutors made an unusual late-in-the-day trip to the 
sixth floor of the federal courthouse, where Robertson was keeping 
late hours in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a fountain of no information,'' Nields said as he left  
the building, refusing to explain what he was doing there. 
</P>
<P>
	In his impeachment referral to the House last year in the Monica  
Lewinsky sex and cover-up scandal, Starr said Hubbell's interviews 
and grand jury appearances in 1995 had been marked by ``incomplete 
testimony.'' Hubbell at the time had been serving a 16-month 
sentence in federal prison for tax evasion and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from friends of  
the Clintons for little or no work in 1994 and 1995, Hubbell didn't 
tell Starr about the work that he and Mrs. Clinton had done on a 
real estate development owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, 
Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law in the mid-1980s, 
according to information Starr presented to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sham transactions at the Castle Grande tract south of Little  
Rock, Ark., cost McDougal's failing savings and loan $3.8 million 
and contributed to the institution's insolvency, federal regulators 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The roles of Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton in the Castle Grande deal  
finally were revealed in 1996 when her billing records from the 
Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where she and Hubbell were partners, 
turned up inside the White House under still-unexplained 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted finally with her own billing records, Mrs. Clinton  
told regulators 55 times that she didn't recall various aspects of 
the work she and her law firm had done on Castle Grande -- including 
authorizing the destruction of her warehoused law firm files on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments Hubbell received from the president's friends  
raised the specter that Hubbell was being given ``hush money'' in 
return for his silence on the Clintons' business dealings -- an 
allegation never made formally or proven. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in April 1998 issued a 10-count indictment charging  
Hubbell, his wife and two associates with conspiring to avoid taxes 
on hundreds of thousands of dollars in income. Robertson dismissed 
the charges, saying Starr's office had violated Hubbell's Fifth 
Amendment privilege by using his own immunized business records to 
incriminate him. An appeals court reinstated the case, but Starr 
faced additional problems because the appeals court ruling raised 
additional issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal observers who have watched the Starr probe closely  
suggest it's too late to do much with whatever information Hubbell 
provides except to put it in a final report. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who was on the job  
six years, says a Hubbell plea ``this late in the day'' is 
``consistent'' with wrapping up the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if Mrs. Clinton proceeds with a Senate bid in New York,  
Hubbell's information could be important. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hubbell's pleas would dispose of the remaining court cases  
Starr has brought in his nearly five-year inquiry, the 
investigations are still open, one legal source said. The course of 
Starr's investigation will depend on information Hubbell and 
possibly other witnesses give the prosecutors, said the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office is also scrutinizing Mrs. Clinton over her  
statements about the White House travel office firings. She 
maintained that she didn't order the seven employees fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ray, declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Group Targets Hispanics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A national conservative group is  
attempting to attract Hispanic voters, a growing bloc that 
increasingly is drifting away from the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Traditional Values Coalition, which represents 43,000  
churches, is building a conservative political network among 
Hispanics, who constitute 5 percent of the U.S. electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, they make up 15 percent of the voting public. But  
fewer than one in 10 new Hispanic voters has registered Republican 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped set up the GOP for crushing defeats in California  
last November, when the party lost all statewide races but two. 
Without a plan of action, conservatives' prospects will dim in 
other states, too, said Mike Madrid, who was political director for 
the state Republican Party until last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen Republican presidential candidates are angling  
for support in California and other states with heavy Hispanic 
populations. One of them, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, visits the 
state this week and plans several appearances targeting Hispanic 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition's chairman, Rev. Lou Sheldon, sees Hispanics as  
crucial to advancing the group's conservative agenda in statehouses 
and Washington, D.C. Many Hispanics are conservatives, he said in 
an interview Monday from New York, where he was meeting with 
Hispanic Christian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 Hispanic church and business leaders will meet Thursday  
in the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk to develop a plan of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to walk away from these people is sort of saying that  
the Traditional Values Coalition is going to institutionalize and 
become sterile,'' Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Madrid co-authored a report that the Anaheim, Calif.-based  
Traditional Values Coalition is using as its blueprint for 
attracting Hispanic voters. The coalition dubbed the effort ``La 
Amistad,'' which means ``the friendship'' in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The report focuses on California, a state with a large Hispanic  
population that will be critical in next year's presidential and 
congressional races. But the coalition is studying it with an eye 
to courting Hispanic voters nationwide, Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that conservatives work to attract  
Hispanics through issues, ``separating themselves from elected 
officials who have been successfully demonized by Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also suggests that La Amistad:  
</P>
<P>
	--Conduct news media and advertising campaigns in Spanish and  
English. 
</P>
<P>
	--Undertake a registration program targeting Hispanic  
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make special efforts to get conservative Hispanics to the polls  
on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mobilize conservative Hispanics to lobby local, state and  
federal elected officials.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Await Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both health care providers and older Americans  
are wary as they await missing pieces of President Clinton's plan 
to bolster Medicare and pay for new prescription drug benefits for 
the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be encouraged that they're trying to do this,  
... but there's an awful lot that we don't know,'' said Patricia 
Smith, a senior lobbyist for the American Association of Retired 
Persons, the nation's largest organization of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is scheduled to announce details Tuesday of a plan to  
avert a cash shortage that would be expected to hobble the nation's 
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and administration officials have revealed a broad  
outline of the plan in recent public statements. 
</P>
<P>
	They say it would keep Medicare solvent for an additional 10  
years, by using $794 billion of expected income tax surpluses and 
by changing the way Medicare does business with health care 
providers -- for example, replacing government payment formulas with 
competitive bidding in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton will propose adding a brand new  
Medicare benefit: coverage of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unanswered questions about Clinton's proposal mean  
judgment is being withheld as yet by those whose support the 
president will need to get politically perilous Medicare changes 
through a Congress already nervous about the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	AARP supports the concept of a new Medicare prescription drug  
benefit. But Smith said among outstanding concerns is how much 
Medicare clients will be asked to pay out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will Medicare beneficiaries judge this to be affordable? I  
think the only way we're going to find out is through the political 
process,'' said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, drug makers are worried about how the government will  
decide which drugs to cover at what prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that the plan not include government price  
controls and that the choice of medicine be left to the doctor and 
the patient and not to a government clerk in Washington,'' said 
Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Other health care providers, including hospitals and HMOs, worry  
that Medicare money to pay for drugs will be squeezed from their 
own budgets even as they struggle to adjust to payment cuts 
Congress set in motion two years ago in the effort to balance the 
federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have seen is an erosion of purchasing power,'' said  
Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health 
Plans. ``Job one is to deal with the stability of the program. Job 
two is to talk about additional benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, administration officials are warning that Clinton's plan  
won't be painless. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday, top White House economic adviser  
Gene Sperling said many specifics of the plan ``will be 
controversial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said much of the money for drug benefits would come  
from ``efficiencies and new competition'' -- buzzwords that many 
interpret to mean more trimming of provider payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has backed away for now from the more  
politically risky idea of charging wealthy retirees -- those with 
incomes over $100,000 a year -- higher monthly premiums for Medicare 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sperling said the president remains open to that ``if it was  
something both Democrats and Republicans agreed should be part of 
the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors would be asked to pay some extra out-of-pocket fees if  
they want to avail themselves of pharmaceutical benefits Clinton 
has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with administration proposals floated on Capitol  
Hill say that under one scenario being considered, retirees would 
pay a monthly premium for 50 percent coverage of their prescription 
costs up to an annual limit of $3,000 to $5,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have promised, however, only that the  
drug benefit will be more affordable than the private Medigap 
coverage many Medicare clients now buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug coverage accounts for about $90 a month of premiums charged  
for most Medigap policies, which generally cover 50 percent of 
prescription costs after a $250 deductible is reached. Annual caps 
on Medigap drug coverage vary up to a maximum of $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the administration has considered contracting with the  
same type of pharmaceutical benefit management companies that many 
private health plans use in order to limit government involvement 
in coverage and pricing decisions.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Deal Is Argued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESSEXVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. officials told two  
federal judges in a hearing Monday that the $3.2 billion settlement 
proposal over damages from silicone breast implants was the best 
compromise available. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for several groups, including those representing  
thousands of women in foreign countries, said the Dow Corning plan 
is unfair and should be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing, which began Monday, is part of Dow Corning's $4.5  
billion bankruptcy restructuring plan. More than 170,000 women sued 
the company, saying implants made by Dow Corning or filled with Dow 
Corning material caused a range of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 112,774 women who voted on the proposed settlement earlier  
this year, 94 percent approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Dow Corning will ``pay far more than it had ever  
offered to pay before, and more than it ever thought it needed to 
pay,'' company attorney Barbara Houser told the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on Dow  
Corning silicone breast implants could get between $12,000 and 
$300,000 each. Women could also receive up to $25,000 for ruptured 
or leaking implants, and up to $5,000 for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan also proposes to pay about 23,000 women in foreign  
countries 40 percent or 65 percent less, depending on where they 
live. Dow Corning said that was due to lower medical costs and 
different economic conditions in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we're the iceberg in front of the Titanic,'' said David  
Goroff, who represents 1,800 Australian women. ``Miss Houser tells 
us the plan is big, fast moving and a lot of people have bought 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys for foreign women argued the plan violated  
international treaties and put too many demands on Third World 
residents to produce medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for U.S. women largely favor the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We realized we were never going to break the logjam in this  
case ... without compromise,'' said Kenneth Eckstein, a lead 
attorney for the U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who reject the money and still want to sue, Dow  
Corning would set aside up to $400 million to cover any costs of 
defending such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial institutions that hold $1.3 billion in Dow Corning  
debt voted against their part of the plan even though it pays them 
in full, saying the interest rate set by the company was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Justice has objected, saying the plan is  
insufficient to pay for the health care the government has provided 
for people with silicone implants.

<HEADLINE> LA Tops in Payroll, Last in NL West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Davey Johnson was asked what it felt like  
to have the biggest payroll in the league and still be in last 
place in the NL West. The Dodgers' manager took a deep breath, then 
tried to look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to win every series. We need to get our act together  
over here,'' he said. ``There's a long way to go. We have time to 
right ourselves, but our pitching has got to lead us. I felt like 
we were a better pitching staff, and the starters have struggled at 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Sunday's 8-7 loss to the Giants, Los Angeles dropped into  
the cellar for the first time since April 24, 1996. Much more had 
been expected of a team that pays its players an average salary of 
$2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, with a $79.2 million opening-day payroll, had been  
predicting championships since early in spring training. Now 
they're 34-39 and being ridiculed as among the biggest 
underachievers in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough year for us, we haven't been able to get a  
good string going,'' said center fielder Devon White, one of 
several free agents signed during the winter as the Dodgers 
revamped their lineup and pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster includes three of the sport's 10 highest-paid players  
-- Kevin Brown is third with earnings of $10.7 million this season, 
Gary Sheffield is fifth at $9.9 million and Raul Mondesi is tied 
for ninth at $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those three is to blame for the Dodgers' struggle.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who got a $105 million contract from Los Angeles, is 9-4  
with a league-best 2.89 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 112 innings. 
Mondesi is hitting .261 -- well below his .292 career average -- but 
has 19 homers and 50 RBIs. Sheffield is hitting .306 with 16 homers 
and 46 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the loss Sunday dropped the Dodgers a half-game behind the  
Padres, whose nine-game winning streak heading into Monday night's 
game at home against Colorado included a three-game sweep last week 
at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego, with a $48 million payroll, plays host to the Dodgers  
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers point to this weekend's series at San Francisco, in  
which they won two of three games and had two big comebacks. Todd 
Hundley's three-run homer in the ninth won Saturday's game, and 
they rallied from a 7-2 deficit to make Sunday's game close. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they're in last place, the Dodgers are just six games  
back in the loss column and the first-place Arizona Diamondbacks 
and second-place Giants are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of days ago we were eight out in the loss column. We  
came up here and played about as well in a series as we have all 
year. That's the way we have to look at it,'' first baseman Eric 
Karros said. ``We play the way we did this weekend for a while, 
good things will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of bad things have surrounded the Dodgers this season:  
</P>
<P>
	--Despite such sluggers as Mondesi and Sheffield in the middle of  
the lineup, the Dodgers are hitting .263, third worst in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	--The pitching has been so disappointing that Charlie Hough was  
fired as pitching coach May 26. Starters Chan Ho Park (5.54 ERA), 
Darren Dreifort (5.67) and Carlos Perez (6.92) all have been 
ineffective. Park has given up four grand slams this season. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hundley, who missed most of last season after surgery on his  
throwing elbow, has caught just seven of 65 base stealers and lost 
his starting job to Angel Pena. 
</P>
<P>
	--Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek broke his throwing hand on June 1  
when he punched a wall in Pittsburgh after grounding into a double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of us as being in last. It means we're 7 1/2 games  
out of first place, that's all it means,'' reliever Jeff Shaw said. 
``I never thought we would be (in last place), but it has been a 
combination of a lot of things. We haven't hit or pitched very well 
on a consistent basis at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said the Dodgers can use the series against the Giants as a  
springboard. But Johnson, whose teams have finished first or second 
in each of his 10 full seasons as a manager, was concerned about 
Park's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Park allowed two homers and six runs in 3 2-3 innings Sunday. He  
has lost his last three starts and is tied with teammate Ismael 
Valdes for second in the NL with 19 HRs allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in last place, 7 1/2 games out. We made some steps forward  
in this series but we also took some steps back with Chan Ho,'' 
Johnson said. ``He's done it in the past. He just needs to do it 
again. We desperately need it.''

<HEADLINE>  China Immigration Splits Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Ms. Leung had been waiting patiently for 20  
years for her turn to migrate to Hong Kong. After her father died 
in 1993 and her mother got sick, she decided to do what many others 
have done -- stay here illegally to fulfill her filial duties. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beijing's final judgment on a Hong Kong immigration case  
Saturday means she now has to leave her ailing 81-year-old mother 
here alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's here to take care of her except some social workers  
from the government,'' said Ms. Leung, weeping at a sit-in protest 
early Sunday. Like many other mainland people caught up in the 
controversy, Ms. Leung declined to give her full name for fear of 
retribution by mainland authorities if she is returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing dashed the hopes of many would-be migrants when the  
National People's Congress said Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal 
erred in an immigration ruling that would have let an estimated 1.6 
million Chinese with at least one parent in Hong Kong move to the 
territory over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beijing ruling sharply limited the number of people eligible  
to immigrate. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, many families will continue to be split by the  
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people who now face deportation to the mainland  
staged a third day of protests today outside Hong Kong immigration 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the former colony reverted from British to Chinese  
rule two years ago, Hong Kong has always accepted migrants from the 
mainland who sought to be reunited with their families here. But 
critics say China's own screening system is slow, opaque and 
corrupt, and many people each year decide to sneak in illegally or 
simply overstay their tourist permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The previous British government at least gave me hope that my  
daughter could come here, but this government doesn't know 
anything,'' a 48-year old woman who only gave her surname, Zhao, 
said today. She arrived in Hong Kong 21 years ago and applied for 
her daughter shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong lawmakers were to be briefed on the Chinese ruling  
late this afternoon, and some of the protesters said they would 
move their demonstrations to outside the Legislative Council 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Some the migrants said they were starting a hunger strike.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ms. Li, a 16-year-old student, decided to  
drop out of high school and stay in Hong Kong illegally with her 
parents and siblings. Ms. Li would not even give her hometown in

<HEADLINE>  China Immigration Splits Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Ms. Leung had been waiting patiently for 20  
years for her turn to migrate to Hong Kong. After her father died 
in 1993 and her mother got sick, she decided to do what many others 
have done -- stay here illegally to fulfill her filial duties. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beijing's final judgment on a Hong Kong immigration case  
Saturday means she now has to leave her ailing 81-year-old mother 
here alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's here to take care of her except some social workers  
from the government,'' said Ms. Leung, weeping at a sit-in protest 
early Sunday. Like many other mainland people caught up in the 
controversy, Ms. Leung declined to give her full name for fear of 
retribution by mainland authorities if she is returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing dashed the hopes of many would-be migrants when the  
National People's Congress said Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal 
erred in an immigration ruling that would have let an estimated 1.6 
million Chinese with at least one parent in Hong Kong move to the 
territory over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beijing ruling sharply limited the number of people eligible  
to immigrate. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, many families will continue to be split by the  
border. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people who now face deportation to the mainland  
staged a third day of protests today outside Hong Kong immigration 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the former colony reverted from British to Chinese  
rule two years ago, Hong Kong has always accepted migrants from the 
mainland who sought to be reunited with their families here. But 
critics say China's own screening system is slow, opaque and 
corrupt, and many people each year decide to sneak in illegally or 
simply overstay their tourist permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The previous British government at least gave me hope that my  
daughter could come here, but this government doesn't know 
anything,'' a 48-year old woman who only gave her surname, Zhao, 
said today. She arrived in Hong Kong 21 years ago and applied for 
her daughter shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong lawmakers were to be briefed on the Chinese ruling  
late this afternoon, and some of the protesters said they would 
move their demonstrations to outside the Legislative Council 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Some the migrants said they were starting a hunger strike.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Ms. Li, a 16-year-old student, decided to  
drop out of high school and stay in Hong Kong illegally with her 
parents and siblings. Ms. Li would not even give her hometown in 
China, citing concerns about trouble if she goes back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Li had been living alone and taking care of her family  
properties in a southern Chinese city with her maid since she was 
9, when her mother, older brother and younger sister moved to Hong 
Kong to join her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Li has applied with mainland authorities for an exit visa,  
which China requires of all citizens moving out permanently. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jeter Leads All-Star Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With one week left before the final totals are  
announced, Derek Jeter more than tripled his lead over Nomar 
Garciaparra to about 30,000 in All-Star voting. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter received 586,173 votes to start at shortstop for the  
American League in next month's All-Star game, according to totals 
released Monday by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Omar Vizquel has moved ahead of Boston's Garciaparra  
by 1,155 votes. Vizquel has 556,673 votes while Garciaparra has 
555,518. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, Jeter led Garciaparra by 7,931.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeter is second in the AL with a .376 average and has been the  
top offensive player for the New York Yankees, hitting 16 homers 
and driving in 46 runs. Vizquel entered Monday with a .339 average, 
2 homers, 33 RBIs and 16 stolen bases while Garciaparra came into 
Monday's game hitting .354, with 14 homers and 55 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was the final day of voting for the starting lineups for  
the July 13 All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. AL starters will 
be announced July 5, with NL starters released the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's Cal Ripken, on track for his 17th consecutive  
All-Star appearance and 16th straight start, leads third basemen 
with 731,662. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who led balloting in 1992 and '95, would tie Rod Carew  
as the only players elected to start 15 times -- in 1988 Alan 
Trammell was elected but got hurt and Ripken started in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. leads all players with 1,752,313.  
Griffey was the AL's leading vote-getter in 1991 and 1993 and led 
all players in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In outfield voting, he was followed by three Cleveland Indians:  
Manny Ramirez (1,095,174), Kenny Lofton (965,148) and David Justice 
(753,667). 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Indians maintained leads at their positions: first  
baseman Jim Thome (743,407) and second baseman Roberto Alomar 
(1,636,612). 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez of Texas (1,130,343) leads at catcher and appears  
likely to gain election for the seventh straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Canseco of Tampa Bay (978,981), who went into Monday  
night's game with a major league-leading 28 home runs, led at 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	An update on NL voting will be released Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Energy Buying Rival Wicor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The electric and gas utility Wisconsin Energy  
Corp. plans to buy natural gas distributor Wicor Inc. for $1.275 
billion in stock and cash in the latest combination in the energy 
distribution industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will serve approximately 921,000 gas  
customers and more than one million electric customers in Wisconsin 
and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and have approximately 9,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is expected to result in gas rates that will  
be lower over the long term than they would have been on a 
stand-alone basis,'' Richard A. Abdoo, chairman, president and 
chief executive of Wisconsin Energy, said today in announcing the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy would also assume approximately $230 million of  
Wicor debt under terms of the deal approved Sunday by both 
companies' boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy will acquire all of the outstanding shares of  
Wicor for $31.50 per share. That is a 19 percent premium over 
Wicor's closing price of $26.56 per share Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy said at least 40 percent of the price of the  
merger will be paid in Wisconsin Energy stock, and Wisconsin Energy 
can increase that to 60 percent. The rest is in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading early this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange,  
Wicor was up 5.6 percent, climbing $1.50 to $28.06 1/4 a share, and 
Wisconsin Energy fell 43 3/4 cents to $26.62. 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy and Wicor said savings related to the  
combination are anticipated to be approximately $35 million 
annually beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings are projected from lower costs for fuel, materials and  
services through enhanced purchasing power, elimination of 
duplication through attrition and sharing of resources, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy spokesman Michael John said there would be no  
layoffs at either company as a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdoo is to continue as chairman of the board, president and CEO  
of Wisconsin Energy with Wardeberg becoming the board's vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardeberg is to continue in this position for 24 months, after  
which he plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, to be known as Wisconsin Energy Corp., is  
to continue to have its headquarters in Milwaukee. Wicor is also 
based in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must still be approved by both companies'  
shareholders and receive approval from regulators but is expected 
to be completed by the spring of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy is a holding company with subsidiaries in  
utility and non-utility businesses. Its principal subsidiaries are 
Wisconsin Electric, Edison Sault Electric, Wisvest, Minergy and 
Wispark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicor Inc. operates six subsidiaries in the energy services and  
pump manufacturing industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdoo told an annual shareholder's meeting June 2 that his  
corporation was pursuing acquisitions. Wisconsin Energy tried 
unsuccessfully four years ago to merge with Northern States Power 
Co. of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of review, the $6 billion merger collapsed under  
regulatory scrutiny and opposition from small utilities and 
consumer groups worried about the new company dominating the 
electric power market in the Upper Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson To Get Wimbledon Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson will get her  
Wimbledon prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTA Tour initially ruled the 18-year-old American entered as  
an amateur and was ineligible for prize money. But Wimbledon 
officials overruled on Monday, saying she is a professional and 
entitled to her winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The player's mother, Samantha Stevenson, had threatened to sue.  
</P>
<P>
	WTA and Grand Slam rules state that a player who begins the  
``first match as an amateur may not receive prize money during that 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Wimbledon said its guidelines assume all players are  
professionals unless the tournament is notified otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson is guaranteed $42,340 for reaching a fourth-round  
match with fellow American Lisa Raymond. That match was rained out 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If she beats Raymond and reaches the quarterfinals she's  
guaranteed $79,442. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Alexandra Stevenson did not register as an amateur for  
this event, we have assumed all along that she has been playing as 
a professional an is fully entitled to receive the prize money,'' 
Wimbledon chief executive Christopher Gorringe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson had cited the Wimbledon guidlines in making  
her case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old player has had a dramatic debut at Wimbledon.  
She i one of a record-three unseeded women to reach the fourth 
round, joining two 16-year-old players -- Jelena Dokic and Kim 
Clijsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson and her mother declined to be interviewed on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson would not elaborate on her charges of racism  
on the WTA Tour and her fears that her daughter faces sexual 
advances from female players. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Craig Kardon refused to answer questions. When the player  
and daughter were approached, Kardon said, ``Don't even think about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's mother, who is white, said an unidentified player at  
a recent tournament directed a racial slur at her daughter, whose 
father is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson, a free-lance sports writer who works for The  
New York Times and other publications, is angered at the conduct of 
players and officials on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``They act like a bunch of girls in high school,'' she said at  
an informal gathering of reporters last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the treatment of Venus and Serena Williams when they  
first joined the tour was ``definite racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it big? No. Is it subtle? Yes. You can't explain racism,  
you have to be there to understand it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Replied WTA Tour chief executive Bart McGuire: ``The WTA Tour is  
made up of players from a myriad of ethnic, cultural and racial 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That being said, we are disappointed that their assertions  
have been made to the press and not the tour. If any assertions of 
racism are presented to the tour, we will look into them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson also said she never leaves Alexandra alone in  
the locker room because she wants to protect her from what she says 
is rampant jealousy and lesbian innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an absolute jungle,'' she said. ``A big, bad place. It  
just isn't a normal place for a young girl. As her mother, I want 
to make sure she's OK. But the biggest threats to girls of her age 
are the other girls on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she goes into the locker room, she looks for me,'' she  
added. ``She's a real teen-ager and I'm not going to let anything 
happen to her. If girls like her don't have a support team, they 
can be led down the wrong path.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- His father played tennis for Ireland  
and his English mother tied him to the net to make him watch her 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Wayne's World.  
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Arthurs is an Australian who lives just outside London and  
has been making a name for himself at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Before losing to Andre Agassi in the fourth round Monday,  
Arthurs had a seemingly unbreakable serve. He'd gone 111 service 
games before Agassi broke him three times in a row on the way to a 
four-set triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had an unusual introduction to tennis as a toddler at his  
home in Adelaide after his parents moved to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mum used to tie me to the net when she went to midweek ladies  
and I watched from here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he feel it was child abuse?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not at that stage,'' he replied with a laugh. ``I do now. I  
know better now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	IT'S NOT BORIS: At least one B.Becker played at Wimbledon on  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While three-time champion Boris Becker was held up by rain and  
was unable to face second seed Pat Rafter on Centre Court, Benjamin 
Becker -- no relation but same nationality -- was in action out on 
Court 15 in front of a handful of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The young German, a late replacement for an injured player,  
couldn't emulate his famous namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	He went down 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) to Japan's Hayato Furukawa in the  
first round of the boys' singles. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NO FUN FOR LINDSAY: The cameras have been chasing glamorous seed  
Anna Kournikova while there's been huge media interest in teen-age 
qualifiers Jelena Dokic and Alexandra Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	So what has Lindsay Davenport been up to?  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely nothing,'' the third-seeded player replied after  
her 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 victory over Barbara Schett put her into the 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a really, really boring like nine days. I've only  
gone out to dinner once. That's how bad it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	RAIN HITS BACK: Monday's rain-delays look like they're spoiling  
the best Wimbledon for four years, weather-wise. 
</P>
<P>
	The first sprinkle of rain arrived late on Saturday, after  
almost six days of uninterrupted play at the All England Club. The 
showers returned when play resumed on Monday, send the players 
racing off court three times and finally ending the action two 
hours early. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1995 championship, which was entirely rain free,  
Wimbledon has had some wet tournaments. In 1991, only 52 matches 
were played on the first four days and, with the championship 240 
behind schedule, organizers allowed play on the middle Sunday for 
the first time.

<HEADLINE> It's Cleveland Browns Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Browns owner Al Lerner on Monday put an end to  
any guessing about the name of Cleveland's new NFL football home. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Cleveland Browns Stadium -- a name as simple the team's  
unadorned helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner is passing on a chance to sell stadium naming rights to  
one business or organization. Instead, the Browns are selling 
naming rights to the new stadium's four gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner and team president Carmen Policy said the Cleveland  
Clinic, CoreComm, National City Corp. and Steris Corp., each with a 
sponsorship agreement, will each have a gate with the 
organization's name above the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said some NFL owners get up to $5 million a year by  
selling stadium naming rights. He said by limiting sponsorship to 
the four gates, the Browns will receive significantly less. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to disclose the specific dollar amounts in the gate  
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't what we could have gotten, but it's a nice, healthy  
compromise, and what I like most about it is that it's never been 
done,'' Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner said he believes the 70,000-seat stadium should be called  
Cleveland Browns Stadium and nothing else. But he said he is 
pleased to involve sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than the money. It's getting people involved.  
Economically, obviously it's a benefit, but it really goes beyond 
that. I mean, if we had one entity that would pay us a lot more 
money and take all four gates we wouldn't have done it,'' Lerner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner, who is also in the banking business as chairman of MBNA  
Corp., said he believes National City is the nation's best-run 
bank. That brought a smile to David Daberko, chairman of National 
City, a multistate bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this opportunity first came to me at the bank, I thought  
that this is really one of the most unique marketing opportunities 
I had ever seen, so I urged our people to get it done,'' Daberko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Clinic, a large medical foundation of which Lerner  
is the chairman, will also be in charge of the medical stations in 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	CoreComm is a telecommunications company and Steris a medical  
products company. Both are based near Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Downing, Cleveland's stadium project director, said the  
stadium is about 90 percent completed. The scoreboard is being 
installed, and she said construction could be completed by the end 
of July. The first Browns exhibition game is Aug. 21.

Germany's national team, won't play again in the Women's World Cup.

	Voss missed the first two games of the first round with a leg  
injury. She played less than half of Germany's 3-3 tie with Brazil 
in the third game of the opening round. Doctors then diagnosed the 
injury as a torn muscle. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Woman Pleads Guilty in Kids' Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A 70-year-old woman pleaded guilty today to  
smothering eight of her 10 young children in a series of crimes 
dating back to 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Noe, whose children were once believed to be victims of  
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, admitted to eight counts of 
second-degree murder. A judge sentenced her to 20 years of 
probation, the first five of which must be served under home 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, none of whom lived longer than 14 months, died  
between 1949 and 1968. In each case, Mrs. Noe was home alone with 
the children; she claimed they died in their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Although doctors and investigators attributed each fatality to  
``crib death,'' police never closed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Noe was charged in 1998, a year after the case returned to  
the spotlight following the publication of ``The Death of 
Innocents,'' a book about SIDS. A story in Philadelphia magazine at 
the time also reported that Mrs. Noe had confessed to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Noe, walking with a cane and an electronic monitoring  
bracelet around her waist, answered the judge today with deliberate 
``yes'' and ``no'' answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Arthur, sat in the courtroom, shaking his head as  
the names of the eight children were read. The couple's two other 
children died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last year, Arthur Noe defended his wife.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived with this woman for 50 years. She was my life,'' he  
said in August. ``That woman was not capable of doing such a thing. 
She wouldn't harm a fly.''

	Since being charged, Mrs. Noe has been free on $500,000 bond but  
confined to her home with an electronic monitoring bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	At a bail hearing in August, prosecutors described her as a  
killer who shouldn't be allowed on the streets. Assistant District 
Attorney Jay Feinschi called her ``as much a mass murderer as Ted 
Bundy.''

	Authorities said that her husband's failing health was a factor  
in the plea agreement today. Prosecutor Charles Gallagher also

``a heart of a killer.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Boredom Led to Park Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAPILLION, Neb. (AP) -- Three people were sentenced to life in  
prison Monday for the slaying of a teen-age friend whose death they 
apparently plotted out of sheer boredom. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Jones, 17, Niccole Wetherell, 18, and James Hargett, 20,  
pleaded no contest to first-degree murder in the stabbing death of 
19-year-old Scott Catenacci. They were among six people, aged 16 to 
20, who authorities said were involved in the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The group initially said Catenacci was killed in retaliation for  
getting rough during an episode of group sex. However, authorities 
now believe the killing was the culmination of increasingly violent 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the murder was the result of idle minds with little  
or no moral or ethical guidance,'' Sarpy County District Judge 
Ronald Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the group talked about killing people, and some  
dabbled in drugs and dark, Gothic beliefs. The group considered 
killing people while invading their homes to rob them, but were 
afraid to pull off the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	They turned their attention to Catenacci, luring him to a park  
in Bellevue, outside Omaha, on Sept. 29 with the promise of buying 
his laptop computer. He was stabbed at least 57 times and left to 
bleed to death in the deserted park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that it was planned and premeditated,''  
Reagan said. ``Motive is unimportant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wetherell and Hargett faced the electric chair but a three-judge  
panel ruled the death penalty was not warranted, saying prosecutors 
failed to show Catenacci suffered torture or that the crime was 
necessarily heinous or cruel. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his age, Jones could not receive the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	The other three defendants previously pleaded guilty to lesser  
crimes and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 months to 
25 years.

<HEADLINE> Motor Sports Reporter Glatthaar Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Walt Glatthaar, well known by area racing fans  
for his motorsports reports on KMOX radio, has died after an 
apparent heart attack at his home in Belleville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar, who died Sunday, was 71.  
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar worked at KMOX for 33 years. In addition to his  
Saturday and Sunday reports on the St. Louis station, his programs 
were carried on the Internet and Armed Forces Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered motorsports for 19 years for ABC Sports and was  
manager for Team Ferrari at the Daytona and Sebring endurance 
races. He served as press officer for the 12 Hours of Sebring, was 
the American director of racing for STP for several years and 
co-founded the American Indy Car Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fiercely competitive guy,'' said KMOX sportscaster  
Ron Jacober. ``He hated to be beaten on a motorsports story. Almost 
every driver in the country, if not the world, knew Walt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar's last report was broadcast on KMOX on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Patti Glatthaar said her husband began racing cars competitively  
at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar, a native of East St. Louis, Ill., served with the  
Army's 82nd Airborne Division from 1946 to 1948. After military 
service, he was president of a Nash dealership in East St. Louis, 
Ill., operated a fleet of trucks and began working in public 
relations before beginning his broadcasting career. 
</P>
<P>
	Glatthaar's body will be cremated. A memorial service will be  
held later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his widow, survivors include two sons, three  
daughters and four grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Fair-Trade Coffee Sought in Cafes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With gentle persuasion and wafting aromas, a group of Canadian  
and U.S. churches are pushing thousands of members to drink coffee 
that improves the lot of Latin America's farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, buying coffee that gives farmers more income from  
their product is an extension of faith, a way of loving their 
southern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see fair trade as a faith issue,'' says Terri Speirs, a  
coffee project coordinator for Lutheran World Relief. ``We think 
that Christ tells us to treat our neighbors fairly and that means 
considering the value of their work and their products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the project began in the fall of 1997, 1,000 Lutheran  
congregations in the United States have agreed to serve Equal 
Exchange coffee at church events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lutherans consider coffee precious -- if there's no coffee  
people won't come to the meeting. And we need to consider the 
people who grew it as just as precious,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual members of other U.S. and Canadian denominations  
including Anglicans, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, and 
Unitarians, have persuaded dozens of supermarkets and cafes to 
offer equitable brews. It is now available in major cities such as 
New York, Montreal, Cleveland, and Vancouver and in tiny fishing 
towns of Gig Harbor, Wash.,, and Truro, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, an ecumenical group called Ten Days for Global  
Justice brings to life the sometimes difficult concept of fair 
trade with a simple play seen in more than 500 churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, ``The Route of Coffee,'' uses drumbeats to punctuate  
the quandry of destitute coffee farmers and the clanging of cash 
registers in Pink Floyd's ``Money'' to bring it home to cafe-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with a video called ``Common Grounds,'' the group's  
efforts have increased the number of coffee brands that carry 
Canada's FairTrade Mark from one to 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coffee is so central to church socializing that it's even  
called `coffee hour,''' said Julie Graham, resource coordinator for 
the ecumenical group. ``We thought it was a good idea to question 
the working conditions behind the product.''

<HEADLINE> Hail Storm Pounds Plains States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. (AP) -- Hail as large as baseballs stripped  
branches from trees, smashed windows and cars, and injured about 
two dozen people as severe thunderstorms battered the central 
Plains and Gulf coast. Flash flooding forced people out of one 
neighborhood in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, floodwaters swept a Huntsville woman and a  
3-year-old Albertville boy to their deaths Monday as unseasonably 
heavy rains continued across that state. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of cars and hundreds of homes were damaged Sunday in  
the Nebraska city of Scottsbluff, officials said. And in addition 
to the hail and high wind, streets were awash after 1.25 inches of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have unbelievable flooding, trees that look like sticks,  
and the roofs of cars left outdoors are all beat up,'' said Denise 
Sinner, a Scotts Bluff County dispatch supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional West Medical Center said 24 people were treated for  
injuries caused by the hail and by flying glass. One policeman was 
cut when hail shattered a window in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it hits your house, it sounds like gunshots being fired  
at it,'' Scotts Bluff Civil Defense Director Sherry Blaha said of 
the hail. ``It starts very slowly and got very loud. It's pretty 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tornado warnings issued during the storms briefly halted the  
Nebraska high school rodeo at Thedford -- where the event had been 
moved because storms the day before flooded the rodeo arena at 
Broken Bow with water 2 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	More violent weather lashed Kansas today, with high wind blowing  
stained glass windows out of the public library in Ottawa and 
littering the streets with downed trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Flash flooding forced residents to evacuate a perennially  
flooded neighborhood of Kansas City, Kan., and blocked roads in 
other parts of eastern Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, storms caused flash flooding in northeastern Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters at McLouth, Kan., had to use a boat to rescue two  
people stranded on a narrow strip of land between two rising creeks 
after they tried to drive across a submerged road, Jefferson County 
Sheriff's spokesman Shawn Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seneca, Kan., several families had to be evacuated from a  
residential area near the Nemaha River. Some parts of Nemaha County 
near Corning got up to 7 inches of rain during the day, said 
Undersheriff Steve Linden.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Daddy' a Big Hit at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Adam Sandler is back on top -- again.  
</P>
<P>
	The funnyman's ``Big Daddy'' debut knocked off both Austin  
Powers and Tarzan to lead the weekend box office with $41.2 million 
in ticket sales, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The animated version of ``Tarzan'' moved to No. 2 with $23.5  
million. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' dropped to the 
No. 3 spot with $18.5 million in sales, according to industry 
estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This past weekend could become one of the biggest non-holiday  
weekends ever, said Paul Dergarabedian, a film industry analyst 
with Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. The top 12 films were up about 1 
percent over last weekend's banner showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of big films out there and the audience is  
expanding,'' Dergarabedian said. ``We're seeing astronomical 
numbers. There are films out there for every type of audience, 
combined with very effective marketing campaigns means very big 
numbers for all the films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This also means that staying No. 1 is difficult, he said. Each  
week, the top film is knocked off its perch but the No. 2 and No. 3 
films were still doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler plays a 32-year-old New York City  
tollbooth worker who's forced to grow up when he suddenly must care 
for a 5-year-old orphan, played by identical twins Cole and Dylan 
Sprouse. 
</P>
<P>
	As a new father, Sandler combines his two film personas -- the  
juvenile clown of the massive hit ``The Waterboy,'' and the likable 
romantic of ``The Wedding Singer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy'' was the second largest grossing comedy opening  
ever, just behind ``Austin Powers,'' which opened with $54 million 
two weeks ago, and was the biggest nonsequel comedy opening ever, 
Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tarzan,'' featuring the voices of Minni Driver, Rosie  
O'Donnell and Tony Goldwyn, and songs by Phil Collins, dropped only 
31 percent from its debut last weekend, said Chuck Viane, president 
of distribution of Buena Vista pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers,'' the quirky comedy sequel with Mike Myers  
returning as both the international mystery man and Powers' 
bumbling nemesis Dr. Evil, has become the highest grossing film for 
New Line Cinema. The film's three week total of $150.8 million beat 
its former biggest hit ``Rush Hour,'' which brought in $144 million 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta's ``The General's Daughter'' was No. 4 with $15.6  
million, while ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' 
remained strong, taking No. 5 with $14.6 million and a six-week 
total of $352.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the box office, the Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romance,  
``Notting Hill'' dropped one place to No. 6 with $5.1 million and 
``The Mummy'' was in seventh place with $2.1 million in ticket 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instinct'' was in eighth with $1.9 million, ``An Ideal  
Husband'' moved to ninth in its second week with $1.1 million and 
``The Matrix'' dropped to No. 10 with $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Big Daddy,'' $42.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Tarzan,'' $23.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $18.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The General's Daughter,'' $15.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $14.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Notting Hill,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Mummy,'' $2.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Instinct,'' $1.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``An Ideal Husband,'' $1.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Matrix,'' $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Digital Music Standards Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The latest round of portable digital music  
players will soon be available in stores nationwide, equipped with 
security features designed to prevent piracy, designers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Secure Digital Music Initiative announced Monday  
they had completed design specifications for the Walkman-like 
devices they claim will thwart online piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	On a yet-to-be determined date, new CDs released by the major  
record producers will be digitally encrypted to prevent piracy, the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative said. The digital players will need 
to be upgraded to accept those new music downloads, but would not 
permit playback of copyrighted versions after the upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``SDMI will enable the future of music and today's announcement  
signals to consumers that this future is coming quickly. This 
future holds the promise that consumers will have access to vast 
amounts of exciting new content with a new level of portability,'' 
SDMI director Leonardo Chiariglione said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond Multimedia, which makes the popular and controversial  
Rio portable digital music player, said it will comply with the new 
standards. The original version of the Rio player has served as a 
focal point for the music piracy debate because it doesn't require 
copyright protection to play music using MP3 technology. 
</P>
<P>
	New devices, available as early as Christmas, would initially  
support all current digital music formats, including MP3. After the 
new digital standard is implemented, consumers would only be able 
to play song files on the machines that recognized the digital 
watermark. 
</P>
<P>
	Future versions of Rio players will be completely  
SDMI-compliant, said Lorraine Comstock, of Diamond's RioPort 
division. A spokeswoman for Milpitas, Calif.-based Creative Labs 
said its Nomad digital music player, to hit store shelves in July, 
will also comply with the SDMI standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry members adopted the design specifications at a  
conference in Los Angeles earlier this month. They are under 
technical review and are to be ratified and made public by July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the security features, however cumbersome, were  
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the traditional music industry to back this, there  
has obviously going to have to be some fairly rigorous copyright 
protection,'' said Clay Ryder, an analyst for Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	He suspects computer-savvy hackers will try to find a way around  
the security features, but the chore will prove labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's 100 percent crack-proof, but you would go through a  
hell of a lot of effort to descramble something,'' Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SDMI members include each of the big five record labels --  
BMG Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- all looking to 
capitalize on the growing digital music marketplace while 
protecting artist and label copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America lost a suit  
earlier this month to halt sales of the Rio -- a portable machine 
that carries about an hour's worth of CD-quality MP3 music on a 
computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Comstock thinks the design specifications will help make popular  
music available to online consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the consumers the SDMI specification is a good thing  
because today you cannot buy music online from well known 
artists,'' Comstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the music available for sale on the Internet  
consists of lesser-known artists.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Killing 4 in Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A man accused of killing his parents, a  
popular police officer and his pregnant wife pleaded innocent 
Monday to four counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Terry Todd Wedding, 27, shot and killed his mother,  
Officer Joey Vincent, a pastor and Wedding's first cousin, and 
Vincent's wife. He used a baseball bat to bludgeon his father to 
death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Vincent, 29, and his 22-year-old wife, Amy, were  
killed early Sunday morning in the driveway of their home, which is 
adjacent to the home of Wedding and his parents. The Vincents' 
3-year-old daughter was found inside unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding killed his parents, Manville Todd Wedding, 59, and  
Beverly W. Wedding, 56, late Saturday or early Sunday in an open 
field about a mile from the family home in Depoy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're working on a motive,'' state police spokesman  
Bryan Pitney said. ``We're trying to nail down anything that may be 
more obvious to those in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent was one of two officers who used force in a previous  
episode to take Wedding into custody for psychiatric treatment at a 
state hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Wedding was being held until a preliminary hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Greenville, a city of about 4,500 people about 130  
miles southwest of Louisville, flags were at half-staff and large 
blue ribbons hung in honor of the victims from the doors of all the 
businesses on Main Street, including the Harbin Memorial Library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone's just in shock,'' said library employee  
Sandra Galyen. ``You hear something like that about such good 
people and you just don't believe it. You know deep down it's the 
truth but your mind just won't let you believe it.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies Co-Owner Monfort Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado Rockies co-owner Charlie Monfort  
apologized Monday for his arrest last week on suspicion of driving 
while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Monfort's blood-alcohol level was .209 after he was  
stopped while driving in a residential area early last Wednesday. 
Colorado law say a blood-alcohol reading of .10 or more is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without trying to make any excuses for myself, I want to  
sincerely apologize for how this incident has affected my family, 
friends, business associates, and others who have had faith in me 
through the years,'' Monfort said in a statement. ``I have in the 
past tried, and will in future endeavor, to be responsible in my 
personal behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Monfort, 39, also faces charges of driving a vehicle  
with excess alcohol, failure to signal a lane change and making an 
unsafe lane change. 
</P>
<P>
	Monfort, who lives in Greeley, and his brother Dick Monfort are  
two-thirds of the Rockies' ownership group and serve as vice 
chairmen. Jerry McMorris is the team's chairman, president and 
chief executive officer.

<HEADLINE> Lumber Company Buys Canadian Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Lumber company Louisiana-Pacific Corp.  
plans to buy Montreal-based Le Groupe Forex Inc., a leading rival 
in making a plywood substitute used in homebuilding, for $408 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday was described by Louisiana-Pacific  
chief executive Mark Suwyn as another step in the company's plan to 
establish itself as the premier building products supplier in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are leading producers of oriented strandboard, a  
plywood substitute that is used for interior walls, roofs and 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
	Suwyn said the deal gives Louisiana-Pacific ``a broader platform  
in our most profitable segment -- one where we believe considerable 
growth opportunities exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to regulatory approval in the United States  
and Canada and tender of at least 66.7 percent of outstanding Forex 
shares. Forex's largest shareholder and the other members of the 
controlling group of Forex have agreed to tender their shares, 
which represent approximately 42.5 percent of Forex's shares. The 
deal is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forex employs about 750 people and has two sawmills and three  
strandboard factories with an annual capacity of 1.6 billion square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana-Pacific employs about 10,000 people at facilities in  
the United States, Canada and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the company announced plans to build four new plants  
in British Columbia to make wood products from fast-growing aspen 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The trees are not considering prime trees for lumber production  
but they can be chipped and flaked into the raw materials used in 
oriented strandboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans are part of Louisiana-Pacific's effort to get out of  
the pulp business and concentrate exclusively on building products. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Louisiana-Pacific shares were up 75 cents to $22.875 a share.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Sink Further Crop Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybeans futures prices, already at more than two-decade lows,  
dropped sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade Monday on favorable 
weather forecasts and predictions for bumper crops in the United 
States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork and sugar prices were both lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans futures prices had actually jumped higher earlier in  
the day on forecasts for hot, dry weather in the next week in key 
growing regions in the Midwest that could result in smaller crops. 
But those gains were lost amid differing weather forecasts as the 
day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices have suffered for a variety of reasons: economic  
troubles in Asia have caused U.S. exports to fall sharply; world 
production is expected to continue to increase even as there are 
few takers for the commodity; U.S. farmers last year harvested a 
record large crop; and analysts predict record acreage this year 
because of farm programs that pay more for soybeans than other 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Further exacerbating the problem are favorable crops in Brazil  
and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	South American soybeans account for a third of the world's  
supply, and Brazil, the biggest producer in the continent, is the 
world's second-largest grower behind the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say wheat futures got support Monday from continued  
concern over the condition of the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop. 
There were reports of harvest delays and possible crop disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn fell on expectations for favorable weather, at least in the  
short-term, in U.S. growing regions. But analysts said uncertainty 
over the weather reports -- calling for 100-degree temperatures in 
some areas -- kept the losses in check. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's close of trading, July wheat was up 1 1/4 cents to  
$2.52 1/2 a bushel; July corn was down 3 1/4 cents to $2.11 a bushel; 
July oats rose 1/2 cent to $1.14 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 4 3/4 
cents to $4.45 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures prices fell in trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for lean hogs and pork bellies dropped sharply after a  
government report showed the nation's hog herd had increased since 
the end of March, an indication that Depression-era prices late 
last year have not prompted farmers to cut production. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 1.37 cent to 62.10 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle dropped 1.50 cents to 75.92 cents a pound; July lean 
hogs fell 2 cents to 48.87 cents a pound; and July pork bellies 
were dropped the limit 3 cents to 41.72 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures fell Monday amid news of increasing supplies but  
no matching demand, particularly from Russia and other consumers in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses came despite news that the beet crop in Russia was  
under pressure from higher-than-expected temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.14 cent to 5.95 cents a pound  
on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York. The October 
contract fell 0.20 cent to 6.37 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Brit Shot Putter Banned for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- British shot putter Paul Edwards was  
suspended again Monday after losing his appeal challenging a ban 
for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics, the domestic governing body of track and field,  
said an independent drug advisory committee found Edwards guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended from all competition immediately and faces  
another disciplinary hearing in which a life ban is expected to be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards tested positive three times in three years. Last year he  
became the first British athlete to be banned for life for drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed on the grounds the testing procedure was flawed. He  
was reinstated pending a review by an independent committee. The 
committee met June 7 and determined he was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said the presence of banned substances was the result of  
his urine sample not being refrigerated for nearly two days. He 
also claimed the seal on his second urine sample was tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old shot putter won a bronze medal at the 1990  
Commonwealth Games.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study Humor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Question: What do you call a group of  
researchers engaged in the study of humor? Answer: Jest folks. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, a gaggle of these gigglers have gathered in Oakland  
for the 18th International Humor Conference, where the study of 
humor is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is as difficult as anything else. In some ways, it's more  
difficult because the information you're dealing with is so much 
more uncertain,'' says Christie Davies, a sociology professor from 
the University of Reading in England. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he points out, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is just  
as much an artistic triumph as ``Hamlet,'' and even that 
blood-soaked classic has its funny bits, such as when Hamlet's 
prospective father-in-law, Polonius, says ``My, Lord I shall be 
brief'' -- and then goes on for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some may scoff at the idea of studying humor. ``It is sort of  
the general knee-jerk reaction,'' says conference organizer Martin 
Lampert, ``that somehow by doing it you're destroying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he who laughs first might be sobered by the scholarly output  
of the five-day conference, which was to begin today at Holy Names 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the papers scheduled for delivery: ``Beckett's 'Godot'  
Humorously Revisited,'' and ``Biting Humor: What's so Funny about 
Count Dracula?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are joke-telling contests, standup comedy sessions and  
seminars on the medicinal value of humor -- including one led by a 
hospital clown. And there's even an entire session devoted to 
Clinton jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies delivered a few samples of these, but about the only  
thing remotely repeatable was his citation of Rudyard Kipling's 
classic line: ``And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a 
smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, a Welshman, will be featured in a discussion of ``Jokes  
about the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' a prolific and 
definitively unprintable genre. 
</P>
<P>
	For posterity, Davies -- ``You want another clean joke from me?  
Oh dear, let me think'' -- did offer this trouble-free, 
cross-cultural quip: 
</P>
<P>
	An American in England dashes onto a train and finds himself in  
front of ``an old-fashioned, uptight Englishman reading the Times. 
And the American says cheerfully, 'Hello, there. My name's 
Jennings.' The Englishman lowers his paper very slightly and says, 
'Mine's not.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``That is in a sense a classic Anglo-American gag where the  
American is sort of cheerful and friendly and the Englishman's very 
reserved,'' says Davies. 
</P>
<P>
	The conferences began in Davies' home country in 1976, put  
together by the society's forerunner, the World Humor and Irony 
Membership. Today, the society's members are mostly professors, 
although managers, counselors, nurses and journalists often join in 
the fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Humor, in short, is worth studying because ``it's a large chunk  
of people's lives,'' Davies says.

	Serbs Observe Kosovo Anniversary  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- While Serbs who remain in the  
province observed the 610th anniversary of their loss of Kosovo to 
the Ottoman empire, the United Nations began organized convoys 
today. Seven buses with about 320 refugees, escorted by 
representatives of the U.N. High Commissioners for Refugees, left 
the Stenkovec 1 camp in Macedonia. Dozens of others were to be 
picked up at Stenkovec 2 for the trip to Pristina, the Kosovo 
capital, in what was the first organized return.

	Congo Cease-Fire Draft Completed  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Progress to end Congo's civil war inched  
forward when African diplomats drafted a cease-fire plan but left 
tricky political issues for foreign and defense ministers to 
discuss today. Technical details were finalized late yesterday, 
state radio reported a Zambian official as saying. Negotiators in 
Zambia left some key matters up in the air, such as how to enforce 
a cease-fire, the timing of troop withdrawals and the deployment of 
monitors and peacekeepers, said Eric Silwamba, minister of state in 
the office of President Frederick Chiluba. Chiluba is serving as 
the main mediator in the conflict.

	Islamic Militant Expects Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian militant has warned that Islamic  
fundamentalists will launch attacks on American facilities and 
advised Britain to distance itself from the United States, a 
London-based Arabic newspaper reported today. ``America is still 
the direct and number one enemy of the Arab and Islamic nations,'' 
Yasser Tawfiq el-Siri told Al Hayat daily. El-Siri, who heads a 
London human rights unit called the Islamic Observation Center, 
referred to a February 1998 fatwa, or edict, calling on Muslims to 
attack U.S. facilities.

to the fighting raging in the disputed province of Kashmir, sources 
said today. Officials in Islamabad confirmed former Foreign 
Secretary Niaz Naik made a one-day trip to New Delhi at the behest 
of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The Pakistan Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, Zamir Akram, denied Naik went in an official 
capacity.

	Taiwan, China Seek To Restart Talks

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Rivals Taiwan and China worked today on arranging  
a visit to the island by Beijing's top negotiator as part of a 
protracted effort to restart talks suspended since 1995. Taiwan 
presented two possible dates for China's Wang Daohan to visit in 
September or October, said Jan Jih-horng, deputy secretary general 
of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation that handles contacts with 
China. Beijing will decide on the dates later, Jan's Chinese 
counterpart, Li Yafei, told reporters after their first of two 
meetings today.

	Tiananmen Square Reopens in China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- After eight months under wraps, a refurbished  
Tiananmen Square reopened to the public today with new tank-proof 
paving, rules against chewing gum and a Catch-22 that temporarily 
banished one of the giant plaza's greatest charms: its kite flyers. 
The square, China's symbolic political heart and home to massive 
pro-democracy protests in 1989, had been closed since October for a 
facelift ahead of this year's 50th anniversary of the founding of 
Communist China on Oct. 1. Thousands of people gathered at dawn 
today to watch a military honor guard perform with clockwork 
precision the daily unfurling of China's red flag on the north end 
of the square, the world's largest.

	PARIS (AP) -- French utilities giant Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA

American water-treatment group, for $4.1 billion. It was the second 
U.S. acquisition this month for Suez Lyonnaise, which bought Calgon 
Corp, a water-treatment company based in Pittsburgh on June 15. The 
French firm's U.S. acquisitions will help Suez Lyonnaise expand its 
international business and secure a place as one of the world's

	Big Day To Kick Off Wimbledon Week  
</P>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Centre Court will be a showcase of  
impassioned clashes today, starting with Britain's Tim Henman 
seeking revenge against American Jim Courier for a Davis Cup 
beating. Courier's emotional career revival, Boris Becker's 
emphatic return and Jelena Dokic's upset rout of Martina Hingis in 
the first week of Wimbledon set up a Super Monday of matches 
kicking off week two. Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova will 
follow Courier-Henman onto Centre Court in a match spiced by some 
catty comments by each.

<HEADLINE> PBS Pairs Hellman, Hammett Portraits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In her day, Lillian Hellman recalled, writers  
``smoked, drank, had affairs and made fools of ourselves.'' And who 
would know better than Hellman, a writer who was involved with the 
hard-drinking, hard-living novelist Dashiell Hammett, creator of 
the hard-drinking, hard-living detective Sam Spade. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the two lovers' lives and work were so intertwined for  
30 years, PBS' ``American Masters'' series is airing profiles of 
Hellman and Hammett back to back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lives of Lillian Hellman'' will be seen Wednesday at 9  
p.m. EDT, followed by ``Dashiell Hammett. Detective. Writer.'' at 
10 p.m., on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen people talk about Hellman, whose finely crafted plays  
include ``The Little Foxes,'' ``Watch on the Rhine'' and ``The 
Children's Hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hammett, who epitomized Hollywood's masculine ideal -- silent,  
tall, thin, sexy, intelligent, heroic, humorous, childlike -- 
avoided the limelight. The Hellman film has excerpts from several 
old TV interviews with her. There are no interviews with Hammett, 
but his daughter, Josephine, appears. 
</P>
<P>
	His segment includes scenes from ``The Maltese Falcon,''  
starring Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and actor David Strathairn 
reading from Hammett's letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr., now 83, is interviewed on both  
programs. Lardner, one of the Hollywood 10 who went to prison for 
refusing to answer questions before the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, talks about Hellman's and Hammett's politics 
and personalities. He met Hellman in 1934 and Hammett in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always got along with Lillian but I liked and admired Dash  
more,'' Lardner said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lillian could be a pretty difficult person, more difficult  
than it shows in the TV program. She had a tendency to exaggerate 
things and make a fair story into a better story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited her account of her helping out an anti-Nazi young  
woman, which became the 1977 movie ``Julia,'' which won three 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dash's writing was realistic, even though he was dealing with  
some sensational crimes. He always made his characters seem very 
real. I think that's why readers liked his stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lardner called Hellman's fourth book, ``Scoundrel Time,'' about  
the McCarthy era, effective. ``It is, however, based on an 
erroneous statement. She says that when she appeared before the 
House Un-American Activities Committee she knew she might end up 
going to prison. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``She knew all that could happen to her would be to be  
blacklisted; there was no danger at all of her going to jail. She 
manages to get away with that in the book. She makes you feel she 
is in great danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dash went to prison for another thing entirely. He would not  
give the names of people who contributed money for bail for 
Communist Party leaders. He was declared in contempt of court. 
There was a rumor he might come to the federal prison I was in, in 
Danbury, Conn. He didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After they met in 1930, Hellman and Hammett became lovers. He  
had stopped writing his pioneering hard-boiled private detective 
novels -- a genre that flourishes today. He wrote ``The Thin Man,'' 
then helped Hellman move from film to theater. 
</P>
<P>
	They never married, and their relationship was an on-and-off  
affair. But even after they parted, they stayed in close touch and 
were together when he died in January 1961. She died in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`WHOSE LINE?': A game of ``Let's Make a Date'' with a  
make-believe President Clinton. A game of ``Weird Newscasters'' 
featuring an overwrought rock star and a mock Captain Kirk. Those 
are just part of the high jinks on ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?,'' 
airing Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. EDT on ABC. Drew Carey is host, with 
featured performers including Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Wayne 
Brady and Greg Proops.

million shortfall in license revenue.

<HEADLINE> Woman Pleads Guilty in Kids' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A 70-year-old woman pleaded guilty today to  
smothering her eight children in a crime that dated back to 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Noe, whose children were once believed to be victims of  
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, pleaded guilty to eight counts of 
second-degree murder under an agreement with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, she will be sentenced to 20 years of probation,  
the first five of which must be served under home confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths spanned two decades, from 1949 to 1968.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Noe claimed the children had died in their sleep. In each  
case, she was at home alone with the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Arthur Noe, who was not at home at the time of the  
deaths and was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The case returned to the spotlight after the 1997 publication of  
a book about SIDS, ``The Death of Innocents,'' and an April cover 
story in Philadelphia magazine which detailed the tragic story and 
reported that Mrs. Noe had confessed to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her arrest, Mrs. Noe had been released from jail on  
$500,000 bond and ordered confined to her home with an electronic 
monitoring bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Arthur, has said he couldn't believe his wife could  
have killed any of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived with this woman for 50 years. She was my life,''  
Arthur Noe said. ``That woman was not capable of doing such a 
thing. She wouldn't harm a fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a bail hearing in August, prosecutors described Mrs. Noe as  
killer who shouldn't be allowed on the streets. Assistant District 
Attorney Jay Feinschi called her ``as much a mass murderer as Ted 
Bundy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, she gave birth to a total of 10 children. One  
child was stillborn, and another died in the hospital six hours 
after birth. The other eight left the hospital, apparently in good 
health, only to die at home. 
</P>
<P>
	With no evidence to show otherwise, doctors and investigators  
reluctantly concluded that the causes were ``crib death,'' now 
known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Police, however, never 
closed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to her pleas today, Mrs. Noe had faced life in prison if  
convicted. She was ineligible for the death penalty because the law 
had not been passed at the time of the killings.

<HEADLINE> Artist Makes Plea for Driver Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- They look like the ghostly outlines of  
crime victims, and in a way, they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever the city's streets have been marked by tragedy, Ken  
Kelton marks them over again. He spray paints the silhouettes of 
crumpled pedestrians who were struck and killed by cars. 
</P>
<P>
	He considers it his own symbolic campaign against reckless  
driving -- something he feels has already taken far too many lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a serial killer out there,'' Kelton said, by way  
of comparison, ``everyone would be jumping into action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Kelton has made about 50 outlines. He'll keep at it, he  
said, until people take notice of the scourge in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, I've been uncomfortable with the domination  
of the automobile,'' said, Kelton, who works as a contractor. ``A 
picture is worth a thousand words. I'm trying to underscore that 
this is life and death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say 29 pedestrians have been killed in San Francisco  
since July 1, 1998. That's about an average year for the city and 
far below the 41 in 1997-98, according to Nick Carr, pedestrian and 
bicycle safety coordinator for the city's parking and traffic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem specific to San Francisco,'' Carr says.  
``It's a product of our time. There are longer commutes. People 
seem to be more competitive at the wheel and drive at increased 
speeds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Kelton says he ``grumbled silently'' about the  
deaths. When he heard about a New York man who was spray painting 
spots where bicyclists were killed, he knew he'd found his calling. 
</P>
<P>
	On a map in his office, red pins represent pedestrian  
fatalities. Yellow pins mark injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been passionate about things,'' said his wife,  
Sue. ``When you look at the map, how can you not support it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out on the streets one recent morning, it's just after dawn.  
Kelton dons an orange reflective vest, and his 23-year-old son 
Jesse erects a construction barrier nearby. It makes them look like 
a road crew, giving them some cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse lays a wood stencil of a human figure on the crosswalk at  
21st and Mission streets for his father to paint over. Kelton draws 
his paint gun and quickly paints ``4-15-99, woman 71'' above the 
stencil. Then he sprays around the edges and over cutout letters 
that read: KILLED HERE, BY TRAFFIC. Last comes his Web site 
address: www.pedsafe.org. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 71-year-old woman crossing the street,'' Kelton says in  
disgust. ``Maybe she didn't cross in time. Is this what she 
deserves?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The week afterward, a driver makes a wide turn onto a San  
Francisco street and mows down a stroller, killing a 10-month-old 
boy on the way to the park with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days, the white outline of a body appears on the  
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	A car has struck again. So, too, has Ken Kelton.

<HEADLINE> Schools End Valedictorian Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) -- As the sole valedictorian of South Colonie  
High School, Shauna Fisher is one of a vanishing breed. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the last to take the front row seat reserved for the one  
student with the highest grades during commencement over the 
weekend. She was the last student to give a speech as the school's 
undisputed valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, South Colonie will honor not just one top student,  
but all those whose grades averaged higher than 95 percent. It will 
join other schools in ending the longtime valedictorian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools are tired of splitting hairs over grade point  
averages, and fed up with criticisms that top-scoring students took 
easier classes. So they are throwing out the system entirely. 
Others are choosing several valedictorians, which critics say 
waters down the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our emphasis is on all students,'' said Harry Kachadurian,  
South Colonie principal. He said the spirit of competition will not 
be lost. ``If anything, the competition is on how many folks can we 
get above a 95 average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 18, has mixed emotions. She enjoyed the honor and said  
her classmates celebrated her success. But among younger students, 
``The competition is heavier. They're not supportive, they're out 
to get each other,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gateway High School in Pennsylvania this year, 12 students  
were named valedictorian. The Keystone Oaks school district in 
suburban Pittsburgh recently returned to picking just one 
valedictorian after a year in which more than 20 earned the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meaning of valedictorian has been lost,'' said Joseph  
Allen, dean of admissions at the University of Southern California 
in Los Angeles. ``There's been a wholesale distortion of high 
school records in this era of competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Allen, ``I can't think there's any reason to choose 15  
valedictorians other than to make 15 students more attractive to 
colleges and universities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't work, though, since he said most students are  
enrolled much sooner than valedictorian selections are announced. 
And there's no financial loss for students, he said, because 
scholarships are awarded for reasons other than the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, tapping just one top student has brought some school  
districts nothing but trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Orange-Stark school district in Texas spent $30,000 to  
settle a lawsuit from a father who claimed his daughter lost a 
scholarship because she wasn't named the class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
	In Athens, Alabama, the NAACP stepped in to investigate when a  
black student and a white student with the same grade point 
averages were both named valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens Principal Garry Adams said the school is now considering  
a weighted grading system to select next year's valedictorian and 
salutatorian. 
</P>
<P>
	But that weighted grading system -- making tougher classes count  
for more than, say, typing -- is what some school officials say has 
caused the problem. The weighted system means several students' 
averages can be much higher than 4.0. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adams doesn't mind. ``To me, if you have 10 who tie, than  
that's great because you're honoring more students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Renzulli, director of The National Research Center on the  
Gifted and Talented, though, sees it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	He agrees that more than one or two students should receive  
honors at commencement time, suggesting schools also congratulate 
the kid who works at a soup kitchen, or who has organized a protest 
against child labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Renzulli said he doesn't see a reason to eliminate what's  
seen as a meaningful title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a part of an effort to create more egalitarianism in  
society,'' he said. However, he added, ``Everybody knows who the 
kids are who work hard. I think we're sacrificing a lot of 
important things about recognizing achievement to satisfy a social 
agenda.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Gives Dogs a New Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sponge-like devices that helped repair broken  
bones in dogs by inserting bone-building genes may one day benefit 
the thousands of elderly people who suffer fractures every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials using the new procedure on people could come as  
early as next year, said Dr. Jeffrey Bonadio, who led the team that 
developed the process at the University of Michigan Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of gene therapy and tissue engineering was  
reported Tuesday in the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used the gene for parathyroid hormone, which  
regulates the amount of calcium in the blood by affecting the 
kidneys, intestines and bones, Bonadio said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much of the hormone coursing through the body can cause  
damage, he said. But present in the proper amount in an area of 
damaged bone, it encourages bone growth and repair. 
</P>
<P>
	The team used a structure in cells called a plasmid, which can  
reproduce and carry genetic instructions. In this case, the plasmid 
they used codes cells to produce parathyroid hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	They implanted the plasmid in a sponge-like material made of  
collagen, said Bonadio, now associated with Selective Genetics Inc. 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In tests on dogs with fractures, the scientists inserted the  
sponges into the damaged area, and bone cells began to grow into 
it, Bonadio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cells then took up the gene for parathyroid hormone ``and  
became growth factories, ... turning repair cells into local 
bioreactors,'' he said. The result was that bone increased at the 
fracture sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The process could prove particularly helpful for the many  
elderly who suffer fractures each year, most involving the hip, 
wrist or spine, Bonadio said. He estimated that 300,000 elderly 
suffer broken hips annually, particularly people suffering from the 
bone-thinning process called osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	'We're not trying to prevent ... fractures; we're trying to heal  
them,'' he said. ``We are hoping to initiate a clinical trial next 
year in which the elderly are the primary target population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, there is a secondary target: young people who  
suffer high-impact fractures of various types. These people include 
skiers, motorcyclists and bikers.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Win 200 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Maurice Greene got in one last bit of  
showboating before preparing for the world championships this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world record-holder in the 100-meter dash, took the  
200 title at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on 
Sunday despite stumbling out of the starting blocks and hamming it 
up at the finish line by wagging his tongue at the Hayward Field 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe I was slowing down, I believe I just wanted to  
put a little show on for the crowd, give them something else to 
see,'' Greene said. ``I could have ran stronger through the finish, 
but I didn't. That's a mistake I made, and I won't do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones won the women's 200 meters two days after she was  
upset in the long jump by Dawn Burrell. And Regina Jacobs won the 
5,000, completing an unprecedented distance double she began 
Saturday by winning the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The field events threatened to steal the thunder from the  
runners, however, in the final program of the four-day meet that is 
the qualifier for the World Championships at Seville, Spain, in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hartwig broke his American record in the pole vault, John  
Godina uncorked the best shot put in the world in two years, and 
Tisha Waller shattered meet and field records in winning the 
women's high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, capitalizing on the absence of injured world  
record-holder Michael Johnson, sped to victory in a wind-aided 
19.93 seconds, beating national indoor champion Rohsaan Griffin by 
.05 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't an ordinary Greene race. He stumbled out of the blocks  
and had to put his left hand on the track to maintain his balance. 
Griffin said he lifted his head too soon, about 50 meters in, 
allowing Greene to take the lead on the turn and hold off the 
fast-closing Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The start of my race was very shaky, but I recovered well and  
I believe I ran the best race that I could,'' said Greene, who 
earlier this month smashed Donovan Bailey's world record in the 100 
by running 9.79 in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene didn't come close to Johnson's world record of 19.32 or  
his personal best of 19.86, even with an aiding wind of 2.3 meters 
per second. He said having Johnson there might have given him a 
push. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I run against the best, the best comes out of me,''  
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the 1998 track athlete of the year, led all the way in  
winning in 22.10. Like Greene, it was not close to her best of 
21.62 and far off the world record of 21.34, but Jones was superior 
to the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Jones sprained her right knee while long-jumping  
and has been nursing the injury since, though she did not use that 
as an excuse Friday night when she lost her first long jump to an 
American since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best it's felt,'' Jones said of her knee. ``We were  
expecting the worse after the jump. I knew if I could get through 
jumping, I could get through running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, using a longer than usual pole that he had used only  
once before, soared 19 feet, 9 inches. He had won the event with 
vault of 19-2, then went for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who would be the favorites to win the gold medal in  
Seville, the confident Hartwig said: ``Me. There's probably five 
guys in the world that'll have a good shot. Only one can win, but 
if everything goes well, hopefully it'll be me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig slithered over the bar at 19-9 on his first attempt,  
surpassing the mark of 19-8 1/2 he set last year. Hartwig then tried 
to become the first American to clear 20 feet, but missed three 
times, not coming close on any jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, the runner-up in the discus Saturday, put on a  
tremendous show in the shot put, with his first three throws 
exceeding 70 feet. On his longest throw, the usually conservative 
Godina danced happily along the fringes of the shot put area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I could have done a little bit better, but you kind of  
lose concentration when you get a big throw like that,'' he said of 
his longest throw in three years. ``I got a little bit too worn out 
from celebrating. I don't know if I should have done that so 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waller, who won her third outdoor title in four years and  
completed a sweep of the indoor and outdoor championships this 
year, missed three times at an American record 6-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of strong hurdling performances, Gail Devers won the  
women's 100 in a wind-aided 12.54 and Mark Crear took the men's 110 
in a wind-aided 13.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers, competing in her first competitive hurdles race in three  
years, ran the fastest race in the world this year. Plagued by 
injuries since 1996, Devers still is hurting. After going the whole 
meet without hitting a hurdle, she also said she's not attacking 
the apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I'm going to start getting my times to improve is  
to teach myself to challenge the hurdle,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crear's time in the men's hurdles also was the fastest in the  
world this year. He surged over the final hurdle to beat two-time 
world champion and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Allen Johnson, second 
at 13.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs stayed close to the leaders before charging to the front  
with less than 500 meters remaining to win in 15:24.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's other winners were Khadevis Robinson in the men's 800  
in 1:45.92; Pascal Dobert in the men's 3,000 steeplechase in 
8:21.48; Jearl Miles-Clark in the women's 800 in 1:59.47; Lynda 
Blutreich in the women's javelin at 182-2; and Curt Clausen in the 
men's 20-kilometer walk in 1:23:34.

<HEADLINE> Duke May Have 4 NBA First-Rounders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke lost the national championship three  
months ago. The Blue Devils will lose a whole lot more Wednesday in 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Danny Ferry,  
Mike Gminski and Gene Banks never left Duke early for the riches of 
pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But Duke's luck ran out this season. Elton Brand said he would  
turn pro after his sophomore season, setting off a domino effect 
involving underclassmen William Avery and Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Add senior Trajan Langdon and the Blue Devils most likely become  
the first team to have four first-round picks in the same draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Five schools have had three first-round selections in the same  
year: Indiana (1976), Michigan (1990), UNLV (1991), Arkansas (1992) 
and Kentucky (1996). 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really hard to imagine that this could happen very  
often,'' said Keith Drum, an area scout for the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a Duke dynasty after coach Mike Krzyzewski led  
the team to a 37-2 record with players such as Brand, Avery and 
Maggette returning to join Chris Carrawell, Shane Battier and Nate 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Blue Devils begin next season with six freshmen among  
their 10 scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said last week he felt hurt after some of the players  
bolted early, the trio not even staying for their junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have allure here,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have one  
of the great schools, we have an outstanding basketball program and 
we have great people. To me, that's a heck of a thing to be a part 
of. To me, that stands by itself against anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not millions of dollars, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Brand, Avery and Maggette are expected to go high in the first  
round, but teams have questions about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Brand tall enough? Can Avery run the point in the NBA? Does  
Maggette have the experience? 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is 270 pounds and 6-foot-8, and some speculate he is  
closer to 6-5 1/2. In fact, Brand was measured twice when he worked 
out for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams made a big deal about it,'' Brand said. ``When it was my  
turn to get measured it was like, `OK, it's Brand, shoes off, socks 
off, head straight' because there were so many rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brand's height checked out and he has surprised some teams.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas, whose team picks third, has  
a drill in which players are fed the ball in a stationary position 
and dunk it repeatedly. He said most of his players can do about 10 
straight dunks. Brand did 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has great physical size, long arms, great hands, a soft  
touch, quick feet and he can run,'' Drum said. ``Without question, 
he was the best low-post guy in college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, a 6-2 sophomore, joins Maryland's Steve Francis and  
UCLA's Baron Davis as the top point guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are questions to be answered like will he get his shot  
away or get stronger?'' assistant director of NBA scouting Ryan 
Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have to learn more about running a team while he uses  
his skills,'' Krzyzewski added. ``Our team was an easier team to 
run. That will be his biggest thing he has to learn while still 
trying to hit his shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, a 6-6 freshman, was Duke's sixth man. He may be the  
draft's biggest mystery -- or reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him play twice. I didn't notice him,'' said Marty Blake,  
the head of NBA scouting. ``The guy looks athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Maggette already has a pro-type body, he averaged only 17  
minutes a game for the Blue Devils. 
</P>

scoring.

best shooters in this draft, if not the best.''

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Found in Orange Juice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Salmonella has been detected in unopened  
containers of a brand of Arizona orange juice, a possible link in 
the sickening of least 19 people in three states. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the smoking gun,'' Dr. John Kobayashi, a state  
epidemiologist, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobayashi expected to have DNA test results today to compare  
with the pattern of 14 Seattle-area cases. Four other cases were 
reported in Oregon, as well as a New York man who got sick after 
drinking orange juice at a hotel in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 cases have been linked to the juice from Sun Orchard Co.  
of Tempe, Ariz., said Mark Alstead, a spokesman for Public 
Health-Seattle and King County. 
</P>
<P>
	None involved long-term illnesses or required hospitalization,  
Kobayashi said. Treatment consists of rest and drinking plenty of 
fluids, and infections rarely are life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella is a bacteria that causes infection of the  
intestines, typically resulting in diarrhea, cramps, headache, 
fever, vomiting and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun voluntarily recalled its non-pasteurized orange juice Friday  
and has halted further distribution of the product. A statement 
issued by the company Saturday said the juice was Sun's only 
product that had been blended with juice from an outside supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 Washington cases have ranged in age from a toddler who  
drank a ``smoothie'' in a restaurant to an 85-year-old man who 
drank the orange juice in his retirement home, Alstead said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vehicle Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's vehicle exports fell 8.6 percent in May  
from a year earlier, dragged down by weak sales in Europe, Latin 
America and the Middle East. But exports to the United States rose 
19.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop to 308,661 vehicles was the fourth straight monthly  
decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's top three automakers; Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor  
Co. and Honda Motor Co. all suffered export declines for the month 
with Nissan posting the largest loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall decline, exports to the United States --  
Japanese carmakers' biggest market -- remained strong, jumping to 
108,598 vehicles in the ninth consecutive increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments to crisis-hit Asia rose for the second time in 19  
months as many of the economies appeared to be recovering. Exports 
to Asia rose 8.2 percent to 23,203 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	But exports to the Middle East and Latin America fell sharply  
because of economic problems in those regions, the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Middle Eastern countries plunged 33.2 percent to  
16,358 vehicles, reflecting sluggish demand in the wake of lower 
crude oil prices, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Latin America tumbled 54.8 percent to 17,913  
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese manufacturers also reduced exports to the European  
Union last month -- by 8.5 percent to 80,929 vehicles -- to stem 
growing inventories of cars in their second biggest market, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May drop in exports followed an 11.1 percent year-to-year  
drop in April and a 1.9 percent fall in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 11 companies covered by the survey suffered export  
declines for May. Only Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of 
Subaru cars, posted an increase in exports, up 29.8 percent to 
16,075 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors Corp. suffered the biggest decline in exports  
for the month, a drop of 38.0 percent to 23,709 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top three makers, Toyota's exports fell 2.1 percent to  
113,407 vehicles, Nissan's exports sank 11.3 percent to 41,331, and 
exports for Honda dropped 8.4 percent to 36,956.

<HEADLINE> Jim Nabors Releases New CDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- When Jim Nabors underwent a liver  
transplant five years ago, he was surprised it drew so much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got about 200,000 to 300,000 letters and prayers,'' said  
Nabors, television's Gomer Pyle. ``The reality had never set in 
before that so many people cared what happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that realization propelled ``When He Spoke,'' Nabors'  
new two-CD compilation of Christian songs. It's the first recording 
by the actor in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabors, 69, said the CDs feature a mix of old gospel songs and  
contemporary Christian numbers, including a ``Lion King version'' 
of The Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real knockout,'' said Nabors, 69.  
</P>
<P>
	Nabors, best known for his portrayal of the simpleton soldier  
from 1964 to 1969 on ``Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.,'' formed his own 
record company for the effort. Another motivation: the success of 
friend Andy Griffith, whose own gospel collection sold about 2.5 
million copies a few years ago.

<HEADLINE> Bear Stearns Settles SEC Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bear Stearns &AMP; Cos., a large Wall Street  
securities firm, has agreed to pay $25 million in a settlement with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was investigating its 
relationship with a small brokerage that defrauded investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, disclosed Monday by Bear Stearns, would head off  
a civil lawsuit by the SEC which was believed to be imminent. But 
New York-based Bear Stearns still faces related criminal 
investigations by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and 
federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bear Stearns is not out of the woods,'' said Aegis Frumento, a  
securities lawyer who represents customers of and investors in A.R. 
Baron &AMP; Co., the now-defunct small brokerage that failed in 1997. 
``There's probably a lot more to be seen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns had processed trades for A.R. Baron, a financial  
function known as clearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement includes a $5 million civil  
fine, which would be one of the largest levied by the SEC on a 
single company in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns likely will neither admit to nor deny wrongdoing in  
the settlement, which is normally the case in such agreements with 
the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesmen declined comment on and would not confirm the  
agreement in principal for a settlement, which Bear Stearns 
disclosed in a routine corporate filing submitted to the agency. 
The precise nature of the SEC's allegations have yet to be made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	By settling the case, the company would avoid extensive civil  
litigation, said Stuart J. Gordon, a former chief counsel in the 
SEC's enforcement division who now is a private attorney. From the 
SEC's standpoint, he said, it would have been a difficult case to 
prove because of the complexities of securities law concerning 
companies accused of helping others commit fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most pragmatic thing to do. Pragmatism carried the  
day,'' said Gordon. ``This lessens the stigma tremendously'' for 
Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said that under the settlement, it will pay a $5  
million civil fine and an additional $20 million to settle 
unspecified private claims, presumably those of customers who lost 
a total of $75 million with New York-based A.R. Baron. The 
investors, some of whom have sued, have maintained that because it 
processed transactions for A.R. Baron, Bear Stearns should have 
noticed signs of fraudulent activity at the smaller firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns has denied wrongdoing and said it is the  
responsibility of the brokerage firms themselves, not the companies 
that process their trades, to detect and prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the SEC fined the founder-chairman of brokerage Olde  
Discount Corp. and three other people a total of $5.15 million in a 
settlement of alleged abusive sales practices. The securities 
brokerage arm of NationsBank was ordered to pay $4 million in a 
settlement of fraud charges, and Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $2 
million in connection with the Orange County, Calif., junk-bond 
debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau won securities fraud convictions in 1997 and 1998  
against several A.R. Baron executives and brokers. He has been 
investigating Bear Stearns's role in the smaller firm's failure for 
about a year, according to attorneys familiar with the case, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, federal prosecutors in New York City also are  
investigating Bear Stearns as part of their case against Sterling 
Foster, another failed small brokerage that used Bear Stearns to 
process its trades, The New York Times reported recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Morgenthau and U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White  
declined comment on the matter Monday, as did a spokeswoman for 
Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns said in its filing that the settlement payments  
would have no significant effect on its business or financial 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing did not mention any agreement concerning executives  
of its transaction-clearing division who may be under investigation 
by the SEC. The agency may still be planning to pursue enforcement 
actions against them.

<P>
	LOVELAND, Ohio (AP) -- Karen Dunne of Colorado Springs, Colo.,  
and Kenny Williams of Tacoma, Wash., won elite criterium titles in 
close finishes Sunday at the U.S. Cycling Federation's Road Cycling 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunne, who earned a berth on the 1999 Pan American Games squad  
earlier this month, finished the 34.2-mile course north of 
Cincinnati in 1:26.45 to win the women's event and her sixth 
national track cycling title. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very special victory for me in what has become a  
career season,'' Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Schuster of Porter Ranch, Calif., and Suzanne Sonye of Los  
Angeles finished second and third, a fraction of a second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams covered the 49.5-mile course in 1:54.41. Kevin Monahan  
of Wyckoff, N.J., and Tom Davis of Mashpee, Mass., were fractions 
of a second behind to finish second and third. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams won the men's criterium in another close finish,  
leading 11 cyclists in a final sprint for his first such title. 
Williams, 32, has won two Masters national titles in road cycling 
and plans to participate in the Masters Road Cycling National 
Championships in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began competitive cycling nine years ago, but I still work  
40 hours per week,'' he said. ``I love cycling and try to race as 
often as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: NATO Bombing Not Precedent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Although ethnic cleansing won't be tolerated,  
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia shouldn't be considered a precedent 
for future intervention by the alliance elsewhere, Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every circumstance is unique,'' Albright told the Council on  
Foreign Relations. ``NATO is a European and Atlantic -- not a global 
-- institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments reflected a subtle shift in the White House's  
thinking about the role of NATO in the aftermath of its 11-week 
bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Kosovo crisis, the administration had been pressing  
NATO members to consider expanding the defensive alliance's reach 
beyond Europe as a way of maintaining an important post-Cold War 
role in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But most European nations opposed the idea and had only  
reluctantly agreed in 1995 to act outside NATO borders by launching 
limited airstrikes against Serb forces in Bosnia and then a 
peacekeeping mission to halt ethnic cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's war against Yugoslavia to protect ethnic Albanians in  
Kosovo demonstrated that the allies still have much work to do to 
secure Europe's future and U.S. officials have since backed away 
from a specific call to expand the alliance's global role. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Monday that any decision to use force against  
another country will be made by the president after weighing many 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some hope, and others fear, that Kosovo will be a precedent  
for similar interventions around the globe,'' she said. ``I would 
caution against any such sweeping conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, NATO's intervention in Kosovo may make force less  
necessary down the road, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By meeting massive ethnic cleansing in the Balkans with a red  
light, we make it less likely that NATO will be called upon to use 
force in the future,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she was optimistic about the future of Kosovo,  
citing strong commitments by the United States and Europe to 
rebuild the province and predicting cooperation from Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she understood the ethnic Albanian desire for  
independence, but said the withdrawal of Serb troops and 
paramilitary groups had changed the reality on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, independence has seemed the only alternative to  
repression. But in the future, Kosovars will have something they 
have never had, which is genuine self-government,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright urged donor countries to make good on promises to help  
rebuild the province but repeated that the United States wouldn't 
provide any reconstruction aid for Yugoslavia -- until President 
Slobodan Milosevic ``is out of work, or better yet, in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged that Serbia lacked a viable democratic  
replacement, but pointed to the recent call from the influential 
Serbian Orthodox Church that Milosevic resign. 
</P>
<P>
	She warned of the ``daunting challenge'' that lay ahead for the  
peace process -- a task that she and her counterparts from Europe 
and elsewhere were to tackle Wednesday during a U.N. meeting to 
discuss the rebuilding of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expectations should be realistic,'' she cautioned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Failure is not an option.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Denies Tax Fraud Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
said Monday it never had been involved in tax fraud and 
falsification of documents as reported last week by a Swiss 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not true,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said.  
``It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lausanne weekly L'Hebdo printed what it said was a secret  
Swiss government memorandum describing the alleged IOC misconduct. 
The story, printed Friday, said Swiss authorities turned a blind 
eye in an effort to sway the 2006 Winter Games selection in favor 
of Sion, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	But Servan-Schreiber said the Lausanne-based IOC had an  
unwritten agreement with local Vaud state authorities, dating back 
to 1971, that exempted foreign from tax on 30 percent of earnings 
and Swiss employees from tax on 15 percent of earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	It had previously applied for full exemption to give its  
employees ``the same status as employees of other organizations 
such as the United Nations and the Red Cross,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax issue resurfaced after the IOC requested exemption from  
Value Added Tax, or sales tax, introduced in Switzerland in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	While applying for the exemption, ``we took the opportunity to  
say to the Swiss government (that) this has been the arrangement 
for 25 years, it's not at all hidden, but we'd like a written 
agreement; we just want to check that everything is in order,'' 
Servan-Schreiber said. ``It was we who suggested examining it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administrator's interim technical report said irregularities  
possibly had been committed, but a federal tax commission decided 
that definitely wasn't the case, Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The VAT concession was approved by the government last  
September. In February, the IOC withdrew its request following 
widespread criticism in Switzerland in the wake of the scandal over 
alleged misconduct in connection with Salt Lake City's bid to host 
the 2002 winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said at the time that the  
decision was taken out of ``a concern to end all 
misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization still receives an income tax exemption it was  
granted in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Reliever Wohlers Out With Sore Arm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Relief pitcher Mark Wohlers, struggling to  
find the strike zone and work his way back to the major leagues, 
will be sidelined from one to three weeks days because of 
tendinitis in his pitching elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds announced Monday that Wohlers will remain  
for now with their Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts affiliate, where 
he has been on a rehabilitation stint. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander struggled in his last appearance for  
Chattanooga. He allowed one hit, three runs, two walks and made 
three wild pitches on Thursday in two-thirds of an inning, striking 
out one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds obtained Wohlers in an April trade that sent reliever  
John Hudek to the Atlanta Braves. Atlanta agreed to pay the $5.2 
million salary of Wohlers, 29, who has been unable to consistently 
throw strikes since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers saved 97 games for Atlanta from 1995-97, setting a  
Braves record with 39 saves in 1996. He had 33 the following 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that personal problems contributed to his pitching  
difficulties. In 1998, he pulled a muscle in his side, his wife 
filed for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rebound for Second Session / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply Monday, padding  
Friday's small rebound from a six-session losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32  
point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 6.09 percent from late Friday's 
6.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose between 3/32 point  
and 1/8 point, while prices of intermediate maturities rose between 
9/32 point and 1/2 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's two-session recovery follows a steep decline  
sparked by expectations that interest rates will rise when the 
Federal Reserve meets this week. 
</P>
<P>
	While an increase in the central bank's lending rates may help  
contain inflation by slowing the economy, higher rates would make 
the fixed rate of return on existing bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.86 percent in the  
auction, while the discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 4.73 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 5.13 percent in the auction as 
the discount rose 0.04 percentage point to 4.93 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields slipped to 5.14 percent, while the discount fell  
0.01 percentage point to 4.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent, up from 5 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 5/32 to 118 17/32, with the yield 
dipping to 5.55 percent, down from late Friday's 5.56 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nets Remove Interim Tag From Casey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don Casey is relaxed again, which  
means things are back to normal for the New Jersey Nets coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, whose laid-back demeanor is the opposite of his  
predecessor, John Calipari, was introduced as the Nets' coach at a 
press conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets had a 3-17 record when Calipari, known for his temper,  
was fired in March. Casey, a veteran assistant, became the interim 
coach and led the team to a 13-17 record with most of the leading 
players on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can make us play hard,'' point guard Stephon  
Marbury said. ``His personality allows you to go on the court and 
give it everything you have. You're not dealing with a coach that's 
screaming and yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Phil Jackson announced two weeks ago that he was going to  
coach the Los Angeles Lakers, Casey and his family started 
wondering what he would be doing when the NBA season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been stressful,'' Casey's wife, Dwynne, said. ``We'd talk  
about it and he'd get upset, and then he'd have a Crown Royal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, impressed with the way he handled the team, gave him a  
reported $1.1 million multiyear contract last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would make Casey the second-lowest paid coach in the  
NBA. That fact, however, does not concern him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more money than I've ever made in my life,'' Casey said.  
The 62-year-old earned $34,000 when he coached Temple University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have six (championship) rings, you don't have a  
commanding presence,'' Casey said, referring to Jackson, who won 
six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations for Casey's contract officially began last Monday,  
although the season ended on May 5. Team president Michael Rowe 
said the Nets had to spend time flying members of Casey's staff 
back and forth for interviews and presenting the proposal to the 
Nets owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could it have been done any quicker? It could have been,''  
Rowe said. He said the team reached an understanding with Casey 
last Wednesday, but delayed a news conference until Monday out of 
respect for the neighboring New York Knicks, who were in the NBA 
Finals until Friday night. ``We're big Knicks fans,'' Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Van Horn said that Casey doesn't have the best-known name  
in basketball, but said the team needed his experience and his 
controlled ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coach doesn't need to be a celebrity in order to be an  
effective coach,'' Van Horn said. ``I think he has a great 
understanding of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's owners did not appear at the news conference,  
although Marbury, Van Horn and Kendall Gill showed up. Casey took 
no offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here. That's all I care about,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said next season -- his first as a head coach since he briefly  
coached the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 -- depends largely on how 
well his leading players recover from the injuries that plagued 
them last season. Jayson Williams is walking gingerly on his broken 
leg and teammates Van Horn and Kerry Kittles were among half a 
dozen players injured this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be a journey without some speed bumps,''  
Casey said. ``It'll be fun. It'll be exciting. We'll win.''

<HEADLINE> Frontier Rebuffs Qwest Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frontier Corp. has again sidelined a takeover  
offer from Qwest, the upstart telecommunications company that is 
trying to build a global network for high-speed Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement late Monday may spur Qwest Communications  
International Inc. to take its $11.4 billion cash and stock bid 
directly to Frontier's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made offers earlier this month to acquire Frontier, a  
long-distance and local phone company, and U S West Inc., a 
Denver-based regional phone company. Qwest sweetened its proposals 
last week after its first bids were not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is trying to break up an agreement the two companies have  
made to be purchased by rival Global Crossing Ltd. Both Qwest and 
Global Crossing are building worldwide fiber-optic cable networks 
to carry radio, TV, e-mail and other data over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's board said it ``is continuing to evaluate the revised  
proposal by Qwest Communications to acquire Frontier'' but said it 
still plans to proceed with its merger with Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Frontier doesn't act soon, Qwest may try to go around the  
company's management by sending its buyout offer directly to 
shareholders, asking them to ``tender'' or offer their shares for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest sent letters Monday to all its investors to stress its  
determination to acquire U S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As circumstances change, we may consider adopting different  
strategies to encourage U S West and Frontier, or their 
shareowners, to accept our offers, and we may set a deadline by 
which they must do so,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman 
and chief executive, in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Hayward, portfolio manager for the Invesco Utilities fund,  
who received a copy of the letter, said, ``I understand the 
strategy behind what they (Qwest) are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``hostile tenders are never as good as the  
acceptance of a friendly offer, so we just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, however, may reconsider its prospects. Frontier also said  
late Monday that its profits for the second quarter and the year 
would fall far short of Wall Street's estimates. Frontier, based in 
Rochester N.Y., blamed its troubles on pricing erosion in the 
long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night, Qwest said it ``will not revise its current  
proposal to acquire Frontier'' especially in light of its weaker 
financial state. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest maintained that its offer is ``superior'' to Global  
Crossing's, adding, ``We would expect ... Frontier's shareowners' 
best interests would be served by a prompt affirmation to our offer 
so that we can proceed together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will now shift their attention to U S West. The  
company's board of directors is scheduled to meet later this week 
to evaluate the new $34.7 billion stock offer from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has been facing political pressure from Colorado  
legislators to consider Qwest's offer because the combined 
companies would remain based in Denver. The union representing U S 
West's workers, however, is lobbying against Qwest's proposal out 
of fear of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has been putting on a full-court press to convince the  
boards of directors of both companies that its bids are superior to 
offers from Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing offered $10.9 billion in cash and stock for  
Frontier and about $31 billion in stock for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has 18,500 miles of cable in place. Global Crossing, based  
in Bermuda, is building an undersea network to link the continents. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire communications industry is being turned upside down  
by the Internet and its vast potential for transmission of 
information, electronic commerce and new forms of entertainment. 
Companies are trying to secure the technology and customers to 
compete in a new market. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made its initial bids for U S West and Frontier on June  
13, but its $55 billion stock offer collapsed when investors dumped 
Qwest shares, sending the stock down 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest revamped its offer Wednesday, and locked in the value at  
$69 a share in stock for U S West and $68 a share in cash and stock 
for Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest sent letters and presentations to the boards of U S West  
and Frontier to alleviate concerns about regulatory snags and 
growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no minefields,'' Nacchio wrote in a letter to the  
head of U S West, Solomon Trujillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would only have to shed 1 percent of its  
business to comply with legislation aimed at fostering competition, 
according to Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $34.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Global Crossing's shares dropped $1.25 to $44.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares rose 6 1/4 cents $57.81 1/4 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Frontier's shares fell $1.50 to $58.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Fire at Rice's Mother's Was Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLINT TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Authorities investigating a fire  
that destroyed the home of the mother of Los Angeles Lakers guard 
Glen Rice said Monday they found evidence that gasoline had been 
poured on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is somebody started the fire,'' fire Capt. Gary  
Borse said. ``It was an arsonist. It was not a professional job. It 
was amateurish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine Rice was in Florida when the fire occurred Sunday, and  
no one else was in the house, Borse said. She flew back later 
Sunday after receiving word of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Borse said he believed the fire was intentionally started in the  
trophy room in the basement, which was full of memorabilia from the 
former Michigan star. Borse said he found evidence that gasoline 
had been poured on all floors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult telling the family,'' Borse said. ``They  
were very distraught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ernestine Rice declined to comment, saying only that she was  
``very tired'' from the ordeal and very glad no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage was estimated at more than $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
	She has lived in the three-story Genesee County house since  
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 100 firefighters assisted in extinguishing the  
early-morning fire that took several hours to control, Borse said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had probably already been burning for 45 minutes when we  
got here,'' Borse said. ``The fire was deep-seeded and was burning 
throughout the house. We knew something was wrong because it was 
burning in places it shouldn't have already been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the Michigan State Police and Flint Township  
police for motive is under way, Borse said. The only item known to 
be stolen from the house was a .357-caliber revolver registered to 
Ernestine Rice and kept in a bedroom night stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was so much damage,'' Borse said. ``They are going to  
have to do a complete inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He previously has played for the Lakers, Charlotte Hornets and  
the Miami Heat in his 10 NBA seasons. Rice, who averaged 17.5 
points this past season, led Michigan to the 1989 national 
championship and was named most valuable player of the NCAA 
Tournament.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Bush Solidifying Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has pulled away from the rest  
of the field in the campaign for the GOP presidential nomination 
since opening his active campaign in June, a poll says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush gained ground, and Elizabeth Dole, former Red Cross  
president, lost ground in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released 
Monday. But Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer said his candidate is in 
the best position to challenge Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Elizabeth Dole can't catch Bush, then no one can,''  
Fleischer said. The Bush campaign declined comment on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor had the support of six out of 10 Republicans,  
59 percent, while Mrs. Dole, the former Red Cross president, 
dropped from 24 percent in May to 8 percent in the latest CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. Bush led Dole 46 percent to 14 percent in early 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who had been the only other GOP candidate in double  
digits, is now in a statistical tie with Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle 
and John McCain for second place nationally, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over six in 10 Republicans said it would be better for the  
GOP if a clear front-runner emerged, while just over a third said 
it would be better to have a number of strong candidates competing 
over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Ed Goeas said recently that GOP voters  
have been lining up behind Bush because he comes across as a 
potential winner, and they intensely want to end the leadership of 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore remained the Democratic front-runner with a 3-1 lead over  
Bill Bradley in the poll taken June 25-27. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling error for the overall sample of 1,016 was plus or  
minus 3 percentage points, but the error margin for subgroups of 
Democrats and Republicans was plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush holds a 15-point lead over Gore in a head-to-head matchup,  
with 56 percent behind Bush and 41 percent behind Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In the crucial state of Iowa, Bush also led in a Des Moines  
Register poll of likely caucus voters. He was the favorite of 40 
percent, while Dole had the backing of 13 percent, Forbes 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 397 registered Iowa voters who said they will  
definitely or probably attend their state's caucus in early 
February next year had an error margin of plus or minus 5 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE>  It's Cleveland Browns Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Browns owner Al Lerner on Monday put an end to  
any guessing about the name of Cleveland's new NFL football home. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Cleveland Browns Stadium -- a name as simple the team's  
unadorned helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner is passing on a chance to sell stadium naming rights to  
one business or organization. Instead, the Browns are selling 
naming rights to the new stadium's four gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner and team president Carmen Policy said the Cleveland  
Clinic, CoreComm, National City Corp. and Steris Corp., each with a 
sponsorship agreement, will each have a gate with the 
organization's name above the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said some NFL owners get up to $5 million a year by  
selling stadium naming rights. He said by limiting sponsorship to 
the four gates, the Browns will receive significantly less. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to disclose the specific dollar amounts in the gate  
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't what we could have gotten, but it's a nice, healthy  
compromise, and what I like most about it is that it's never been 
done,'' Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner said he believes the 70,000-seat stadium should be called  
Cleveland Browns Stadium and nothing else. But he said he is 
pleased to involve sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than the money. It's getting people involved.  
Economically, obviously it's a benefit, but it really goes beyond 
that. I mean, if we had one entity that would pay us a lot more 
money and take all four gates we wouldn't have done it,'' Lerner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lerner, who is also in the banking business as chairman of MBNA  
Corp., said he believes National City is the nation's best-run 
bank. That brought a smile to David Daberko, chairman of National 
City, a multistate bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this opportunity first came to me at the bank, I thought  
that this is really one of the most unique marketing opportunities 
I had ever seen, so I urged our people to get it done,'' Daberko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Clinic, a large medical foundation of which Lerner  
is the chairman, will also be in charge of the medical stations in 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	CoreComm is a telecommunications company and Steris a medical  
products company. Both are based near Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Downing, Cleveland's stadium project director, said the  
stadium is about 90 percent completed. The scoreboard is being 
installed, and she said construction could be completed by the end 
of July. The first Browns exhibition game is Aug. 21.

<HEADLINE> Japan Weighs What To Do With Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The government could decide this week what to do  
with the shares of major banks that it bought to strengthen the 
country's financial system, the minister for financial reform said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government poured $61.6 billion of taxpayers' money into  
major banks in late March to help them write-off huge loads of bad 
loans. In exchange, the government received preferred stock in the 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is now a kind of silent owner in the banks --  
preferred shareholders receive dividend payments first, but they 
don't have the right to vote for corporate officers or changes in 
company structure. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now must decide if it will hold on to those  
preferred shares or convert them to ordinary stock. The government 
would control a major part of many of the banks if it converts the 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I would like this week to release guidelines for  
what we are going to do with the preferred shares, including 
whether to turn them into ordinary shares or to whether to dispose 
of them as they are,'' said Hakuo Yanagisawa, head of the Financial 
Revitalization Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa has said that the government will try to ensure that  
the public doesn't suffer a loss as a result of the purchase of 
bank shares with their money. To do so, the government will have to 
push banks to improve their operations so the value of the stocks 
does not fall.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Win 200 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Maurice Greene got in one last bit of  
showboating before preparing for the world championships this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world record-holder in the 100-meter dash, took the  
200 title at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on 
Sunday despite stumbling out of the starting blocks and hamming it 
up at the finish line by wagging his tongue at the Hayward Field 
grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe I was slowing down, I believe I just wanted to  
put a little show on for the crowd, give them something else to 
see,'' Greene said. ``I could have ran stronger through the finish, 
but I didn't. That's a mistake I made, and I won't do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones won the women's 200 meters two days after she was  
upset in the long jump by Dawn Burrell. And Regina Jacobs won the 
5,000, completing an unprecedented distance double she began 
Saturday by winning the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The field events threatened to steal the thunder from the  
runners, however, in the final program of the four-day meet that is 
the qualifier for the World Championships at Seville, Spain, in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hartwig broke his American record in the pole vault, John  
Godina uncorked the best shot put in the world in two years, and 
Tisha Waller shattered meet and field records in winning the 
women's high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, capitalizing on the absence of injured world  
record-holder Michael Johnson, sped to victory in a wind-aided 
19.93 seconds, beating national indoor champion Rohsaan Griffin by 
.05 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't an ordinary Greene race. He stumbled out of the blocks  
and had to put his left hand on the track to maintain his balance. 
Griffin said he lifted his head too soon, about 50 meters in, 
allowing Greene to take the lead on the turn and hold off the 
fast-closing Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The start of my race was very shaky, but I recovered well and  
I believe I ran the best race that I could,'' said Greene, who 
earlier this month smashed Donovan Bailey's world record in the 100 
by running 9.79 in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene didn't come close to Johnson's world record of 19.32 or  
his personal best of 19.86, even with an aiding wind of 2.3 meters 
per second. He said having Johnson there might have given him a 
push. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I run against the best, the best comes out of me,''  
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the 1998 track athlete of the year, led all the way in  
winning in 22.10. Like Greene, it was not close to her best of 
21.62 and far off the world record of 21.34, but Jones was superior 
to the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Jones sprained her right knee while long-jumping  
and has been nursing the injury since, though she did not use that 
as an excuse Friday night when she lost her first long jump to an 
American since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best it's felt,'' Jones said of her knee. ``We were  
expecting the worse after the jump. I knew if I could get through 
jumping, I could get through running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, using a longer than usual pole that he had used only  
once before, soared 19 feet, 9 inches. He had won the event with 
vault of 19-2, then went for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked who would be the favorites to win the gold medal in  
Seville, the confident Hartwig said: ``Me. There's probably five 
guys in the world that'll have a good shot. Only one can win, but 
if everything goes well, hopefully it'll be me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig slithered over the bar at 19-9 on his first attempt,  
surpassing the mark of 19-8 1/2 he set last year. Hartwig then tried 
to become the first American to clear 20 feet, but missed three 
times, not coming close on any jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, the runner-up in the discus Saturday, put on a  
tremendous show in the shot put, with his first three throws 
exceeding 70 feet. On his longest throw, the usually conservative 
Godina danced happily along the fringes of the shot put area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I could have done a little bit better, but you kind of  
lose concentration when you get a big throw like that,'' he said of 
his longest throw in three years. ``I got a little bit too worn out 
from celebrating. I don't know if I should have done that so 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waller, who won her third outdoor title in four years and  
completed a sweep of the indoor and outdoor championships this 
year, missed three times at an American record 6-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of strong hurdling performances, Gail Devers won the  
women's 100 in a wind-aided 12.54 and Mark Crear took the men's 110 
in a wind-aided 13.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers, competing in her first competitive hurdles race in three  
years, ran the fastest race in the world this year. Plagued by 
injuries since 1996, Devers still is hurting. After going the whole 
meet without hitting a hurdle, she also said she's not attacking 
the apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I'm going to start getting my times to improve is  
to teach myself to challenge the hurdle,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crear's time in the men's hurdles also was the fastest in the  
world this year. He surged over the final hurdle to beat two-time 
world champion and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Allen Johnson, second 
at 13.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs stayed close to the leaders before charging to the front  
with less than 500 meters remaining to win in 15:24.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's other winners were Khadevis Robinson in the men's 800  
in 1:45.92; Pascal Dobert in the men's 3,000 steeplechase in 
8:21.48; Jearl Miles-Clark in the women's 800 in 1:59.47; Lynda 
Blutreich in the women's javelin at 182-2; and Curt Clausen in the 
men's 20-kilometer walk in 1:23:34.

humanitarian work. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old actor received the second annual Marian Anderson  
Award on Saturday in front of 400 friends and fans. Peck received a 
crystal sculpture and $100,000, which he donated to several 
charities. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brennan Settles on Lifetime NJ Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan  
avoided a trial by agreeing to pay $100 million and accepting a 
lifetime ban on participating in the securities industry in New 
Jersey, according to court papers filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan denied wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he  
used ``substantial influence'' at two brokerages to make 
``unreasonably excessive profits'' in low-cost stocks in which he 
held an undisclosed interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan is responsible for $45 million of the settlement, which  
was reached last week just as opening arguments were to begin in 
the case brought four years ago by state stock regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains unclear how much, if any, the bankrupt financier will  
ever pay. The money is to compensate the investors state regulators 
believe Brennan swindled. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $55 million would come from a settlement with  
investors made last year by the bankruptcy court-appointed overseer 
who is liquidating Brennan's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The practical result of the lifetime ban is also minimal because  
Brennan was barred last year by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission from re-entering the securities industry anywhere in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 55, became nationally known in the 1980s through  
television commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc., in 
which he would step from a helicopter and tell investors to ``come 
grow with us.'' The company has been inactive since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	State authorities charge that after closing First Jersey,  
Brennan secretly controlled two now-shuttered brokerages, Hibbard 
Brown and L.C. Wegard &AMP; Co. Inc., which pushed stocks he controlled 
onto unwitting investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The state accused Brennan, six others and the brokerages of  
making $300 million in illegal profits at the expense of individual 
investors from 1988 to 1995 by using illegal ``boiler room'' sales 
tactics and manipulating the prices of the low-cost securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had survived previous investigations with settlements  
but without sanction until 1995 when a federal judge in New York 
ruled that Brennan cheated First Jersey investors and ordered him 
to pay what is now more than $78 million to the SEC. The judgment 
drove him to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The state trial had been scheduled to start early in the month,  
but Freedman adjourned it until June 16 so defense lawyers could 
take depositions from three former associates of Brennan who had 
previously settled with the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan and his three remaining codefendants were not required  
to attend court Monday, and none chose to witness the papers signed 
by state Superior Court Judge Philip M. Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The codefendants who settled along with Brennan, concluding the  
case, were Robert B. Barnett, First Jersey's president; Robert G. 
Berkson, a former First Jersey executive; and Michael K. Hart, 
former national sales manager at First Jersey who later held the 
same post at Hibbard Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The codefendants have to pay amounts ranging from $25,000 to  
$200,000, and also cannot participate in the securities industry in 
New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Braves Scouting Director Leaving </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Paul Snyder, Atlanta's director of scouting and  
player development, said Monday he's leaving the Braves after 42 
years with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, 63, signed with the Milwaukee Braves as a player in  
1957. Slowed by a back operation in the early 1960s, he became a

	Snyder became the Braves' first director of stadium operations

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pitcher Layana Dies in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Former major league reliever Tim  
Layana, a member of the 1990 Cincinnati Reds World Series 
champions, died in a car crash. He was 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana, who also pitched for the San Francisco Giants, died  
after he was ejected from his Chevy Blazer that was broadsided by 
another car, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana and three passengers were traveling at around 4:15 p.m.  
when they tried to make a left turn. A 1982 Mercedes was passing 
slower traffic and broadsided Layana's Blazer. The Blazer flipped 
and Layana, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	His passengers -- Michael Layana, 37, Gregory Hoel, 34, and Bruce  
Taylor, 35 -- were treated at Kern Medical Center and released, said 
nursing supervisor Erlinda DeLaCruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Layana is the brother of the victim.  
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the Mercedes -- Michael Ryan, 19, of Lake Isabella  
-- and his passenger, Richard Welty, 18, were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana was most recently living in Culver City and was a  
baseball coach at a private Catholic school in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees drafted Layana in the third round in 1986  
out of Loyola Marymount. He spent four seasons in the Yankees' farm 
system before being taken by the Reds in the minor league draft 
before the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was 5-5 with a 4.56 ERA and two saves in 78  
career relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1990 with the World Series champion Reds when  
he went 5-3 with a 3.49 ERA and two saves in 55 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana was part of the Reds' bullpen nicknamed ``The Nasty  
Boys,'' which led Cincinnati to the World Series title. Layana was 
not on the postseason team that swept the Oakland Athletics in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Layana pitched one game for San Francisco in 1993 and never made  
it back to the majors.

<HEADLINE> Coach K Will Watch Stars Depart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Mike Krzyzewski will watch the NBA draft and  
think about what could have been next season. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 37-2 season and talk of a possible dynasty, the Duke  
coach will be helpless Wednesday night as the pros scoop up his 
talented underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not cut and dry, but overall I would side with finishing  
(school) and graduating and growing and all of that,'' the Duke 
coach said when asked about underclassmen Elton Brand, William 
Avery and Corey Maggette leaving the Blue Devils early for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Danny Ferry,  
Mike Gminski and Gene Banks all stayed four years at Duke, delaying 
the riches of pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But Duke's luck ran out this season. Brand, the national player  
of the year, said he would turn pro after his sophomore season, 
setting off a domino effect involving Avery and Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton felt somewhat guilty. He and his mom wanted to make sure  
they weren't offending anyone at Duke,'' said Krzyzewski, who 
supported Brand's decision to leave school because he thought Brand 
would be a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The news of Avery and Maggette exiting the program early wasn't  
greeted with such warmth from coach K. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me not supporting the decision does not mean I don't support a  
kid,'' Krzyzewski said. ``In no way did I ever say I wouldn't 
support a kid. They made a commitment to me. These guys went to 
their profession, and to their main profession as they see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Add senior Trajan Langdon, and the Blue Devils will likely  
become the first team to have four first-round picks in the same 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Five schools have had three first-round selections in the same  
year: Indiana (1976), Michigan (1990), UNLV (1991), Arkansas (1992) 
and Kentucky (1996). 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really hard to imagine that this could happen very  
often,'' said Keith Drum, an area scout for the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he felt hurt after some of the players bolted  
early, the trio not even staying for their junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have allure here,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have one  
of the great schools, we have an outstanding basketball program and 
we have great people. To me, that's a heck of a thing to be a part 
of. To me, that stands by itself against anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not millions of dollars, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Brand, Avery and Maggette are expected to go high in the first  
round, but teams have questions about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Brand tall enough? Can Avery run the point in the NBA? Does  
Maggette have enough experience? 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is 270 pounds and 6-foot-8, and some speculate he is  
closer to 6-5 1/2. In fact, Brand was measured twice when he worked 
out for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams made a big deal about it,'' Brand said. ``When it was my  
turn to get measured, it was like, `OK, it's Brand, shoes off, 
socks off, head straight' because there were so many rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brand's height checked out, and he has surprised some teams  
with his shooting ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who characterize him as just a power player are so  
wrong,'' Krzyzewski said of Brand. ``He can face the bucket and has 
ability to put the ball on the floor. He'll be unbelievably 
versatile in the pros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, a 6-2 sophomore, joins Maryland's Steve Francis and  
UCLA's Baron Davis as the top point guards in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He already has NBA 3-point range,'' Drum said of Avery. ``He  
improved a lot as a playmaker last season, but still has a long way 
to go. He had a lot of talent around him at Duke that made his 
conversion to the point pretty easy. You have less time to make the 
right decisions in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, a 6-6 freshman, was a reserve for Duke. He might be  
the draft's biggest mystery -- or reward. 
</P>
<P>
	While Maggette already has a pro-type body, he averaged only 17  
minutes a game for the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the epitome of a world of potential,'' Drum said. ``He  
is a great athlete and is an explosive jumper. Now he just has to 
bring the game together. Right now he is more athlete than 
basketball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski thinks the 6-3 Langdon, his senior star, is the one  
most ready for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be a longtime NBA player,'' the coach said. ``He's  
solid. There is very little variance in his game.''

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Treated for Burns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Michael Jackson was treated for minor  
burns at a Munich hospital after a benefit concert and released, a 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson suffered burns from the fireworks used in the concert,  
according to the spokesman for his concert promoter, Mama Concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, had  
confirmed that the pop star had been treated and released, but 
would give no other details other than to say it was ``nothing 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has had brushes with pyrotechnics before: He was  
hospitalized with second-degree scalp burns in January 1984 after 
his hair caught fire when a smoke bomb misfired during the filming 
of a soft-drink commercial in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson led a group of 30 international stars, including Andrea  
Bocelli, Luther Vandross and Boyzone, in eight hours of 
performances at Munich's Olympic Stadium. Luciano Pavarotti and 
Elizabeth Taylor dropped out at the last minute, citing health 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said more than 3 million marks ($1.6 million/1.5  
million euros) was raised for UNESCO, the Red Cross and the Nelson 
Mandela Children's Fund.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Fly Over Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes screeched over Beirut  
on Monday, setting off sonic booms and rattling Lebanese as they 
worked to restore electricity and roads cut off in devastating 
Israeli airstrikes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, Israel's defense minister said his warplanes  
struck Lebanese bridges and power stations Thursday night because 
Syria ignored Israel's requests that it rein in guerrillas in south 
Lebanon who have been firing rockets into northern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest exchange between Israel and Hezbollah guerillas  
since 1996 began Thursday, when Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets 
into northern Israel in retaliation for an Israeli attack that 
injured a Lebanese woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel then retaliated with bombing raids on Lebanon, drawing an  
intensified rocket attack by Hezbollah that killed two Israelis. 
The Israeli strikes lasted until early Monday, killing nine 
Lebanese. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Israel's parliament on  
Monday that he sent messages through the United States to Syrian 
President Hafez Assad after each shelling, but the Hezbollah 
bombardments continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our patience ran out,'' after the fatal rocket attack, Arens  
said, adding that was when warplanes targeted power substations and 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Beirut was plunged into darkness, ``our message registered  
... and the Hezbollah shellings stopped,'' Arens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, where it maintains  
30,000 troops. It is also a supporter of the Shiite Muslim 
Hezbollah group, which battles Israeli troops occupying a border 
zone in south Lebanon. Israel holds the strip to prevent 
cross-border attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	After days of relatively few overflights, Israeli jets buzzed  
over the capital and nearby mountains Monday, breaking the sound 
barrier and sending off a shock wave that startled residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids were a painful reminder of the war in the south for  
residents of Beirut, which has not been hit in three years and has 
been undergoing a reconstruction boom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the south, the Lebanese army erected two makeshift steel  
bridges near the collapsed Awali River Bridge to reconnect a key 
highway linking Beirut and south Lebanon. It was one of three 
bridges targeted by Israel on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	More lights came on in the capital, as the state power company  
increased service to homes and businesses 12 hours a day Monday 
instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
	Work continued around-the-clock to repair the two demolished  
power stations in Beirut's suburbs. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a 
Saudi billionaire businessman whose mother is Lebanese, has 
promised to foot the repair bill, estimated at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A commercial cellular phone site south of Beirut that was also  
hit resumed partial operations. Damage there is estimated at $20 
million.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell To Plead Guilty in Ark. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Webster Hubbell, President Clinton's Arkansas  
friend who served as associate attorney general, will plead guilty 
to covering up work he and former law partner Hillary Rodham 
Clinton did on a fraudulent land development back home, sources 
familiar with the case said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will recommend that Hubbell  
serve no jail time for the felony conviction, said the sources, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, who the sources say will enter the plea Wednesday, was  
scheduled to go on trial Aug. 9, and Starr's prosecutors had listed 
Mrs. Clinton as a potential witness. Even if she weren't called to 
the stand, the trial could have become a political issue as the 
first lady finalized plans regarding a bid for a U.S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, Hubbell's legal team has let Starr's  
office interview Hubbell in connection with the Castle Grande land 
deal indictment, which refers to Mrs. Clinton about three dozen 
times, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell will also plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge,  
while Starr will seek dismissal of other charges against Hubbell, 
his wife, his accountant and his tax lawyer in that separate tax 
case, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	That indictment alleges that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some  
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received from friends of 
the Clintons in 1994 when he was under criminal investigation by 
Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell lawyer John Nields and prosecutors from Starr's office  
went to the sixth floor of the federal courthouse Monday evening, 
along with U.S. District Judge James Robertson, who is presiding 
over both criminal cases against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked as he left why he was at the courthouse and whether any  
proceeding was scheduled for Wednesday, Nields said: ``I can't 
comment about it at all'' and ``I am a fountain of no 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hubbell's pleas would dispose of the remaining court cases  
Starr has brought in his nearly five-year inquiry, the 
investigations are still open, one source said. The course of 
Starr's investigation will depend on information Hubbell and 
possibly other witnesses give the prosecutors, said the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office is also scrutinizing Mrs. Clinton over her  
statements about the White House travel office firings. She 
maintained under oath that she didn't order the seven employees 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell and the late deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster --  
a pivotal figure in the travel office matter -- were close friends. 
Foster killed himself in July 1993 as congressional investigators 
were beginning to look at the travel office firings. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ray, declined comment on the plea  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	New York University law professor Steve Gillers said the records  
in Castle Grande ``leave a lot of unanswered questions about 
Hillary Clinton's role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell is the key to those answers,'' Gillers said. ``I find  
it hard to believe that Starr would not have demanded complete 
answers from Hubbell in exchange for what seems to be a fairly 
generous'' plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Starr  
might just be ready to wind down his work as the independent 
counsel law expires. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a prosecutor and could get rid of the Hubbell case  
this way and be done with it, I'd make the deal without any 
testimony,'' Walsh said. ``It's late in the day and nobody wants to 
see him tried twice. A felony disposition is a pretty solid 
outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of some charges against Hubbell is the 1,050-acre  
Castle Grande tract south of Little Rock, a development that 
federal regulators concluded was riddled with insider dealing and 
fictitious land sales. It was owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater 
partner, the late Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, 
prominent Little Rock businessman Seth Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande was revealed in 1996 when  
her law firm billing records mysteriously appeared in the White 
House, two years after prosecutors subpoenaed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost from the first day he went to work in August 1994, Starr  
has targeted Hubbell as a possible valuable witness against the 
Clintons. Months earlier, Hubbell had resigned his post as the 
Justice Department's No. 3 official because of questions about his 
work at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty in December 1994 to tax evasion and mail  
fraud for stealing nearly $400,000 from his law firm and its 
clients. He promised to cooperate with Starr's investigation of the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr renewed his investigation of Hubbell in 1995 after  
discovering that political supporters of the Clintons had paid 
Hubbell large sums of money for little or no work, raising the 
specter of ``hush money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation led to the tax case. The discovery of Mrs.  
Clinton's billing records for Castle Grande led to the concealment 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenneth Starr may have realized enough is enough. It's over,''  
said Georgetown University professor Paul Rothstein.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Fall; Wheat Rises / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures prices plunged Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat futures were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans futures, which are at a 20-year low, continued to fall  
Monday on news of favorable short-term growing conditions and 
record or near-record acreage devoted to this year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had jumped higher earlier in the day on updated weather  
reports that called for hot, dry conditions in the next week in key 
growing regions in the Midwest that could result in smaller crops. 
But the gains evaporated as differing weather forecasts surfaced as 
the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say wheat futures got support from continued concern  
over the condition of the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop. There 
were reports of harvest delays and possible crop disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn fell on expectations for favorable weather, at least in the  
short-term. But analysts said uncertainty over the weather reports 
-- calling for 100-degree temperatures in some areas -- kept the 
losses in check. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's close of trading, July wheat was up 1 1/4 cents at  
$2.52 1/2 a bushel; July corn was down 3 1/4 cents to $2.11 a bushel; 
July oats rose 1/2 cent to $1.14 a bushel; and July soybeans fell 4 3/4 
cents to $4.45 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, meat and livestock futures prices fell on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell 1.37 cents to 62.10 cents a pound;  
August feeder cattle dropped 1.50 cents to 75.92 cents a pound; 
July lean hogs fell 2 cents to 48.87 cents a pound; and July pork 
bellies dropped the limit 3 cents to 41.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan, China Seek To Restart Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Rivals Taiwan and China worked today on arranging  
a visit to the island by Beijing's top negotiator as part of a 
protracted effort to restart talks suspended since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan presented two possible dates for China's Wang Daohan to  
visit in September or October, said Jan Jih-horng, deputy secretary 
general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation that handles 
contacts with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing will decide on the dates later, Jan's Chinese  
counterpart, Li Yafei, told reporters after their first of two 
meetings today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang agreed to visit Taiwan under a series of minor agreements  
worked out during an October trip to Shanghai by his Taiwanese 
counterpart, Koo Chen-fu. That no date has been fixed after eight 
months underscores the difficulties both governments -- heirs to the 
opposing sides in the Chinese civil war -- have in working together. 
</P>
<P>
	In an indication of that friction, the two sides have not set an  
agenda for Wang's meeting with Koo in Taiwan. Li said there would 
be no restrictions on the topics to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve the atmosphere, China plans to hold a forum in late  
August on mainland-Taiwan ties and will invite senior Taiwanese 
statesman responsible for handling contacts with China, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	During their two hours of talks, negotiators also agreed to have  
Taiwanese legal experts visit China and a Chinese agricultural 
delegation go to Taiwan in July and August. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan also implored Beijing to set up shelters for Chinese who are  
caught illegally entering Taiwan. He suggested building detention 
centers on Chinese soil across the strait in Xiamen, Fujian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, illegal Chinese immigrants in a Taiwanese  
detention center held two police officers hostage, demanding to be 
returned home, before releasing them after 20 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Li said China was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, but would  
not be able to take full responsibility for the problem. At least 
5,000 Chinese are caught each year being smuggled on fishing boats 
to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan hopes Wang's visit will help nudge the two sides toward  
restoring a dialogue suspended by China four years ago in anger 
over Taiwanese efforts to shake off Beijing's diplomatic blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing regards the island as a renegade province with no right  
to international recognition and has threatened to attack if the 
island formally declares independence.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Celebrates NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Spurs fans didn't want the party to end.  
</P>
<P>
	All weekend the city cheered the first NBA championship won by  
its only major league sports team after 26 years of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration peaked Sunday night with a Fiesta-style river  
parade attended by 230,000 people and a tribute afterward for the 
team at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. Everything came together this year perfectly,''  
Spurs center David Robinson told ecstatic parade-goers. ``Our team 
came together. The city came together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players, coaches, team executives and a few devoted fans rode  
decorated, motorized barges along the San Antonio River through 
downtown as spectators lined the River Walk to watch. It was 
reminiscent of the city's annual Fiesta celebration each spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, the 5-foot-11 point guard who hit the winning  
jump shot against the New York Knicks on Friday to capture the 
title, was the star of the show at the dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson introduced his fellow players, cracked jokes about their  
personalities, made fun of the fact that he was twice cut by the 
Spurs and led approximately 40,000 fans in chants and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to ask you a question,'' Johnson said to the dome  
crowd. ``Did the Lakers win the championship?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' the fans yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did the Portland Trail Blazers win the championship?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' screamed the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did the Utah Jazz win the championship?''  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd responded with a huge ``No,'' and Johnson added,  
``With the Utah Jazz, it's all right to say `Hell, no!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to ask you a question. ... Did the San Antonio  
Spurs win the championship?'' Johnson asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans went wild.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio in 1973 as part of the American  
Basketball Association and merged into the NBA in 1976. San Antonio 
is the first old ABA team to win an NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the team's first trip to the NBA Finals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been so fantastic to see David Robinson and Avery Johnson  
get their due,'' said 11-year season-ticket holder Kevin Conroy, 
who rescheduled his cancer radiation treatments so he could attend 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Alamodome to the song, ``We Are the Champions,''  
Spurs players hopped onto a stage where the basketball court 
normally is and waved to the crowd as team members showed off the 
Larry O'Brien title trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a 10-year veteran, thanked the Spurs players of the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons I came here was because y'all had a  
tradition. The name I knew was George Gervin,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gervin, a Hall of Fame member who played for the Spurs in the  
1970s and early 1980s, stepped onto the stage and held the 
championship trophy as the crowd gave him big applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan was still recording everything with the mini-cam he  
also turned on after the Spurs' victory in Madison Square Garden. 
He was joined by several other Spurs, who pointed their cameras at 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``M-V-P, M-V-P,'' the fans chanted when Duncan was introduced.  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich told the fans they were crucial in  
the team's playoff victories, especially in urging on the 
game-winning, tippy-toe 3-pointer Sean Elliott sunk to defeat 
Portland in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals on Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without your energy, Sean Elliott can't stand on his toes and  
he misses that shot,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit that shot, it made it possible for Avery Johnson  
to hit another shot,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	And everyone knew what came next.

<HEADLINE> No Bond in Alleged Revenge Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- A man who police say told them he took  
revenge against his wife by purposely fathering her child and then 
killing the boy was ordered held without bond on a murder charge 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Lee Shanabarger, wearing a brown flak jacket over a jail  
jumpsuit, mumbled brief answers at a court hearing when he was 
appointed a public defender and told he will remain in jail until 
his Nov. 30 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told police he planned the crime to exact punishment  
on his wife, who had refused to cut short a cruise vacation after 
his father passed away in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 22, just hours after the funeral of his 7-month-old son,  
Tyler, Shanabarger confessed to his wife that he smothered their 
son in his crib three nights ealier, investigators said. A coroner 
had ruled the infant died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the funeral, Shanabarger, 30, allegedly told  
police in this suburban Indianapolis community that he suffocated 
Tyler with plastic wrap and that he dreamed up the crime after his 
father's death. 
</P>
<P>
	When the judge asked whether Shanabarger thought he had enough  
money to hire his own attorney, he said, ``I don't know. I'd have 
to check with my wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge suggested help was unlikely to come from his wife, Amy  
Shanabarger, and assigned public defender Richard Tandy to 
represent Shanabarger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was with him for a minute and a half and I really don't know  
enough about him to say anything yet,'' said Tandy, who planned to 
meet with his client to begin discussing a defense for a man who 
has allegedly confessed three times. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, those accused of murder can't bail out of jail. And  
those convicted of murdering a child are eligible for capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Lance Hamner said a death penalty decision may be  
weeks, even months, away. Authorities must collect evidence, talk 
to police, fellow prosecutors, defense counsel and -- most 
importantly -- Mrs. Shanabarger. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Randy Maynard, chaplain with the Franklin police, met with  
Shanabarger in jail after his arrest. He said Shanabarger was 
depressed, rattling off a list of things he had lost -- his job, his 
house, his money, his wife, his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `And you lost Tyler too,''' Maynard told reporters.  
```Oh yeah, I lost the boy too.' That was it for me. He said the 
wrong thing. I was out of there.''

<HEADLINE> EPA To OK New Fluorescent Bulb Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In most places, people who worry about the  
environment can recycle their cans, soda bottles and yard clippings 
with a quick trip to the curb or local landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Environmental Protection Agency is set to approve  
a new rule intended to add another product to that list -- 
fluorescent light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly a decade of debate over the dangers of mercury  
contamination, the EPA has decided to require those who buy 
fluorescent bulbs by bulk to recycle them or throw them in a 
hazardous waste landfill. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is a victory for recyclers and environmentalists who  
decried a rival plan backed by light manufacturers to allow the 
bulbs to be thrown into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule is aimed at large firms and government agencies  
that account for the vast majority of disposed bulbs. It could 
eventually spawn recycling programs for homeowners who toss lamps 
into the household garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the EPA classifies fluorescent bulbs as a hazardous  
waste and requires they be recycled or thrown in special hazardous 
waste landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	But enforcement has been spotty, according to Michael Bender, a  
consultant to the Association of Lighting and Mercury Recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that until EPA finalizes this rule the states  
have taken a wait-and-see attitude and are not enforcing the 
regulations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a lot of confusion out there, and this is going  
to clear up the confusion and make it easier for customers to 
understand the best things to do with lights,'' Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule will apply to mercury-containing fluorescent,  
mercury vapor, sodium vapor and metal halide lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	A naturally occurring metal, mercury accumulates in fish and  
becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. In humans, 
the neurotoxin can slow fetal and child development and cause brain 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, more than a dozen states -- including Massachusetts --  
require that fluorescent light bulbs be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules would continue to classify the bulbs as a  
hazardous waste but would also loosen tough standards for record 
keeping, storage and transportation of bulbs destined for 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from two major light bulb manufacturers -- General  
Electric Lighting and OSRAM Sylvania Lighting -- have maintained 
that the hazardous waste label is an overreaction to what is 
essentially a minuscule environmental threat from mercury-bearing 
lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Bleasby, director of industry relations and standards at  
OSRAM Sylvania, said recycling fluorescent bulbs is 
cost-prohibitive, given the abundance of recycled mercury from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In drawing up the new rule, the EPA considered draft studies  
conducted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Florida EPA 
concluding that broken fluorescent bulbs at landfills are strong 
sources of mercury pollution that can linger for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Bleasby said the studies are flawed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any draft study they have, I can provide you two more that say  
the exact opposite,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Up; Corn Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and soybean futures prices were up in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn futures 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say wheat futures got support from continued reports of  
harvest delays and possible crop disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices started the day lower but got a boost  
from updated weather reports. Forecasters are calling for hot, dry 
weather in the next week in key growing regions in the Midwest that 
could result in smaller crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn fell on expectations of high crop ratings later in the day  
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But analysts said the 
weather reports -- calling for 100-degree temperatures in some areas 
-- kept the losses small. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, July wheat was up 2 1/4 cents to $2.53 1/2 a  
bushel; July corn was down 3/4 cent to $2.13 1/2 a bushel; July 
oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.13 1/4 a bushel; and July soybeans rose 
1/2 cent to $4.51 a bushel. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Question Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The details of the plan remain under wraps,  
but lawmakers of both parties already are questioning whether 
President Clinton was overreaching with a Medicare rescue plan that 
includes broad new prescription drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton will detail his proposal to save Medicare  
from bankruptcy through a combination of better management, more 
competition and dipping into the federal budget surplus. He was 
proposing today that $794 billion from higher-than-expected 
surpluses -- $108 billion more than he proposed in February, when he 
submitted his budget -- be invested to strengthen Medicare over the 
next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of Clinton's Medicare overhaul will be a new  
program giving all 39 million beneficiaries access to prescription 
drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 15 million in the program for the elderly and  
disabled have no drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, head of the White House National Economic  
Council, said the surplus would be used to ``make sure that 
Medicare is safe and strong and solvent the next 25 years.'' The 
president ``is going to show a bit of political guts in coming 
forward with such a detailed plan,'' he said Sunday on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawmakers argued that while the working poor do need  
help with prescription drugs, extending that benefit to all 
Medicare recipients would threaten the 34-year-old program's 
financial future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said about two-thirds of those on  
Medicare do have prescription drug coverage, either through the 
Medicaid program for the poor or through private ``Medigap'' 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's don't make a problem where one doesn't exist, and  
providing that benefit is prohibitively expensive,'' Gramm said on 
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans generally favor a plan floated earlier this year  
that would offer government-subsidized drug benefits only for those 
living near the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling contended the new benefit would cost the taxpayers  
little because of planned savings in other Medicare programs, and 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the 
administration had ``no intention of rolling out a benefit that's 
going to spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala said the new program would be voluntary and people will  
share the costs. ``This will not be as generous as people think and 
that people are talking about,'' she said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues that many Medigap prescription drug  
policies, which average about $90 a month and have large 
deductibles, are too expensive for Americans with modest incomes. 
Shalala said half of rural Americans lack drug coverage, and many 
are skimping on drugs to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about just adding some new, lush benefit,'' she  
said. ``This is critical to health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., whose state's senior population  
strongly supports cheaper drug prices, told CBS that universal 
coverage was feasible if real steps are taken to make Medicare more 
efficient and cut fraud and waste, which he said still accounts for 
about 10 percent of Medicare spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the way to save  
Medicare from insolvency in the next decade ``is not to load it up 
with another big costly benefit that nobody pays for even though 
everybody wants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do it step by step,'' he said on ``Fox News  
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the prescription drug  
benefit is a candidate for that ``one last national achievement'' 
that Clinton wants before leaving office, but that the plan for 
universal coverage ``suffers an extensive reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, on CNN, predicted that in the end prescription drug  
benefits will be extended to only those 15 million elderly not now 
covered and that Medicare reform will be linked to the Republicans' 
top priority, a package of tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Sec. Council Meets About Iraq Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council held its first  
discussion on three rival proposals to restart relations with Iraq 
Monday, still deeply divided more than six months after U.N. 
inspectors pulled out of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the five  
veto-wielding permanent members of the council remain split in two 
camps with no immediate prospect of bridging their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 council members agree on the need to resume weapons  
monitoring and to suspend at least some U.N. sanctions in an effort 
to improve living conditions for the 22 million Iraqis who have 
lived under sanctions since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But the five permanent members remain divided on key issues --  
when and how to suspend sanctions and what kind of financial 
controls to impose on Iraq after sanctions are suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	France, Russia and China, Iraq's closest allies on the council,  
want to suspend all sanctions if Iraq cooperates with a new 
commission that would monitor its banned weapons programs. Britain 
and the United States would suspend only the oil embargo if Iraq 
answers key remaining questions about its weapons programs -- a 
proposal already rejected by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. inspectors left Iraq in mid-December just before the United  
States and Britain launched airstrikes on Baghdad because of its 
failure to cooperate with the inspectors. Baghdad has barred 
inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz rejected the  
British-Dutch draft in an interview carried Monday by the Qatari 
al-Jazeera satellite channel. He was quoted as saying it imposed 
restrictions which aren't in existing council resolutions and paved 
the way ``for a new aggression on Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's meeting, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergei Lavrov  
said he didn't expect much -- and he left without commenting 
further. ``I don't think the issue is ready for discussion,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said there was  
``clear support'' for the British-Dutch draft. 
</P>
<P>
	For the British and Americans, Iraqi compliance with key  
disarmament demands is essential. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members agreed to continue the talks early next month.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Hispanic Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- George W. Bush is wooing Hispanic voters in his  
first visit to California since officially announcing his 
presidential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP front-runner begins a three-day swing today through  
California, the nation's largest state and the one with the biggest 
cache of nominating convention delegates and Electoral College 
votes. Bush has seven fund-raising events planned in the state this 
week. His campaign already has raised more than $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his first visits will be the ``Plaza de Mexico'' exhibit  
at a county fair. The excursion is meant to highlight cultural and 
commercial ties between the United States and its southern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics make up 15 percent of the electorate in California,  
and they have increasingly voted Democratic. Battles over illegal 
immigration, affirmative action and bilingual education that raged 
through most of the 1990s under then-Gov. Pete Wilson have left 
deep reservations among Hispanics toward Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fact that's not lost on Bush or his Republican  
presidential rivals. The Texas governor on Monday appointed Margita 
Thompson, who is Hispanic and speaks Spanish, to his California 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a message that speaks to values that the  
Hispanic community can understand,'' Bush said as he arrived here 
Monday night. ``I've done a good job in Texas of reaching out to 
the Hispanic community, I intend to do so in California as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics constitute America's fastest growing electorate group.  
Nationally, 5 percent of the voting public is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech last week in Detroit, Bush told his predominantly  
Hispanic audience: ``The message has got to be, 'The American dream 
has got to stand for you as well.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, another Republican  
presidential hopeful, gave a brief Spanish pitch to adult students 
in Los Angeles in March, but it backfired when his audience began 
to pepper him with questions in Spanish, which he didn't 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona has long courted Hispanic voters and  
captured more than 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in his last two 
elections. ``Their support is my honor,'' McCain said at a GOP 
convention here in February. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, the front-runner, Vice President Al  
Gore, told a mostly Hispanic audience in Los Angeles last week that 
the Republicans were trying to divide Californians with ``demagogic 
tactics designed to turn one group against each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an apparent reference to the state's Proposition 187, the  
successful ballot measure five years ago that sought to bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving most forms of state aid. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two presidential elections, the Hispanic vote  
nationally went overwhelmingly for the Democrat, Bill Clinton. He 
got 61 percent of the vote in 1992 and 72 percent in 1996, 
according to Voter News Service exit polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Bush won the Texas gubernatorial race last year with  
49 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a VNS exit poll. 
Another exit poll, by the William Velasquez Institute of San 
Antonio for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, 
a Hispanic interest group, put the figure at 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor hopes to parlay this support into a broad  
victory in the primaries. States with heavy Hispanic populations 
include California, Texas, New York and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a 900-pound electoral gorilla,'' said Leslie Goodman, a  
Republican consultant volunteering for Bush's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The four states combined have 144 of the 270 electoral votes  
needed to win the White House.

<HEADLINE> NYC Gays Try To Reduce Risks of HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than a third of homosexual men in New York  
City don't use condoms when they have sex, but most of those who 
have unprotected sex are trying to reduce the risks of HIV 
infection in other ways, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of more than 7,000 homosexuals, conducted last year  
by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, is the biggest of its kind in the 
nation's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	As in recent surveys of other cities with large homosexual  
populations, the New York survey found a substantial group of men 
had unprotected anal intercourse in the past year -- 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest said they either are having sex with partners whose  
infection status matches their own or are limiting their sexual 
activities to certain practices that reduce the risk of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen percent overall said they abstained from anal sex  
altogether and 35 percent said they always use condoms for anal 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 percent of men who have unprotected anal sex said they  
do so with a partner whose HIV status they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 2 percent admitted being HIV-positive and having  
unprotected anal sex with someone whose HIV status was not known to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5 percent also acknowledged having unprotected sex with  
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, first reported on Monday, has been accepted for  
presentation at a conference in Atlanta this summer by the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was compiled from 7,065 questionnaires handed out at  
bars, clubs, bathhouses, street corners, beaches and other venues 
where homosexual men gather. To reach blacks, Hispanics and other 
minorities, a peer system was used in which volunteers attempted to 
reach out to men of similar ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is not as scientific as a random poll that is then  
weighted to reflect the actual population by age and ethnicity. 
White, middle-aged, educated men were overrepresented in proportion 
to their actual numbers. Young black and Hispanic men were 
underrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
	But the methodology -- using volunteers enlisted by a gay  
organization to reach out to their peers -- has been used in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the CDC cited as significant the findings of a  
similar street survey by STOP AIDS, a San Francisco-based advocacy 
group. That survey of nearly 22,000 homosexual men found that 39.2 
percent reported having unprotected anal sex in 1997, up 
substantially from 30.4 percent in a 1994 STOP AIDS street survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Other alarming trends were also reported earlier this year, such  
as increases in rates of other sexually transmitted diseases in 
some cities and a rise in risky behavior like sex parties for 
HIV-positive men where condoms are banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from New York City, however, have been scarce. Although a  
law has been passed requiring clinics to report HIV infection 
rates, the regulations have not yet been implemented, and the city 
Health Department, unlike other Health Departments around the 
country, does not issue monthly reports tracking other sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMHC study, being the first of its kind, does not indicate  
whether risky behavior here is increasing, decreasing or remaining 
steady.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Finally To See Odom Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In years past, this would have been the week the  
Chicago Bulls caused a clamor in the city, hoisting trophies to the 
adoring thousands who gathered in Grant Park for a championship 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Bulls management was finishing its homework Monday,  
planning to watch mystery man Lamar Odom work out, considering 
trade offers and comparing notes in preparation for the NBA draft 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, known for his secrecy, insisted  
the Bulls did not know what they would do with the No. 1 pick. 
Chicago also owns the 16th pick and two picks in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a very good possibility we will not make any decision  
on our draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of phone calls from the better teams. But  
those things are not productive because they don't have the draft 
choices we want to eventually acquire. Whatever we do, if we make a 
move, it will be with a team that's fairly high in the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So if the Bulls don't trade, who might they take? Exciting  
Maryland guard Steve Francis? Duke's consensus player of the year, 
Elton Brand? A scorer like Miami's Wally Szczerbiak or Rhode 
Island's long-armed, 6-foot-11 Odom, considered by many to be the 
top talent in a draft without an impact player? 
</P>
<P>
	Odom seemed to reverse course after announcing for the draft and  
was apparently thinking about returning to school. He's refused to 
take a physical and skipped scheduled workouts with some teams, 
including the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago assistant coach Frank Hamblen was on his way to  
Providence, R.I., on Monday to watch the 19-year-old Odom work out. 
Krause and coach Tim Floyd said they expected to talk with the 
player on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause said the Bulls have seen Odom play close to 20 times in  
the last two years. He tried to draw a comparison with another 
troubled player, Dennis Rodman, saying the former rebounding 
champion ``was a character who had character'' and was fine once 
the game started. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the young man is basically a good person -- and  
Dennis was basically a very good person -- you can see there are 
different ways of evaluating people. We don't evaluate anybody 
until you speak to them,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Bulls brought in more than 35 players to interview,  
test and work out, spending two or three days with the top 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are going to get in this draft hopefully is a building  
block or blocks toward what we have to do,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	After six titles in the 1990s, the NBA lockout and then Michael  
Jordan's retirement, the Bulls struggled to a 13-37 season. They 
did stockpile draft choices and have about $20 million available 
under the salary cap. Teams can sign free agents beginning Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd has said he'd prefer to keep the top draft choice rather  
than trade and was impressed with several of the potential top 
picks he met. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is sure if Odom could become one of those, even though  
his talent as passer, scorer and ball handler at his size is 
indisputable.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Urges Web Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth  
Dole, campaigning Monday in Washington's high-tech corridor, urged 
the industry to help shield youngsters from pornography on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hour-long meeting with Microsoft chairman Bill Gates,  
Mrs. Dole applauded the software company for developing a computer 
program that can ``childproof'' cyberspace. She then called on 
Congress to withhold some federal dollars from schools and 
libraries that fail to install similar screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole traveled to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond after  
raising $50,000 at a private fund-raising breakfast in Seattle. 
During a stop at a Bellevue library, she proposed broadening 
federal legislation on Internet filters and said she had asked 
Congressional GOP leaders to extend the screening requirement to 
all computers in public schools and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also suggested withholding federal computer money from  
libraries and schools that fail to comply with such requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Libraries should not use federal tax money to put pornography  
on their shelves,'' she said. ``...To protect our families and to 
protect our taxpayers, we should not let pornography slip in 
through an electronic back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who trails George W. Bush in the race for the GOP  
nomination, said she's not intimated by his wide lead in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. No. This is early!'' Mrs. Dole declared.  
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned. We're going to win this. We are going strong,''  
she said. ``In all the polls I've seen, I've been running a very 
strong second to George Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll released Monday indicated otherwise, however.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll reported that Bush had  
expanded his lead -- and that most of the gain came at Mrs. Dole's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor had the support of six out of 10 Republicans,  
59 percent, while Mrs. Dole dropped from 24 percent in May to 8 
percent in the recent poll. Mrs. Dole, who had been the only other 
GOP candidate in double digits, is now in a four-way tie with Steve 
Forbes, Dan Quayle and John McCain for second place nationally, 
according to the poll.

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls New Rules for Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Political heavyweights are gathering in the  
corner of a group that may need extra legal protection -- boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional subcommittee was collecting testimony today from  
boxing promoters, a boxing commissioner, a boxing author, a boxing 
official and a boxer, all pushing a bill to give fighters greater 
protection from greedy promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's House sponsor, Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, said it would  
help states police the boxing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would require promoters and organizers of major  
boxing events to disclose more financial information and to inform 
state boxing commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out 
of boxers' purses. 
</P>
<P>
	No boxing contract could extend longer than a year, a condition  
to make it more difficult to obligate fighters to long-term deals 
in exchange for a shot at a world title. Also, no contract could 
require a fighter to hire a manager associated with the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bill written by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., becomes law,  
``the most egregious abuses in the boxing industry would be 
prohibited on a nationwide basis,'' said Oxley. 
</P>
<P>
	He said promoters have been known to use a coerced managerial  
contract to siphon an extra 33 percent from a boxer's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Sirb, boxing commissioner for Pennsylvania and president  
of the Association of Boxing Commissioners, said changes being 
pushed by McCain and Oxley ``will ultimately elevate professional 
boxing to the level that other major sports in this country 
currently enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is named after Muhammad Ali, who appeared before  
a Senate committee this year to lend his support. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also has been endorsed by the International Boxing  
Federation and World Boxing Council. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of the bill passed the Senate last year, but time ran  
out without action by the House. This year's version is awaiting 
action by the full Senate and just beginning its process in the 
House with a hearing before a House Commerce subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Sirb, the telecommunications, trade and consumer  
protection panel arranged to hear testimony from middleweight 
Alfonso Daniels; World Boxing Council legal counsel Arlen D. 
``Spider'' Bynum; author and former Olympian Jose Torres; and 
promoters Dan Goossen and Tony Holden. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prices at Amusement Parks Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Go ahead and get that second cone of cotton  
candy at the amusement park this summer. You can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a family of four to visit a U.S. amusement  
park decreased by $1.58 this year to $141.32, according to an 
annual survey by the trade publication Amusement Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in admission charges were offset by decreases in  
children's prices and the cost of souvenir T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville, Tenn.-based Amusement Business, which compiles  
information from the same 25 parks each year, considers the cost of 
admission for two adults and two children, parking, food and two 
child-size souvenir T-shirts. The average price experience the 
first decline since the publication began keeping tabs five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the whole scope of things, (the cost) didn't  
decrease as much as it just stopped its magnificent gains,'' said 
Tim O'Brien, Amusement Business' southeast editor, who compiled the 
survey. ``They are stabilizing a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A large part of the decline was attributed to Six Flags'  
decision to admit children under 48 inches for half-price at its 16 
amusement, water and animals parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to develop brand loyalty at a young age by a  
demographic group whose purchasing power is growing, said Brent 
Gooden, a spokesman for the Premier Parks-owned Six Flags chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``These youngsters will grow up and as teen-agers they'll want  
to ride the latest ride,'' Gooden said. ``And these teen-agers will 
be parents someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedar Fair, which owns Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio and Worlds  
of Fun in Kansas City, Mo., also had tried discounting children's 
admission to great success several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful marketing ploy and it saves people money,''  
O'Brien said. ``What they lose in money, they pick up in goodwill 
and marketing value. You're going to be more inclined to take your 
kids back to the later in the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., experienced the largest cost  
increase at $21.50. The park, which according to the survey costs 
$161.50 for a family of four, added a new looping roller coaster as 
well as a gospel music hall of fame and museum this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're adding a major new ride, that is taken into  
consideration when looking at admission prices,'' said Ellen 
Liston, Dollywood's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices shot up with the average costs of a hot dog and  
hamburger increasing 14 cents to $2.46 and $2.99 respectively. An 
average order of fries went up 13 cents to $1.79 and soft drinks 
went up eight cents to an average of $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost of a T-shirt at the parks decreased $2.14 to  
$9.74, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Nellie Bly Park in Brooklyn, N.Y., was the cheapest park,  
costing a family of four only $65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-area theme parks continued to be the priciest in the  
survey. Universal Studios Florida, whose prices are similar to 
nearby Walt Disney World and SeaWorld parks, topped the list, 
costing a family of four $225.

<HEADLINE> Dummy Helps Teach Medical Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Everybody's first encounter with Stan D.  
Ardman is the same, no matter if they are doctors, nurses, medical 
residents, anesthesiologists or Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	First chance they get, they try to kill him.  
</P>
<P>
	Stan's a dummy -- and one sophisticated dummy at that. From his  
resting place on an operating table at Penn State's College of 
Medicine, the $200,000 mass of plastic, metal, wire and circuit 
board spends his days crashing into all manner of medical trauma: 
heart attacks, asthma attacks, blocked airways, collapsed lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical simulators like Stan, introduced five years ago, are  
rapidly finding their way into hospitals from Stanford to Sydney. 
They are part of a growing effort to train medical residents 
without risk to patients, to cut mistakes by professionals and, 
when errors happen, to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out, part of that training is to learn what it takes for a  
patient to die. It's a lot like test pilots trying out the newest 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see what their safety margins are,'' says Jody  
Henry, an assistant in the simulator lab whose laptop makes Stan 
run. ``They say, `How do I know where the bad things start if I've 
never seen them happen?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight simulators came about because airlines and the military  
figured it would be cheaper for a pilot to crash a virtual aircraft 
than a real one. The idea is similar in patient simulators: Better 
to kill a dummy than a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as people prepare with fire drills and disaster training,  
we want medical students to know what it's like before it 
happens,'' says Dr. Margaret Wojnar, a Penn State professor who 
uses the simulator. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial dummies actually were offshoots of flight  
simulation technology. They first arrived in hospitals in 1994, and 
sales took off in 1996. Today, about 150 hospitals have one. The 
two major manufacturers, Medical Education Technologies Inc., of 
Sarasota, Fla., and MedSim-Eagle Simulation Inc., of Binghamton, 
N.Y., say sales are strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan has blinking eyelids, pupils that dilate, an airway that  
opens and closes, and a pulse. He breathes and exchanges gases like 
human lungs. Physicians inject drugs, drain fluid from his heart 
sac, intubate him, insert chest pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan's name comes from his default setting -- standard man -- but  
he can become ``Truck Driver,'' a beer-swilling cardiac patient who 
smokes four packs a day. There is a program for ``Soldier,'' who 
has a gunshot wound. Doctors can also change his condition on the 
fly to keep students off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	These sophisticated simulators have become all the rave despite  
a medical community wary at first of the technology. Even today, 
researchers are working to determine how, clinically, it helps 
teach doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's left of the resistance is people who are threatened by  
it,'' says Chris Paulsen, executive vice president at MedSim-Eagle. 
They say, `Are they going to use it against me in a high-pressure, 
pass-fail test?''' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, most don't.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Hershey Medical Center, home of Penn State's College of  
Medicine, the dummy is used by the surgical, nursing and anesthesia 
departments for crisis training; by the residents for trauma 
lessons; and by high schoolers and Boy Scouts for health education. 
</P>
<P>
	For the professionals, programs are optional. In groups of six,  
participants work an emergency, focusing not on medical technique, 
but on group dynamics. Do the right doctors take the lead? Do the 
first people on the scene call in specialists soon enough? 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is videotaped, and the group uses it to discuss  
what they could have done better. ``They can practice all the 
uncommon events, the crises,'' says W. Bosseau Murray, who runs the 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same way, medical students and residents can come into  
the lab and work through traumas a dozen times. The other way to 
learn? ``On real live patients,'' Murray says. ``On you, your wife 
or your children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent morning, five resident doctors from Hershey Medical  
Center gather in the lab to prepare for one-month rotations in the 
intensive care unit. They are here for a refresher course on 
opening airways in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	First up are a handful of first- and second-year residents.  
Wojnar sets up a patient, a 25-year-old man with an upper airway 
problem. The dummy's chest moves up and down irregularly. He's 
blinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senior residents are tied up in a meeting. There you are  
in the unit by yourself,'' she says. ``What do you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using stethoscopes, the students probe Stan's chest. They feel  
for a pulse and ask Wojnar questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chest X-ray? ``Not done.''  
</P>
<P>
	Medical history? ``Yeah, actually, somebody gave him peanuts at  
school today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His breathing and heart rates fall. First, they try ``bagging''  
him, forcing air into his lungs with a pump. Nothing changes. They 
look down his throat and see it is blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you going to do? You're losing him,'' Wojnar warns.  
</P>
<P>
	They try a procedure called a tricothyroidotomy, inserting a  
needle into the neck and forcing oxygen into the airway. That 
works. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, they will decide the patient had a swelling in the back  
of his throat, an allergic reaction to peanuts. The students smile, 
looking pleased with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``They like to challenge themselves and see if they can work  
through the problems,'' Wojnar says. ``They knew they figured it 
out. It's a big puzzle. A lot of medicine is like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the simulator has limitations, the test lacks the  
urgency of a true emergency. The simulator can't talk, for one 
thing. The other difficulties are human: These students are 
unfamiliar with how the dummy works, and Wojnar is still learning 
how she can use it to push her students. But she's satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all reality, because it's still a simulation,'' she  
says. ``But it's close.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls Contours and Mystiques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said Monday it is  
recalling 703,000 1996 to 1998 Ford Contours and Mercury Mystiques 
because of vehicle-lighting concerns that may affect tail light or 
instrument-panel operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the affected vehicles, electrical terminals at what's  
called the headlight switch wiring harness connector may be damaged 
by overheating, the automaker said. If that happens, Ford said, the 
instrument panel's lighting, and parking and tail lamp circuits, 
could fail. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of accidents or injuries attributed  
to the problem, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail to arrange  
with their dealer to have the wiring harness connector replaced -- 
and the headlight switch inspected and replaced, if necessary -- at 
no charge.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Thwart GOP Spending Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gridlock triumphed in the Senate as Democrats  
blocked action Monday on a series of spending bills in a struggle 
to force Republicans into a protracted debate on health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total farce,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said about the Democratic tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	With four shiny tractors as a backdrop, Lott and other GOP  
lawmakers held a news conference across the street from the Capitol 
to accuse Democrats of thwarting a money bill for farm programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are ``acting like some of the stubborn HMOs'' they  
frequently criticize, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unchastened, Democrats later held ranks and kept Republicans  
from advancing either the farm bill or three other spending 
measures. The majority Republicans never gained more than 50 votes 
on any of the four, well shy of the 60 needed to bring them to a 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the frustration of the Republican leadership,''  
said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. But he said Republicans were 
merely using the spending bills to duck difficult issues on 
legislation to enhance the ability of patients to deal with their 
managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly those on the Republican side do not want to have these  
votes. They don't want to say yes or no'' and choose between 
patients and insurance companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican news conference was a classic bit of Washington  
theater, held on a muggy summer's day. The tractors, two red and 
two green, formed a made-for-television backdrop as a string of GOP 
senators criticized the Democrats for failing to allow the 
agriculture bill to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sound of a jackhammer intruded moments after the news  
conference began as a crew worked across the street to repair a 
sidewalk. No sooner had the drilling stopped than a truck bearing a 
Capitol landscaping crew rumbled toward the senators, aides and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides signaled to the driver to stop. He did.  
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the legislative struggle is an attempt by  
Democrats to force Republicans through a series of politically 
difficult amendments related to the HMO question. Democratic leader 
Tom Daschle said at day's end that he and lawmakers in his party 
want a ``full, meaningful debate'' on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott tried to win agreement for a swift vote on the entire  
Democratic measure, without amendments, but Daschle objected.

<HEADLINE> Detroit To Restore City's Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Endowed with riches by the roaring auto industry,  
the men who shaped the Motor City in the early part of the century 
poured money into bricks, mortar and concrete to create an 
architectural treasure trove of graceful design and intricate 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Today many of Detroit's gems are tattered and worn, done in by  
years of hard times and neglect. But as the city moves to kick its 
fledging renaissance into high gear, some see a vision of the 
future in the elegant past. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculators are pouring money into a city that for so long was  
synonymous with middle class flight to the suburbs and urban decay. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen distinctive buildings have changed hands in  
the past year, sales sparked by a strong economy, renewed corporate 
and civic investment, optimism in the city's leadership -- and an 
appreciation for aesthetics and history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I clearly think there's more upside potential in investing in  
the city,'' said David Farbman, a 27-year-old executive of a real 
estate company that plans to spend millions in Detroit. ``I think 
that Detroit clearly -- for the first time in 30-plus years -- is 
beginning to become a driver of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an investment group, Brian Pastoria bought two century-old  
buildings -- a four-story structure that for 52 years was quarters 
to a mannequin-rental shop, and a three-story, Tudor-style building 
where women once sold handcrafted items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to preserve a part of history. ... It's great to  
have these old jewels shined up,'' said Pastoria, who thinks at 
least one of the buildings can be used for loft offices and 
entertainment venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the city's relics boast ornate cornices. Facades of  
others feature Pewabic tile, Montrose granite and Mankato stone -- 
even marble -- as testament to the richness of Detroit's 
architectural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	No expense was spared in those pre-Depression days.  
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Kelbaugh, dean of the University of Michigan's Taubman  
College of Architecture and Urban Planning, believes Detroit's 
collection is bettered only by New York City's and Chicago's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're a huge asset I'd hate to see lost,'' Kelbaugh  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The push to preserve the old is combined these days with a  
construction boom for the new. 
</P>
<P>
	Side-by-side downtown stadiums for the Detroit Lions and the  
Detroit Tigers -- the Lions are moving from the suburbs and the 
Tigers are replacing their rundown park -- will be in place in the 
next few years, as will three new casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. is investing $500 million to renovate the  
multi-tower Renaissance Center and turn it into its world 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	And Compuware Corp., the computer software and services giant,  
is planning to move to the city from the suburbs and invest $1.2 
billion in two office structures. 
</P>
<P>
	City leaders expect the GM, Compuware and casino efforts to draw  
thousands of good-paying jobs downtown, spurring developers to snap 
up cheap buildings to restore into lofts, offices, restaurants and 
the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit hopes to follow the lead of other cities like Cleveland  
and Baltimore, which have seen new interest and investments in 
their urban cores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the momentum growing daily,'' Brenda Schneider, a  
Comerica bank vice president who heads the banking company's 
business and development services, said of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Farbman and three partners figure they'll pour about $10 million  
into restoring two of downtown's smaller gems -- six-story buildings 
dating to the early 1900s and featuring facades melding terra 
cotta, red brick and arching windows. Their plan: turn them into 
loft apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in order to have a great city, a number of your  
historic fixtures need to be restored,'' said Farbman, executive 
vice president of the Farbman Group, a full-service real estate 
company that has about $300 million in active developments in 
southeast Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	To Greg Bowens, spokesman for Mayor Dennis Archer, developers  
snapping up what now amount to cheap downtown buildings are smartly 
ahead of the curve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The optimism runs high, and we expect it to continue,'' Bowens  
said.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Regulations Rule Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a full appeals  
court Monday to reconsider a three-judge panel's decision 
overturning new federal air pollution regulations for smog and 
soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial requirements, issued by the Environmental  
Protection Agency in 1997, called for tougher pollution controls to 
reduce the amount of smog-causing chemicals and microscopic soot in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia said in a 2-1 decision May 14 that the EPA 
lacked authority to impose the tougher smog standards and had 
improperly issued new standards for soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The court action came in response to a lawsuit filed by some of  
the country's most powerful business interests and sent shock waves 
through the administration and the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal had been expected.  
</P>
<P>
	In its filing Monday, the Justice Department argued the  
three-judge panel had ``erred in concluding that the EPA lacks 
authority to implement and revise more stringent ozone'' standards 
and in holding that the agency's actions on soot was an 
``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full appeals court must now consider whether to uphold the  
panel's decision, or reverse it. The administration may still 
appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, should it be necessary, 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 regulation that was struck down by the panel's May 14  
decision, was one of the most controversial ever developed by EPA. 
It required much tougher air pollution controls to reduce soot and 
ozone levels in the air to ensure better protection of children, 
the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who has promised an appeal,  
said she was gratified of the Justice Department action to try to 
reverse ``one of the most bizarre and extreme decisions in the 
annals of environmental jurisprudence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If allowed to stand this decision would bring real  
consequences to the American people,'' she said in a statement. If 
the tougher air standards are blocked ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a broad cross-section of  
industry groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil 
and auto industries, as well as small businesses. Three states -- 
Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards being challenged had limited ozone, an  
essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 
parts per million under the previous requirement. And for the first 
time they required that states to regulate microscopic 
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources 
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
in 1997, but the EPA and the White House sided with 
environmentalist and health advocacy groups, which argued the more 
stringent air quality standards are needed to protect sensitive 
populations such as children and people with respiratory problems.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Broadcaster Santo Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs radio broadcaster Ron Santo  
underwent heart bypass surgery today, a week after suffering a mild 
heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cubs third baseman, a nine-time All-Star and  
five-time Gold Glove winner, has a history of diabetes and recently 
underwent an angiogram that revealed a minor blockage of one 
artery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs said Santo, 59, went into surgery at 8:30 a.m. at  
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The operation was 
expected to last about five hours, the Cubs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo suffered the heart attack last Monday and admitted himself  
into a Denver hospital. He was in Colorado to broadcast the Cubs' 
three-game series with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Chicago on Thursday, Santo has been receiving  
treatment at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	Santo became the team's radio announcer 10 years ago. While  
Santo recovers, his commentator's job in the radio booth is being 
handled by his former Cubs teammate, Randy Hundley.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Wants Own Assistant Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New coach Phil Jackson told Lakers assistants  
Kurt Rambis, Bill Bertka and Larry Drew on Monday that he intends 
to assemble his own coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jackson is successful in hiring the assistants he wants,  
Rambis, Drew and Bertka will all be offered front office jobs with 
the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, named the Lakers' coach on June 16, is expected to try  
to hire his former assistants at Chicago, Jim Cleamons and Jimmy 
Rodgers, and possibly Tex Winter, whose contract with the Bulls 
expires soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis became Los Angeles' interim head coach when Del Harris  
was fired 12 games into this past season. Rambis guided the Lakers 
to the second round of the playoffs, but they were swept by San 
Antonio, the eventual NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis joined Los Angeles' coaching staff in 1994. Drew has been  
a Lakers assistant for seven years. Bertka has been with the team 
for 18 years, the longest current tenure of an assistant with any 
NBA team.

<HEADLINE> Wisc. Gas and Electric Co's Combine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wisconsin's largest electric and gas companies  
are combining forces in a $1.275 billion deal that would create the 
state's largest utility corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	If regulators approve the merger between Wisconsin Energy Corp.

gas and electric customers in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula and have a market value of $7.3 billion, said Richard 
Abdoo, Wisconsin Energy's chairman, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Wisconsin Energy would pay a fixed price of  
$31.50 per share for all Wicor's outstanding shares. Wisconsin 
Energy said at least 40 percent of the merger, and possibly as much 
as 60 percent, will be paid for in Wisconsin Energy stock. The 
remainder will be paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies anticipate the merger would save them about $35  
million annually beginning in 2001 through lower gas prices and 
attrition in the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	No workers will be laid off because of the merger, said George  
Wardeberg, Wicor's chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers would see the merger's effects in the mailbox when  
they receive a combined gas and electric bill, Abdoo said. While he 
does not anticipate an outright reduction in gas or electricity 
rates, he said the merger would help control rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the savings of the merger would in the long term  
offset the pressure to raise prices,'' said David Walker, an 
analyst with Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Wicor rose 5.3  
percent, rising $1.56 1/4 to close at $28.12 1/2 per share. Wisconsin 
Energy fell 50 cents to $26.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture, to be called Wisconsin Energy Corp., will  
continue to be based in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdoo will serve as chairman of the new company, with Wardeberg  
as vice chairman. Wardeberg plans to retire after two years, then 
serve on the Wisconsin Energy board. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tommy Thompson said Monday a bigger Wisconsin Energy Corp.  
may have the resources to develop a second gas pipeline into 
Wisconsin. Currently, all gas into Wisconsin comes through a 
pipeline run by American Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Another pipeline would probably result in lower gas prices,  
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Wisconsin Energy has tried to acquire  
another energy company. In 1995, Wisconsin's Public Service 
Commission rejected Wisconsin Energy's $6 billion plan to merge 
with Minneapolis-based Northern States Power Company. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators were largely concerned that combination would  
put too much market power into too few hands, said commission 
spokesman Jeff Butson. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators and the companies' shareholders must approve the  
proposed WicorWisconsin Energy merger. Company officials said they 
anticipate the transaction can be completed by the spring of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy is a holding company with subsidiaries in  
utility and non-utility businesses. Its principal subsidiaries are 
Wisconsin Electric, Edison Sault Electric, Wisvest, Minergy and 
Wispark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicor Inc. operates six subsidiaries in two industries, energy  
services and pump manufacturing. The subsidiaries are Wisconsin 
Gas, Wicor Energy, FieldTech, Sta-Rite Industries, SHURflo Pump 
Manufacturing Company and Hypro Corporation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reopens 5 Embassies in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has reopened five of six  
embassies in Africa that were shuttered last week. The embassy in 
Madagascar remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision to return to normal business in Gambia, Togo,  
Liberia, Namibia and Senegal was made over the weekend after 
consultations among various U.S. agencies, a senior U.S. official 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a close eye will be kept on the embassies, which were  
closed as a ``prudent measure'' after they were found to be under 
surveillance by suspicious individuals, said the official, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence had concluded earlier there were indications  
Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire suspected of heading a 
terrorist organization, was in the final stages of planning a 
terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The first anniversary of bombings Aug. 7 of the U.S. embassies  
in Kenya and Tanzania is approaching, and bin Laden is accused in a 
trial in New York of masterminding the attacks. There are 15 
defendants of whom nine are fugitives, including bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans in Nairobi.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. embassies worldwide were placed on a heightened state of  
alert last week due to increased security concerns. All six 
embassies that were closed had undergone security upgrades since 
last August's bombings, the State Department said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reveals Budget Surplus Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Announcing a surplus bonanza, President  
Clinton said Monday the government can drastically reduce the 
national debt while still buttressing Social Security and Medicare 
with federal surpluses that now appear $1.1 trillion bigger through 
2014 than they did five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed using virtually none of the newfound money for  
the bigger tax cuts Republicans covet, but he didn't rule it out 
when answering reporters' questions. That left GOP leaders reacting 
with cautious optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the president's comments today indicate a summer of  
cooperation,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
``We're interested in deeds not words,'' said Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus estimate suddenly enlivened a year in which  
political pressures from the 2000 elections had made agreement seem 
unlikely on such high-profile issues as Social Security, Medicare 
and tax cuts. It was still unclear whether it made an overall 
budget deal with Republicans any likelier. 
</P>
<P>
	The improved budget picture -- credited to strong economic  
performance -- let the White House project a non-Social Security 
surplus in fiscal 2000 of $5 billion, the first since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 15 years, Clinton projected overall surpluses of  
$5.9 trillion -- nearly $1.1 trillion more than he estimated in 
February. That included $715 billion more than the White House 
projected in February in non-Social Security surpluses, which both 
parties consider fair game for tax cuts or spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Social Security, the White House projected a $99  
billion surplus this year and a $143 billion surplus -- the biggest 
ever -- in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House released its numbers days before the  
Congressional Budget Office planned its own, similar update. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Clinton took the extra resources projected by his  
budget office and proposed using them for the same priorities he 
had in February for fiscal 2000 and beyond. Besides Social Security 
and Medicare, this included extra money for defense and domestic 
programs and for ``Universal Savings Accounts,'' or 
government-subsidized investment accounts for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a chance to do even more, to use the fruits of our  
prosperity today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow; indeed, 
for tomorrows well into the 21st century,'' Clinton said at the 
White House before heading to political fund-raisers in New York 
and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	But his aides reiterated that before using the surplus for  
anything else, Clinton believes the giant pension and 
health-insurance plans for the elderly and disabled must be shored 
up for the looming retirement of 76 million baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our view, first things first,'' said Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin. ``First deal with Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many congressional Democrats, eager to avoid handing Republicans  
a major accomplishment in time for the 2000 elections, said 
Clinton's new proposal did not indicate that the chances for a 
budget deal had increased. Their opinions might be crucial in 
determining whether the White House strikes an agreement with the 
GOP this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has put us on firm ground to oppose any attempt to squander  
the surplus on shortsighted tax breaks for the wealthy,'' said Rep. 
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not propose revamping Social Security benefits or  
the program's financing. But over 15 years, he proposed changes 
that he said would keep it solvent through 2053. 
</P>
<P>
	That is two years less than the plan he offered in February. But  
in exchange, he jettisoned his earlier proposal to use some Social 
Security money for other programs. That had worried Democrats eager 
to avoid being accused of spending the pension program's funds. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Clinton said he would use nearly $3.1 trillion in  
Social Security surpluses over 15 years to buy down the accumulated 
national debt, helping the pension program by strengthening the 
economy. He embraced a ``lock-box'' plan similar to one House 
Republicans have pushed that would make it harder for lawmakers to 
get at that money, leading some GOP lawmakers to claim a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan would eliminate all federal debt held by the public,  
aides said, which is more than half the $5.7 trillion total. The 
rest is debt the government owes itself, such as money it has 
already spent from Social Security trust funds that must be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	As the national debt is reduced, Clinton proposed crediting  
Social Security with $543 billion in interest savings beginning in 
2011. That in effect would put the money off-limits to Republicans 
eager to use it for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed using $794 billion over 15 years to strengthen  
Medicare -- $108 billion less than he planned in February. He would 
also reshape the program to keep it afloat for another 25 years and 
include optional prescription drug benefits in an overhaul he 
planned to unveil on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed spending $41 billion more over 15 years than  
previously proposed for defense and such domestic programs as 
veterans affairs, environmental protection, medical research and 
agriculture. And he offered a ``children and education trust 
fund,'' designed to ensure healthy financing for Head Start, school 
construction and other programs.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Goodwin Back on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers outfielder Tom Goodwin was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list again on Monday after 
aggravating a hip injury in Sunday's 5-2 loss to Seattle in the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin went on the 15-day DL on June 12, one day after  
suffering a small tear in his left hip flexor muscle while running 
the bases against Colorado. The Rangers activated him before 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Goodwin on the roster, the Rangers recalled  
outfielder Scarborough Green from Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time in less than a week that Green has been  
with the Rangers. He was called up on Wednesday to replace the 
injured Ruben Mateo. He appeared in two games, scoring a run 
without an at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	As a pinch-runner on Saturday, he scored from first on Roberto  
Kelly's bases-loaded double when Seattle catcher Tom Lampkin 
dropped the ball during a jarring collision at home. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in 63 games for Oklahoma this season, batting .224  
with one home run and 12 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Escapes in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Hundreds of officers searched Monday  
for a killer who escaped from what is supposed to be Texas' 
tightest prison and ran naked into a swampy area full of 
mosquitoes, snakes and poison ivy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Jones, 33, whose convictions include a murder in Dallas  
and attempted murder for shooting at a Dallas police officer, fled 
Sunday from the high security section of the prison system's 
Estelle Unit, about 12 miles northeast of Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison shares property with the Ellis Unit, where last  
Thanksgiving seven condemned killers broke out of death row. One of 
those escapees, Martin Gurule, was found a week later, dead in a 
creek, and an autopsy showed he had drowned. The other six 
surrendered after guards opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is much more dangerous,'' Texas Department of  
Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said of Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	While being escorted to a recreation area Sunday, Jones slipped  
one hand out of his handcuffs and threatened to kill a female guard 
with the restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-6, 180-pound Jones scaled a 25-foot chain-link fence  
to the roof of the yard, then fell to another fence that covers a 
walkway and jumped 8 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached a 12-foot fence equipped with sensing devices and  
climbed over it. The sensors alerted another guard, who fired at 
him with a tear gas shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones then climbed a 16-foot camera tower to jump over a second  
12-foot fence covered with four coils of razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, a guard who patrols the perimeter of the prison spotted  
him and fired twice with his .357-caliber Magnum pistol. Jones kept 
running toward a creek bottom and took off his clothes and shoes, 
apparently to foil tracking dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fatal flaw in this incident was the inmate being able to  
get out of that handcuff and we just need to figure out how that 
occurred,'' said Gary Johnson, the prison system's director. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials said Monday they assumed he was still  
unclothed. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sign of him Monday was the evident disturbance of  
poison ivy growing up a tree about three miles north of the Estelle 
Unit. Dogs led authorities to the spot and officials believe Jones 
spent the night in the tree, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime temperatures were in the 90s.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones had been serving a 20-year prison term since July 1987.  
While in prison, he was sentenced to an additional six years for 
assaulting a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, correction officers shot and killed a prisoner and  
wounded two others when they tried to escape while weeding cotton 
on a work farm in northeastern North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom OKs Olivetti Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Shareholders of Telecom Italia SpA on Monday  
approved a new board dominated by representatives of Olivetti SpA, 
which won its hostile takeover battle of Telecom last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's operation, the largest hostile takeover bid in  
Europe, garnered 52.1 percent of Telecom shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 13-member board consists of eight Olivetti candidates  
presented via Olivetti's takeover vehicle Tecnost SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight are Enrico Bondi, chief executive of energy and  
chemicals group Montedison SpA; Peter A. Cohen, an investment 
banker and former board member of Olivetti; Olivetti chief 
executive Roberto Colaninno; corporate lawyer Sergio Erede; Italian 
businessman and longtime Colaninno ally Emilio Gnutti; Olivetti 
chairman Antonio Tesone; Wang Global chief executive Joseph Tucci, 
and Rothschild Bank executive Gerard Worms. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the other five members of the board are economics  
professors nominated by the Italian Treasury, which, under 
arrangements for Telecom's privatization, holds a 3.46 percent 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno has said he will nominate himself as chairman and  
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some shareholders expressed hope that the new board will end the  
management turmoil and lack of strategy that has dogged Telecom 
since it was privatized in October 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Should Wait on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Republican  
lawmakers Monday to use projected budget surpluses to shore up the 
retirement system before they enacted tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Democratic fund-raising luncheon in suburban Westport,  
Conn., Clinton noted that his affluent audience would benefit from 
an across-the-board tax cut, but urged his listeners to think about 
the future of such government program as Medicare and Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of you would be better off, in the short run, being at a  
Republican fund-raiser,'' Clinton said, but added: ``There's 
something to be said about looking to the long run, as well as the 
short run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was the featured guest in a lunch for 50 people at the  
Westport home of Sandra Wagenfeld, a frequent contributor to 
Democratic causes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunch and a special matinee of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman  
Cometh'' at a Broadway theater helped raise more than $1 million 
for Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea had been  
expected to attend the performance with the president, but the two 
instead went house-hunting in the New York area as Mrs. Clinton 
edged ever closer to becoming a candidate for the Senate from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the performance, which drew some 1,000 Democratic  
contributors, Clinton entered from the rear of the stage to thank 
the cast, greeting Kevin Spacey, star of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' 
with a giant bearhug. He said the tale of besotten souls living on 
lies they tell to themselves gave him and the audience ``too much 
to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the Stonewall riots, a watershed event for the gay  
rights movement had occurred just blocks away 30 years ago, the 
president said he was proud that the Democrats have backed hate 
crimes legislation and worked for the rights of all minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged GOP lawmakers to address public concern over violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hoping that members of the other party will decide  
they really are the candidates of law and order and will join us 
... passing sensible restrictions to keep guns out of the wrong 
hands,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices rose today while the U.S.  
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 174.06 points,  
or 1 percent, to close at 17,610.58. On Friday, the average closed 
down 191.80 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar cost 121.28 yen late afternoon, down 0.24 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
121.43 yen Friday. During the day, it ranged from 121.05 yen to 
121.95 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, expectations that the Japanese economy  
might finally be turning around encouraged buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are selectively buying Japanese stocks on hopes for  
economic recovery,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at Chuo 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 8.05 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,417.46. The 
index closed down 1.72 points, or 0.12 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was about 336 million,  
down from 468 million Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
retreaters 684 to 474, while 159 issues remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Surging share prices helped push the yen higher, dealers said.  
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. investment banks seem to be very keen on buying Japanese  
stocks. To do that, they need to sell dollars for yen,'' said Shuji 
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But dollar-selling remained cautious amid lingering fears about  
possible dollar-supporting intervention by the Bank of Japan. An 
overly strong yen can hurt Japanese exporters by making their 
products more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are selling the dollar only bit by bit as they make sure  
that the BOJ will not step in,'' said Minoru Shiroiri, assistant 
manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players were also awaiting the outcome of the U.S.  
Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is widely expected to nudge up interest rates to  
keep potential inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy at bay. 
Higher interest rates make a nation's currency more attractive to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 126.43 yen, down  
from 127.09 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7850 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7750 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.12 yen from 100.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Sea Life Said Threatened by Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The deep is far from silent these days. And  
in some undersea places, its too downright noisy, an environmental 
group warns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Natural Resources Defense Council says underwater noise from  
supertankers and military sonar can scramble signals that sea 
creatures use to communicate, affecting migration routes and 
breeding patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing Russian roulette with our oceans,'' said Joel  
Reynolds, senior attorney with the council. ``We can't afford to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled to be released today, the study calls for a harder  
look at how man-made noise affects sea creatures. It also urges 
stiffer regulations to protect aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a serious problem. The problem is, we don't know how  
serious it is,'' said Roger Gentry, acoustics team coordinator for 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees most marine 
life in U.S. waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was ``a pretty fair summary'' of the issues that  
acoustics experts in government, the military, academia and the 
environmental movement struggle with, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean noise is similar to the visual affect that strip malls and  
utility lines have on dry land, according to Cornell University 
bioacoustics expert Christopher W. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just went out and listened in the Channel Islands,  
you'd be appalled,'' Clark said. ``Those places off San Francisco, 
off Los Angeles -- you're just in the middle of an acoustics traffic 
jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study says those three sites, as well as Monterey and San  
Diego bays, have abundant sea life -- and high levels of underwater 
noise. Environmentalists want special efforts to turn down the 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
	In dark sea waters, mammals such as whales and dolphins appear  
to use their hearing -- much as humans use sight -- to seek food, 
find mates, guard their young and avoid predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Man-made noise may harm those animals because sound travels  
faster through water than air. Whales sometimes abandon traditional 
breeding grounds and change direction during migration to avoid 
noise, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is too new to say definitively whether these behavioral  
changes do long-term damage to mammal populations, Clark and Gentry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	International shipping generates the most noise pollution, but  
faces few noise regulations, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies should have the authority to regulate the acoustic  
output of ships and other sources of noise, the NRDC says. Laws 
should take a cue from the Clean Air Act, setting targets of 
practicable emissions and holding polluters to them, the report 
recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls for setting aside marine reserves to protect  
animals from noise, additional research and international 
standards.

<HEADLINE>  Wimbledon Is Delayed by Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Wimbledon is being delayed by rain  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	When play starts, Centre Court will be a showcase of impassioned  
clashes today, starting with Britain's Tim Henman seeking revenge 
against American Jim Courier for a Davis Cup beating. 
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe caught the mood of that much anticipated match and  
fanned some flames by accusing Henman and his teammates of choking 
against Courier two months ago on an indoor court in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Henman said he ``desperately'' wants to beat Courier, and the  
American said he's eager to feed off the energy of a crowd that 
will be against him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier, who was hospitalized and given an intravenous drip  
after suffering dehydration in his five-setter last Friday, said 
he's completely recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier's emotional career revival, Boris Becker's emphatic  
return and Jelena Dokic's extraordinary rout of Martina Hingis in 
the first week of Wimbledon set up a Super Monday of matches 
kicking off week two. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova, the two most photographed  
and followed women in the tournament, will follow Courier-Henman 
onto Centre Court in a match spiced by some catty comments by each. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Anna that I like grass,'' Williams said after hearing  
that Kournikova disparaged her chances to win Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, the 31-year-old three-time champion back for his last  
hurrah, then takes on Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open 
champion, in a duel of classic serve-and-volleyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to play halfway,'' Becker said. ``It's all or  
nothing. That's the way I've been playing all my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other themes of the first week -- the record run of  
five qualifiers into the round of 16 -- will by played out in the 
Court One stadium, where former champion Andre Agassi starts off 
against the so-far unbreakable serves of Australian journeyman 
Wayne Arthurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthurs has faced only six break points against his serve in  
three matches, and brushed them all away. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time women's champ Steffi Graf follows against another  
qualifier, Kim Clijsters of Belgium, before an ace-a-thon between 
Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2, the dreaded ``Graveyard of Champions'' where Richard  
Krajicek was buried by qualifier Lorenzo Manta on Saturday, gets a 
shot at five-time and defending champ Pete Sampras when he meets 
Canada's Daniel Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2 also should be packed for the duel between Dokic and  
Mary Pierce, after an opening match pitting No. 3 Lindsay Davenport 
against Barbara Schett.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Slow To Embrace Palm PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- It's not hard to spot technophiles writing  
e-mail or making notes on a palm-sized PC in the capital, but many 
businesses are keeping the devices at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, probably 95 percent of these things were bought by  
individuals,'' Tim Bajarin, a California technology consultant, 
told the Austin American-Statesman. ``Most of this stuff comes into 
the corporation through the back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be about to change, in the view of analysts, who  
believe companies will become more comfortable buying so-called 
personal digital assistants, or PDAs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Austin area's biggest home builders, Clark Wilson  
Homes Inc., has invested about $10,000 to outfit most of its 
employees with Palm Pilots. Job superintendents schedule 
subcontractors, order supplies and track the progress of each house 
with the devices. Estimators and quality-assurance technicians use 
them too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a big investment, but it's paid off tremendously,''  
said Nedda Brown, the builder's vice president of operations. She 
said workers with the devices ``are much more efficient, and they 
make fewer mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting to see more companies looking at these devices  
more seriously, and they're testing these devices,'' said Diana 
Hwang of International Data Corp., which forecasts that the 
hand-held computer industry to grow by 35 percent in the next year. 
That is more than double the expected increase in personal-computer 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hwang predicted that about 9 million palm-sized devices will  
be shipped this year -- still a small amount when compared with the 
103 million conventional PCs she predicted will be sold in the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hwang said corporations are worried about palm devices'  
compatibility with existing software and compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
	To allay those fears, 91 manufacturers, software companies and  
service providers have formed the Wireless Application Protocol to 
develop a standard.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vehicle Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's vehicle exports fell 8.6 percent in May  
from a year earlier, dragged down by weak sales in Europe, Latin 
America and the Middle East. But exports to the United States rose 
19.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop to 308,661 vehicles was the fourth straight monthly  
decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's top three automakers; Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor  
Co. and Honda Motor Co. all suffered export declines for the month 
with Nissan posting the largest loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall decline, exports to the United States --  
Japanese carmakers' biggest market -- remained strong, jumping to 
108,598 vehicles in the ninth consecutive increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments to crisis-hit Asia rose for the second time in 19  
months as many of the economies appeared to be recovering. Exports 
to Asia rose 8.2 percent to 23,203 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	But exports to the Middle East and Latin America fell sharply  
because of economic problems in those regions, the association 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Middle Eastern countries plunged 33.2 percent to  
16,358 vehicles, reflecting sluggish demand in the wake of lower 
crude oil prices, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Latin America tumbled 54.8 percent to 17,913  
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese manufacturers also reduced exports to the European  
Union last month -- by 8.5 percent to 80,929 vehicles -- to stem 
growing inventories of cars in their second biggest market, the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May drop in exports followed an 11.1 percent year-to-year  
drop in April and a 1.9 percent fall in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 11 companies covered by the survey suffered export  
declines for May. Only Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of 
Subaru cars, posted an increase in exports, up 29.8 percent to 
16,075 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors Corp. suffered the biggest decline in exports  
for the month, a drop of 38.0 percent to 23,709 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top three makers, Toyota's exports fell 2.1 percent to  
113,407 vehicles, Nissan's exports sank 11.3 percent to 41,331, and 
exports for Honda dropped 8.4 percent to 36,956.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises 0.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose again in May  
but their spending climbed much faster, contributing to another 
all-time low in the nation's savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government  
benefits -- rose 0.4 percent last month, the Commerce Department 
said today. Spending, however, went up 0.6 percent in the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Because consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the  
nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income 
-- has set a string of record lows this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In May the savings rate fell to a minus 1.2 percent, even worse  
than the previous record of minus 1.0 percent in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	Torrid consumer spending propelled the nation's economic growth,  
which rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three 
months of this year. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, is at an 
record high -- despite the prospects that the Federal Reserve will 
begin to raise short-term interest rates at its meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.6 percent gain in spending in May followed gains of 0.5  
percent in April, 0.6 percent in March, 0.9 percent in February and 
0.5 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last at  
least three years such as washing machines and cars -- rose 2.2 in 
May. That followed two months of declines 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel, also  
increased 0.5 percent and spending on services rose 0.3 percent in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years  
and high demand for labor -- with labor shortages in some regions 
and industries, helping to boost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, wages rose 0.5 percent, following a 0.6 percent increase  
the previous month. However, wages for farm workers dropped 13.8 
percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that one of the major reasons why Americans  
have let their savings rate fall into negative territory is because 
the stock market is at record highs, boosting Americans' net worth 
and making them feel more comfortable about dipping into savings to 
fund their spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong consumer spending has been the major factor pushing  
up economic growth this year. With unemployment at the lowest level 
in three decades, the Fed has begun to worry that tight labor 
markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent speech, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave  
strong hints that the central bank would begin raising interest 
rates this Wednesday in an effort to slow the economy and keep 
inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Gore Friction Played Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House worked Monday to squelch the  
notion that President Clinton is fuming over Vice President Al 
Gore's remarks about his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't believe everything you read in the newspaper,'' White  
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, referring to reports that said 
Clinton was angry after Gore criticized Clinton's behavior in a 
June 16 speech announcing his candidacy for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton thought Gore delivered ``a great speech,''  
and was impressed with the vision the vice president articulated. 
He denied the speech had strained the Clinton-Gore friendship, 
saying Clinton has not displayed any hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you I talked to him half a dozen times, while we  
were in Europe, about the Gore announcement, the speech, the 
coverage, and he never expressed any anger to me,'' Lockhart said. 
``They enjoy a very strong relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, speaking Monday on condition of  
anonymity, said White House chief of staff John Podesta told 
Clinton aides in a senior staff meeting that the president supports 
Gore 100 percent -- and instructed them to ensure they're not 
suggesting anything to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	A second administration official said Podesta told staff to  
``keep your mouth shut'' if they've got a problem with Gore's 
campaign or an opinion about his relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the rumors of a strain between Clinton and Gore  
must be emanating from far outside either man's inner circle. ``If 
you read some of those stories very closely, you'll find they don't 
quote people from here in the White House,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Pole-Sitter Ray Wins IRL Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOUNTAIN, Colo. (AP) -- The last thing Greg Ray wanted to see was  
fast-closing Sam Schmidt in his rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray had averted a disaster when he accidentally shut off his  
engine while trying to reset the balky gauges on his dashboard. 
Then his car mishandled in the final laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray hung on, however, to win the Indy Racing League's Radisson  
200, edging Schmidt by just one car length Sunday for his first 
career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 32, of Plano, Texas, finished with an average speed of  
134.111 mph on Pikes Peak International Raceway's one-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray and Schmidt traded the lead throughout the race after  
Schmidt, who started fourth, made a strong inside move to take 
second place on the opening lap. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, they shared six lead changes. Ray led 109 laps and  
Schmidt 91, with Ray winning by .12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, Ray struggled to explain how he managed to hold  
off Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our radios were starting to fade a little bit at the end, and  
I didn't know how close Sam was,'' Ray said. ``The last few laps it 
was pretty clear because I could see that black-and-red car back 
there. I thought, `Oh, no.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was vibrating. We were starting to rattle pretty bad.  
Sam was coming. I was just driving it for all it was worth. But as 
Sam will tell you, catching somebody is one thing, passing is 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Hamilton finished third, followed by Eddie Cheever Jr. and  
Buddy Lazier. Robby Unser was sixth, and defending champion Kenny 
Brack was seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy I just can't stand it,'' Ray said. ``After I saw  
the checkered flag, I just wanted to stop and cry. This team has 
worked so hard. We just haven't had the finishes that we've wanted. 
Now we have a finish as good as the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole race I really didn't know how fast I was going. I  
really didn't have a dash. I reset it about four times, and one 
time, about halfway through the race, I actually turned the car off 
but quickly pushed the restart button. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a slinky out there. I would pull out to a lead and  
get held up in traffic and Sam would catch up. Then I would pull 
out to a lead and Sam would catch up and go ahead. It was a 
constant seesaw, a battle. That was fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, also seeking his first IRL win, passed Ray on the 25th  
lap and gradually increased his lead to nearly four seconds. Both 
pitted on a caution flag on lap 84, and Ray beat Schmidt out of the 
pits. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, 34, of Las Vegas, drew ahead again with an outside pass  
along the front stretch on lap 100, but Ray took advantage of 
Schmidt's sudden handling problems and reclaimed the lead on lap 
115. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Scott Harrington, hobbling on crutches because of a  
broken right leg suffered in practice two weeks ago, overtook 
Schmidt for second place on the 151st lap. 
</P>
<P>
	By lap 180, Ray had built a lead of six seconds over Schmidt,  
who had reclaimed second place. Harrington was another three 
seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the 184th lap, Harrington got high on the track and  
brushed the wall in Turn 1, bringing out a yellow. 
</P>
<P>
	The green flag flew again with 11 laps remaining, and Schmidt  
appeared to have the faster car after Ray radioed to his crew that 
his car was ``loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray maintained a lead of about one second until the final lap,  
when Schmidt drew up right behind Ray but was unable to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't have enough time,'' Schmidt said. ``I couldn't  
reel him in fast enough. Our car was really dialed. I didn't think 
I could get him off (Turns) 3 and 4, so I tried to put a rush on 
him going down the backstretch (of the last lap), but I just never 
got close enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyce Carlson and Billy Boat failed to complete a lap. Carlson  
got sideways in Turn 3 on the first lap and skidded into Boat's 
path. Both drivers hit the wall but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other caution flag came on lap 83 when Mark Dismore  
spun in the pits after losing his brakes, lightly tapping the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite finishing 12th, Scott Goodyear stayed atop the IRL  
season standings with 164 points. Jeff Ward, who finished ninth, 
remained runnerup with 149 points, and Ray moved to third with 131.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Rebuffs Qwest Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frontier Corp. has again rebuffed a takeover  
offer from Qwest, the upstart telecommunications company that is 
trying to build a global network for high-speed Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement late Monday may spur Qwest Communications  
International Inc. to take its $11.4 billion cash and stock bid 
directly to Frontier's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made offers earlier this month to acquire Frontier, a  
long-distance and local phone company, and U S West Inc., a 
Denver-based regional phone company. Qwest sweetened its proposals 
last week after its first bids were not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is trying to break up an agreement the two companies have  
made to be purchased by rival Global Crossing Ltd. Both Qwest and 
Global Crossing are building worldwide fiber-optic cable networks 
to carry radio, TV, e-mail and other data over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's board said it ``is continuing to evaluate the revised  
proposal by Qwest Communications to acquire Frontier'' but said it 
still plans to proceed with its merger with Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	If Frontier doesn't act soon, Qwest may try to go around the  
company's management by sending its buyout offer directly to 
shareholders, asking them to ``tender'' or offer their shares for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest sent letters Monday to about 20 of its largest investors  
to stress its determination to acquire U S West and Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As circumstances change, we may consider adopting different  
strategies to encourage U S West and Frontier, or their 
shareowners, to accept our offers, and we may set a deadline by 
which they must do so,'' wrote Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman 
and chief executive, in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Hayward, portfolio manager for the Invesco Utilities fund,  
who received a copy of the letter, said, ``I understand the 
strategy behind what they (Qwest) are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``hostile tenders are never as good as the  
acceptance of a friendly offer, so we just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, however, may reconsider its prospects. Frontier also said  
late Monday that its profits for the second quarter and the year 
would fall far short of Wall Street's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Frontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Denver-based Qwest did not immediately return a  
call for comment following the announcement from Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors will now shift their attention to U S West. The  
company's board of directors is scheduled to meet later this week 
to evaluate the new $34.7 billion stock offer from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has been facing political pressure from Colorado  
legislators to consider Qwest's offer because the combined 
companies would remain based in Denver. The union representing U S 
West's workers, however, is lobbying against Qwest's proposal out 
of fear of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has been putting on a full-court press to convince the  
boards of directors of both companies that its bids are superior to 
offers from Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing offered $10.9 billion in cash and stock for  
Frontier and about $31 billion in stock for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has 18,500 miles of cable in place. Global Crossing, based  
in Bermuda, is building an undersea network to link the continents. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire communications industry is being turned upside down  
by the Internet and its vast potential for transmission of 
information, electronic commerce and new forms of entertainment. 
Companies are trying to secure the technology and customers to 
compete in a new market. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest made its initial bids for U S West and Frontier on June

<HEADLINE> Routier Juror Says Conviction Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A juror who voted with 11 others to send a mother  
to death row for killing her 5-year-old son now says he may have 
been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the trial was over and I started thinking about  
different things and what I'd read, I just came to this conclusion, 
and I couldn't make it go away,'' juror Charlie Samford told 
Monday's edition of The Dallas Morning News. ``The more I think 
about it, the more I think that we were wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case made headlines when it happened. Darlie Routier  
described what sounded like a wild man breaking into her Rowlett 
home and stabbing herself and her two sons, 5-year-old Damon and 
6-year-old Devon, in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said she slashed her own throat to make the  
slayings look like the work of an intruder. They say she killed her 
children because of money problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband said he was upstairs at the time and did not see or  
hear an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Routier did not stand trial in Devon's death.  
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Greg Davis said Samford, 55, and the 11 other  
jurors were correct and that a murder conviction was just. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been now three years since the death of these two boys,  
and no one, including the Routier family, has ever brought me any 
credible evidence to suggest that anyone other than Darlie Routier 
killed these two boys,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samford said he initially voted ``not guilty'' and regrets that  
he allowed other jurors to change his mind. He said he voted for 
the death sentence because of the child's age and the crime's 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Routier's supporters contend that one or more intruders  
killed the boys and left Mrs. Routier with near-fatal injuries -- 
proof that the attack was a robbery or rape attempt gone awry.

<HEADLINE>  Quayle Speaks on Guns, Parenting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle proposed a ``one strike and you're  
out'' policy Monday for students caught carrying guns to 
classrooms, saying the government should crack down on school 
children -- not guns -- to curb school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president is seeking the Republican presidential  
nomination on a conservative tough-on-crime, family values agenda. 
In a speech to a conservative Washington think tank, Quayle urged 
parents to spend more time with their children and said the 
government is making it too difficult for mothers to stay home 
instead of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being there for the children means spending time with the  
family -- and I'm not talking about quality time, I'm speaking of 
quantity time,'' Quayle said. ``It is impossible for invisible 
parents to instill values in their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle lags far behind GOP front-runner George W. Bush in  
polling and is having serious trouble raising money. He practically 
begged for donations Monday, telling the crowd and a potential 
television audience that they could use a credit card to contribute 
$21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Join the 21st Century Club. That's only $21!'' he said,  
sounding like a zealous ad pitchman on TV. ``Just give us $21 and 
get put on a fancy mailing list. You'll be supporting us and then 
we'll be well on our way to victory!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief question-and-answer session, the generally  
conservative audience asked Quayle three times about guns and 
school shootings. At least one of the questioners appeared to take 
a pro-gun control stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will a few more laws, a few more regulations deal with gun  
violence appropriately?'' Quayle said in response. ``I don't think 
that's sufficient at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that current laws need to be better enforced, the former  
vice president said prosecutions were pressed in just 13 of the 
6,000 cases nationwide in which students were caught carrying a gun 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a situation where a student takes a gun to school  
and they should be slapped on the wrist and go home and come back 
in a couple of weeks,'' Quayle said. ``This is not a situation 
where we're going to say to that student, `Three strikes and you're 
out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying to that student, `You bring a gun to school and  
you're out of here. You're history. You're gone. Don't come back. 
One strike and you're out,''' Quayle said. ``I guarantee if you had 
better enforcement of the laws you have on the books, we could see 
gun violence decline in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a questioner implied that the NRA has undue influence in  
Congress, Quayle said, ``I don't see too many congressmen and women 
or senators wearing a banner around saying, `I'm a proud member of 
the NRA' or `I totally support and am in the pocket of the NRA.' 
The NRA has been demonized,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange marked the most passionate moment of Quayle's  
appearance, including the address itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In his prepared remarks, Quayle said government needs to lower  
taxes, ease regulations and urge companies to provide more flexible 
working conditions so more fathers and mothers can afford to stay 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government has distorted their choice by making the option  
more economically difficult,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised mothers who stay home to raise children, saying their  
decision ``deserves to be respected and honored, not mocked or 
belittled.'' He told employers not to hold it against stay-at-home 
mothers when they return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said his wife, Marilyn, has been both a working- and  
stay-at-home mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every family can and will decide what's best. All we should  
ask is that parents be allowed to follow their hearts,'' he said. 
``The problem is that millions of mothers and fathers don't feel 
like they have a choice at all.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Nixes Mission To Land on Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A $240 million NASA mission to land a probe  
on the surface of a comet for the first time and drill beneath its 
surface was scrapped Monday, a victim of the space agency's tight 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was axed to make more money available for other  
projects' cost overruns -- a Hubble Space Telescope repair mission 
and future Mars exploration, said Edward Weiler, head of NASA's 
space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is solve our own problems,'' said  
Weiler, who added the canceled project was still in its early 
development phase. ``Nobody is coming to our rescue from somewhere 
else in the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space Technology 4/Champollion's demise means it may be more  
than a decade before a robotic explorer lands on one of the huge 
icy snowballs that circle the sun -- and sometimes collide with 
Earth with devastating impact, said project manager Brian Muirhead 
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know very little about how comets are formed and what their  
constituency is,'' he said. ``If you're serious about planetary 
protection, you have to know more about comets than we do today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which had been scheduled to launch in 2003 for  
late-2005 arrival, also would have tested 10 new technologies, 
ranging from futuristic tools for landing on a comet to ion 
propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA already has sent a probe, named Stardust, to sweep through  
the tail of a comet and collect material for return to Earth. The 
European Space Agency also plans a mission that will attempt to 
land on a comet in 2012.

<HEADLINE> Monument's Road To 'Pure Radiance' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slim as a pencil ready to scribble on the  
clouds, the Washington Monument seems as inevitable and serenely 
irreplaceable as George Washington himself. 
</P>
<P>
	This Independence Day the monument is caged, wrapped in aluminum  
scaffolding that when illuminated at night makes the white-marble 
shaft look a bit like a stack of glowing crystal cubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Designed by architect Michael Graves for the workers patching  
and cleaning the monument's 36,000 cut-stone blocks, the scaffold 
will be dismantled early in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument's image as an American landmark needed no repair,  
even though every eye is free to see it just a little bit 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	To some it's one giant exclamation point that from bottom to top  
measures 555 feet, 5 and 1-8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is George Washington's finger pointing to the sky,'' Cecil  
Spring Rice, an early 20th century British ambassador, remarked. 
</P>
<P>
	Claes Oldenberg, a contemporary sculptor known for outsized  
renditions of everyday objects, saw it whimsically as a huge pair 
of folded scissors, the curved handles buried deep underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Washington National Monument stands not only as one of the  
most stupendous works of man, but also as one of the most beautiful 
of all human creations,'' landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted 
Jr. said in 1901. ``Indeed, it is at once so great and so simple 
that it seems to be almost a work of nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are stories under the marble skin.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans first started talking about a national monument to  
George Washington before the Revolutionary War had ended. In the 
way of such things, it took Congress until 1833 to actually 
authorize that one be built, at private expense. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, the nation's first president had been dead 34  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington National Monument Society selected architect  
Robert Mills to draw the plans. Peppered with suggestions, he 
designed a 500-foot shaft with a classic colonnade at its base. 
There was space for a parade of marble patriots and a tomb for 
Washington himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone was laid with cheerful optimism on July 4, 1848,  
a hot and dusty day of oratory and brass bands with former first 
lady Dolley Madison present as a link to the past. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1854 all work came to a sudden halt. Masked raiders  
surprised the night watchman to steal and perhaps sink in the 
Potomac River a memorial stone contributed to the project by the 
pope. That act -- widely blamed on an anti-foreign, anti-immigrant, 
anti-Catholic political faction -- was the first link in a chain of 
events that dried up contributions. The unfinished monument 
languished for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outbreak of the Civil War, the monument was a 156-foot  
stub of stone rising wearily across a weedy lot and a smelly canal 
from the White House, an uninspiring view from the president's 
office windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Work resumed when the centennial year of 1876 revived interest  
in the nation's founders. The 22-year hiatus left a permanent 
transition mark where the old and new marbles join. The 
ground-level temple and tomb were discarded for an unadorned stone 
sentinel with the proportions of an Egyptian obelisk. 
</P>
<P>
	And soon there were new stories to tell.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington newspapers reported that one morning in the late  
1870s, when the shaft had reached the 250-foot level, workmen found 
a lost and unhappy cat at the very top. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornered, the cat left the only way it could, leaping off the  
top of the shaft. It landed, stunned but alive -- only to be set 
upon and fatally mauled by a startled guard dog, completely 
unaccustomed to cats plunging on him from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	On another morning the weight hanging by a string inside the  
monument -- a device to check that the structure was rising straight 
and true -- was found far out of place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consternation among the workmen followed and the monument was  
thought to be doomed,'' the Washington Evening Star reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors found the tower perfectly straight. But a closer look  
revealed ``that during the night spiders had built their web from 
the line of the box casing, and thus drawn the line out of 
perpendicular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Evening Star estimated on dedication day, Feb. 21, 1885,  
there were enough marble chips from the capstone of the monument 
being sold as souvenirs around the city to build another monument 
from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Souvenir merchants hawked ladies' pins made of aluminum, then a  
new rust-and stain resistant metal from which the nine-inch 
``pyramidion'' cap of the monument had been fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The dedication keynote speaker, Sen. John Sherman of Ohio,  
observed that the monument rose that day higher ``than any work of 
human creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was replaced as the world's tallest structure by the  
Eiffel Tower just four years later, the Washington Monument remains 
the tallest all-masonry structure in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In this century its grounds have become the city's rallying  
point. Suffragists gathered there, Martin Luther King Jr. faced it 
square-on to proclaim his dream of racial equality, and mass 
demonstrations of the war in Vietnam swirled around its base. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shaft is a thing of the spirit, said President Hoover in  
1932, the 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is about it a mantle of pure radiance.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Williams on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates put Mike Williams on  
the disabled list on Monday and chose two pitchers to replace him 
as the team's closer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of Williams, who has converted 13 of 15 save  
chances, manager Gene Lamont said he'll use left-hander Jason 
Christiansen and right-hander Brad Clontz to save games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the situation is going to bother those two  
guys,'' Lamont said. ``Some guys are a little different when they 
have to pitch the ninth inning, but I don't see that with those 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen has three saves this season and completed Sunday's  
6-5 win at Milwaukee by throwing a third strike past Jeff Cirillo 
with a runner on. 
</P>
<P>
	Christiansen will get the majority of the save chances, with  
Clontz likely to be used if the opponent has several right-handed 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really been a save guy,'' Christiansen said. ``This  
is something new to me. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to 
get in there in pressure situations. When you're the setup guy, you 
never get on ESPN or get your name in the paper unless you do 
something bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clontz has six saves in his major league career, all with  
Atlanta from 1995-97. Since then, Clontz has been with four 
organizations. He signed a minor league contract with the Pirates 
in April after the Boston Red Sox released him at the end of spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Clontz had surgery last September to remove bone spurs and chips  
from an elbow. He said his repaired elbow lets him throw a better 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm throwing it more now than I have since my days in  
college,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has biceps tendinitis. Trainer Kent Biggerstaff said he  
is hopeful a week's rest will help the condition and that Williams 
will be able to return when his 15-day term in the disabled list 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates recalled right-hander Marc Wilkins from Triple-A  
Nashville. Wilkins, who was with the Pirates earlier this season, 
was sent to Nashville on June 10. In eight games with Nashville, he 
was 1-1 with three saves and a 0.79 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's throwing well, he's a guy who could get a chance in  
some save situations,'' Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins has three major league saves.

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Landmark Smokers' Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Six jurors began deciding on Monday whether the  
nation's biggest tobacco companies are responsible for injuries 
that hundreds of thousands of sick Florida smokers blame on their 
cigarette habit. 
</P>
<P>
	The first class-action lawsuit by smokers to reach trial went to  
the jury after eight months of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury must decide if cigarettes cause 32 diseases and medical  
conditions and if cigarettes are addicting, defective or 
unreasonably dangerous. They also must decide if manufacturers 
intended to mislead smokers or keep health information from them. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent most of Monday in deliberations, which were to resume  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the jury determines compensatory or punitive damages are in  
order, the amount will be determined during another phase of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven alternate jurors seemed surprised to learn that while they  
will not deliberate in this first phase, they are alternates and on 
standby for the next phase, should it be necessary. One juror 
gasped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgive us for, uh, a little white lie in not telling you  
about that. I hope you understand that,'' said Circuit Judge Robert 
Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed against Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds  
Tobacco Co., the Tobacco Institute, and other cigarette makers and 
industry groups in 1994 on behalf of an estimated 500,000 sick 
Florida smokers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers, who are seeking at least $200 billion in damages,  
are represented by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, a husband-and-wife 
legal team won a $349 million settlement for flight attendants in a 
secondhand-smoke case against the same defendants in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenblatts argued that cigarette manufacturers misled  
smokers in what Stanley Rosenblatt called ``one of the great cons 
of the 20th century'' -- working to keep smokers hooked and 
uncertain about the deadliness of the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Former surgeons general, cancer researchers, erstwhile tobacco  
company scientists and health activists testified in support of the 
sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contended that people who start to smoke are well

<HEADLINE> Digital Music Standards Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A coalition of major record labels and  
electronics manufacturers announced new specifications for digital 
music players on Monday that they claim will eventually prevent 
people from illegally downloading copyrighted music over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On a yet-to-be determined date, new music released by the major  
record producers will be digitally encrypted to prevent piracy, the 
Secure Digital Music Initiative said. At that point, only devices 
that can recognize the coding will play the music. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond Multimedia, which makes the popular and controversial  
Rio portable digital music player, said it will comply with the new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies have been striving to combat widespread music  
piracy as increasingly available technology makes it easy to spread 
high-quality digital music files across the Internet. Rio players 
in particular have served as a focal point for the debate because 
they don't require copyright protection to play music in the MP3 
compression format. 
</P>
<P>
	New devices, available as early as Christmas, would initially  
support all current digital music formats, including MP3. After the 
new digital standard is implemented, consumers would only be able 
to play songs on the machines that recognized the digital 
watermark. 
</P>
<P>
	Future versions of Rio players will be completely  
SDMI-compliant, said Lorraine Comstock, of Diamond's RioPort 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	``SDMI will enable the future of music and today's announcement  
signals to consumers that this future is coming quickly. This 
future holds the promise that consumers will have access to vast 
amounts of exciting new content with a new level of portability,'' 
SDMI director Leonardo Chiariglione said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry members adopted the design specifications at a  
conference in Los Angeles earlier this month. They are under 
technical review and are to be ratified and made public by July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the security features, however cumbersome, were  
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the traditional music industry to back this, there  
has obviously going to have to be some fairly rigorous copyright 
protection,'' said Clay Ryder, an analyst for Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	He suspects computer-savvy hackers will try to find a way around  
the security features, but the chore will prove labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's 100 percent crack-proof, but you would go through a  
hell of a lot of effort to descramble something,'' Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SDMI members include each of the big five record labels --  
BMG Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- all looking to 
capitalize on the growing digital music marketplace while 
protecting artist and label copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America lost a suit  
earlier this month to halt sales of the Rio -- a portable machine 
that carries about an hour's worth of CD-quality MP3 music on a 
computer chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Comstock thinks the design specifications will help make popular  
music available to online consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the consumers the SDMI specification is a good thing  
because today you cannot buy music online from well known 
artists,'' Comstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the music available for sale on the Internet  
consists of lesser-known artists.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Release Left-Hander Watson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Mariners released left-hander Allen Watson on  
Monday, just 10 days after acquiring him from the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, 28, was 0-1 with a 12.00 ERA in three appearances with  
the Mariners, allowing five homers. He previously pitched for 
Anaheim, San Francisco and St. Louis and has a 47-5 career record 
with a 5.02 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson arrived in Seattle on June 18 after being acquired with  
cash for right-hander Mac Suzuki and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle recalled left-hander Jordan Zimmerman from Triple-A  
Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman, 24, began the season at Double-A New Haven, where he  
was 1-3 in 12 relief appearances with a 1.61 ERA. He was promoted 
to Seattle on May 16 and appeared in 10 games with no decisions.

<HEADLINE> Automaking Era Ends in Flint, Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Darlene Morris skipped the recent ``Family  
Day'' festival at the Buick City factory, not quite up to the lure 
of gleaming white tents with children's games, ice cream and free 
coffee mugs. 
</P>
<P>
	She has built Buicks for 23 years, but her job will end when the  
plant closes next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buick City is a building, but it just contains everything I've  
known for all these years,'' she said. ``The last few days have 
been -- well, it's too quiet. Everybody is just kind of closed up. 
It's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 95 years of making Buicks in the city where General Motors  
Corp. was born, the automaker is shutting the sprawling plant and 
ending 1,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Buick City workers will retire or eventually be  
offered jobs at other factories, receiving ``protected status'' 
paychecks while they wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the plant's closing signals the end of an era for a place  
that has defined the city's identity for nearly a century -- and 
more uncertainty for an already wobbly economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not a lot of jobs around here that pay $17 an hour,  
or $20 an hour, like GM does,'' said Raymond Faris, a city 
merchant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's roots in the city 57 miles north of Detroit date  
to 1903, when a Flint wagon company bought David Dunbar Buick's 
struggling engine shop. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1908, Buick was the top seller, and owner William C. Durant  
merged Buick and several other automakers to form GM. 
</P>
<P>
	The company employed more than 75,000 in the Flint area as  
recently as 1978. The area was hit hard by thousands of GM layoffs 
in the 1980s, a period documented by Flint native Michael Moore in 
his film ``Roger &AMP; Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period, GM spent about $300 million to modernize  
Buick City. Since then, sales of the large sedans that Buick 
specializes in have fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the company said it would close Buick City's car  
assembly lines and transfer production to two other Michigan 
plants. GM will keep Buick City's engine and parts factories 
running, as well as a nearby truck plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Just under 30,000 GM employees will remain in Flint after the  
assembly plant closes sometime next week. The automaker plans to 
spend $1.5 billion in the next several years to update and build 
factories in the area, which will add several hundred jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buick City plant manager Amy D. Farmer agrees with GM's  
reasoning in closing the plant, but sees how people can be 
sentimental about a factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been here over 90 years,'' she said. ``When you have this  
giant sitting in the middle of the city, it's understandable how 
you'd get attached to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 42, and other workers say GM's explanations for the  
closing don't make sense, especially after years of promoting the 
idea that improved quality could save the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Buick City was rated one of GM's most efficient plants in a  
recent report, beating the two plants that will get its production. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been preaching to us that our job security is to build  
a good car with high quality, and we're still closing,'' said 
worker Don Wilcox, 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wilcox thinks the change could help the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``There'll be fewer jobs within GM itself, and a lot of those  
jobs will take more education,'' Wilcox said. ``In Flint, it might 
help diversify the workforce as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the town itself, the future is far from certain for Darlene  
Morris. She's willing to transfer to plants in Saginaw or Pontiac. 
In the meantime, she'll wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the worst things -- not knowing, not being able  
to make a plan,'' Morris said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Peter's DWI Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A drunken-driving charge against Carolina  
Panthers defensive end Jason Peter was dismissed Monday because of 
botched paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mecklenburg County judge agreed with the defense that the case  
was tainted because a magistrate's order signed after the arrest 
was improperly dated. Peter was arrested March 14 but the order was 
dated March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tommy Simpson said the state would appeal to Superior  
Court, but defense lawyer George Laughrun said it was unlikely the 
case would even make it to trial on that level. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter, who had pleaded guilty to speeding, declined to speak  
with reporters after the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	A trooper testified that Peter was unsteady on his feet, had red  
eyes, slurred speech and a strong odor of alcohol when he was 
pulled over. A breath test indicated he was legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter, the Panthers' top 1998 draft choice, finished with just  
one sack in the first year of a four-year contract that could be 
worth up to $7.5 million with incentives.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Bush Solidifying Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has expanded his lead in the  
race for the GOP nomination since hitting the campaign trail in 
June, and most of the gain has come at the expense of Elizabeth 
Dole, says a poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor had the support of six out of 10 Republicans,  
59 percent, while Dole, the former Red Cross president, dropped 
from 24 percent in May to 8 percent in the latest CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who had been the only other GOP candidate in double  
digits, is now in a four-way tie with Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle and 
John McCain for second place nationally, according to the poll. 
Just over six of 10 Republicans said it would be better if a clear 
front-runner emerged for the GOP, while just over a third said it 
would be better to have a number of strong candidates competing 
over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Ed Goeas said recently that GOP voters  
have been lining up behind Bush because he seems to be a potential 
winner and they intensely want to end the leadership of President 
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore remained the Democratic front-runner with a 3-1 lead over  
Bill Bradley in the poll taken June 25-27. The sampling error for 
the overall sample of 1,016 was plus or minus 3 percentage points, 
but the error margin for subgroups of Democrats and Republicans was 
plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush holds a 15-point lead over Gore in a head-to-head matchup,  
with 56 percent behind Bush and 41 percent behind Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also led in a Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa  
caucus voters. He was the favorite of 40 percent, while Dole had 
the backing of 13 percent and Forbes had support from 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 397 registered Iowa voters who said they will  
definitely or probably attend their state's caucus in early 
February next year had an error margin of plus or minus 5 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Has Hard Work Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Now it gets tough for Jana Novotna.  
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion reached the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 7-5  
victory Monday over France's Nathalie Dechy. 
</P>
<P>
	She next faces Lindsay Davenport in the final eight. The  
third-seeded American has won all five of their previous matches -- 
though this will be their first on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport downed No. 14 Barbara Schett of Austria 7-6 (9-7), 6-1  
in their fourth-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	In another key women's match, unseeded 16-year-old Australian  
Jelena Dokic ousted No. 9 Mary Pierce 6-4, 6-3. And now she's 
talking about actually winning Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting to the quarterfinals, I think it's anyone's  
tournament,'' said the Australian, who faces either Americans Lisa 
Raymond or Alexandra Stevenson. ``Beating Martina ... and beating 
Mary today just proved I can beat those top players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Davenport looked ill at ease and trailed 3-5 before  
rain fell and gave her a chance to regroup. When play resumed, she 
held off six set points before claiming the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain delay helped me immensely,'' Davenport said. ``I was  
really nervous, and the rain delay came and I was able to relax a 
bit. I could really think how I wanted to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a very good record against her, I like playing her, and  
it will be interesting how it is on the grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna also looked uncomfortable in the tricky conditions with  
swirling wind and showers -- which eventually ended play for the day 
-- posing a danger to Novotna's high ball toss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult match,'' she said. ``It was difficult  
conditions, and she's a very smart player. She's playing very 
aggressive tennis and I wasn't very comfortable on the court today 
for some reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struggling from the beginning until the end.''  
</P>
<P>
	Novotna knows she has a tough task ahead of her if she wants to  
reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being on grass will obviously play to my advantage, but  
nevertheless she's a very difficult opponent,'' Novotna said. ``She 
has lots of weapons and a very powerful serve, and it's going to be 
very difficult to play against her.''

<HEADLINE> HBO Won't Renew Wimbledon Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The strawberries and cream have been great, but  
25 years at Wimbledon was enough for HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network will not renew its contract with the  
grass-court classic after a quarter-century of coverage, and there 
will be no shortage of bidders to pick up tennis' most prestigious 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner sports president Seth Abraham said HBO's decision  
had nothing to do with ratings or money. The network paid $50,000 a 
year when it started with Wimbledon in 1975, while the current 
five-year deal averaged about $8 million a year. Ratings have been 
steady if unspectacular. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I look ahead, I felt the need to refresh our schedule,''  
Abraham said Monday from his London hotel room. ``If we had tried 
to renew Wimbledon, then we wouldn't have been able to try other 
new things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham would not elaborate on his plans to acquire replacement  
programming, but did say that it would not involve another tennis 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is still the elite tennis tournament in the world  
and one of the top 10 sporting events,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ratings had fallen to a 1.6 in 1997, HBO posted a 1.9  
last year after making a decision to devote more of its coverage to 
women players. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said he expects this year's ratings to be about the  
same, even with Andre Agassi's success. 
</P>
<P>
	But ratings aren't as important for HBO as with other networks  
because HBO does not have advertising -- and advertising is driven 
by ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said he made the decision not to renew about two weeks  
before the tournament began and flew to England to tell club 
chairman John Curry and chief executive officer Christopher 
Gorringe that HBO would be going in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about money and it never even got to that stage,''  
Abraham said. ``Time Warner doesn't scare easily money-wise. That 
wasn't really a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bidding to replace HBO should be extremely competitive.  
Rupert Murdoch and Fox outbid HBO by about $35 million five years 
ago, but the All England Club decided to stick with HBO instead of 
the larger check. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made our interest known to the appropriate people,''  
said Fox spokesman Vince Wladika, adding that interest would be 
purely for cable telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's ESPN and ABC are also interested, as is Turner and USA  
Network, which televises the early rounds of the U.S. Open and 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, which broadcasts the U.S. Open, declined to comment if they  
were interested in Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's contract also expires at the end of this year's  
tournament, but the network will likely seek a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``HBO's been a wonderful partner for both NBC and the All  
England Club for 25 years,'' said NBC spokesman Ed Markey. ``We 
look forward to developing the same kind of relationship with HBO's 
successor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO was responsible for airing weekday tennis on network  
television for the first time in the United States. When it began 
in 1975, it had 125,000 subscribers. That number has increased to 
25 million.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Player Gets Probation for Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The former Kentucky football player who  
pleaded guilty in a drunken car crash that killed a teammate and 
another man will be released from jail next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Watts was granted probation from a 10-year sentence Monday  
and will be on probation five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Daniel Venters of Pulaski Circuit Court ordered that Watts  
be released July 19. During his probation he must attend an alcohol 
abuse program and do 50 hours a year of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulaski prosecutor Eddy Montgomery said the early release  
devalues the seriousness of Watts' crime. Venters declined to 
comment on his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a pretty bare-bones order, but I don't really want  
to elaborate any further,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts is jailed at the Pulaski County Detention Center in  
Somerset, where he has been since pleading guilty to two counts of 
reckless homicide on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted through Pulaski Jailer Darrell Presley, Watts declined  
to comment on being granted ``shock probation,'' an early release 
available to nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred shortly after dawn last Nov. 15, when Watts'  
pickup truck went out of control and overturned as he tried to pass 
another driver north of Somerset. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were Kentucky teammate Arthur Steinmetz, a 19-year-old  
defensive end who was sitting out the season after transferring 
from Michigan State, and 21-year-old Scott Brock, a longtime friend 
of Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had been out all night celebrating the Wildcats'  
Senior Day victory over Vanderbilt the day before. They were on 
their way to a farm near Somerset to go deer hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed Watts' blood-alcohol content to be 1 1/2 times the  
legal limit, and that Brock and Steinmetz also were drunk at the 
time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts never disputed his guilt and chose to go to jail  
immediately after pleading guilty March 31. On April 20, Venters 
sentenced him to the maximum 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks leading to his plea and sentencing, Watts gave  
several anti-drunken driving speeches at schools in Kentucky and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	When he sentenced Watts, Venters questioned the value of those  
speeches. His probation order bars Watts from counting speaking 
engagements as community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The community service can include ``work for a public service or  
charitable organization ... or public agencies,'' Venters said.

<HEADLINE> Man Denies Killing Yosemite Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRACY, Calif. (AP) -- A convicted felon who is being questioned  
in the February slayings of the three Yosemite sightseers denies he 
killed any of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't kill anybody,'' Eugene ``Rufus'' Dykes told The  
Associated Press in his first jailhouse interview. ``If I was 
involved, it wasn't through my knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, speaking from behind a glass booth at Deuel Vocational  
Institution, would not elaborate on what that role was or how he 
could not have known that he was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Modesto man, who is serving a year on an unrelated parole  
violation, also refused to discuss any information he has provided 
to the FBI task force trying to unravel the murders of Carole Sund, 
her daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Nick Rossi said Sunday he would not discuss statements  
made by any individuals interviewed or questioned by the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, whose Eureka family has made millions in real estate,  
was taking her 15-year-old daughter and 16-year-old Argentine 
friend on a trip through the Sierra foothills to Yosemite National 
Park when they were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were last seen alive Feb. 15 at a lodge on the western  
fringe of the park. The bodies of Mrs. Sund, 42, and Ms. Pelosso 
were found about a month later and far to the north, burnt beyond 
recognition in the trunk of their torched rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli's body was found a week later and miles away, hidden in a  
thicket off a lightly traveled mountain highway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the case but investigators have said  
they are confident that most of those responsible for the crime are 
already behind bars on unrelated charges. They will not identify 
suspects or say how many there are. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement sources have said that Dykes, his half brother,  
Michael ``Mick'' Larwick, and other members of a looseknit band of 
methamphetamine-using ex-cons are the focus of the FBI task force 
and federal grand jury proceedings in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes and Larwick were arrested a week apart in March after  
standoffs with Modesto police. Dykes later was charged with being a 
convicted felon in possession of drugs and a gun. Larwick has 
pleaded innocent to shooting and injuring a cop during his standoff 
and is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Larwick, 42, has declared his innocence in the Yosemite case.  
Dykes has admitted to being involved, law enforcement sources have 
said -- although none have disclosed exactly what his role was. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, 32, who has a record of meth possession, unlawful sex and  
weapons convictions, currently is being held in solitary 
confinement at Deuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a mustard-colored jumpsuit and his head shaved, he was  
escorted in leg shackles to a bank of glass booths at the back of 
the main visiting room for Sunday's interview with the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes initially was nervous about talking with a reporter  
because, he said, he had no prior experience with the media. But 
eventually he loosened up and grew quite animated as the hour-long 
interview proceeded, even though he deflected many questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't talk about it,'' he said repeatedly, occasionally  
dropping the booth's phone to shrug or wave his tattooed forearms, 
and frequently finishing off his answers with: ``Ya know what I 
mean?''

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two weeks before he takes over as chief executive  
of United Airlines and UAL Corp., James E. Goodwin has assembled 
his own team of top executives culled from the company's existing 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of Jim Goodwin's effort to build his own team,''  
said company spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch. All the moves are effective 
July 13, the same day Goodwin, a 32-year employee of the carrier, 
becomes chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rono J. Dutta was elevated from senior vice president for  
planning to president. Dutta joined United in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew P. Studdert, currently senior vice president of fleet  
operations, will be executive vice president and chief operating 
officer, and Douglas A. Hacker, now senior vice president and chief 
financial officer, will become an executive vice president. He will 
continue as CFO. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, when UAL announced Goodwin would succeed Gerald  
Greenwald, analysts viewed the move as a way to maintain stability 
as the company tries to satisfy both Wall Street and the carrier's 
unions. This round of promotions suggests that goal remains the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new management team, Dutta, 47, will oversee United's  
North American and International divisions, and lead the airline's 
network of alliances and code-share agreements. He will also 
oversee business activities, including marketing, on-board services 
and cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Studdert, 42, will be responsible for United's operating  
performance. He will oversee operations of its fleet, including 
safety, maintenance and flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacker, 43, will be responsible for the airline's profitability.  
Besides his previous duties as the company's chief financial 
officer, Hacker will oversee scheduling, pricing and yield 
management, and also the strategic direction for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL also named new vice presidents for finance, marketing and  
resource planning. 
</P>
<P>
	United is also creating two new positions: vice president for  
customer satisfaction and vice president for operational services. 
United has not yet said who will fill those positions.

<HEADLINE> Richard Petty Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Stock car racing great Richard Petty  
checked out of a hospital Monday and returned home after being 
treated for bleeding ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old Petty was admitted to Moses Cone Hospital last  
week after he lost 40 percent of his blood, according to son Kyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty returned home to Randleman and wants to get back to work  
at Petty Enterprises, where he is a car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty said his father lost about 40 percent of his stomach  
to ulcers in 1978, but this illness came on suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently he ate something or he didn't eat something and one  
of the ulcers ruptured,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Petty is the most successful Winston Cub driver with 200  
victories and seven championships. He retired from competition in 
1992.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush is off to California this  
week in a quest for cash that, according to officials in his 
Republican presidential campaign, has already brought in more than 
$23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has maintained a strong fund-raising  
operation since his first campaign money report showed $7.6 million 
collected in 3 1/2 weeks in March, racking up millions more with 
out-of-state trips that began June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Monday night the campaign has collected more than $11  
million in Texas alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's phenomenal,'' Bush told about 400 people at a reception  
honoring donors and fund-raisers. ``It's an indication that my base 
of support, the great state of Texas, is strong, it's vibrant and 
it sends a large message to the rest of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He collected about $5 million during a six-state swing last week  
alone, said campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes. Seven California 
fund-raising events are planned this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's introducing himself to the country,'' Ms. Hughes said.  
``He's talking about the principles by which he makes decisions and 
the priorities he would have as president. At the same time, he's 
asking people to help fund his campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign plans to announce an estimate of its April-June  
fund-raising totals Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he is considering bypassing federal campaign funds  
for next year's Republican primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of his advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
have estimated he would need to raise about $50 million to forgo 
the 2000 federal match, which they estimate could total $13 million 
to $16 million. Bypassing that money would allow Bush to spend more 
in key early states than is allowed under the limits placed on 
those who take federal dollars.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole urged  
congressional leaders on Monday to expand legislation to ban all 
access to pornographic Web sites in federally funded libraries and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has passed a bill that reduces federal money to  
libraries that don't install software that weeds out pornography in 
computers used by children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, Mrs. Dole argued that the measure also should 
apply to school and library computers used by everyone, not just 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``To protect our families and to protect the taxpayers, we  
shouldn't let pornography gain access to federally funded libraries 
through an electronic back door,'' Mrs. Dole wrote. ``This 
legislation fails to protect the taxpayers and it doesn't represent 
our shared national values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said in her letter that tax dollars should not be used  
for access to Internet pornography. ``This pornography loophole 
must be closed.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich wants to debate fellow GOP  
presidential hopeful Steve Forbes -- and only Forbes -- on Social 
Security next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Forbes on Monday, the Ohio Republican applauded  
Forbes for addressing the issue of Social Security substantively. 
Kasich also said other candidates must begin addressing issues to 
make the 2000 election ``a contest of ideas, not sound bites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich said Forbes is the only other candidate to have  
specifically addressed Social Security plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am directing this invitation to you alone because we have  
both released detailed Social Security reform plans,'' Kasich 
wrote. ``Both of us are prepared to have a meaningful discussion on 
the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich said he does not want to debate the other GOP candidates  
because they would not be able to discuss the issue substantively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not interested in debating someone whose primary  
contribution would be rhetoric and sound bites,'' Kasich wrote. 
``The American people deserve better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Forbes spokesman said the candidate would welcome a debate --  
but only in a forum that involves all the candidates, especially 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to anything that would encourage all the  
candidates to participate,'' said Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign 
manager. ``The key is to have all the candidates, particularly Gov. 
Bush, involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich wants to debate Forbes either in Iowa or New Hampshire in  
July.

	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. John Engler on Monday signed  
legislation moving Michigan's Republican primary to Feb. 22, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law is intended to give Michigan a larger role in the  
selection of the Republican presidential nominee. The Republicans' 
original primary date was March 21, well after traditional Iowa 
caucuses and New Hampshire primary in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the first big state on the GOP's primary schedule in 2000,  
Michigan is now an even more significant player in the presidential 
selection process,'' Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Republican Chairwoman Betsy DeVos said the new law  
places Michigan's primary after primaries in New Hampshire and 
South Carolina and a caucus in Iowa. But the national primary 
schedule isn't complete yet, so other states could crowd in around 
Michigan or leap ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Democrats aren't affected by the new law, since they  
choose delegates to their national convention in a closed caucus. 
Last week, they lost a bid to move up the state Democratic 
presidential caucus to Feb. 12, 2000.

<HEADLINE> 7-0 Road Trip Puts Reds on Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds had the Houston Astros right  
where they wanted them this weekend: in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``For any team to come in here and dominate us like they did for  
four games, to me, would have been unthinkable four days ago,'' 
Houston interim manager Matt Galante said. ``But they're playing 
well right now, as well as any team we've seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially on the road. The Reds capped a 7-0 road trip with a  
5-2 victory over Houston on Sunday to move into first place in the 
NL Central. Before coming to Houston, the Reds swept NL 
West-leading Arizona in a three-game series in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they can be any hotter,'' Houston second baseman  
Craig Biggio said. ``If you sat back and watched this series, it 
seemed like they had 11 or 12 players out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In four games, the Reds outscored Houston 26-10. Houston hit  
.151 and led just once in four games. The two-time defending 
division champion Astros have lost nine of their last 13 and four 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it wasn't going to be a cakewalk,'' Galante said.  
``But the cream always rises to the top. Cleveland lost four 
straight. Chicago lost five straight. The Mets lost eight in a row 
and they're a good club. I'm just saying it's a long season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was certainly a long weekend for the Astros, who have seen  
six games shaved off their lead in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to panic here,'' said Jose Lima (11-4) who  
took the loss Sunday. ``First place right now means nothing. 
There's still a lot of baseball left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Tucker homered to help lead the Reds, who swept a  
four-game series at the Astrodome for the first time since June 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clicking on all cylinders right now,'' said Cincinnati's  
Sean Casey, who went 13-for-27 in the seven games. ``Our starting 
pitching has been good, we've been playing great defense and 
everybody's hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweeping a series like this is a big boost for the team.  
You're just hoping to come in and get a few wins and the sweep is a 
big confidence booster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds lead the majors with a 26-10 road record, but to stay  
in first they will need to improve on a home mark of 15-21. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be there,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said.  
``We're all delighted. But I'm looking down the road and I'd like 
to be there in October when we come back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three of the four games of this series, the Astros had a  
total of eight hits in 85 at-bats and were outscored 16-3. The 
other game was a 10-7 slugfest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their pitching just dominated us,'' Galante said. ``It's tough  
to believe that could happen to a club that hits as well as we do. 
We're not hitting on all cylinders right now, but we've got 90

	Tucker had two hits Sunday and went 5-for-10 with seven runs  
scored and six RBIs in the series. The Reds have won nine of their 
last 11.

going to win many games,'' Lima said. ``I'm not blaming the guys.

holding us down. You can't blame it all on them. I didn't pitch 
well enough to win today.''

<HEADLINE> Short-Term T-Bill Interest Rates Up / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.50 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.750 percent, up from 4.610 percent last 
week. An additional $7.50 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.960 percent, up from 4.850 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 8, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.790 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since Aug. 3, 1998, when the rate was 5.030. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.889 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,879.90 and 5.173 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,749.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.14 
percent last week from 5.03 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 130.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-company stocks rose sharply today as  
investors became more optimistic that the Federal Reserve will 
raise interest rates by only a small amount at its meeting this 
week. Gains in the technology-dominated Nasdaq market were held 
back by falling Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 130.76 at 10,683.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 14.29 at 1,329.60, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 10.97 at 2,563.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume remained light at 418.63 million shares, but was up from  
Friday's session, which had the lowest volume of the year. Many 
traders are unwilling to make big commitments in advance of the 
Fed's Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to increase short-term interest rates  
by a quarter percentage point to slow the economy and prevent 
inflation from accelerating. Analysts say that rate hike is already 
reflected in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a relief-type situation,'' said John Lynch, director  
of investment strategy at IJO Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. ``A 
quarter point increase is not something that will grind the economy 
to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further illustrating the strength of the U.S. economy, the  
Commerce Department today reported that consumer spending rose 0.6 
percent in May, outpacing personal income, which rose 0.4 percent. 
The continued rapid rise in spending, which boosts corporate 
profits, also drives inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are already looking past the expected quarter-point  
interest rate hike to gauge whether the Fed will make a series of 
increases or just one, Lynch said. ``I don't think a series of rate 
hikes is necessary, as the global economy still has a way to go 
till it hits recovery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in interest rates in the bond market lent support to  
stocks. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.09 percent 
from 6.15 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow lost 303 points, or 2.7 percent, amid fears  
that the Fed would raise interest rates by a larger amount. 
</P>
<P>
	But the blue chip index was led higher today by the financial  
sector, which is most vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates. 
J.P. Morgan was up 3 7/8 to 132 7/16, and American Express rose 3 
9/16 to 126. Cyclical stocks, or economically sensitive companies, 
also rose, with Dupont up 1 3/4 to 68 1/16 and Caterpillar rising 1 
15/16 to 60 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were generally down, with Amazon.com falling 4  
3/4 to 105 7/16, America Online slipping 2 1/8 to 100 11/16 and 
Lycos dropping 1 15/16 to 89 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 6.50 at 629.84 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.47 to 775.49.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Fathered Baby To Kill It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ind. (AP) -- A man who allegedly sought revenge against  
his wife by plotting to father their child and then kill the baby 
was ordered held without bond today on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald L. Shanabarger, wearing a brown flak jacket over a  
zebra-stripe jail jumpsuit, gave brief answers at today's hearing 
to questions about whether he could afford an attorney. The judge 
ordered that a public defender be appointed and set a trial date 
for Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger told police he planned the crime to exact punishment  
on his wife, Amy, who had refused to cut short a vacation to 
comfort him after his father passed away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shanabarger said he planned to make Amy feel the way he did  
when his father died,'' prosecutors said in an affidavit filed to 
support a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, just hours after the funeral of his 7-month-old  
son, Tyler, Shanabarger confessed to his wife that he smothered 
their son in his crib the night before Father's Day, investigators 
said. A coroner had ruled the infant died from Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Shanabarger, 30, allegedly told police he  
suffocated Tyler with plastic wrap and that he dreamed up the crime 
after his father's death in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit said Shanabarger's plan included marrying Amy and  
getting her pregnant. He then ``allowed time for her to bond with 
the child, and then took his life,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Shanabarger begged officers to shoot him after  
he confessed last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most bizarre case that I've ever had any dealings  
with and probably the most bizarre motive I've ever heard of,'' 
Johnson County prosecutor Lance Hamner said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Shanabarger said that on the evening  
of June 19, he wrapped plastic wrap around his son's face, then 
left the boy's nursery to get something to eat and brush his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes later, he returned, removed the plastic and  
placed Tyler face down in the crib before he went to bed, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Shanabarger, 29, had been working that night as a grocery  
store cashier. When she came home, she went straight to bed, 
assuming that Tyler was asleep. She found the boy's body the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger, who worked at a tire retreading center, told police  
he confessed because he was haunted by the image of his son's face 
-- flat and purplish from rigor mortis, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's confessed at least three times, Police Chief  
Harry Furrer said. Each time, police said, the story has been the 
same -- that he hatched his plan because he was enraged by his 
then-girlfriend's refusal to cut short a cruise and return home 
after his father's death in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shanabargers were married the following May.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Randy Maynard, a volunteer police chaplain, accompanied  
officers to the couple's home in this town south of Indianapolis on 
Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	While most parents of children who die from SIDS console each  
other, Shanabarger was cold, distant and offered no comfort to his 
sobbing wife, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Mrs. Shanabarger's parents arrived later, Shanabarger  
gave his father-in-law a Father's Day gift -- a gift-wrapped 
commemorative knife -- Maynard said. Shanabarger then passed the 
knife around, showing it to the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really struck me as odd,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maynard said he's still troubled by the image of Tyler's tiny  
face. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a beautiful boy,'' he said. ``Even in death, he was  
just the most beautiful boy. I'm still getting goose bumps thinking 
about this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanabarger's father-in-law, Robert Parsons, wears a tiny gold  
cherub pin to remind him of his grandson, who was born Thanksgiving 
Day. He won't discuss his son-in-law, but says his daughter, an 
only child, is devastated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people to just to talk about a 6- or 7-month-old  
infant -- a nameless, faceless infant. He was a little boy, he 
played, he laughed, he loved. We loved him dearly and that's what 
this is all about,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want vengeance, but we do want justice.''

<HEADLINE> Saturn Unveils First Midsize Sedan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- You can't call Saturn the small-car company of  
General Motors Corp. anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Television ads for the first midsize Saturn began airing Monday  
as part of Saturn's biggest ad campaign yet. Saturn also announced 
prices for the new L-series sedan and station wagon, which will 
range from $15,450 to $21,800. 
</P>
<P>
	The L-series (L stands for ``larger'') is the first new model  
line for Saturn since it began selling its S-series subcompacts in 
1990 and are scheduled to go on sale in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will be targeted over the coming month with ads  
intended to pique interest in the new model. Each ``teaser'' ad 
inserts the sedan's name, ``LS,'' among familiar clothing sizes: 
``S-M-LS-XL.'' The TV, print and billboard versions do not show the 
car, but promise ``the next big thing from Saturn'' is coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty- and 90-second TV ads showing the car will debut in August  
and will keep with the down-home feeling of Saturn's previous 
campaigns, which featured Saturn's modern Spring Hill, Tenn., plant 
as a harmonious place where happy workers built solid cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker has high hopes for the L-series,  
which will be assembled in Wilmington, Del. GM officials expect the 
model line to double Saturn's annual sales to around 500,000 within 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	To do so, the L-series will have to take on the American-built  
Toyota Camry and Honda Accord -- the nation's best-selling cars -- in 
the industry's largest and most competitive segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn is betting the L-series' competitive prices and Saturn's  
reputation for providing a friendly, no-hassle buying experience 
will help it do that. Toyota and Honda also no longer make wagon 
versions of the Camry and Accord, a fact that Saturn plans to 
exploit as wagons show signs of staging a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has more midsize cars on the U.S. market than any other  
automaker, but Saturn officials have said they do not expect the 
L-series to pull customers from other GM models. Saturn maintains 
that a majority of its customers traditionally have bought Saturns 
after owning imports and other non-GM cars. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts are skeptical. Alan Baum of IRN Inc. predicted  
the LS will take away sales from similarly sized GM cars, such as 
the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an admirable product, reasonably priced, but not a  
breakthrough by any means,'' Baum said. ``We forecast it at a 
little under 200,000 cars a year at full production -- a significant 
number, but it will be at the expense of some Grand Ams and 
Malibus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	L-series prices will start at $15,450 for the base LS sedan with  
a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, manual transmission and air 
conditioning. The LS2 sedan, equipped with a 3-liter V6 engine, 
automatic transmission and several other features not standard on 
the lower-priced versions, will cost $20,575. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagons include the LW1 with a four-cylinder engine and automatic  
for $19,275 and the LW2, with the V6, for $21,800. All prices 
include the $440 destination charge. Saturn does not negotiate 
prices, though they can vary from dealer to dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn dealers have long wanted a midsize model to accompany the  
S-series line of subcompacts, especially in the past two years as 
sales of small cars have slumped. Through May, Saturn's sales were 
down 2 percent from the same period of 1998 in an otherwise robust 
market for new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's board last month also approved preliminary plans to produce  
a compact sport utility vehicle for Saturn at Spring Hill. It is 
expected to arrive in showrooms by 2001.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A national police plane on a drug  
eradication mission crashed Monday in a remote southern region 
where leftist rebels are active, killing the pilot, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-65 TurboThrush singe-engine prop plane crashed near the  
town of La Vega while spraying poppy crops, the raw material of 
heroin, said regional police commander, Col. Hipolito Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had not yet determined the cause of the crash and  
rebel gunfire was not ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels levy taxes on the drug crop cultivation and  
production, using proceeds to fund their insurgency. Colombia is 
the source of some 80 percent of the processed cocaine that reaches 
the United States.

	The Ecuadorean Banos 2000 Foundation launched a reforestation  
campaign in April offering poor farmers near the town of Rio Verde,

<HEADLINE> Government Ships Salmon Downstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASCADE LOCKS, Ore. (AP) -- Gray clouds hug the Cascade Mountains  
along the Columbia River as a barge called the Chinook chugs into 
the Bonneville Dam lock with its cargo -- 200,000 live salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two decades, the federal government has been  
shipping young fish downstream past eight federal dams, hoping the 
fish will swim back upstream on their own to spawn. So far the fish 
are losing the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 1 percent of the salmon on this barge were expected  
to make it back to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen types of salmon in the Columbia Basin have been put on  
the threatened or endangered species list since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' salmon barging program is  
either a vital crutch for the fish or a sure path to their greater 
doom, depending on one's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barging just doesn't work,'' said Justin Hayes of the  
environmental group American Rivers. ``As long as they keep 
flushing money and fish into the barge system, they're going to 
fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Lovelin of the Columbia River Alliance, an industry  
group, said barging has ``kept the salmon on life support. ... We'd 
define it as the best that the corps has going right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the deck of the Chinook, there is no political debate, just a  
stiff wind from the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruthanne Watkinson is all business. Her crewmates sometimes call  
her ``the fish lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly two straight months, it is her job to ride the barge  
up and down the Columbia, making sure that young salmon captured 
behind the dams are loaded safely aboard, and then safely let loose 
at the end of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
	During the night, she emerges every two hours from a makeshift  
trailer on the Chinook's deck where she sleeps and makes sure the 
fish are OK in their six 150,000-gallon tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer I've been in this boat, I'm wondering if there is a  
glamorous part of this job,'' said Watkinson, a 22-year-old 
wildlife management graduate from New York state. Still, she feels 
the job is important, saying, ``I'm their lifeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An hour downstream from the Bonneville lock, the crew opens  
portals in the bottom of the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	With a giant whooshing sound, the 4-inch to 6-inch baby salmon  
are flushed into the river, where they begin their journey out to 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps will spend about $3.4 million this year to ship more  
than 20 million salmon down the river. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish barging helps ensure the both the fish and the dams  
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The dams can still provide flood control, irrigation and  
especially hydropower and the fish bypass them en route to the sea. 
Electricity from the dams powers huge companies like Boeing and 
Intel and helps keep residents' power bills among the cheapest in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Barging program backers point to studies showing that two of  
every three adult salmon that survive the inland migration through 
the eight dams were barged fish. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists cite another study showing that just a  
quarter of 1 percent of barged fish make it back upstream to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	That means that of the 20 million salmon the corps will ship  
downstream this year, only 50,000 will return to spawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep going at this rate, the fish will go extinct,''  
said Jim Baker of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the healthiest salmon runs have only a 3 percent to 7  
percent return rate for spawning salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is heating up.  
</P>
<P>
	The corps this fall will complete a draft of a study examining  
whether to remove a portion of four of the eight dams -- the ones on 
the Snake River. The move, intensely sought by environmentalists, 
would boost salmon survival, but would render the dams useless. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is also looking at other options to help the fish,  
including a continuation or an increase in barging. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress will ultimately decide. In the near term, lawmakers  
show no desire to cut back or cancel the barging program.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Question Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The details of the plan remain under wraps,  
but lawmakers of both parties already are questioning whether 
President Clinton was overreaching with a Medicare rescue plan that 
includes broad new prescription drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton will detail his proposal to save Medicare  
from bankruptcy through a combination of better management, more 
competition and dipping into the federal budget surplus. He was 
proposing today that $794 billion from higher-than-expected 
surpluses -- $108 billion more than he proposed in February, when he 
submitted his budget -- be invested to strengthen Medicare over the 
next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of Clinton's Medicare overhaul will be a new  
program giving all 39 million beneficiaries access to prescription 
drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 15 million in the program for the elderly and  
disabled have no drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, head of the White House National Economic  
Council, said the surplus would be used to ``make sure that 
Medicare is safe and strong and solvent the next 25 years.'' The 
president ``is going to show a bit of political guts in coming 
forward with such a detailed plan,'' he said Sunday on CNN's ``Late 
Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawmakers argued that while the working poor do need  
help with prescription drugs, extending that benefit to all 
Medicare recipients would threaten the 34-year-old program's 
financial future. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said about two-thirds of those on  
Medicare do have prescription drug coverage, either through the 
Medicaid program for the poor or through private ``Medigap'' 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's don't make a problem where one doesn't exist, and  
providing that benefit is prohibitively expensive,'' Gramm said on 
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans generally favor a plan floated earlier this year  
that would offer government-subsidized drug benefits only for those 
living near the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling contended the new benefit would cost the taxpayers  
little because of planned savings in other Medicare programs, and 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the 
administration had ``no intention of rolling out a benefit that's 
going to spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shalala said the new program would be voluntary and people will  
share the costs. ``This will not be as generous as people think and 
that people are talking about,'' she said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues that many Medigap prescription drug  
policies, which average about $90 a month and have large 
deductibles, are too expensive for Americans with modest incomes. 
Shalala said half of rural Americans lack drug coverage, and many 
are skimping on drugs to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about just adding some new, lush benefit,'' she  
said. ``This is critical to health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., whose state's senior population  
strongly supports cheaper drug prices, told CBS that universal 
coverage was feasible if real steps are taken to make Medicare more 
efficient and cut fraud and waste, which he said still accounts for 
about 10 percent of Medicare spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the way to save  
Medicare from insolvency in the next decade ``is not to load it up 
with another big costly benefit that nobody pays for even though 
everybody wants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do it step by step,'' he said on ``Fox News  
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the prescription drug  
benefit is a candidate for that ``one last national achievement'' 
that Clinton wants before leaving office, but that the plan for 
universal coverage ``suffers an extensive reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, on CNN, predicted that in the end prescription drug  
benefits will be extended to only those 15 million elderly not now 
covered and that Medicare reform will be linked to the Republicans' 
top priority, a package of tax cuts.

<HEADLINE>  Wimbledon Is Delayed by Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Wimbledon is being delayed by rain  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	When play starts, Centre Court will be a showcase of impassioned  
clashes today, starting with Britain's Tim Henman seeking revenge 
against American Jim Courier for a Davis Cup beating. 
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe caught the mood of that much anticipated match and  
fanned some flames by accusing Henman and his teammates of choking 
against Courier two months ago on an indoor court in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Henman said he ``desperately'' wants to beat Courier, and the  
American said he's eager to feed off the energy of a crowd that 
will be against him from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier, who was hospitalized and given an intravenous drip  
after suffering dehydration in his five-setter last Friday, said 
he's completely recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier's emotional career revival, Boris Becker's emphatic  
return and Jelena Dokic's extraordinary rout of Martina Hingis in 
the first week of Wimbledon set up a Super Monday of matches 
kicking off week two. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams and Anna Kournikova, the two most photographed  
and followed women in the tournament, will follow Courier-Henman 
onto Centre Court in a match spiced by some catty comments by each. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Anna that I like grass,'' Williams said after hearing  
that Kournikova disparaged her chances to win Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker, the 31-year-old three-time champion back for his last  
hurrah, then takes on Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open 
champion, in a duel of classic serve-and-volleyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to play halfway,'' Becker said. ``It's all or  
nothing. That's the way I've been playing all my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other themes of the first week -- the record run of  
five qualifiers into the round of 16 -- will by played out in the 
Court One stadium, where former champion Andre Agassi starts off 
against the so-far unbreakable serves of Australian journeyman 
Wayne Arthurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthurs has faced only six break points against his serve in  
three matches, and brushed them all away. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time women's champ Steffi Graf follows against another  
qualifier, Kim Clijsters of Belgium, before an ace-a-thon between 
Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2, the dreaded ``Graveyard of Champions'' where Richard  
Krajicek was buried by qualifier Lorenzo Manta on Saturday, gets a 
shot at five-time and defending champ Pete Sampras when he meets 
Canada's Daniel Nestor. 
</P>
<P>
	Court 2 also should be packed for the duel between Dokic and  
Mary Pierce, after an opening match pitting No. 3 Lindsay Davenport 
against Barbara Schett.

<HEADLINE> Telekom Raises $9.6B in Offering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- More than 250 million new shares of  
Deutsche Telekom AG started trading Monday, raising about $9.6 
billion for the German telecommunication company's international 
acquisition plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The new shares, offered at Friday's closing of price of $38 a  
share, opened up 1.3 percent Monday amid heavy trading in the first 
pan-European stock offering. Telekom said there was twice as much 
demand for shares than it was offering, partly from European retail 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a step made possible by the introduction of the single  
European currency this year, retail investors in the 11 countries 
using the euro were offered identical discounts and bonus shares in 
the early subscription period, reflecting Telekom's desire to 
expand beyond its German base. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the orders came from Germany, the rest from  
the 10 other euro bloc countries, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, seeking to become a major global telecommunications  
company, made its first major cross-border bid this year by 
attempting a friendly merger with Telecom Italia SpA, Italy's 
former telephone monopoly. But it lost to Olivetti SpA's hostile 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Undeterred, Telekom chairman Ron Sommer repeated Sunday that the  
new cash will be used for possible acquisitions and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Joachim Kroeske said the group will  
announce a deal at the end of the summer similar to this year's 
takeover of Max.mobil, Austria's second-largest mobile phone 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Deutsche Telekom increased its stake in Max.mobil  
to 81 percent from 25 percent for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the government was not selling any of the shares it  
still holds in the former telephone monopoly, the new stock issue 
effectively decreases its stake from 72 percent to about 67 
percent, a Telekom spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 250 million shares offered to retail and  
institutional investors, another 5.9 million shares were offered to 
Telekom employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking consortium led by global coordinators Deutsche Bank,  
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, and Goldman Sachs also has an option to 
sell 30 million additional shares, held in reserve in the event of 
oversubscription. The consortium was to decide whether to release 
those shares in about four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Glenn Robinson Arrested at Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Milwaukee Bucks forward Glenn Robinson  
was arrested early Monday outside a nightclub and charged with 
disorderly intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, the Bucks' leading scorer last season, was arrested  
about 2:15 a.m. after he refused to leave Club Chaos, police said. 
He apparently had been denied entrance because he wasn't dressed 
properly, then began shouting at the doormen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers tried to calm the 6-foot-7 player and asked him to  
leave the area eight times, the police report said. Instead, 
Robinson became ``aggressive'' and appeared ``on the verge of 
physical violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson showed signs he had been drinking, including slurred  
speech, bloodshot eyes and the smell of alcohol on his breath, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was taken to the Miami-Dade County Jail, where he was  
released Monday afternoon after posting $500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected by Milwaukee as the first pick of the 1994 NBA draft,  
Robinson averaged 18.4 points last season as the Bucks made the 
playoffs for the first time since 1991. The Bucks were eliminated 
in the first round of the playoffs by Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Robinson was cited for disorderly conduct  
stemming from an argument outside a Milwaukee nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Flees Texas Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convicted murderer was on the loose  
today after slipping out of handcuffs, eluding prison guards' 
gunfire and scaling two 12-foot-high fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Jones, 33, fled into swampland Sunday, shedding his  
prison clothes to throw off search dogs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The area where he fled is very difficult terrain,'' said Texas  
Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. ``It's a 
swampy area, and that might be working to his advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Jones escaped while being escorted from a  
recreational area inside the prison, tucked in a forest 12 miles 
northeast of Huntsville. More than 200 law enforcement personnel 
were helping with the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, from Dallas, was serving a 26-year term for murder,  
attempted murder and assaulting a prison guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Estelle Unit from which he fled is within view of the Ellis  
Unit, the scene of a November escape attempt by seven condemned 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	All were captured immediately except Martin Gurule, who fled  
over a pair of fences and was the subject of an intense hunt by 
hundreds of officers. Gurule was found dead a week later in a 
nearby creek where authorities determined he drowned shortly after 
the break.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Philly Mob Figure Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The reputed head of Philadelphia's organized  
crime family was arrested today for alleged conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph ``Skinny Joey'' Merlino, 37, was arrested around 7 a.m.  
at his summer home in Margate, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials said he was charged with conspiring with other mob  
members to purchase and distribute cocaine in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate complaint, Ralph Natale, who is believed to have  
handed over control of the mob to Merlino last year, was charged 
with directing a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute 
methamphetamine in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Natale, 68, is currently serving time in federal prison in Ohio  
for a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven other people were arrested in connection with the drug  
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Conforti, the special agent in charge of the Philadelphia  
FBI office, called the arrests ``a serious blow to the Philadelphia 
mob.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Merlino could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Priest Slay Suspect Appears in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- A 32-year-old drifter has admitted he  
killed a Catholic priest with a candlestick after he refused to let 
him sleep in a church, according to an arrest affidavit released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ouellette, who has a history of mental problems,  
appeared in court on Monday and disrupted the proceedings with a 
verbal outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not guilty,'' Ouellette screamed when Superior Court  
Judge Angela Robinson advised him of his rights. She ordered him 
held on $1 million bond on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouellette told investigators he asked the Rev. Robert Lysz on  
Thursday evening for permission to sleep in the Church of St. 
Matthew and was told to go to a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ouellette told them he hid in some bushes and  
then followed the pastor into the church several hours later. 
Ouellette said a struggle ensued and he hit the priest over the 
head with a heavy candlestick ``three or four times,'' police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouellette told police he then donned some priestly garments,  
went into the rectory and went to sleep, according to the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The priest's body was found in the church sanctuary Friday  
morning when worshippers arrived for an early morning service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouellette's father says his son often claimed he was damned and  
behaved erratically when he wasn't taking medication prescribed for 
manic-depression.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 102.59  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today as investors,  
regaining their optimism about interest rates, decided that the 
Federal Reserve will implement only a small increase when it meets 
this week. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 102.59 at 
10,655.15. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq 
composite index was up 31.72 at 2,584.37, boosted by a late 
recovery in some Internet stocks. The Fed is widely expected to 
increase short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 
slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating. Analysts 
say that increase is already reflected in stock prices.

	U.S. Savings Rate at All-Time Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's savings rate hit another all-time  
low in May as Americans' spending rose faster than their income. 
Economists said the figures give the Fed more ammunition to justify 
an expected interest rate increase this week. Consumer spending, 
which has repeatedly outpaced incomes this year, rose 0.6 percent 
in May, the Commerce Department said today. Americans' personal 
income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, 
went up 0.4 percent last month. In May, the savings rate fell to a 
minus 1.2 percent, even worse than the previous record of minus 1.0 
percent in March and April. The nation's economy grew at a brisk 
annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three months of this year -- 
powered by strong consumer spending. Consumer confidence, 
meanwhile, is at record highs.

Stearns still faces related criminal investigations by Manhattan 
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and federal prosecutors. SEC

industry made a defective product and conspired to deceive the

contends smokers should have known the risks of smoking and are 
responsible for their own decision to light up. Tobacco officials

	Hackers Attack Army's Internet Site  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers defaced the Army's main Web  
site in the latest digital attack on a federal system. Pentagon 
workers noticed it early today and repaired it. Maj. Jim Stueve 
said administrators believe hackers altered the www.army.mil site 
between 8 p.m. yesterday and 5 a.m. today, but no internal systems 
were affected. ``There were no security breaches,'' he said. The 
altered site said the attack was designed ``to settle rumors''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Quarters Pit Strong Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When FIFA organized the Women's World Cup, it couldn't have set  
up better matchups than what's in store for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	How about Russia vs. China? Norway against Sweden? The United  
States and Germany? Historically strong rivals, although they have 
little history in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the best of the second-round games could be Nigeria vs.  
Brazil, featuring two of the most creative offenses in women's 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the style of Brazil, and I'm going to present a very  
good strategy to counter,'' coach Ismaila Mabo said. ``We shall do 
our best to win the match against Brazil Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal matchups:  
</P>
<P>
                    *San Jose, Calif. (Wednesday)    	
</P>
<P>
                          *China vs. Russia    	
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese have two victories over the United States this year.  
They were formidable with a 7-0 rout of Ghana in the opening round. 
Rarely were they tested, although their opener with Sweden was 
spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	China might be the most balanced team, and it has an outstanding  
goalkeeper in Gao Hong. The Chinese have not finished below second 
in an important international event since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a relative newcomer in the women's game, advanced from  
the weakest group. The Russians showed firepower in beating Canada 
4-1 and Japan 5-0. They lost 2-1 to Norway, the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Norway vs. Sweden    	
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes usually play Norway close, but lose. The Norwegians  
are more physical and experienced, which often is the difference 
between the Scandinavian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway scored 13 goals and yielded two in the first round. It  
hit stride after the close but convincing victory against Russia. 
Captain Linda Medalen broke her nose against Japan and her status 
is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes don't have much offense and will probably lay back  
and hope for a break. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Landover, Md. (Thursday)    	
</P>
<P>
                      *United States vs. Germany    	
</P>
<P>
	The Germans, who finished second to Norway in 1995, play a  
physical and almost mechanical game. They don't have a lot of 
flair, but they don't usually need it. 
</P>
<P>
	That could bother the Americans, who prefer a more freewheeling  
opponent. The Germans' ruggedness hurt them in the final seconds 
against Brazil, sending them into this matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched film of the Germans many times and have found  
things they do that we have put into our game,'' U.S. coach Tony 
DiCicco said. ``They are a very formidable opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Americans. If they can handle the rough stuff, they  
have more options on attack. But the United States needs a quicker 
start than it had in any of the three first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Brazil vs. Nigeria    	
</P>
<P>
	Did someone say 8-7 in extra time? The outcome could come down  
to the last possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians have a vastly superior defense and a flair for  
just about everything, including last-second goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil could be bothered by Nigeria's fouling, especially if  
scoring leader Sissi is targeted. If the officiating tight, that 
could be the key.

<HEADLINE> Inkster Took 16 Years To Get Slam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Winning the career Grand Slam turned out  
to be a marathon for Juli Inkster. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight players who have won the four major championships  
of their era, no one took as long as Inkster -- 16 years from the 
time she won the Dinah Shore as a rookie to her victory in the LPGA 
Championship as a 39-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
	But, oh, what a kick.  
</P>
<P>
	In a span of 21 days, Inkster separated herself from the pack  
and took her place in history by winning the U.S. Open and the LPGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Her finish at DuPont Country Club on Sunday was just as swift.  
</P>
<P>
	In a span of three holes, she shot out of a three-way tie for  
the lead with a staggering display of shotmaking and putting, an 
eagle-birdie-birdie finish to win by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comprehend this,'' she said after her 6-under 65. ``I  
kept looking up and the ball was going in the hole. It's just been 
a phenomenal year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she was 23 and playing her first full season on the LPGA  
Tour, Inkster thought winning the four majors was simply a matter 
of time. It was hard to blame her for such confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	She was Tiger Woods and Se Ri Pak rolled into one, the first  
player to win three straight U.S. Amateur titles, the first 
professional to win two majors as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought this is what I wanted, to win the four  
majors,'' she said. ``I won two really quick, and didn't think it 
was going to be that tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to the other seven who have won the Grand Slam, it was  
plenty difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Bradley, the only other woman to win all of the LPGA's  
modern majors, got her first one in the 1980 du Maurier and 
completed the sweep seven years later with the most dominant 
stretch of major championship golf since Ben Hogan in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Wright, the player Hogan once said had the greatest swing  
he ever saw, won the U.S. Open, LPGA Championship, Titleholders and 
Western Open in a span of five years. In fact, it took Wright only 
11 years to win her nine majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Suggs went 14 years between her first major and her  
fourth, although she won three of them long before the inaugural 
LPGA Championship in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus won his Grand Slam in five years, starting with  
the 1962 U.S. Open and ending with the British Open in 1966. Four 
years later, Nicklaus had won them all again. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan took six years to win the four majors, although it might  
have been sooner had he gone to the British Open before 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Player required seven years to win the Grand Slam. Gene  
Sarazen took 14 years, only because the Masters wasn't around until 
1934 and really didn't begin to achieve major status until Sarazen 
knocked in that 4-wood for a double eagle a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster began her pursuit of the Grand Slam as a rookie and  
finished it in the twilight of her career, with detours that none 
of the others had to face. 
</P>
<P>
	She won 13 times before Hayley was born in 1990, and twice more  
until she became pregnant with Cori. Trying to find a balance 
between motherhood and her career, Inkster began to question her 
desire, almost to the point of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to commit herself to practice, to becoming a top  
player again. She brought her daughters with her on the road. After 
she finished her work on the course, motherhood took over. 
</P>
<P>
	On eve of the final round, she took them for ice cream. On  
Sunday morning, she got up early to make them French toast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked really hard the last three years to get back to where  
I thought I could be,'' Inkster said. ``I just never thought I 
could do what I'm doing now. Everything is coming together, and 
hopefully I can keep doing this the rest of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster won for the fourth time this year, matching her  
career-best season of 1986. She is closing in on her first $1 
million season, and already has earned $300,000 more than last 
year. She is one point from the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy with where I'm at in my golf game and in my  
life,'' she said. ``I'm going to enjoy it. I mean, this will 
probably never happen again. If I don't play another week good, no 
one can take these last six months away from me.''

<HEADLINE> Congo Cease-Fire Draft Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Progress to end Congo's civil war inched  
forward when African diplomats drafted a cease-fire plan but left 
tricky political issues for foreign and defense ministers to 
discuss today. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical details were finalized late Sunday, state radio  
reported a Zambian official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators in Zambia left some key matters up in the air, such  
as how to enforce a cease-fire, the timing of troop withdrawals and 
the deployment of monitors and peacekeepers, said Eric Silwamba, 
minister of state in the office of President Frederick Chiluba. 
Chiluba is serving as the main mediator in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ministers approve an agreement, the next step would be  
for rebel representatives and nine regional heads of state, 
including Congolese President Laurent Kabila, to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-month conflict has destabilized central Africa and drawn  
in soldiers from six other countries, each with a security or 
financial interest in Congo -- a vast, mineral-rich country that 
used to be called Zaire. The war is draining the coffers of 
financially troubled countries and displacing tens of thousands of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have sent troops and supplies to  
back Congolese President Laurent Kabila; Rwanda and Uganda have 
sent soldiers to fight alongside the rebels, who control the 
eastern third of Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Political wrangling and Kabila's refusal to meet with rebel  
leaders -- who themselves have split -- has wrecked a series of 
cease-fire negotiations since the first round in Zimbabwe last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we are moving forward for a peaceful settlement,''  
Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader and former Kabila minister, told 
South African Broadcasting Corp. But he dampened hopes about the 
latest plan, saying any settlement must tackle ``the fundamental 
problems of the Congo'' -- issues concerning democracy, human rights 
and a ``nonpartisan'' army. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft peace plan calls for a standstill of forces and the  
deployment of regional or U.N.-sponsored peacekeepers; for 
immediate steps to resolve the security concerns of Congo and 
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda; for an exchange of prisoners; for 
humanitarian aid to treat the wounded; and for the recovery of 
abandoned bodies of fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	A key stumbling block is timing troop withdrawals once a  
cease-fire is declared. Zimbabwe on Sunday demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of what it described as ``invaders'' from Rwanda and 
Uganda. The latter insist they will not leave until they receive 
guarantees on the security of their borders.

<HEADLINE> Real Quiet Wins Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Real Quiet has been a mystery horse,  
very good on some days, so-so on others. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old colt was good enough Sunday to get out of a jam  
and win the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, just the sixth in 20 career starts for Real Quiet,  
came after a third-place finish the last time out for the 1998 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert believes he understands the disparity.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he runs a mile and a quarter, that's his distance,''  
Baffert said after Real Quiet's half-length victory over Budroyale 
at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any shorter, and he's going to have his problems. That's why  
he's not a win machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although only four horses ran, the smallest field in the race's  
60-year history, Real Quiet still got boxed behind frontrunners 
Malek and Budroyale, with Puerto Madero on the outside, early in 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jerry Bailey, riding Real Quiet for the first time,  
eventually found room on the rail and Real Quiet came through to 
edge ahead in the final strides. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get in trouble in a small field,'' Bailey said. ``I  
almost didn't get a chance to win. With a small field, everybody 
knows where everybody else is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he considered slowing down so he could take his  
mount outside, but ``Kent Desormeaux (on Puerto Madero) looked over 
at me several times and he was going to play to what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero faded to finish four lengths back in fourth, with  
Malek third, a neck behind Budroyale. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet was clocked in 1:59 3-5. All four horses carried 124  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent off as the 4-5 favorite, Real Quiet paid $3.80 and $2.40.  
Budroyale, ridden by Garrett Gomez, paid $3.80. There was no show 
wagering because of the short field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner ran a great race,'' Gomez said. ``I did think for a  
moment or two that we had it won. The last two jumps were the only 
time I could see the winner coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there was nothing I could do.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, aboard Real Quiet because regular jockey Gary Stevens is  
riding in Europe, said: ``I'd like to say that it was very 
difficult to get used to the horse, and that I did a wonderful job. 
But really, he was very easy to ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real Quiet is very fluid, with a lot of good qualities, and no  
peculiarities or temperament that I had to adjust to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet was coming off a third-place finish in the May 29  
Massachusetts Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile race won by Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet earned $600,000, while Budroyale, a career claimer,  
earned $200,000 and Malek $120,000. Even Puerto Madero earned 
$60,000 simply for finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale, raced 16 times in claimers, has been claimed three  
times, mostly recently by Jeffrey Sengara for $50,000 in February 
1998. The 6-year-old already has won $892,150 for his new owner. 
</P>
<P>
	In another of three big races on the Hollywood Park card, Mazel  
Trick won the $300,000 Triple Bend Invitational in track record 
time, finishing five lengths in front of Christmas Boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazel Trick, carrying 115 and ridden by Chris McCarron, went  
seven furlongs in 1:19 4-5, and paid $15, $8 and $4.40. The old 
track record was 1:20 2-5 by Memo under 120 pounds in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy The Moment won the $200,000 A Gleam Handicap, a  
seven-furlong race for fillies and mares. Ridden by David Flores, 
Enjoy The Moment was timed in 1:21 1-5 and paid $19.60, $4.80 and 
$2.10.

<HEADLINE> Nets Remove Interim Tag From Casey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets coach Don Casey is  
the complete opposite of his predecessor, John Calipari. And that 
suits his players just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can make us play hard,'' point guard Stephon  
Marbury said at a press conference Monday introducing Casey as the 
Nets coach. ``His personality allows you to go on the court and 
give it everything you have. You're not dealing with a coach that's 
screaming and yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets had a 3-17 record when Calipari, known for his temper,  
was fired in March. Casey, a veteran assistant with more of a 
laid-back approach, became the interim coach and led the team to a 
13-17 record with most of the leading players on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, impressed with the way he handled the team, gave him a  
reported $1.1 million multiyear contract last Friday. The deal 
would make Casey the second-lowest paid coach in the NBA. That 
fact, however, does not concern him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more money than I've ever made in my life,'' Casey said.  
The 62-year-old earned $55,000 in his first job as an assistant 
coach and $34,000 when he coached Temple University. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have six (championship) rings, you don't have a  
commanding presence,'' Casey said, referring to Los Angeles Lakers 
coach Phil Jackson, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Van Horn said that Casey may not be the best-known name in  
basketball, but said the team needed his experience and his 
controlled ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our coach doesn't need to be a celebrity in order to be an  
effective coach,'' Van Horn said. ``I think he has a great 
understanding of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations for Casey's contract officially began last Monday,  
although the season ended on May 5 and Jackson decided to coach the 
Lakers two weeks ago. Team president Michael Rowe said the Nets had 
to spend time flying members of Casey's staff back and forth for 
interviews and presenting the proposal to the Nets owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could it have been done any quicker? It could have been,''  
Rowe said. He said the team reached an understanding with Casey 
last Wednesday, but delayed a news conference until Monday out of 
respect for the neighboring New York Knicks, who were battling in 
the NBA Finals until Friday night. ``We're big Knicks fans,'' Rowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's wife, Dwynne, said while she and her husband waited,  
they returned to their California home to relax, then came back to 
New Jersey and passed the time with nightly dinners at their 
favorite restaurant in Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understood totally looking at Jackson,'' Mrs. Casey said.  
``I think that once that was resolved ... I think it could have 
been done a little bit quicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept telling ourselves they're new owners. They've never  
done this before,'' she said of an ownership group that includes 
businessmen Lewis Katz, Finn Wentworth and actor-philanthropist 
Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's owners did not appear at the news conference,  
although Marbury, Van Horn and Kendall Gill showed up. Casey took 
no offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here. That's all I care about,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said next season -- his first as a head coach since he briefly  
coached the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 -- depends largely on how 
well his leading players recover from the injuries that plagued 
them last season. Jayson Williams is walking gingerly on his broken 
leg and teammates Van Horn and Kerry Kittles were among half a 
dozen players who battled injuries all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be a journey without some speed bumps,''  
Casey said. But for the first time in a while, he was relaxed 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be fun. It'll be exciting. We'll win.''

	Hubbell To Plead Guilty in Ark. Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Webster Hubbell, who served as associate  
attorney general, will plead guilty to covering up work he and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former law partner, did on a fraudulent 
land development in Arkansas, sources familiar with the case said 
today. Hubbell also will plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge 
as part of the agreement, said the sources, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will recommend that 
Hubbell serve no jail time for the felony conviction, said the 
sources. Starr also will seek dismissal of a tax case against 
Hubbell's wife, his accountant and his tax lawyer, the sources 
said.

	KLA Hands in Weapons

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels handed over  
their weapons to peacekeepers today in Kosovo. As NATO put those 
weapons under lock and key, the United Nations brought back home 
its first convoy of Kosovo refugees. The 335 refugees who came in 
the first organized return operation was only a trickle compared to 
the flood of ethnic Albanians who have come back to Kosovo on their 
own in the past two weeks -- around half the total of 860,000 
refugees. The ethnic Albanians fled in a Serb crackdown during 
NATO's bombing campaign which started March 24.

	Clinton Makes Budget Surplus Plans

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed buttressing  
Social Security and Medicare, using what the White House expects to 
be a $1 trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years. ``Now we 
have a chance to do even more to use the fruits of our prosperity 
today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow -- indeed for 
tomorrows well into the 21st century,'' the president said. His 
plan included no dramatic increases in the targeted tax cuts he 
proposed earlier this year. But the president did not rule out 
considering deeper tax reductions in discussions with congressional 
Republicans later this year.

the core of last year's peace accord. But the threat by British 
leader Tony Blair to impose a Wednesday deadline did not seem to 
move the two key leaders -- the Ulster Unionists' David Trimble and 
Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams -- who continued to accuse each other of 
inflexibility throughout the day's negotiations.

	Transplants Could Treat Parkinson's  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists may have found a way to generate  
unlimited supplies of brain cells for transplanting into 
Parkinson's disease patients. Researchers in the study, which was 
reported in the July issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology, 
said they were able to produce brain cells that pump out the 
chemical dopamine, and that's the kind of cell that is transplanted 
in Parkinson's disease. The results are important but there are 
some caveats, Dr. Olle Lindvall of the University Hospital in Lund, 
Sweden, wrote in an accompanying editorial. One is that the 
resulting dopamine cells didn't survive well when transplanted into 
mice.

	Prices at Amusement Parks Decrease  
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The average price for a family of four to  
visit a U.S. amusement park decreased by $1.58 this year to 
$141.32, according to an annual survey by the trade publication 
Amusement Business. The cost of admission for two adults and two 
children, parking, food and two child-size souvenir T-shirts were 
considered. The average price experiences the first decline since 
the publication began keeping tabs five years ago. ``When you look 
at the whole scope of things, (the cost) didn't decrease as much as 
it just stopped its magnificent gains,'' said Tim O'Brien, 
Amusement Business' southeast editor, who compiled the survey.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today as investors,  
regaining their optimism about interest rates, decided that the 
Federal Reserve will implement only a small increase when it meets 
this week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 102.59 at 
10,655.15. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange led

	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Australian Jelena Dokic, who  
eliminated top-seeded Martina Hingis in the first round, reached 
the Wimbledon quarterfinals with a 6-4, 6-3 win today over 
ninth-seeded Mary Pierce. The unseeded 16-year-old Dokic -- whose 
play led to a flag-waving demonstration by her father and other 
Australians -- fell behind 4-1 but won the next five games to take 
the opening set. She broke Pierce in the seventh game and again in 
the ninth.

<HEADLINE> High-Stakes Game Set for Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a huge pot of cash on the table,  
Democrats and Republicans are sitting down for perhaps the biggest 
poker game in history -- a match that both sides still will be 
arguing about during next year's presidential and congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton fattened the purse Monday by announcing the  
government's budget surplus will be a staggering $1 trillion larger 
than expected over the next 15 years. So, after years of budget 
drought, there finally is real money to divvy up and no agreement 
about how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is trying to win $794 billion to strengthen Medicare,  
and for the first time to pay for prescription drug coverage for 
the nation's elderly. He also wants to leave the table with an 
additional $845 billion for Social Security over the next 15 years 
to assure the program's solvency until 2053. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at their cards, Republicans see prospects for  
strengthening Medicare and Social Security. But they view the 
surplus mountain really as an opportunity to find hundreds of 
billions of dollars for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying higher taxes today than at any time since  
World War II, and they have the right to pay less,'' said Rep. Bill 
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans are drafting a $778 billion, 10-year tax-cut  
plan. Some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, also are catching 
the tax-cutting fever. Clinton says he is open to tax cuts -- but 
not before Congress pays off the national debt, fixes Social 
Security and Medicare and approves tens of billions of dollars for 
education and health programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans question how Clinton can expand Medicare with  
prescription drug coverage on the one hand while cutting the 
program's long-term cost on the other. GOP critics suspect the 
government will impose some form of price controls on medications 
or force belt-tightening that would force pharmaceutical companies 
to cut back on research. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what should Americans expect?  
</P>
<P>
	``People can expect continued deadlock between the two  
parties,'' predicts American University political scientist James 
Thurber. ``Now we have the politics of surplus rather than the 
politics of deficit going on, and it's just as mean-spirited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for cooperation are darkened by the fact that a  
Democratic pickup of just six seats could restore them to power in 
either the House or Senate. With that narrow difference, both sides 
are looking for leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to use every major issue as a wedge issue to try  
to get votes,'' Thurber said. ``I see a great train wreck over 
these issues, as well as the budget generally, coming up. He's 
(Clinton) got his own party split, he's got weak leadership in the 
other party, and it's split. He's a lame duck president. Divided 
party government. He's been impeached. It's the worst possible 
situation he could be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other analysts believe there is a chance for compromise,  
particularly on a form of prescription drug coverage under 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans are scrambling to make sure they're not on the  
short end of the Medicare stick,'' said Norm Ornstein, a political 
analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ``They'd love to get 
a resolution of it. The thing that argues most in favor of some 
kind of a deal is Republicans want to keep their majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the sense of gridlock -- or that Bill Clinton wants to do  
something for the seniors on Medicare and the Republicans don't -- 
is a very powerful spur to try to get something done and declare 
victory,'' Ornstein said. ``But remember, you've got a lot of 
congressional Democrats who'd rather have an issue than a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even if a presidential election were not on the horizon, it  
would be difficult to craft a complicated deal that would amount to 
the biggest expansion in Medicare benefits since the program was 
created three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yielding to demands of Democrats, Clinton reluctantly put aside  
the politically risky idea of charging higher Medicare premiums to 
wealthier recipients. Democrats feared election-year charges that 
they had raised taxes on the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says Clinton hasn't abandoned the idea entirely  
but isn't going to take the heat for it. If Democrats and 
Republicans agreed that it should be part of the package, aides 
said, Clinton would be open to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Medicare and Social Security look to be  
dominant issues for the 2000 campaign.

<HEADLINE> IOC Denies Tax Fraud Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
said Monday it never had been involved in tax fraud and 
falsification of documents as reported last week by a Swiss 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not true,'' IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said.  
``It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lausanne weekly L'Hebdo printed what it said was a secret  
Swiss government memorandum describing the alleged IOC misconduct. 
The story, printed Friday, said Swiss authorities turned a blind 
eye in an effort to sway the 2006 Winter Games selection in favor 
of Sion, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	But Servan-Schreiber said the Lausanne-based IOC had an  
unwritten agreement with local Vaud state authorities, dating back 
to 1971, that exempted foreign from tax on 30 percent of earnings 
and Swiss employees from tax on 15 percent of earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	It had previously applied for full exemption to give its  
employees ``the same status as employees of other organizations 
such as the United Nations and the Red Cross,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax issue resurfaced after the IOC requested exemption from  
Value Added Tax, or sales tax, introduced in Switzerland in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	While applying for the exemption, ``we took the opportunity to  
say to the Swiss government (that) this has been the arrangement 
for 25 years, it's not at all hidden, but we'd like a written 
agreement; we just want to check that everything is in order,'' 
Servan-Schreiber said. ``It was we who suggested examining it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An administrator's interim technical report said irregularities  
possibly had been committed, but a federal tax commission decided 
that definitely wasn't the case, Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The VAT concession was approved by the government last  
September. In February, the IOC withdrew its request following 
widespread criticism in Switzerland in the wake of the scandal over 
alleged misconduct in connection with Salt Lake City's bid to host 
the 2002 winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said at the time that the  
decision was taken out of ``a concern to end all 
misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organization still receives an income tax exemption it was  
granted in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Energy Buying Rival Wicor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The electric and gas utility Wisconsin Energy  
Corp. plans to buy natural gas distributor Wicor Inc. for $1.275 
billion in stock and cash in the latest combination in the energy 
distribution industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will serve approximately 921,000 gas  
customers and more than one million electric customers in Wisconsin 
and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and have approximately 9,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is expected to result in gas rates that will  
be lower over the long term than they would have been on a 
stand-alone basis,'' Richard A. Abdoo, chairman, president and 
chief executive of Wisconsin Energy, said today in announcing the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy would also assume approximately $230 million of  
Wicor debt under terms of the deal approved Sunday by both 
companies' boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy will acquire all of the outstanding shares of  
Wicor for $31.50 per share. That is a 19 percent premium over 
Wicor's closing price of $26.56 per share Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy aaid at least 40 percent of the price of the  
merger will be paid in Wisconsin Energy stock, and Wisconsin Energy 
can increase that to 60 percent. The rest is in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy and Wicor said savings related to the  
combination are anticipated to be approximately $35 million 
annually beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings are projected from lower costs for fuel, materials and  
services through enhanced purchasing power, elimination of 
duplication through attrition and sharing of resources, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy spokesman Michael John said there would be no  
layoffs at either company as a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdoo is to continue as chairman of the board, president and CEO  
of Wisconsin Energy with Wardeberg becoming the board's vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wardeberg is to continue in this position for 24 months, after  
which he plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, to be known as Wisconsin Energy Corp., is  
to continue to have its headquarters in Milwaukee. Wicor is also 
based in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger must still be approved by both companies'  
shareholders and receive approval from regulators but is expected 
to be completed by the spring of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Energy is a holding company with subsidiaries in  
utility and non-utility businesses. Its principal subsidiaries are 
Wisconsin Electric, Edison Sault Electric, Wisvest, Minergy and 
Wispark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicor Inc. operates six subsidiaries in the energy services and  
pump manufacturing industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdoo told an annual shareholder's meeting June 2 that his  
corporation was pursuing acquisitions. Wisconsin Energy tried 
unsuccessfully four years ago to merge with Northern States Power 
Co. of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of review, the $6 billion merger collapsed under  
regulatory scrutiny and opposition from small utilities and 
consumer groups worried about the new company dominating the 
electric power market in the Upper Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Attack Army's Internet Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers defaced the Army's main Web  
site in the latest digital attack on a federal system. Pentagon 
workers noticed it early Monday and repaired it. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Jim Stueve said administrators believe hackers  
altered the www.army.mil site between 8 p.m. Sunday and 5 a.m. 
Monday, but no internal systems were affected. ``There were no 
security breaches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The altered site announced the attack ``has a purpose ... to  
settle rumors'' about the demise of the loosely organized hacker 
group that claimed responsibility for the May attack on the White 
House Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Another message hidden within the altered page's computer code  
urged people who saw it to ``trust very few people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stueve said he noticed the defaced page when he arrived for work  
Monday morning. It was replaced by 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at it and just went on to my favorites (other  
sites) and blew it off because I knew they were going to get to it 
right away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack comes in the wake of several others on prominent  
government Internet sites, including those of the White House, FBI 
and Senate. Military pages have long been favorites of hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always the target,'' said Keith Rhodes, a director in  
the information management division in the General Accounting 
Office, the investigative branch of Congress. ``It's almost like a 
rite of passage. You have to bust a (military) site to have any 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, experts told the House Science Committee's  
technology panel that managers at many federal agencies fail to 
consider computer security adequately and have too few employees 
with sufficient training. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who was among those testifying last week, said Monday  
that the Defense Department's computer-security expertise is 
uneven. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the best and the worst in computer security,'' Rhodes  
said. ``They've got some real pros, some of the best in the 
business. But the DOD is huge ... and some of the areas in the 
Department of Defense don't have very good security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside security experts said they believed the Army site's  
attackers used a relatively well publicized security loophole in 
the popular Cold Fusion software package. The Army said only that 
the incident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The community of attackers is getting better at what they do,  
and a lot of their tools are getting automated,'' Rhodes said. 
``And a lot of the software being sent out is getting worse -- 
designed for flash with security as an afterthought. You put up 
your Web site, and its gets creamed.''

<HEADLINE> Prices at Amusement Parks Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The roller coaster that makes your heart  
pound won't lighten your wallet quite so much this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a family of four to visit a U.S. amusement  
park decreased by $1.58 this year to $141.32, according to an 
annual survey by the trade publication Amusement Business. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in admission charges were offset by decreases in  
children's prices and the cost of souvenir T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville, Tenn.-based Amusement Business, which compiles  
information from the same 25 parks each year, considers the cost of 
admission for two adults and two children, parking, food and two 
child-size souvenir T-shirts. The average price experienced the 
first decline since the publication began keeping tabs five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the whole scope of things, (the cost) didn't  
decrease as much as it just stopped its magnificent gains,'' said 
Tim O'Brien, Amusement Business' southeast editor, who compiled the 
survey. ``They are stabilizing a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A large part of the decline was attributed to Six Flags'  
decision to admit children under 48 inches for half-price at its 16 
amusement, water and animals parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to develop brand loyalty at a young age by a  
demographic group whose purchasing power is growing, said Brent 
Gooden, a spokesman for the Premier Parks-owned Six Flags chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``These youngsters will grow up and as teen-agers they'll want  
to ride the latest ride,'' Gooden said. ``And these teen-agers will 
be parents someday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedar Fair, which owns Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Worlds  
of Fun in Kansas City, Mo., also had tried discounting children's 
admission to great success several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful marketing ploy and it saves people money,''  
O'Brien said. ``What they lose in money, they pick up in goodwill 
and marketing value. You're going to be more inclined to take your 
kids back to the later in the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., experienced the largest cost  
increase at $21.50. The park, which according to the survey costs 
$161.50 for a family of four, added a new looping roller coaster as 
well as a gospel music hall of fame and museum this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're adding a major new ride, that is taken into  
consideration when looking at admission prices,'' said Ellen 
Liston, Dollywood's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices shot up with the average costs of a hot dog and  
hamburger increasing 14 cents to $2.46 and $2.99 respectively. An 
average order of fries went up 13 cents to $1.79 and soft drinks 
went up eight cents to an average of $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost of a T-shirt at the parks decreased $2.14 to  
$9.74, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Nellie Bly Park in Brooklyn, N.Y., was the cheapest park,  
costing a family of four only $65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando-area theme parks continued to be the priciest in the  
survey. Universal Studios Florida, whose prices are similar to 
nearby Walt Disney World and SeaWorld parks, topped the list, 
costing a family of four $225.

<HEADLINE> Disney Seeks To Build Fla. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CELEBRATION, Fla. (AP) -- Three years ago, The Walt Disney Co.  
promised homebuyers a small, community-based school along with its 
movie-perfect town of small shops and lakefront rocking chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, faced with a booming population, Disney and school  
officials in surrounding Osceola County are seeking to build a new 
high school in Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, some residents say, could zap the magic from their own  
magic kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've built our lives around is a school where our  
children are known,'' said Bob Morris, a Celebration resident and 
father of three. ``What they're proposing cuts the heart out of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan to be voted on July 6 by the county school board,  
the town would change from its single, nontraditional K-12 school 
with less than 1,000 classmates to a two-school model that could 
eventually accommodate a total of 4,300. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also could boost to 50 percent the number of  
Celebration students who don't live in the community -- a 10 to 15 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Walt Disney were alive, this wouldn't happen,'' said  
resident Joan Jones. ``We have no input in this decision. We're 
being railroaded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Located on the edge of Walt Disney World, Celebration is an  
oasis of small-town solitude cushioned from a nearby tourist strip 
of hotels and fast-food restaurants by dense forest and swamp land. 
</P>
<P>
	The town of 2,000 residents has a two-street downtown district  
of restaurants, a post office, town hall, specialty shops, a movie 
theater and an ice cream shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The downtown is surrounded by homes, ranging in price from  
$160,000 to $1 million, designed in classical, Victorian, Colonial 
Revival and Mediterranean styles, many with American flags hanging 
from the front porch. 
</P>
<P>
	The unorthodox school is the heart of this community where  
neighborliness is encouraged by the small lots, and homes built 
close together. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of classes, it offers ``neighborhoods'' of 100 children  
with four teachers in large rooms with sofas, chairs and desks. 
Students are encouraged to learn at their own pace and are allowed 
to undertake presentations or projects instead of tests. In the 
first five grades, they receive written evaluations, not grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebration School has also been a flashpoint for criticism.  
Several unhappy parents withdrew their children after moving there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school has divided the community since Day One,'' said  
Lisa Dworkin, president of its PTSA. ``More than any other issue in 
this community, people express their opinions through the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The K-12 school had only 200 students when it opened in 1996,  
but has more than 900 now. While it was designed to accommodate 
1,400 students, up to 3,000 are projected for Celebration by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney underestimated such growth, said Marilyn Waters, a  
spokesman for The Celebration Co., which manages the town. 
Furthermore, she said, Celebration is at the mercy of Osceola 
County school officials, who badly need another high school to keep 
up with the area's overall growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a challenge as far as capacity at the school,'' she  
said. ``The challenge is, what's the solution to the problem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the school board approves the proposed high school to  
accommodate up to 2,500 students, the current K-12 school would be 
converted into a K-7 grade school with a capacity for roughly 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney says it's willing to contribute up to $27 million toward  
building a new high school and expanding the K-12 facility. And 
Waters said the company would be willing to consider a different 
proposal, should someone offer one. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who live in Celebration are passionate about this  
community and they care deeply, like all parents do, about their 
children,'' she said. ``They're having a dialogue, and that's a 
good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone feels threatened by talk of expansion. ``Logic  
would dictate that you need more schools,'' said Ken Baker, a 
parent of four who supports the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Teri Rosen, a Celebration mother of three, said she fears  
the changes would spoil a school where no one is a stranger, and 
where teachers can give more individual attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Goodbye small town, goodbye Disney promises, goodbye Disney  
vision,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 61 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 61 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 5-2 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 18 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is kicking off what figures to be an eventful week.  
</P>
<P>
	First and foremost, the Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting  
on interest rates tomorrow and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expect to see a quarter-point hike in short-term  
rates from the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the second quarter ends on Wednesday, so there  
could be some window-dressing in the market the next couple days. 
</P>
<P>
	Portfolio managers may want to sell underperforming issues and  
buy stronger stocks to give the impression of a good quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the economic calendar is busy this week, capped off by  
Friday's report on June unemployment levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the government released a report showing personal  
incomes rose 0.4 percent in May, with consumer spending up 0.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices are higher on the news.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Brown Is Still the Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A quarter century has passed since Jerry  
Brown was the exciting, youthful new governor of California. After 
a period of self-imposed political exile, he's back as the 
energetic 61-year-old mayor of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Some things have changed. The long dark hair in a thick  
Beatles-style cut is now a thin, slightly graying Friar Tuck ring 
around a nearly bald head. And he is better at keeping appointments 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is the same energy and constant motion, the same  
fast-paced flow of ideas -- the same need to be surrounded by 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make the city come alive,'' Brown says. ``When I  
walk out of the office at night, I want somewhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking office in January, Brown has focused on four  
priorities: improving schools, reducing crime, revitalizing 
downtown and encouraging the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	He has replaced the police chief and school superintendent,  
created an arts council and taken a hands-on role negotiating with 
developers to refurbish vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown talks most about his goal of attracting 10,000 new  
residents to what is now the tattered and lifeless downtown of his 
city of 395,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governors are isolated a lot. As governor, you're dealing at a  
much more abstract level,'' he says. ``Being mayor is actually 
doing things. It's much more specific. It's this street, this 
school, this building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That enthusiasm -- and Brown's lifestyle -- are reminiscent of his  
arrival at the state Capitol in 1975. Now, as then, his political 
life and private life are almost one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers of Brown's universe are his wood-paneled City Hall  
office with its high beam ceilings, and his home a mile away, a 
gray corrugated metal 18,000-square-foot former warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The warehouse's first floor consists of a meeting room seating  
300 or more, offices for his ``We The People'' political action 
group, a broadcast studio, a large library-living room and a 
commercial-size kitchen with long wooden dining tables and benches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Compound,'' as Brown's friends call it, is a beehive of  
employees, volunteers, friends and guests. Full-time residents 
include his senior adviser and the manager of his 1998 campaign for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	An unorthodox lifestyle is nothing new for Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	As governor, he rejected a limousine and mansion, opting for a  
blue Plymouth from the motor pool and an apartment near the Capitol 
with a mattress on the floor. Meetings in the governor's office 
were often unstructured and unending, blending into evening tours 
of nearby restaurants and bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown dated rock star Linda Ronstadt and was on the cover of  
national news magazines within months. In some ways, he was the 
Gov. Ventura of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, many Californians still think of Brown as ``Governor  
Moonbeam,'' satirized by Doonesbury comic strips and late-night 
comedians for his ``small is beautiful'' economics, slowing of 
highway construction and promotion of windmills and space stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, like now, Brown challenged the status quo.  
</P>
<P>
	He named unprecedented numbers of women and minorities to top  
state posts, shifting highway dollars to mass transit, bicycle 
paths and other innovative modes of travel and halting nuclear 
power plants in favor of alternative energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters of all persuasions liked his fresh approach and the way  
he shook up the bureaucracy. He had an unprecedented 6-1 favorable 
rating in California's leading independent poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the novelty wore off. Voters, concluding Brown hadn't  
really done anything that improved their lives, turned against him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was criticized for a short attention span -- motivating people  
with exciting new ideas, then failing to follow through. He became 
an object of ridicule and left public life after a series of 
defeats for president and U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Oakland's residents, more than 72 percent minorities,  
elected Brown by a landslide, making him their first white mayor in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, his popularity seems intact, although some residents say  
they are withholding judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone else would have been business as usual, and we can't  
afford business as usual,'' says John Cottrell, 66, an Oakland 
plumber who didn't vote for Brown but now thinks he is the right 
person for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	To Joe Sweeney, a retired Oakland police sergeant, Brown's  
political fame is an important asset to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably no other mayor can pick up the phone and call any  
corporate CEO in the country and have that call go through. They 
know who he is. You can't buy that kind of clout. That's tremendous 
for the city,'' Sweeney says. ``Another positive thing is he 
listens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like Patricia Wright, 53, say they are waiting for  
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like he's taking on a bit much ... trying to do  
everything,'' says Wright, who voted for Brown. ``He was promising 
jobs for people, but I'm still looking. I guess we ought to give 
him about two years to see if things work out. If they do, then I'm 
going to vote for him again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland was almost an accidental stopping place for Brown, who  
was raised in San Francisco, lived more than 20 years in Los 
Angeles and returned to San Francisco in late 1980s after a 
post-gubernatorial period of travel and solitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking to build a live-work center. San Francisco  
didn't seem to be right. I came to Oakland and found a nice 
building near the railroad station and said, `That's right for 
me,''' Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former Gov. Pat Brown and a three-time candidate for  
the Democratic nomination for president -- 1976, 1980 and 1992 -- 
Brown said he didn't come here intending to run the place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some sense I might get involved in politics, but I  
didn't know at what level. It just sort of evolved,'' he says. ``It 
seemed like the right scale for my interests, my experience and my 
talents.''

<HEADLINE> Cop Ploy Nets 100 Wanted Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 100 people who received unsolicited job  
offers in the mail showed up for promised excellent wages and 
benefits, with one man arriving in a tuxedo, only to find out there 
was a price to be paid for the free croissants and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs were a scheme by police to catch fugitives with  
outstanding warrants charging them with everything from assault to 
failure to show up for jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested 102 people in Sunday's sting.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people probably could've used the jobs,'' Sgt.  
Detective Bill Kelley said. ``But if they want to do good, they 
have to start at square one. Get your (legal business) out of the 
way and nobody's going to bother you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Los Angeles to New York, authorities occasionally rely on  
the element of surprise to lure fugitives with the promise of prize 
money or merchandise only to find themselves in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston sting began when 14,000 fugitives got letters from  
``Madrid International Ltd.,'' an employment agency looking for 
workers for the city's ``Big Dig'' construction project. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent wages, union benefits and the option of working part  
time were mentioned in a letter, accompanied by an application 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of fugitives either didn't respond to the  
enticement or could not be found. Those who did were told to attend 
an orientation at the Bayside Expo Center. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, as the job hunters were welcomed by Madrid's leader --  
a police captain dressed in a business suit -- officers flooded the 
room. A few tried to bolt but no one escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes involved included assault, robbery, drug offenses,  
welfare fraud and child support violations.

<HEADLINE> UPS Moving into Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Hoping to increase its business in Latin America,  
United Parcel Service plans to buy the assets -- including the 
operating rights -- of Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this now as an opportunity for UPS to provide seamless  
service throughout Latin America,'' Bob Elizondo, UPS's vice 
president of operations for Latin America and the Caribbean, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms hope to reach an agreement within two weeks. Financial  
terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The assets include all of Challenge Air's leased facilities,  
ground equipment, computer systems, route authorities and some 
staff. Challenge Air has 1,200 employees in the United States and 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's fleet of aircraft is not included in the asset  
list, said Bill Spohrer, president and founder of Challenge Air 
Cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenge Air operates a fleet of three Boeing 757s and two  
DC-10-40 freighters and will be adding a third in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes more than 60 scheduled flights a week, serving  
17 cities in Latin America. UPS now operates 15 flights a week into 
Puerto Rico, 10 a week into Mexico and charters a number of 
different flights throughout the rest of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular acquisition is going to accomplish what would  
have taken us years to develop had we had gone through separate 
acquisitions,'' Elizondo said. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX Corp., the parent company of Federal Express, already has a  
substantial presence in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes for Oil Deals in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- American and British oil giants are among  
many Western companies looking into oil development deals in Iraq 
now that the U.N. Security Council is indicating a willingness to 
suspend its oil embargo, Oil Ministry officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But these companies haven't a chance at the best deals, Iraqi  
officials say, refusing to identify them. Agreements to explore the 
most abundant fields are in the works or completed with companies 
from France, Russia and China -- key Security Council nations Iraq 
considers friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council has three rival proposals on the table that  
attempt to resume U.N. monitoring of Iraqi weapons programs. All 
involve suspending the 9-year-old oil embargo on Iraq as an 
incentive to secure Baghdad's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no arms monitoring for more than six months. The  
U.N. inspectors left Iraq ahead of December U.S.-British 
airstrikes, which were meant to punish Baghdad for an alleged lack 
of cooperation. Iraq has refused to let the inspectors return until 
sanctions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``crown jewels'' of Iraq's untapped fields either are in the  
hands of ``our friends or are about to be given to them,'' said 
Abdulillah al-Tikriti, head of the ministry's economics department. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Tikriti was referring to Al-Majnoon, Nahr Umar, West Qurna  
and Halfaya fields in southern Iraq, which have reserves estimated 
at 50 billion barrels and a projected production capacity of more 
than 2.1 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamkhi Huwait, a consultant at the ministry, said deals on all  
four have been struck -- or are near completion -- with companies 
from Russia, France and China as a reward for the three nations' 
efforts to get U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, France and China are three of the council's permanent,  
veto-wielding members. They generally have held closer positions to 
Iraq than the other two permanent members: Britain and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals, known in the industry as Development and Production  
Sharing Agreements or DPSAs, reportedly are extremely lucrative. 
The Iraqis have not made the details public yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Lukoil is tied to West Qurna, and France's Elf  
Aquitaine and Total are ``just waiting for the right moment'' to 
sign their deals for Al-Majnoon and Nahr Umar, Al-Tikriti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese National Petroleum Company has struck a deal to  
develop al-Ahdab, where reserves are estimated at a billion 
barrels, and is in talks on Halfaya, according to Huwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is not willing to grant DPSAs to companies from countries  
other than France, Russia and China. Those visiting Baghdad lately 
-- including U.S., British, Italian, Dutch, Australian, Canadian and 
Brazilian companies -- have been told to present offers for buy-back 
deals or other contracts believed to be much less profitable than 
DPSAs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad diplomats, however, said Italy's Agip was in talks on  
the nearly three-billion-barrel Nasiriya oil field. Australia's 
Broken Hill Proprietary was competing with CNPC on Halfaya and 
Brazil's Petrobras, which discovered Iraq's largest oil field of 
Al-Majnoon in 1975, was testing the waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Ranger, they said, was interested to obtain an  
exploration block in Iraq's Western Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	But these Western firms do not fall within Iraq's category of  
``friendly countries.'' Therefore, Huwait said, they stand little 
chance against companies from India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Algeria, 
Jordan and Indonesia -- nations Baghdad has pledged to grant 
preferential treatment for political support during the years of 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> DiCicco Finds More Talent on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Shannon MacMillan and Tisha Venturini were stars for the gold  
medal-winning U.S. team at the 1996 Olympics. Now they ride the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Whalen, Lorrie Fair and Tiffany Roberts might be good  
enough to start for any other team in the Women's World Cup. They 
ride the bench for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	If depth is a contributing factor to which team wins the  
tournament, the Americans have as a good a chance as anyone. 
Probably better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so deep that you will not see a huge dropoff when the  
veterans need a rest and we come in,'' said Whalen, in her third 
season with the national team, which meets Germany in the 
quarterfinals on Thursday at Landover, Md. ``Tony has so much faith 
in all of us, we have faith in ourselves and in each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone through so much in the last six months together, we  
have no choice but to trust each other. There's no way we could go 
through this without trust in our teammates and the trust of the 
coach. We all have the same goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They all want to play in achieving that goal, but realize that's  
impossible. Limited to three substitutions per game, DiCicco can't 
go through his entire bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the players who sit are youngsters. Of the non-starters,  
only MacMillan, Venturini, Roberts and goalkeeper Saskia Webber had 
any notable time on the national team before the 1995 World Cup. 
And Roberts is only 22. 
</P>
<P>
	College record-setter Danielle Fotopoulos has yet to appear in a  
World Cup game. Christie Pearce, who just turned 24, is the only 
defender not to get into the lineup in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	They will comprise the core of the U.S. team for the next World  
Cup. Meanwhile, they sit and learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``You accept whatever role is given to you,'' said defender  
Fair, at 20 the youngest player on the squad. ``Whether you are a 
starter or a cheerleader, you want to do the best you can. 
Everyone, from the players to the coaching staff to the trainers 
and team doctors, they work their best ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't do your job, somebody will let you know. And you  
don't want to let anyone down, so you do your job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan and Venturini did a wonderful job in the 3-0 win over  
North Korea that clinched Group A for the Americans. While it was 
starters Tiffeny Milbrett and Julie Foudy who came in after 
halftime and sparked the three-goal spurt, MacMillan (a goal and 
two assists) and Venturini (two goals) finished off the scoring 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan played in all three first-round games. Venturini made  
her '99 World Cup debut against the Koreans and didn't do much in 
the first half. But in the second, the eight-year veteran of the 
national team was sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best coaching job in the world,'' DiCicco said  
with a smile. ``We have a lot of weapons on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, we have an opportunity to do something  
that has never been done before, and that's what is driving this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He meant following an Olympics title with a world crown. Even if  
he has to go deep into his bench to do it.

<HEADLINE> Educational Value of Kid's TV Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television industry is providing more  
shows for young people, but the educational value of some of the 
programs are questionable, a research group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of  
Pennsylvania said the number of shows available for children rose 
12 percent in the 1998-99 season, but it deemed 21.1 percent of the 
total programming ``minimally educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still substantial confusion about what constitutes  
educational programming,'' said Annenberg research fellow Kelly L. 
Schmitt. ``Shows such as `Duck Tales' and `Hercules' were offered 
by stations to satisfy the educational needs of children, even 
though syndicators and networks claimed they were not designed for 
that purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The studies evaluated the quality and quantity of children's  
television in 1998, as well as parents' and children's opinions and 
behavior. Similar reports have been issued since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the increase in the number of children's  
programs is due mostly to a Federal Communication Commission rule 
that helps broadcasters speed their license renewal by airing a 
minimum of three hours a week of educational and informational 
television for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows such as ``NBA Inside Stuff'' and ``Peer Pressure''  
continue to receive the educational and informational label even 
though they contain minimal educational content, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some improvement: Researchers judged 26 percent of  
the 1998 shows to be ``low quality,'' down from 36 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of the shows classified educational under FCC  
guidelines were ``highly educational,'' 45.5 percent were judged 
``moderately educational,'' and 21.2 percent were ``minimally 
educational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--28 percent of children's shows contained four or more acts of  
violence, and 75 percent of these high-violence programs did not 
carry the FV, or fantasy violence, content rating for children's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--45 percent of children's programs contained one or more  
instances of problematic language and 12 percent of programs had 
one or more instances of sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	--27 percent of local educational productions reported to the FCC  
in 1997 and 1998 no longer are on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	--84.1 percent of parents ``strongly'' or ``somewhat'' favor the  
V-chip technology, which allows them to block certain shows from TV 
sets. Also, 51.4 percent of parents say they would use the V-chip 
``often'' if they had one. 
</P>
<P>
	--Parents report their children spend, on average, 3.25 hours per  
day watching television or videos and 48.2 percent of the children 
have television sets in their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The national survey covered 1,269 parents of 2- to 17-year-olds  
and 303 of their children, ages 10 to 17. The margin of error was 
plus or minus 2.9 percent for the parent's survey and 5.7 percent 
for the children's survey.

<HEADLINE> Study: Bad News Easier by E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The unenviable task of being the bearer of bad  
news is easier -- and the information gets delivered more accurately 
-- when done via electronic mail rather than face-to-face or by 
telephone, a new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't sugarcoat. They don't sweet talk it. They just  
tell it like it is'' through e-mail, Stephanie Watts Sussman, the 
study's co-author, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't necessarily mean it's always better, researchers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some cases where face-to-face communication may be  
preferable. For instance, there are times when delivering bad news 
in person is taken as a sign that the news is important and the 
deliverer cares about the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sussman, an assistant professor of information systems at Case  
Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management in 
Cleveland, conducted her research at Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Her co-author, Lee Sproull, is moving from Boston this week to  
take a position at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
	It's important to examine how bad news gets delivered because  
receiving accurate information -- even if it's negative -- can be the 
first step toward helping an organization or an individual improve, 
the authors said in their study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in the June issue of Information Systems  
Research, a journal of the Maryland-based Institute for Operations 
Research and the Management Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 117 Boston University undergraduates were asked to  
deliver information to a fellow student -- who was in league with 
the researchers -- about a bogus resume the student supposedly 
submitted for comments. 
</P>
<P>
	When the participants had to deliver only positive comments  
about the resume, they didn't distort the good news no matter what 
form of communication they were using. 
</P>
<P>
	But when they had to deliver bad news, participants tended to  
distort the negatives to make the criticisms softer. There was 
significantly less distortion in e-mail than when participants were 
using the phone or speaking face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
	John King, professor of management at the University of  
California at Irvine and former editor-in-chief of Information 
Systems Research, said he has had an e-mail system for 20 years and 
often notices people are less inhibited about sharing their ideas 
when shielded by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of this is particularly surprising,'' he said. ``But  
until somebody looks at it carefully you don't know if it's really 
the case.''

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Celebrates NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Spurs fans didn't want the party to end.  
</P>
<P>
	All weekend the city cheered the first NBA championship won by  
its only major league sports team after 26 years of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration peaked Sunday night with a Fiesta-style river  
parade attended by 230,000 people and a tribute afterward for the 
team at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good. Everything came together this year perfectly,''  
Spurs center David Robinson told ecstatic parade-goers. ``Our team 
came together. The city came together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players, coaches, team executives and a few devoted fans rode  
decorated, motorized barges along the San Antonio River through 
downtown as spectators lined the River Walk to watch. It was 
reminiscent of the city's annual Fiesta celebration each spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson, the 5-foot-11 point guard who hit the winning  
jump shot against the New York Knicks on Friday to capture the 
title, was the star of the show at the dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson introduced his fellow players, cracked jokes about their  
personalities, made fun of the fact that he was twice cut by the 
Spurs and led approximately 40,000 fans in chants and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to ask you a question,'' Johnson said to the dome  
crowd. ``Did the Lakers win the championship?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' the fans yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did the Portland Trail Blazers win the championship?''  
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' screamed the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did the Utah Jazz win the championship?''  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd responded with a huge ``No,'' and Johnson added,  
``With the Utah Jazz, it's all right to say `Hell, no!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to ask you a question. ... Did the San Antonio  
Spurs win the championship?'' Johnson asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans went wild.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs came to San Antonio in 1973 as part of the American  
Basketball Association and merged into the NBA in 1976. San Antonio 
is the first old ABA team to win an NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the team's first trip to the NBA Finals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been so fantastic to see David Robinson and Avery Johnson  
get their due,'' said 11-year season-ticket holder Kevin Conroy, 
who rescheduled his cancer radiation treatments so he could attend 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the Alamodome to the song, ``We Are the Champions,''  
Spurs players hopped onto a stage where the basketball court 
normally is and waved to the crowd as team members showed off the 
Larry O'Brien title trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a 10-year veteran, thanked the Spurs players of the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons I came here was because y'all had a  
tradition. The name I knew was George Gervin,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gervin, a Hall of Fame member who played for the Spurs in the  
1970s and early 1980s, stepped onto the stage and held the 
championship trophy as the crowd gave him big applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan was still recording everything with the mini-cam he  
also turned on after the Spurs' victory in Madison Square Garden. 
He was joined by several other Spurs, who pointed their cameras at 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``M-V-P, M-V-P,'' the fans chanted when Duncan was introduced.  
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich told the fans they were crucial in  
the team's playoff victories, especially in urging on the 
game-winning, tippy-toe 3-pointer Sean Elliott sunk to defeat 
Portland in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals on Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without your energy, Sean Elliott can't stand on his toes and  
he misses that shot,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit that shot, it made it possible for Avery Johnson  
to hit another shot,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	And everyone knew what came next.

<HEADLINE> US Uneasy About Hong Kong Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department suggested Monday that a  
weekend decision by the Chinese legislature that affects Hong Kong 
could erode the independent authority of Hong Kong's judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States attaches the  
highest priority ``to the preservation of and respect for Hong 
Kong's high degree of autonomy, its rule of law, judicial 
independence and the protection of individual liberties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy occurred when the Hong Kong government asked the  
Chinese legislature to reject a ruling on immigration policy by 
Hong Kong's highest court. Hong Kong authorities said the local 
court ruling could lead to severe overcrowding in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said that seeking an interpretation from China's  
legislature is not unlawful. But he said the United States worries 
that such power ``has the potential to erode the independent 
authority of the Hong Kong judiciary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Broader, frequent review of the Hong Kong court of final  
appeals' power of final jurisdiction could, thereby, erode the 
independent authority of the Hong Kong judiciary,'' Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Spill in Puget Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FERNDALE, Wash. (AP) -- A tanker unloading oil at the Tosco  
refinery became untethered, spilling as much as 1,050 gallons of 
crude oil into north Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern of the Arco Texas accidentally became unmoored Sunday  
afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Paul Lattanzi. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ship drifted away from the dock, the metal arm that  
carries oil from the tanker to the refinery was bent and broken, 
Lattanzi said, and oil spilled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The flow of oil was stopped immediately after the break occurred  
off Neptune Beach, near Ferndale, Lattanzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ``touched land in two spots'' and was a threat to  
wildlife, said U.S. Coast Guard officer Fran Colantonio. No damage 
to fish or birds was evident Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A light sheen of oil could be seen in the water from the dock at  
Neptune Beach about seven miles north to Point Whitehorn, Lattanzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tosco Ferndale Refinery spokeswoman Wendy Eickmeyer estimated  
the spill at 20 barrels of crude oil, about 840 gallons. The 
company is conducting its own investigation and cooperating with 
authorities, Eickmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleanup crews have responded to the spill, Lattanzi said. Booms  
were put in place to contain the oil, and two Clean Sound Coop 
skimming vessels were aiding the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill was relatively small. A Tacoma refinery was fined  
$30,000 last year by state regulators for a March 16, 1998 spill of 
75,000 gallons at a dockside tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press analysis recently found that the Navy had  
spilled 56,675 gallons of fuel at Puget Sound ports from 1990-1997 
-- about 60 percent of the total reported spilled in the sound 
during that time.

<HEADLINE> Reliever Wohlers Out With Sore Arm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Relief pitcher Mark Wohlers, struggling to  
find the strike zone and work his way back to the major leagues, 
will be sidelined from 1-3 weeks because of tendinitis in his 
pitching elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds announced Monday that Wohlers will remain  
for now with their Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts affiliate, where 
he has been on a rehabilitation stint. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander struggled in his last appearance for  
Chattanooga. He allowed one hit, three runs, two walks and made 
three wild pitches on Thursday in two-thirds of an inning, striking 
out one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds obtained Wohlers in an April trade that sent reliever  
John Hudek to the Atlanta Braves. Atlanta agreed to pay the $5.2 
million salary of Wohlers, 29, who has been unable to consistently 
throw strikes since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers saved 97 games for Atlanta from 1995-97, setting a  
Braves record with 39 saves in 1996. He had 33 the following 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said that personal problems contributed to his pitching  
difficulties. In 1998, he pulled a muscle in his side, his wife 
filed for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Regulations Rule Appealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a full appeals  
court Monday to reconsider a three-judge panel's decision 
overturning new federal air pollution regulations for smog and 
soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial requirements, issued by the Environmental  
Protection Agency in 1997, called for tougher pollution controls to 
reduce the amount of smog-causing chemicals and microscopic soot in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia said in a 2-1 decision May 14 that the EPA 
lacked authority to impose the tougher smog standards and had 
improperly issued new standards for soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The court action came in response to a lawsuit filed by some of  
the country's most powerful business interests and sent shock waves 
through the administration and the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal had been expected.  
</P>
<P>
	In its filing Monday, the Justice Department argued the  
three-judge panel had ``erred in concluding that the EPA lacks 
authority to implement and revise more stringent ozone'' standards 
and in holding that the agency's actions on soot was an 
``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full appeals court must now consider whether to uphold the  
panel's decision, or reverse it. The administration may still 
appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, should it be necessary, 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 regulation that was struck down by the panel's May 14  
decision, was one of the most controversial ever developed by EPA. 
It required much tougher air pollution controls to reduce soot and 
ozone levels in the air to ensure better protection of children, 
the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who has promised an appeal,  
said she was gratified of the Justice Department action to try to 
reverse ``one of the most bizarre and extreme decisions in the 
annals of environmental jurisprudence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If allowed to stand this decision would bring real  
consequences to the American people,'' she said in a statement. If 
the tougher air standards are blocked ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a broad cross-section of  
industry groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil 
and auto industries, as well as small businesses. Three states -- 
Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards being challenged had limited ozone, an  
essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 
parts per million under the previous requirement. And for the first 
time they required that states to regulate microscopic 
particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and other sources 
down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the width of a human 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
in 1997, but the EPA and the White House sided with 
environmentalist and health advocacy groups, which argued the more 
stringent air quality standards are needed to protect sensitive 
populations such as children and people with respiratory problems.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Crisis Could Have Been Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The financial crisis that began two years ago  
in Asia threatened to erupt into an even more severe emergency that 
could have engulfed the entire world, including the United States, 
in recession, departing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin believes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a number of times when this thing could have become  
far worse than it did,'' Rubin told a small group of reporters 
during one of his final interviews as treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said in December 1997, when South Korea came close to  
defaulting on its foreign obligations, and last fall, when a 
default by Russia badly rattled markets, were two such periods when 
the global financial system ran the risk that the crisis could have 
spread to far more countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a number of times when it could have really become  
a severe crisis for the entire world, including ourselves,'' Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the International Monetary Fund has come in for severe  
criticism for how it responded to the crisis, Rubin said for the 
most part the decisions it made were the correct ones given the 
need to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF was making them in very brief periods of time, in the  
context of very complex situations,'' Rubin said. ``There were a 
lot of unknowns. ... On balance, I think they did a very good 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he expected a lot of books to be written about the  
financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997, leveled a 
number of countries in Asia, struck Russia last fall and forced the 
devaluation of the Brazilian currency earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have charged that the more than $100 billion in  
financial rescue packages assembled for crisis countries wound up 
being wasted because the money did not prevent severe recessions 
from occurring or keep the crisis from claiming more victims. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said, ``Without the IMF, without the international  
community, the probability that this would have turned out very 
badly would have been much higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin pointed to the fact that a number of the countries  
receiving rescue package have seen their economies stabilize and 
begin to recover is evidence the IMF programs are working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Korea certainly has made a lot of progress although they have  
a lot of issues that lie ahead,'' Rubin said. ``Thailand has made a 
lot of progress ... and Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin announced in May that he is stepping down after 4 1/2 years  
as treasury secretary. President Clinton's nominee to replace him, 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, is awaiting a vote by 
the full Senate after having won unanimous backing from the Senate 
Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin refused to be drawn into speculating about whether he  
would remain on past his July 4 target departure date if the Senate 
has not confirmed Summers by that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``That question should turn out to be academic,'' Rubin said.  
``It seems to me that this should be brought to the floor and 
brought to the floor expeditiously. It seems to me that I should 
not have to face that issue.''

<HEADLINE> Tom Cruise Talks to Time Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Cruise found the filming of Stanley  
Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' such an intense experience that he 
developed an ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to tell Stanley,'' Cruise told Time magazine in  
this week's issue. ``He panicked. I wanted this to work, but you're 
playing with dynamite when you act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a story of sexual obsession starring Cruise  
and his real-life wife Nicole Kidman, turned out to be Kubrick's 
swan song. The director died in March and neither Cruise nor Kidman 
were able to talk about him without misting up, Time said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're so proud of the movie, but we have this strange feeling  
about its success,'' Kidman said. ``Stanley was always around. And 
now he's gone.''

<HEADLINE> DiCicco Finds More Talent on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When U.S. coach Tony DiCicco looks down his bench, he sees  
enough talent to form another Women's World Cup team. In the end, 
that could prove a decisive edge. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Americans head into Thursday's quarterfinals matchup with  
Germany at Landover, Md., many of their key players will be rested. 
The reserves who have gotten a chance to play have looked sharp. 
And the inexperienced backups who were called upon in the first 
round won't be so green if they are needed in the knockout rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are as good as anyone in the field,'' DiCicco said  
after Sunday's 3-0 victory over North Korea gave the U.S. team a 
3-0 record in the opening round. ``I think we're capable of beating 
anyone and of winning the tournament. But there are some very 
strong teams that feel the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those teams, most notably Norway and China, don't have the depth  
of the Americans. The Norwegians have been plagued by injuries in 
the last week, with captain Linda Medalen's bruised nose and face 
the most worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Koreans, DiCicco rested starters Michelle Akers and  
Kate Sobrero for the entire game. He gave Tiffeny Milbrett and 
Julie Foudy the first half on the sideline, while Mia Hamm and 
Cindy Parlow took off the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	And while it was Milbrett and Foudy who sparked the second-half  
rally after an 0-0 first 45 minutes, backups Shannon MacMillan (a 
goal and two assists) and Tisha Venturini (two goals) finished off 
the scoring plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got into every practice fighting for starting roles,'' said  
MacMillan, who was a regular for the 1996 Olympic team that won 
gold. She had two game-winners in her three goals in the Atlanta 
Games and is a proven commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be among these 20 women. It's an awesome team.  
I'm ready to contribute, whether it's starting or coming off the 
bench or not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacMillan played in all three first-round games. Venturini made  
her '99 World Cup debut against the Koreans and didn't do much in 
the first half. But in the second, the eight-year veteran of the 
national team was sensational. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've achieved what we wanted in the first round, and now we  
have a chance to move closer to our goal,'' Venturini said. ``As we 
proved in our last two games, whoever we play, if we play our game, 
we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And whomever DiCicco puts on the field, it appears those players  
are capable of leading the United States to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best coaching job in the world,'' he said with a  
smile. ``We have a lot of weapons on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, we have an opportunity to do something  
that has never been done before, and that's what is driving this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He meant following an Olympics title with a world crown.  
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about this team,'' said Sara Whalen, who  
replaced Sobrero on defense Sunday, ``is we all are pulling for one 
another and we help each other. I want Kate to be healthy and to 
play. But if she can't go, she knows she can count on me. Tony 
knows he can count on all of us. And we all know we can count on 
each other.''

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Seven people died when a car skidded out of  
control into the path of a van on busy Interstate 15, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Scott Flabi said the victims  
Sunday included two Los Angeles residents in the car and five 
people from San Marcos, Calif. who were in the van. 
</P>
<P>
	The car skidded into the northbound lanes and into the path of  
the van, the trooper said. The van struck the car broadside, Flabi 
said, and both vehicles burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no survivors.  
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the car was identified as Chong Tae Kim, 60, and  
the passenger as Susan Suk Kim, 51. The names of the five other 
victims were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred about 36 miles southwest of Las Vegas,  
near Primm, Nev.

<HEADLINE> Small Asparagus Harvest Expected / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- Eastern Washington's asparagus harvest  
could turn out to be the smallest in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have sure never seen anything close to this in my 12  
years,'' said Mike Harker, Washington Asparagus Commission 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields traditionally are about 3,800 pounds per acre, but this  
year, they're not likely to exceed 3,000 pounds per acre, Harker 
said. Final yield figures won't be available until August. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers blame a cool spring punctuated by periods of blistering  
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is what the asparagus commission is calling a crisis,  
and growers in Adams, Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla and Yakima 
counties could be eligible for federal weather disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mother Nature was not good to us through April and May, and it  
wasn't good to us in June,'' said Tom Philleo, an asparagus packer 
in Eltopia. ``It's been a tough year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the blame goes to last summer's heat wave, which  
prevented plants from getting all the nutrients and water they 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost more than they could take in,'' said Jeanne Pickel,  
Outlook grower and chairwoman of the asparagus commission. ``They 
were just tired all year. They didn't have the vigor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington leads the nation in asparagus with about 22,000  
acres. But after two bad seasons in a row, the industry is hurting. 
Last year, the crop earned about $34 million, down about $6 million 
from recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Asparagus joins a long list of troubled crops, including apples,  
potatoes, wheat and hops. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of weather, next year might not be much better for  
growers because the minimum wage is expected to rise again. 
Washington voters, in the fall of 1998, approved a ballot measure 
to raise the state minimum wage. This year, it's at $5.70 per hour. 
Next year, it will be $6.50 an hour, $1.90 more than it was in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	HERMISTON, Ore. (AP) -- Pressured by processors to grow perfect  
potatoes for supermarkets and fast-food restaurants, Oregon farmers 
apply more chemicals per acre than potato farmers in the six other 
major potato-growing states, according to a federal survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, potato farmers have more than doubled their use of  
pesticides to an average of 164 pounds an acre in 1997, mostly 
because of the increasing use of fumigants and fungicides, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers inject fumigants into the ground, flush weed killers  
through giant rotating sprinkler systems and hire pilots to spray 
fungicides and insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy use of chemicals has helped produce some of the  
world's biggest per-acre potato yields. But federal agencies, 
concerned about health risks, are prodding farmers to reduce their 
pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is conducting a  
sweeping review of pesticide compounds by examining the hazards 
they may pose to consumers, workers and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, most of those chemicals don't show up even in trace  
amounts on the spuds that reach consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Potato farmers -- like many fruit and vegetable growers -- use two  
classes of chemicals that act as neurotoxins. These carbamates and 
organophosphates kill by attacking a bug's nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA review, required by the 1996 Food Quality Protection  
Act, will try to gauge the cumulative risks -- both on and off the 
farm -- posed by the widespread use of these chemicals. The review 
could lead to restrictions on certain crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The review has spurred research into alternative pest-control  
methods. But the economics of potato farming and the stubborn 
nature of the pests slow the pace of change, and many farmers are 
wary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose those products, you could be in real trouble,''  
said Gary Reed, an entomologist who heads the Oregon State 
University experiment station near Hermiston.

<HEADLINE> Few Changes Likely For San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- With an NBA title in hand and most of the  
team's core players under contract through next season, it should 
be a fairly quiet offseason for the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson, Malik Rose and Will Perdue are exceptions.  
</P>
<P>
	The three reserve players become free agents this summer after  
each found moments to shine during the Spurs' 15-2 playoff journey 
leading to San Antonio's first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue and Rose were among the several Spurs players who took  
turns guarding and slowing down Shaquille O'Neal when San Antonio 
swept the Lakers 4-0 in the Western Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson scored a playoff career-high 22 points in Game 3 against  
the Lakers and followed up with 20 points, including six 
3-pointers, in Game 4 at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, Jackson scored 17  
points and sunk a key 3-pointer to put a stop to a Knicks' run in 
San Antonio's series-opening victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning the title on Friday, players and coaches have  
spent most of their time celebrating and none of it talking 
publicly about individual contracts or personnel moves. During the 
championship series, Jackson said he would like to be back with the 
Spurs next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping the situation with a level head, not too  
overconfident,'' said Jackson, who has played with eight NBA teams. 
``I'm not going to count my chickens yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson has two years left on his six-year, $66 million  
deal. He could choose to opt out of it this summer but isn't 
expected to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs also have said little about the NBA draft on Wednesday  
in which the team has the No. 29 overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Another personnel matter to be addressed in the offseason is the  
contract of coach and general manager Gregg Popovich. Spurs 
chairman Peter Holt is trying to negotiate an extension of 
Popovich's three-year deal, which ends after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest contract question looming for San Antonio is  
a year away. That involves franchise player Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan has one more season left on his three-year rookie deal.  
He has said he would like to stay in San Antonio but has hinted the 
Spurs' arena uncertainty needs to be resolved before he'll decide. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Spurs don't get a new arena, the team may leave town and  
relocate in some other city with a better facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs executives want to leave the Alamodome for a more  
profitable smaller arena. So far they've seen little local 
political initiative to get public money pledged to help build it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to get it done,'' Duncan said. ``I think we will  
get it done. We've given them a good reason to keep us.''

<HEADLINE> Hail Storm Pounds Plains States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. (AP) -- Hail as large as baseballs stripped  
branches from trees, smashed windows and cars, and injured about 
two dozen people as severe thunderstorms battered the central 
Plains. Flash flooding forced people out of one neighborhood in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of cars and hundreds of homes were damaged Sunday in  
Scottsbluff, city officials said. And in addition to the hail and 
high wind, streets were awash after 1.25 inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have unbelievable flooding, trees that look like sticks,  
and the roofs of cars left outdoors are all beat up,'' said Denise 
Sinner, a Scotts Bluff County dispatch supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional West Medical Center said 24 people were treated for  
injuries caused by the hail and by flying glass. One policeman was 
cut when hail shattered a window in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it hits your house, it sounds like gunshots being fired  
at it,'' Scotts Bluff Civil Defense Director Sherry Blaha said of 
the hail. ``It starts very slowly and got very loud. It's pretty 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tornado warnings issued during the storms briefly halted the  
Nebraska high school rodeo at Thedford -- where the event had been 
moved because storms the day before flooded the rodeo arena at 
Broken Bow with water 2 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	More violent weather lashed Kansas today, with high wind blowing  
stained glass windows out of the public library in Ottawa and 
littering the streets with downed trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Flash flooding forced residents to evacuate a perennially  
flooded neighborhood of Kansas City, Kan., and blocked roads in 
other parts of eastern Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, storms caused flash flooding in northeastern Kansas.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters at McLouth, Kan., had to use a boat to rescue two  
people stranded on a narrow strip of land between two rising creeks 
after they tried to drive across a submerged road, Jefferson County 
Sheriff's spokesman Shawn Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seneca, Kan., several families had to be evacuated from a  
residential area near the Nemaha River. Some parts of Nemaha County 
near Corning got up to 7 inches of rain during the day, said 
Undersheriff Steve Linden.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Denies WWII War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Allegations that the Jasenovac detention  
camp was a death factory that subjected inmates to torture, forced 
labor and starvation are absurd, the last living Nazi-era 
commandant told a court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinko Sakic, 77, is standing trial for war crimes against  
humanity for his role in the deaths of some 2,000 inmates at 
Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than a dozen concentration 
camps set up by Croatia's Nazi puppet regime in 1941-45. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued his defense, which started last week at the Zagreb  
county court, seeking to discredit eyewitness testimonies, 
documents of the postwar communist government of Yugoslavia and 
papers published by historians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stories of mass extermination and summary executions are  
nonsense manufactured by communist ideologists,'' Sakic said 
defiantly -- comments that came in striking contrast to earlier 
harrowing accounts from survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conditions inside the camp were good and inmates were treated  
satisfactorily in order to increase their productivity,'' said the 
77-year-old, citing an International Committee of the Red Cross 
report based on a five-day examination of the compound in August 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist  
Croats perished at Jasenovac. If convicted, Sakic faces a maximum 
sentence of 20 years in jail. A verdict is expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Several survivors have accused Sakic of personally killing one  
inmate with a hand gun and ordering the hanging of nine others 
accused of stealing fellow prisoners' mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic denied that Monday, saying ``none of the officers had the  
authority to independently punish inmates.'' Disciplinary action 
was decided upon by administrators, local governmental bodies and 
military courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic said he ran Jasenovac from July to October in 1944, not  
from April to November as prosecution documents show. The start and 
length of his tenure could prove vital in establishing his 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no starvation or suffering caused by intense physical  
labor during his term, though there were minor food shortages due 
to transportation problems, he said. Inmates worked nine hours a 
day, he said, and on Sundays they rested.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 102.59 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot higher Monday as investors grew more  
confident that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates only 
slightly at its meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 at 10,655.15.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index rose 16.04 to 1,331.35, and the Nasdaq composite 
index gained 49.79 to close at 2,602.44, boosted largely by 
software makers and a recovery among Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume remained relatively light, a sign that many traders were  
unwilling to make big commitments in advance of the Fed's Open 
Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Consolidated 
volume came to 789.24 million shares, up from Friday's 750.45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is widely expected to increase short-term interest rates  
by a quarter percentage point to slow the economy and prevent 
inflation from accelerating. Analysts say that increase, which 
would be the first in more than two years, is already reflected in 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate hike is almost history and now investors are thinking  
it's a great time to buy,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of 
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's rally was a ``relief-type situation,'' said, John  
Lynch, director of investment strategy at IJL Wachovia in 
Charlotte, N.C. ``A quarter-point increase is not something that 
will grind the economy to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow lost 303 points, or 2.7 percent, amid fears  
that the Fed would raise interest rates by a larger amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Further illustrating the strength of the U.S. economy, the  
Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending rose 0.6 
percent in May, outpacing personal income, which rose 0.4 percent. 
The continued rapid rise in spending, which boosts corporate 
profits, also increases fears about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are already looking past the expected quarter-point  
interest rate hike to gauge whether the Fed will make a series of 
increases or just one, Lynch said. ``I don't think a series of rate 
hikes is necessary, as the global economy still has a way to go 
till it hits recovery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A rally in the bond market also boosted stocks. As the  
bellwether 30-year Treasury rose in price, its yield fell to 6.09 
percent from 6.15 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index was led higher Monday by the financial  
sector, which is most vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates. 
J.P. Morgan, up 5 1/2 at 134 1/16 and American Express, up 2 13/16 at 
125 1/4, were among the biggest Dow gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks, or economically sensitive companies, also rose,  
led by Dupont, up 1 3/8 at 67 11/16, and construction equipment maker 
Caterpillar, up 2 1/8 at 60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks and software makers led the Nasdaq. Yahoo! was  
the biggest gainer, adding 9 5/8 at 156 1/2. Microsoft added 1 13/16 at 
86 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.55 to 628.89, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.08 at 774.10 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.50 to 448.61.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.0 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was up 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bill Clinton Denies Senate Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coming soon to the White House -- his-and-hers  
Senate campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
	No way, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday. He was  
responding to a New Yorker magazine report that friends in Arkansas 
were encouraging President Clinton to seek a Senate seat from that 
state after he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no intention of running for the Senate, rules out the  
idea of running for the Senate,'' Lockhart said. ``I think his 
quote to me was, 'That story is crazy and I don't know where they 
got it from.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the political focus in the Clinton household is on  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's possible Senate bid in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clintons were in New York City on Monday to attend  
Democratic Party fund-raisers, the first lady took time to go 
house-hunting in the city and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``She took the opportunity to go look at some houses,'' said  
Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton. ``She looked at some 
in the city and some in the environs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said she had no further details about the house-hunting  
activities. The Clintons have said they plan to settle in New York 
after the president's term ends in 2001, whether she runs for the 
Senate next year or not.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air in Pilot Training Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Korean Air has signed a $30 million  
contract with the FlightSafetyBoeing of the United States to train 
its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year contract calls for the Seattle-based firm to send  
about 100 personnel to Seoul to train and test some 1,500 Korean 
Air pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	FlightSafetyBoeing was founded in 1997 by Berkshire Hathaway's  
FlightSafety International and The Boeing Co. It is the largest 
provider of training for commercial pilots and maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air, the world's 13th largest carrier, has been sharply  
criticized for a string of disasters and the South Korean 
government has hit it with millions of dollars in penalties in the 
form of route reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Korean Air's recent accidents were blamed on poor  
maintenance and safety violations by its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Disasters have plagued the Korean airline since 1983, when one  
of its 747s -- Flight 007 -- was shot down after straying into Soviet 
air space, killing all 269 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air Flight 801 slammed into a Guam hillside on Aug. 6,  
1997, killing 229 people. Only 26 people aboard the Boeing 747 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest fatal accident, a Korean Air cargo plane crashed  
minutes after takeoff from Shanghai's airport on April 15, killing 
all three crewmen and five people on the ground.

<HEADLINE>  Duke May Have 4 NBA First-Rounders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke lost the national championship three  
months ago. The Blue Devils will lose a whole lot more Wednesday in 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Danny Ferry,  
Mike Gminski and Gene Banks never left Duke early for the riches of 
pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But Duke's luck ran out this season. Elton Brand said he would  
turn pro after his sophomore season, setting off a domino effect 
involving underclassmen William Avery and Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Add senior Trajan Langdon and the Blue Devils most likely become  
the first team to have four first-round picks in the same draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Five schools have had three first-round selections in the same  
year: Indiana (1976), Michigan (1990), UNLV (1991), Arkansas (1992) 
and Kentucky (1996). 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really hard to imagine that this could happen very  
often,'' said Keith Drum, an area scout for the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a Duke dynasty after coach Mike Krzyzewski led  
the team to a 37-2 record with players such as Brand, Avery and 
Maggette returning to join Chris Carrawell, Shane Battier and Nate 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Blue Devils begin next season with six freshmen among  
their 10 scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said last week he felt hurt after some of the players  
bolted early, the trio not even staying for their junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have allure here,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have one  
of the great schools, we have an outstanding basketball program and 
we have great people. To me, that's a heck of a thing to be a part 
of. To me, that stands by itself against anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not millions of dollars, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Brand, Avery and Maggette are expected to go high in the first  
round, but teams have questions about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Brand tall enough? Can Avery run the point in the NBA? Does  
Maggette have the experience? 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is 270 pounds and 6-foot-8, and some speculate he is  
closer to 6-5 1/2. In fact, Brand was measured twice when he worked 
out for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams made a big deal about it,'' Brand said. ``When it was my  
turn to get measured it was like, `OK, it's Brand, shoes off, socks 
off, head straight' because there were so many rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brand's height checked out and he has surprised some teams.

<HEADLINE>  Duke May Have 4 NBA First-Rounders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke lost the national championship three  
months ago. The Blue Devils will lose a whole lot more Wednesday in 
the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Danny Ferry,  
Mike Gminski and Gene Banks never left Duke early for the riches of 
pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But Duke's luck ran out this season. Elton Brand said he would  
turn pro after his sophomore season, setting off a domino effect 
involving underclassmen William Avery and Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Add senior Trajan Langdon and the Blue Devils most likely become  
the first team to have four first-round picks in the same draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Five schools have had three first-round selections in the same  
year: Indiana (1976), Michigan (1990), UNLV (1991), Arkansas (1992) 
and Kentucky (1996). 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really hard to imagine that this could happen very  
often,'' said Keith Drum, an area scout for the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a Duke dynasty after coach Mike Krzyzewski led  
the team to a 37-2 record with players such as Brand, Avery and 
Maggette returning to join Chris Carrawell, Shane Battier and Nate 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Blue Devils begin next season with six freshmen among  
their 10 scholarship players. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said last week he felt hurt after some of the players  
bolted early, the trio not even staying for their junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have allure here,'' Krzyzewski said. ``We have one  
of the great schools, we have an outstanding basketball program and 
we have great people. To me, that's a heck of a thing to be a part 
of. To me, that stands by itself against anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not millions of dollars, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Brand, Avery and Maggette are expected to go high in the first  
round, but teams have questions about all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Brand tall enough? Can Avery run the point in the NBA? Does  
Maggette have the experience? 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is 270 pounds and 6-foot-8, and some speculate he is  
closer to 6-5 1/2. In fact, Brand was measured twice when he worked 
out for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams made a big deal about it,'' Brand said. ``When it was my  
turn to get measured it was like, `OK, it's Brand, shoes off, socks 
off, head straight' because there were so many rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brand's height checked out and he has surprised some teams.  
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Hornets coach Paul Silas, whose team picks third, has  
a drill in which players are fed the ball in a stationary position 
and dunk it repeatedly. He said most of his players can do about 10

<HEADLINE> Soccer Quarters Pit Strong Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When FIFA organized the Women's World Cup, it couldn't have set  
up better matchups than what's in store for the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	How about Russia vs. China? Norway against Sweden? The United  
States and Germany? Historically strong rivals, although they have 
little history in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the best of the second-round games could be Nigeria vs.  
Brazil, featuring two of the most creative offenses in women's 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the style of Brazil, and I'm going to present a very  
good strategy to counter,'' coach Ismaila Mabo said. ``We shall do 
our best to win the match against Brazil Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal matchups:  
</P>
<P>
                    *San Jose, Calif. (Wednesday)    	
</P>
<P>
                          *China vs. Russia    	
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese have two victories over the United States this year.  
They were formidable with a 7-0 rout of Ghana in the opening round. 
Rarely were they tested, although their opener with Sweden was 
spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	China might be the most balanced team, and it has an outstanding  
goalkeeper in Gao Hong. The Chinese have not finished below second 
in an important international event since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, a relative newcomer in the women's game, advanced from  
the weakest group. The Russians showed firepower in beating Canada 
4-1 and Japan 5-0. They lost 2-1 to Norway, the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Norway vs. Sweden    	
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes usually play Norway close, but lose. The Norwegians  
are more physical and experienced, which often is the difference 
between the Scandinavian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway scored 13 goals and yielded two in the first round. It  
hit stride after the close but convincing victory against Russia. 
Captain Linda Medalen broke her nose against Japan and her status 
is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes don't have much offense and will probably lay back  
and hope for a break. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Landover, Md. (Thursday)    	
</P>
<P>
                      *United States vs. Germany    	
</P>
<P>
	The Germans, who finished second to Norway in 1995, play a  
physical and almost mechanical game. They don't have a lot of 
flair, but they don't usually need it. 
</P>
<P>
	That could bother the Americans, who prefer a more freewheeling  
opponent. The Germans' ruggedness hurt them in the final seconds 
against Brazil, sending them into this matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched film of the Germans many times and have found  
things they do that we have put into our game,'' U.S. coach Tony 
DiCicco said. ``They are a very formidable opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Americans. If they can handle the rough stuff, they  
have more options on attack. But the United States needs a quicker 
start than it had in any of the three first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Brazil vs. Nigeria    	
</P>
<P>
	Did someone say 8-7 in extra time? The outcome could come down  
to the last possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians have a vastly superior defense and a flair for  
just about everything, including last-second goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil could be bothered by Nigeria's fouling, especially if  
scoring leader Sissi is targeted. If the officiating tight, that 
could be the key.

<HEADLINE> Florida Smokers' Suit Heads to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Six jurors began deciding Monday whether the  
nation's five biggest cigarette makers and two industry groups are 
responsible for injuries thousands of smokers claim they suffered 
because they couldn't quit the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury left the courtroom after about 40 minutes of  
instruction and the reading of the verdict form by Circuit Judge 
Robert Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers say the tobacco industry made a defective product  
and conspired to deceive the public and government about 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry contends smokers should have known the risks of  
smoking and are responsible for their own decision to light up. 
Tobacco officials also deny allegations they purposely made more 
addictive cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are enormous,'' said anti-tobacco activist and  
Northeastern University law professor Richard Daynard. ``They're 
enormous for the defendants much more so than for the plaintiffs. 
If they lose this case, there are lots of other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If jurors find for the plaintiffs in this initial phase, damages  
would be set in the next segment, which also would highlight the 
lives of nine smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye has imposed a gag order barring lawyers and parties from  
talking about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards of lawsuits settled by states have gone into state  
treasuries. In this case, the smokers themselves are seeking 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers are represented by Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, a  
husband-and-wife legal team that won a $349 million settlement for 
flight attendants in a secondhand-smoke case against the same 
defendants in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the Rosenblatts used thousands of internal and  
embarrassing tobacco documents released after Minnesota settled its 
case against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosenblatts represent an estimated 500,000 sick Florida  
smokers or their survivors who are seeking at least $200 billion 
from Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the Tobacco 
Institute., and other cigarette makers and industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple filed the lawsuit in 1994, a jury was chosen last  
July and opening statements began Oct. 19. Since then the trial has 
dragged on, interrupted by holidays, long weekends and illness as 
well as legal challenges and arguments over motions.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 61 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 61 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 5-2 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 18 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is kicking off what figures to be an eventful week.  
</P>
<P>
	First and foremost, the Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting  
on interest rates tomorrow and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts expect to see a quarter-point hike in short-term  
rates from the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the second quarter ends on Wednesday, so there  
could be some window-dressing in the market the next couple days. 
</P>
<P>
	Portfolio managers may want to sell underperforming issues and  
buy stronger stocks to give the impression of a good quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the economic calendar is busy this week, capped off by  
Friday's report on June unemployment levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the government released a report showing personal  
incomes rose 0.4 percent in May, with consumer spending up 0.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices are higher on the news.

<HEADLINE> Laptop...If You've Got the Dough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Notebook computers are like Male Midlife Crisis sports cars --  
you can't make a reasonable case for owning them, but oh, what they 
do for your heart. 
</P>
<P>
	As this is being written, my heart is rejoicing in an IBM 1472  
ThinkPad notebook computer that's sitting in my lap as I enjoy the 
shade and breeze of the backyard. My head is pointing out that for 
$2,799, I could probably get almost two comparably equipped 
desktops. 
</P>
<P>
	My head should go soak itself.  
</P>
<P>
	The top model of IBM's i Series, the 1472 sports a 14.1-inch  
active matrix color display at 1,024 x 768 resolution backed by 2.5 
megabytes of video RAM. The processor is a 366-megahertz Pentium II 
with onboard 256K level-two cache and the notebook comes standard 
with 64 megabytes of RAM, expandable to 256. There's a 6.4 gigabyte 
hard drive, a 3.5-inch floppy drive and a DVD-ROM drive, in case 
you feel the need for a movie in the midst of working. 
</P>
<P>
	And whether or not you have the computer powered up for  
computing, you can still play audio CDs without even opening the 
screen, getting your sound through a robust pair of built-in Altec 
Lansing Sound Guide stereo speakers with a dynamic equalization 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, you can connect it to an external stereo system,  
or earphones, or a TV, not to mention ports for printers, monitors, 
keyboards, mice, USB devices and a port replicator interface. 
There's a built-in 56 kbs V.90 modem. It will handle two Type I or 
one Type III PC cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The keyboard is comfortable enough, although it took about an  
hour before this mouse jockey got used to the TrackPoint pointing 
device. That's a widget that looks like a pencil eraser jammed 
between the G, H, and B keys on the keyboard. You use it like a 
mini joystick to control the cursor. And as used by a trip-hammer 
typist from the days of manual typewriters, the keyboard stood up 
to extended pounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Battery life is three hours, and the whole shooting match weighs  
7.7 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Windows 98, software includes Lotus SmartSuite  
Millennium, which bundles LOTUS 1-2-3, Lotus Freelance, Lotus Word 
Pro, Lotus Organizer and Lotus Approach.( You expected IBM, which 
owns Lotus, to shop Corel or Microsoft?) Quicken 99 is there, as 
well as Norton Antivirus, PC Doctor, America Online, World Book 
Encyclopedia and Tom Lehman Golf Pro 98. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1472 performed well testing software for the column, and if  
you've got the dough for luxury spending, it is the machine to 
consider. If you don't have the dough, just the taste for luxury, 
consider the next machine down in the line, the 1452 for $2,299. 
You'll drop to a 128K cache, a 4.8 gigabyte hard drive and the 
processor will be a Celeron. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom of the i Series line is the $1,799 1412, but now  
you've given up the DVD drive, dropped to a 12.1-inch monitor and 
800 x 600 resolution, so what's the point? It's like buying a 
four-cylinder sports car. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM products are ubiquitously available.

<HEADLINE> Minister Convicted in Murder Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A former pastor was convicted Monday of  
asking a parishioner to join him in a plot to kill their wives. 
</P>
<P>
	James Ogle, pastor of the defunct Bull Run Bible Fellowship in  
Manassas, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and solicitation of a 
felony. Although he did not admit to the plot, he did acknowledge 
that prosecutors had enough evidence for a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle, 46, indicated his relationship with his four children  
``would be better'' with his wife, Judy, out of the picture, police 
Detective Samuel Walker testified. Ogle, a teacher before becoming 
a minister, blamed his wife for career failures, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that Ogle suggested to Scott Jinks in February  
that they swap murders. Ogle was counseling Jinks and his wife 
about their marriage at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I take care of your wife, will you take care of mine?''  
Ogle asked Jinks, according to Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	Jinks went to police and allowed them to tape telephone calls,  
and wore a wire to a meeting. He arrived with $200 for Jinks to buy 
a silencer for a handgun, Walker testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said Ogle typed and mailed to Jinks instructions on how  
to carry out the murder of Ms. Ogle. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Jinks asked Ogle about reciprocating the murder and  
Ogle assured him he would. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogle was having an affair with a female parishioner, but the  
woman had broken off the relationship, Walker said. Ogle had 
promised his wife that he would not divorce her or remarry unless 
she cheated on him, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other way Ogle could remarry ``was if she was dead,''  
Walker said.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The United Nations began organized  
convoys today, while Serbs who remain in the province observed the 
610th anniversary of their loss of Kosovo to the Ottoman empire, 
the defeat that defines their claim to the province. Seven buses 
with about 320 refugees, escorted by representatives of the U.N. 
High Commissioners for Refugees, left the Stenkovec 1 camp in 
Macedonia shortly after 8 a.m. Dozens of others were to be picked 
up at Stenkovec 2 for the trip to Pristina, the Kosovo capital, in

	Thailand Making Bulletproof Silk

<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Researchers at a local university said  
today they have developed a bulletproof vest and body armor made 
from tightly woven strands of Thai silk. Only Special Forces units 
of the military and police are currently using the vests, which 
according to engineers at the Rajamankala Institute of Technology, 
where they were developed, can stop .22 and .38 caliber bullets. 
Thailand's police and military, under severe budget pressure, can't 
afford vests made from the standard kevlar. Kevlar vests cost about 
$270, while the silk vests cost $216, said Prof. Somprasong 
Phasaprathed, of the Faculty of Engineering at Rajamankala.

ministers hope that three days of make-or-break negotiations 
starting today will rescue the Northern Ireland peace process and 
enable the new government of Catholics and Protestants to begin 
work. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, 
Bertie Ahern, return today to Belfast to begin the intensive round 
of talks aimed at saving last year's peace accord. Blair has set a 
Wednesday deadline for the agreement to get back on track, or fail.

	Educational Value of Kid's TV Eyed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The television industry is providing more  
shows for young people, but the educational value of some of the 
programs are questionable, a research group reported today. The 
Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania 
said the number of shows available for children rose 12 percent in 
the 1998-99 season, but it deemed 21.1 percent of the total 
programming ``minimally educational.'' The studies evaluated the 
quality and quantity of children's television in 1998, as well as 
parents' and children's opinions and behavior.

	Crude Oil Spill Reported in Wash.  
</P>
<P>
	FERNDALE, Wash. (AP) -- An oil tanker spilled about 1,050 gallons  
of crude oil into north Puget Sound waters yesterday, the Coast 
Guard said. The Arco Texas was unloading oil at the Tosco refinery 
when the ship's stern came unmoored at about 1:55 p.m., said Coast 
Guard Lt. j.g. Paul Lattanzi. As the ship drifted away from the 
dock, the metal arm that carries oil from the tanker to the 
refinery was bent and broken, he said, and oil spilled into the 
water. It was not clear how the stern of the ship became unmoored 
from the dock. The Coast Guard and the company were investigating.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego leadoff batter Quilvio Veras scored  
twice yesterday as the Padres took an early lead against Colorado 
and held on to top the Rockies 5-3, tying the longest winning 
streak in the majors this season. The Padres, who have outscored 
the opposition 55-23 during the streak, equaled Texas' streak from 
May 24-June 2. It is two games shy of the club record, last reached 
in 1998.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Travis Lee tripled to lead off the bottom of the  
10th inning and scored on pinch-hitter Andy Fox's single as the 
Arizona Diamondbacks recovered from a blown save in the ninth to 
beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 last night. Lee lined Ricky 
Bottalico's 2-1 pitch to right field and the ball got past Thomas 
Howard, allowing Lee to easily make it to third. Hanley Frias hit a 
high bouncer Botallico, but no one covered first and the runner was 
safe. Fox hit it deep to right-center to end the game.

<HEADLINE> Slay Suspect's Poster Won't Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The name of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez will remain  
on wanted posters for an alleged serial killer, even though the FBI 
on Monday confirmed several media reports that the name is just one 
of more than 30 aliases. 
</P>
<P>
	Don K. Clark, special agent in charge of the Houston bureau and  
head of the task force pursuing the man linked to eight slayings in 
three states, said authorities have confirmed the suspect borrowed 
the Resendez-Ramirez name from his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect's real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis,  
according to a birth certificate. The 39-year-old was born in 
Izucar de Matamoros, Puebla, Mexico, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the public to be concerned about names,'' Clark  
said, explaining why they'll continuing calling him Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez. ``The picture is what's very important, because 
that is how he's going to be recognized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the suspect's penchant for inventing names as he  
travels the country, often by riding freight trains, Clark said his 
actual name is less significant than his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Angel Reyes is among the myriad aliases already listed on the  
wanted poster. His full name will be added to that list, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, who appears on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, has  
been charged with two slayings earlier this month in Illinois. He 
also is wanted for questioning in five Texas killings and a 1997 
homicide in Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urged To Prioritize Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blaming the Clinton administration for a drop  
in government-funded housing, tenants from across the nation 
protested Monday outside the campaign headquarters of Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of property owners have refused to renew contracts for  
apartments subsidized through Section 8 -- one of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's biggest public housing programs -- 
since Congress lifted restrictions in April 1996. More than a 
million families are at risk of losing their homes, the National 
Alliance of HUD Tenants said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis resident Ronald Bobo said that so far, his landlord  
hasn't ``opted out'' of Section 8, a move allowing landlords to 
charge much higher rents. ``That would mean I'd be living under a 
bridge,'' said Bobo, 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobo was one of about 150 demonstrators chanting, ``Wake up, Al!  
Wake up, Al!'' as they marched around a 6-foot-tall clock whose 
face read, ``Time is running out for our homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tenants who lose their homes to owner ``opt outs'' often receive  
voucher certificates, which don't protect them against future rent 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to find a landlord that would take a voucher,'' said  
Bobo, whose hometown has an estimated 2,150 at-risk homes, 
according to the National Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators blame the White House for the crisis.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of thousands of low-income working families, senior  
citizens, and the unemployed face homelessness or deepening poverty 
unless current policy is reversed,'' the tenants' group president, 
Cleo Busby, wrote in a letter to Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A top HUD official told the protesters that his agency is  
working to reverse the trend. Effective May 1, HUD froze ``opt 
outs'' and raised rental assistance payments to landlords under to 
bring them up to market levels, said Federal Housing Administration 
Commissioner Bill Apgar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a budget proposal in for $100 million to cover the  
markup-to-market situation,'' Apgar said, arguing that Gore and 
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo were directly involved in 
negotiations on fixing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on the same side,'' Apgar told the tenants.

<HEADLINE> ABC, Affiliates To Share TV Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC has reached a long-sought deal with its 225  
affiliates to help defray the cost of ``Monday Night Football'' and 
set guidelines for the use of network programming on cable 
offshoots. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC will get more than $150 million from its stations, mostly in  
cash but also through additional advertising time ceded to the 
network from the local stations, said ABC President Patricia 
Fili-Krushel on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stations, in return, get an equity stake in the new soap  
opera cable channel that ABC is launching early next year and 
assurances that the network won't undermine them by quickly 
replaying programming on competing channels. 
</P>
<P>
	The major networks have traditionally paid affiliates to air  
their shows. But declining viewership and increased programming 
costs have forced struggling networks into delicate talks to alter 
those relationships. Fox this spring took back ad time from its 
affiliates, and NBC is in similar talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a mutual understanding that the business model has  
got to change,'' said David Barrett, president of Hearst-Argyle 
Television and a past head of ABC's affiliate board. ``It's part of 
the reason it took so long to arrive at this agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's negotiations began almost immediately after its expensive  
January 1998 deal for the continued rights to broadcast ``Monday 
Night Football.'' It's the first time affiliates have paid to air 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The affiliates agreed on Monday to a payment of $45 million a  
year over three years to help cover the football costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The stations were also worried that the soap opera channel,  
which will rerun daytime dramas on cable in the evening, would give 
viewers less incentive to watch during the day. With additional 
cable offshoots for other genres a possibility, the affiliates 
wanted to set guidelines for ``repurposing'' of programming. 
</P>
<P>
	The affiliates agreed to allow the soap operas to be rerun in  
return for a piece of the new cable business. The stations also 
forced ABC to commit to not re-using most of its entertainment 
shows for at least three months after the original air date. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides swapped ad time: the network will sell all the  
commercials during the Saturday morning childrens' schedule and 
affiliates won some additional prime-time commercials. They hope 
that ABC turns its fortunes around so the ad time becomes more 
valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal does not address ABC's general compensation to its  
affiliates. This will be negotiated on a station-by-station basis 
over the next few years, Fili-Krushel said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the deal gives ABC stability in its relationship with  
the affiliates over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you're trying to change a business, there are a lot  
of issues,'' she said. ``Both of us were trying to deal with ways 
to preserve our flexibility for the future.''

<HEADLINE> Andersen and Investors Settle Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State and federal judges on Monday  
approved a $90 million settlement between accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen and 6,800 investors, who claimed faulty advice from the 
firm cost them millions in the collapse of Colonial Realty. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Alfred V. Covello and Superior Court Judge  
Joseph H. Pellegrino took about 15 minutes to approve the 
settlement, which resolved 31 lawsuits filed against Andersen in 
federal and state courts since Colonial's bankruptcy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who lost about $300 million were retirees, teachers,  
judges and lawyers. Each invested between $25,000 and $1.5 million 
in real estate ventures in 17 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent of the investors were from Connecticut.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors blamed the fall of the $2 billion real estate empire  
on widespread fraud and a downturn in the real estate market. 
Twelve people were convicted in the scandal, including company 
principals Jonathan Googel and Benjamin Sisti, who are serving time 
in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors claimed Arthur Andersen worked with Colonial officials  
to paint falsely optimistic pictures of Colonial's real estate 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Andersen has denied wrongdoing, and the 1998 conviction  
of accountant Edmund M. Autori on wire and mail fraud charges was 
overturned in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said it agreed to the settlement to keep the  
case from dragging on another decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, had already paid the  
investors $10 million to end a criminal investigation into its role 
in Colonial's collapse. It also paid a $2.5 million settlement to 
the state attorney general's office.
