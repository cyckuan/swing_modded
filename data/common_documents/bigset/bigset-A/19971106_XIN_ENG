<HEADLINE> Philippine High Court Voids Oil Deregulation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
today stopped the oil deregulation law just nine months after the
law fully took effect.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 9 to 2, the court declared the law
"unconstitutional" and made permanent the temporary restraining
order against any oil prices increase it issued less than a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
There were no representatives from the three big players in the
oil industry -- Shell, Caltex, and Petron -- when the decision was
handed.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said the judges had serious basis in
declaring the oil deregulation law as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the high tribunal made the decision in
consideration that any hikes in oil prices at this time would
endanger the country's lower inflation rate and make the financial
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings from the government and the court, the three
oil companies hiked prices last month just before the court
announced no oil prices increase in the face of the current
currency woes sweeping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos described the High Court's decision as "a
surprise", saying he has ordered the Departments of Energy, Trade
and Industry and Finance to study the impact of the decision in
terms of investors' confidence and future deregulation policies
and whether a motion for re-consideration could be filed.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Hydroelectric Expert's Three Gorges Dream Coming True (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- A field trip
to the Three Gorges 60 years ago filled Zhang Guangdou, a young
scientist in his mid 20's, with an ambitious dream of building a
gigantic water control project on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
This trip in 1937 after his return with a master's degrees in
civil engineering and engineering mechanics respectively from the
University of California and Harvard of the United States, still
lingers in his mind after six decades.
</P>
<P>
So Zhang, 85, a world-famous scientist and hydroelectric
enginnering expert is still working tirelessly and indefatigably
today for materializing his long-aspired dream, which will be
materialized in a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is now an academician of boths the Chinese academies of
sciences and engineering sciences and professor of the prestigious
Qinghua.
</P>
<P>
"What a wonderful site for building dams," young Zhang
exclaimed with joy when overlooking at the swift currents gushing
through the gorges. "Then I vow that abundant water resources must
be taped and developed to the benefit of people."
</P>
<P>
But he didn't anticipate it would remain a dream for so long.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was sent to the US to take up his post as intern engineer
in 1942 and, two years later, thanks to his effort, a famous
American engineer surnamed Savage was invited to make an
investigative tour of the Three Gorges. Afterward, based on
Savage's proposal, the US and Chinese sides signed an agreement
concerning the construction of the Three Gorges project with
American loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang then was at a loss. In spite of being a staunch advocator
for the project, he hesitated because he deemed that the
war-ravaged China then was neither capable of undertaking such a
mammoth program nor was in need of the huge amount of electricity
to be generated by the project. So he wrote to an authoritative
official and voiced his concerns.
</P>
<P>
After some 800,000 US dollars were spent, the government then
suspended the project in May of 1947. And Zhang Guangdou, chief
engineer of the national hydroelectric engineering department
under the Resources Committee, was appointed to head a team to
deal with the matters related to the worktoppage.

<P>
"I felt very much relieved," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He explained, "the Three Gorges project must have the powerful
backing of the national strength, certain scientific and
technological standards and a peaceful environment."
</P>
<P>
Zhang has devoted himself to the construction of new China's
first batch of hydroelectric power stations, designing some of the
country's key water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
"Through all these years, however, I have never forgotten my
Three Gorges dream," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the founding of new China in 1949, the Three Gorges
Project has been placed high on the agenda of the Chinese
government. Zhang has actively taken part in surveying, planning
and designing the project.
</P>
<P>
When the state once again organized a feasibility appraisal of
the project from 1986 to 1989, Zhang was one of the principal
leaders of a contingent of more than 400 specialists.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, when the National People's Congress approved the
project, he was overjoyed and swept with delight for being able to
witness and participate in the project personally.
</P>
<P>
After the construction of the project was officiated in
December 1993, Zhang Guangdou has inspected the worksite several
times and, after his return to Beijing, he still pondered the
project. Last September, he again came to inspect the first-stage
project at the head of a leading quality appraisal team for
the first-stage project.
</P>
<P>
When the first stage construction is about to be completed with
the blockage of the Yangtze River on November 8, the hydropower
master said, he only hoped that the river damming will be crowned
with success and that his Three Gorges dream will come true.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Wheat Arrive in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 tonnes of Syrian
wheat worth 5 million U.S. dollars has reached Iraq within the first
phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first shipment of wheat from Syria under a
contract signed between the two countries for the purchase of
25,000 tonnes of Syrian wheat.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the imported wheat were reshipped from
Syrian ports to Iraq immediately after their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi-Syrian relations, severed in early 1980's because of
Syria's support for Iran in the Iraqi-Iranian war from 1980 to 1988,
have been improved since May.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reopened the border in June and Iraq has
signed a number of agreements with Syria for the purchase of
Syrian products within the framework of the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal which was launched in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil
over a renewed six month period to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for the Iraqi people suffering under the
seven-year-old U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Saleh has recently
expressed his country's worry about the cancellation of the
oil-for-food deal as a result of the present crisis between Iraq
and the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraqi mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by an Iraqi decision to expel
American members of the U.N. weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Three U.N. envoys began their diplomatic mission in Iraq today
to try to solve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> No Permanent African Intervention Force Planned: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- France, Britain and the
United States had no intention of setting up a permanent force to
intervene in African conflict, French embassy counsellor Roland
Dubertrand said today.
</P>
<P>
An earlier proposal by the three countries on a framework for
African peacekeeping operations had been misunderstood,
Dubertrand told a conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"It is not, under any circumstances, about creating a
permanent African intervention force."
</P>
<P>
Instead, the tripartite proposal was aimed at the better
co-ordination of peacekeeping operations between African and
non-African states under the umbrella of the United Nations and
the Organization for African Unity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubertrand said the initiative by France, Britain and the U.S.
also did not constitute an African peacekeeping exterior
directorate.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, its objective is not to relieve the international
community from its responsibilities to the detriment of the
Africans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dubertrand said African armies often lacked the logistical
capability to take part in peacekeeping operations. France
contended that swift UN intervention in Africa could have avoided
more than one tragedy during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the principles for a peacekeeping framework would
foucs on the need for a long-term coordinated action under the
auspices of the UN and the OAU, Dubertrand said.
</P>
<P>
The approach was that African states should be involved. An
envisaged support group to reinforce peacekeeping activities on
the continent should be open to all.
</P>
<P>
"Its aim is to allow all African states involved and all
potential contributors to be informed of the ongoing activities
throughout the African continent."
</P>
<P>
The first meeting on the issue would be held in New York next
month, and it was hoped that African countries would attend.

<HEADLINE> Haze on Increase in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The haze caused by the forest
and brush fires still raging across some parts of Indonesia has
began to blanket parts of Java Island, the National Flight and
Aerospace Institute (Lapan) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The smoke has reached Java since yesterday afternoon, totally
covering the Sunda Strait," Lapan official Dr. Muchlish Aries
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the haze is still hovering in the skies and is yet to
move down the surface of Java, he added.
</P>
<P>
The sky over some parts of Jakarta was dark Tuesday afternoon,
but meteorologists could not immediately say whether it was thick
clouds or the haze, or a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
The choking haze, which has occurred in the past few months in
several countries in Southeast Asian region, will not ease in the
near future despite many recent falls of rain, Aries said, adding
that fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
He said at least 92 new hot spots were detected late on Monday,
still burning in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, Bali and East Nusa
Tenggara.
</P>
<P>
Recent rainfall in some parts of Indonesian has failed to
extinguish the majority of fires that have already devastated
1.714 million hectares of forests in the country. The fires have
caused a total loss of about 3.15 billion U.S. dollars, according
to the Indonesian Forum of Environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's Environmental Impact Management
Agency said that only heavy rains would be able to put a complete
end to the fires, which some analysts have attributed to the
EL-Nino weather phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Opponents Accuses Kim of Supporting NPP's Rhee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam is under growing attacks from two major parties for
allegedly supporting Rhee In-je, the candidate for the New Party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) and the main opposition
National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) has questioned the
president's neutrality, which he repeatedly guaranteed in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Rhee In-je is a former close associate of President Kim. He
left the ruling party in September to run the presidential race on
his own after he was defeated by NKP chairman Lee Hoi-chang in the
party's nomination contest in July.
</P>
<P>
While other NKP members loyal to the president, including eight
lawmakers, have joined Rhee's party, there is speculation that
more NKP figures are expected to turn to support their onetime
factional colleague, Rhee.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties, beginning to intensify their attacks,
described Rhee's party as the new party of YS (President Kim
Young-sam). Rhee has begun in earnest his preparations for the
presidential election slated for December 18.
</P>
<P>
However, NKP candidate Lee Hoi-chang and his aides suspect that
President Kim is behind the recent desertion by lawmakers to
Rhee's new party.
</P>
<P>
They speculated that the president has abandoned the unpopular
Lee and decided to support the rising Rhee to prevent a victory by
opposition NCNP leader Kim Dae-jung, his longtime political rival.
</P>
<P>
A NKP senior official's claim that top presidential aides had urged
him to break with Lee Hoi-chang added fuel to the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP, claiming that some presidential aides were supporting
Rhee's campaign, is even raising suspicions that the president may
have provided Rhee with money from his slush funds to finance the
creation of Rhee's new party.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office today denied the president's
involvement in Rhee's campaign, but failed to make a direct reply
to the question about whether the president still supports Lee's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rhee's party, the NPP, reacted angrily to the two
major parties' move to associate Rhee with President Kim. He
called it a dirty scheme to hurt his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
NPP officials said the NKP's accusation is aimed at turning the
presidential race into a showdown between Lee of the NKP and Kim
of the NCNP by damaging Rhee's popularity.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey indicated that Rhee is a close second to Kim,
the most popular presidential candidate with an approval rate
standing at more than 35 percent, with a gap of less than five
percent.
</P>
<P>
If Rhee joins hands with Cho Soon, another opposition
presidential hopeful, he could obtain over 40 percent of votes to
defeat the veteran politician Kim, the poll suggested.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, the ruling party candidate Lee Hoi-chang filled a
distant third place with less than 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's President Leaves for Lome Convention Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omer
Al-Bashir here this morning for the Gabonese capital Libreville to
participate in the three-day Lome Convention summit due to open
today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir will make a speech at the summit on Sudan's position
on the Lome Convention, namely, Sudan's opposition to linking
economic assistance with political preconditions. He will argue
that international cooperation should be based on equality, mutual
interest and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention was first signed in 1975 by 46 developing
countries in African, Caribbean and Pacific regions and nine
European Economic Community (EEC) member states and became
effective on April 1, 1976.
</P>
<P>
It gave industrial and agricultural products of those
developing countries free access to the markets of the EEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention has since been renewed and enlarged to include
more developing countries. It offered to provide EEC funds to help
financial projects in developing member countries through grants
and loans from the European Investment Bank and from the European
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which joined the convention in 1975, has obtained some 1
billion U.S. dollars from the EEC on projects of food production,
rural development and aids to foreign refugees in various parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denounces New US Sanctions, Aggressive Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan angrily denounced newly
imposed U.S. economic sanctions as "an extension of the
U.S. aggressive policies against those who do not submit to its
hegemony."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision represented one aspect of the injustices
Washington was practicing against numerous countries that pursue
an independent policy, said Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Mustafa Osman Ismail today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Tuesday
new U.S. sanctions against Sudan, which included freezing Sudanese
government assests in U.S., barring most U.S.-Sudanese trade and
banning U.S. investments and most financial transactions between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the tightening of sanctions was prompted by Sudan's
"abysmal record" on human rights and its pro-Iranian government's
support of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Ismail said the U.S. decision was made out of
its biased policies against the just causes of the Arab nation,
starting with the causes of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was tantamount to U.S. support of the aggressions
perpetrated by the Sudan's neighboring states, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last January Washington sent 20 million U.S. dollar worth of
military equipment to each of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda to
defend themselves against what it claimed "radical Islamic tide
coming from the Sudan."
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed regret that the announcement came as
negotations were under way in Nairobi, Kenya, between Sudanese
government and the John Garang-led Popular Movement for the
Liberation of the Sudan to end the civil war in southern Sudan and
to establish peace throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was the biggest loser by making such a decision, and
would inevitably give up as it did in several other cases like
Iran, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's President Leaves for Lome Convention Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omer
Al-Bashir here this morning for the Gabonese capital Libreville to
participate in the three-day Lome Convention summit due to open
today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir will make a speech at the summit on Sudan's position
on the Lome Convention, namely, Sudan's opposition to linking
economic assistance with political preconditions. He will argue
that international cooperation should be based on equality, mutual
interest and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention was first signed in 1975 by 46 developing
countries in African, Caribbean and Pacific regions and nine
European Economic Community (EEC) member states and became
effective on April 1, 1976.
</P>
<P>
It gave industrial and agricultural products of those
developing countries free access to the markets of the EEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention has since been renewed and enlarged to include
more developing countries. It offered to provide EEC funds to help
financial projects in developing member countries through grants
and loans from the European Investment Bank and from the European
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which joined the convention in 1975, has obtained some 1
billion U.S. dollars from the EEC on projects of food production,
rural development and aids to foreign refugees in various parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Lorry Drivers in UK Face 10-Hour Delay by French Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of lorry drivers in
Britain are facing a wait of up to 10 hours for a ferry to
continental Europe Wednesday as the French lorry drivers' strike
tightens its grip, local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that during last night, the number of
lorries waiting on the closed-off stretch of the M20 motorway near
the south coast port of Dover reached 400.
</P>
<P>
The queue was expected to lengthen as more lorries headed for
the coast.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,000 lorries left Dover Tuesday bound for the
Belgian ports of Zeebrugge and Oostende.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair held a 15-minute telephone
conversation Tuesday with his French counterpart Lionel Jospin and
demanded help for British truckers caught up in the strike.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday UK Transport Minister Gavin Strang held talks
with France's ambassador to London Jean Gueguinou in a further
diplomatic move aimed at putting pressure on France.
</P>
<P>
The strike by French lorry drivers, who are campaigning for
higher pay and better working conditions, has lasted for three
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Belgian club Beveren said on
Wednesday they had sacked coach Paul Theunis, making him the third
first division trainer to lose his job this season.
</P>
<P>
"The players had made it clear it could not go on like this,"
Beveren secretary Kris Rotthier told VTM television.
</P>
<P>
Beveren, led by Theunis, won last season's second division
championship but are now second-last in the 18-team table with
just one victory from nine games.
</P>
<P>
"We think that with these players we should at least be able
to stay in the first division," Rotthier said.
</P>
<P>
Theunis will be temporarily replaced by assistant coach Bert
Van Puymbroeck.

<HEADLINE> PLO Senior Official Claims Peace Process Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kadoumy, head of the
political department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) asserted here today that the Middle East peace process
is dead.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Damascus for a visit to Syria, Kadoumy said in
an statement to newsmen that "We may say that the peace process is
dead."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is maintaining its intransigent policy in
absolute disregard of the international will, the U.N. resolutions
and peace in general, leading to mounting tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stated that during his stay in Damascus the prime issue he
would take up with Syrian officials is the strengthening of Arab
solidarity and joint Arab action in these difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy added that the United States was endeavoring to
delude the Arab and world public opinion that political
negotiations were under way so that the Arabs might participate in
the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference scheduled in
mid November in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Arabs should uphold a clear stance
towards the suspension of normalization process with Israel and
close down the liaison offices which have been opened for that end.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinian National Authority and
Israel resumed in Washington Monday under the U.S. auspices. The
PLO Secretary General Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy are discussing issues including security cooperation, a
freeze on Jewish settlement, Israeli further withdrawal from West Bank
area, implementation of the agreements signed and how to start
talks on final status.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries are waiting for the results of the PNA-Israeli
talks as they have conditioned their participation in the Doha
conference on major progress of the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe left here this afternoon for Libreville, Gabon, to attend
a two-day summit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
group of countries which begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 70-member grouping are expected to produce
an agreed position on negotiations for a new Lome arrangement,
which is intended to become effective in September next year.
</P>
<P>
At this summit the ACP heads of state and government will
exchange views on the strategic challenges facing the group and
the ACP-European Union relations beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also discuss other economic issues with the
focus on trade among the member countries and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe currently chairs the ACP group's ministerial council.
</P>
<P>
ACP countries were worried about the pending expiry in the
year 2000 of the Lome IV convention and its trade packages which
have over the years facilitated preferential access of various
agricultural commodities from ACP countries to European markets.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the World Trade Organisation two years
ago now threatens the economies of ACP countries as the
preferential treatment being accorded to them will no longer be
permissible by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lome conventions have provided frameworks for trade,
development and aid between the EU and ACP countries since 1975.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already produced a green paper indicating the
stoppage of the present facility once it expires in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The ACP have the desire to continue the Lome-type arrangements
with some modifications, such as relaxing the hard rules and
regulations for borrowing and lending.
</P>
<P>
The major benefit of the ACP countries in the Lome arrangement
is access to the European market without paying duty and without
the requirement of reciprocity.

MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today dismissed Boris Berezovsky, a business tycoon from a senior
position on the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the presidential press service were quoted as saying
that Yeltsin made the decision under pressure from first deputy
prime ministers, Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, following a
meeting Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky was deputy secretary of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov reportedly refused to comment on Berezovsky's
dismissal, and a high-ranking Kremlin source has denied that
Berezovsky is to be offered the post of deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The presidential administration said it had no information
about any presidential decree on a new appointment for Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky, a billionaire, amassed a banking and media empire
following the collapse of the Soviet Union. His position with the
Security Council had come under questioning because of his lack of
experience in security affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was also criticized for linking his government job with
business activities, a charge he consistently denied.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Face Bleak Economic Prospects: Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Australia
would climb above 11 percent and hopes of economic growth of four
percent or more would be dashed as part of the fallout from the
Asian economic crisis, an Australian economic think tank said
today.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research
(NIEIR), one of the first economic think tanks to warn of the
impending danger to Australia from the currency turmoil in
Southeast Asia, revised its forecast to predict an even worse
scenario for the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
Peter Brain, NIEIR executive director, predicted one percent
would be lopped off economic growth for this financial year (July
of 1997 to June of 1998), with at least 60,000 jobs lost in
Australia because of the Asia crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia's current jobless rate stands at about eight percent.
</P>
<P>
While one percent would be cut from this financial year's
economic growth predictions, the think tank anticipated the full
impact of the Asian economic crisis would begin around 1999 as
some of Australia's major trading partners in northern Asia
suffered a "severe growth correction".
</P>
<P>
"The Asian economic crisis will continue to seriously undermine
Australia's net trade performance over the next three years," Dr
Brain said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Asia buys about 40 billion US dollars worth of Australian goods
and services each year, around 60 percent of everything Australia
sells to the world, and Southeast Asia's annual purchase of eight
billion US dollars worth of Australian agricultural and mineral
products alone accounts for about 15 percent of Australia's total
export figure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Australia's export to the region will be affected
by the devaluation of local currencies and cuts in the region's
government spending.
</P>
<P>
Dr Brain suggested the Australian government could be forced to
increase the budget surplus through increased taxes and spending
cuts as part of its tax reform initiatives, in a bid to minimize
the size of interest rate rises required to address the current
account deficit blow out.
</P>
<P>
The think tank revised forecasts came ahead of an expected
downgrading of Australian economic growth by the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The OECD has already confirmed it planned to lower forecasts
for 1997 economic growth in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and
South Korea, in part because of Asia's economic crisis, but is yet
to publish the exact size of the revision.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Wheat Arrive in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 tonnes of Syrian
wheat worth 5 million U.S. dollars has reached Iraq within the first
phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first shipment of wheat from Syria under a
contract signed between the two countries for the purchase of
25,000 tonnes of Syrian wheat.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the imported wheat were reshipped from
Syrian ports to Iraq immediately after their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi-Syrian relations, severed in early 1980's because of
Syria's support for Iran in the Iraqi-Iranian war from 1980 to 1988,
have been improved since May.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reopened the border in June and Iraq has
signed a number of agreements with Syria for the purchase of
Syrian products within the framework of the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal which was launched in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil
over a renewed six month period to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for the Iraqi people suffering under the
seven-year-old U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Saleh has recently
expressed his country's worry about the cancellation of the
oil-for-food deal as a result of the present crisis between Iraq
and the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraqi mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by an Iraqi decision to expel
American members of the U.N. weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Three U.N. envoys began their diplomatic mission in Iraq today
to try to solve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Unemployment Getting Worse: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
unemployment problem is getting worse with job losses continuing
unabated in spite of solid economic growth in some sectors,
Central Statistical Service (CSS) figures released Tuesday
showed.
</P>
<P>
Employment has shrunk 1.5 percent since June last year, taking
the total number of people employed in the formal economy to
fewer than 5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
One of the sectors hit hardest was manufacturing, the largest
provider of employment in South Africa. The number of jobs in the
sector declined almost 2 percent in the second quarter from the
first quarter, bringing the decline from June last year to almost
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs in the non-farm economy also fell by 25,072
or 0.5 percent between the first and second quarters of the year.
</P>
<P>
The fall in employment is a slap in the face of the
government's macro-economic growth, employment and redistribution
(Gear) strategy, which projected 252,000 new jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
Government officials admitted Gear's job targets were
unrealistic, but said the CSS figures did not reflect the true
picture.
</P>
<P>
They said the data did not measure growth in the informal
sector and under-counted the services sector. But economists said
the situation is worrying even there is some under-counting.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President OK's Five Ministers' Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today accepted the resignation of five cabinet ministers
that come from the coalition partner center-right Democratic Party
(DIKO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Presidential Palace where the five ministers
handed in their resignations, Clerides said he was pleased with
the cooperation he has had with them.
</P>
<P>
The five are ministers of defense; interior; agriculture,
natural resources and environment; commerce, industry and tourism;
and labour and social insurance.
</P>
<P>
They offered to resign following the coalition partner DIKO's
Tuesday decision to pull out of the government in view of next
February's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
However, Spyros Kyprianou, president of the DIKO, did not make
explicit the reasons for the withdrawal of his party from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou has decided to run for the presidency in the upcoming
presidential election. He had threatened that if President
Clerides decides to seek re-election, his party will withdraw from
the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the cabinet, in its present composition, will
meet Friday and, if necessary, again on Monday to sort out pending
issues.
</P>
<P>
New cabinet members are expected to be appointed next week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was disappointed by DIKO's decision to quit its
coalition with the ruling Democratic Rally Party (DISY), the
president said "I respect party decisions whether I agree with
them or not."
</P>
<P>
Clerides, founder of the ruling DISY, was elected president of
Cyprus in February 1993 with the support of the DIKO, which has
the five ministers in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that he would announce his final decision on
whether he will seek re-election on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Kyprianou, who served as president of Cyprus from 1977-88,
said he was certain that Clerides would run again.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou has put forward his own candidacy in the hope that
Clerides might stand down and give his support, along with that
of DISY.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth to Conduct Study on Money Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth announced
today it would be conducting a study in pursuit of a solution to
the instability in the international financial and capital
markets with a view to cushioning developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaouku told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the study was expected to be undertaken
by a team of experts within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We should be having the results by early next year, and we
shall present them to governments, the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank," said Anyaouku, who was on a stop-over
in Harare en route from Lesotho to Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Destabilization and speculation of currencies, which was high
on the agenda of the group of 15 developing countries when they
met this week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, threatened the
sustainability of growing economies.
</P>
<P>
The trend which reached a climax recently with the wiping off
of millions of dollars on a number of money markets and affected
many stock exchanges caused deliberate devaluation of currency by
traders.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to study ways on how developing countries can be
protected against volatility of currency surges and adverse
impact of speculation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The study would look into the movement of short-term capital
between countries.
</P>
<P>
He said a Commonwealth business council was soon to be
commissioned to explore ways of redressing existing imbalances
between the developed and developing countries in the area of
investment flow.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief added that the council would attempt to
mobilise investment to the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that developing countries also needed to increase
investment among themselves.

LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Katele
Kalumba today called for enhanced medical cooperation between his
country and China.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while meeting a Chinese medical delegation
led by Zhang Fenglou, senior advisor of the Chinese Health
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba called for joint medical research with China,
especially on the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases,
as well as cooperation in pharmaceutical production and trade.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged Chinese doctors to train their Zambian
counterparts on medical skills, such as to run acupuncture
training courses in his country to train Zambian doctors as well
as those from neighboring countries like Malawi, Botswana and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia wants to learn from China's experience on how to
strengthen community-based medical care, he said, adding that
health care is vital for economic development and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba praised the Chinese doctors working in Zambia for
their skills and manners in treating Zambian patients.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said his visit in the country is to seek ways of
promoting bilateral medical cooperation and solve the problems
facing the Chinese doctors to make them serve Zambians better.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government dispatched a medical team of about 25
doctors to Zambia every two years beginning from 1978. Each team
works in the country for two years.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Ready to Reform Health Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A task force has been set up
in Kenya with a mission to review outdated public health laws and
to create sustainable and cost effective health services for
Kenyan people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar held here recently, S.K. Mailu, Head of
the Health Sector Reform Secretariat, said that the task force
would review 18 acts of the Kenya Constitution which are seen to
be grossly interfering with the delivery of quality health to the
public.
</P>
<P>
He told the seminar on better health in Kenya that the roles
and functions of the Ministry of Health would also be reviewed at
the headquarters, district and peripheral levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the medical official, the health sector has faced
an imminent collapse unless the reforms are introduced into the
sector to ensure that it is able to meet the growing demands of
the population.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government intends to decentralize its
participation in the sector and to play the role of an overseer
and regulator.
</P>
<P>
Mailu announced that as part of its reform, his ministry had
formed a health inspectorate which will oversee the smooth
operations of both public and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also set up a standard and regulatory
department which will define the standards and quality needed in
the provision of health care in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will maintain its primary responsibility
of national health policy formulation and strategic planning,
monitoring, provision of resources and management, Mailu noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Mulinge said Tuesday that his
ministry would establish an autonomous body to handle all drugs
procurement in the country as part of the on-going health sector
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Kenyan government was committed to
reforms in the health sector in a bid to improve delivery of
quality health services to the public.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Presents 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Finance
Minister G.L. Peiris this afternoon presented the ruling People's
Alliance government's budget bill for the fiscal year 1998 to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government anticipates a total revenue of 214.7
billion Rupees (3.58 billion U.S. dollars) as against a total
expenditure of 327.7 billion Rupees (5.5 billion dollars) in 1998,
leaving a budget deficit of 113.0 billion Rupees (1.90 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A sum of 45 billion Rupees (763 million dollars) will be spent
on defense, accounting for 13.7 percent of the total expenditure
next year, according to the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said the government is planning to reduce the budget
deficit to 6.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998 and
move towards a lower deficit of around 4 percent of GDP by the
year 2000. This year's deficit is projected to be 7.6 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the budget concentrates on the relief to
small and medium industrialists to help develop the industrial
sector and to those involved in self employment, and focuses on
restoring investor confidence weeks after the October 15 bombing
in downtown Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposes to reduce corporate income tax in respect
of agriculture, fisheries, livestock and tourism to 15 percent
from April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Taxation on income from the above activities will also be
reduced to a maximum of 15 percent in order to provide benefits to
small and medium individual investors.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget will aim at promoting the sectors of research
and development, agriculture, tourism, gem and jewelry and
textiles, which are considered to have potentials for rapid
economic expansion and generation of employment and income.
</P>
<P>
The budget also introduces a plan for local industries to
operate under a lower rate of customs duty in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizers, agro-chemicals, certain kinds of farming
equipment, capital goods including medical and dental equipment
and accessories will be made duty free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, computers, software and related components,
telecommunications equipment and accessories and some other
imported items will also be exempted from customs duty.
</P>
<P>
Peiris, who is also in charge of justice, constitutional and
ethnic affairs and national integration, said in his budget speech
that the economy is on the path to a 6 percent annual growth and
long-term investments have gathered momentum.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government's primary objective in
formulating the budget is to further strengthen the favorable
trends and to accelerate economic development.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the budget focuses on creating an
overall incentive structure conducive to sustaining buoyant
activities in agriculture, industry and a wide range of services.

<HEADLINE> UN Launches Anti-AIDS Drug Access Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launched today an initiative to increase
access to HIV/AIDS drugs in four developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the "UNAIDS HIV Drug Access Initiative", the four
developing countries of Chile, Cote d'Ivoire, Uganda and Vietnam
in the pilot phase will work to adapt their health infrastructures
to ensure effective distribution and use of the HIV/AIDS-related
drugs, and participating pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies
will subsidize purchases of these drugs, UNAIDS said in a press
release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAIDS, over 20 million people living with
HIV/AIDS now live in developing countries, where resources are
severely limited. While potent drugs to control HIV infection and
new sophisticated drugs to treat and prevent AIDS-related
illnesses are helping to improve lives in the industrialized
world, the gap in access to medical care continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
Multiple barriers block wider access to HIV/AIDS-related drugs,
UNAIDS stated. These include insufficient health care structures,
the increasing complexity of HIV management and care at different
levels, as well as distribution channels, laboratory facilities
and health center technology, costs of treatments, medical
training to support complex regiments, and administrative delays.
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to provide developing countries with
proven strategies to improve care and increase access to the
newest and most effective drugs," said Dr Peter Piot, Executive
Director of UNAIDS.

<HEADLINE> US Jets to Resume Sorties over Iraq Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Head of the U.N. special
commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq Richard Butler has said the
U.S. reconnaissance sorties over Iraq, which suspended as of
today, will be resumed Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement distributed by the U.N. Information
Bureau in Cairo, Bulter said the decision to halt the sorties,
which came in response to a request by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, coincided with the arrival of the U.N. three-men mission in
Baghdad to persuade Iraq to reconsider the decision to prevent
American nationals from participating in missions by the U.N.
inspection committee in Iraq, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will inform the Iraqi authorities of his
decision to resume U.S. sorties over Iraq in the wake of the
current U.N. mission in Baghdad, pointing out that the decision
concerning the sorties is the committee's direct responsibility and
not Iraq's.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation will convey to the Iraqi authorities the
U.N. Security Council message which stipulates the need to continue
activities of the U.N. Committee on Scrapping Iraqi Weapons of Mass
Destruction (UNSCOM) unconditionally, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will return to New York at the weekend and
report on Monday to the Security Council. Iraq has decided to
extend the expulsion of Americans working in the UNSCOM until the
end of debate by the Council.
</P>
<P>
In its latest showdown with the U.S., Iraq has blamed the
American inspectors for the slow progress of arms inspections and
on Tuesday again barred Americans from U.N. arms inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM canceled inspections on Monday, after Iraq barred
inspectors from entering a site.
</P>
<P>
The Special Commission was set up after the 1991 Gulf War to
rid Iraq of chemical, biological and ballistic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Wide-ranging sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its August
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be eased until UNSCOM has certified
that all weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided not to impose a ban on tobacco sponsorship of Formula One
motor racing, local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government would instead press the
sport's governing body to introduce a voluntary code to reduce the
level of advertising at racetracks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Frank Dobson announced in June that the
government would ban all sports sponsorship by tobacco companies
without exception as part of the drive to reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
However, the Prime Minister's office said today that Formula
One was a "truly global sport" and organizers would find it hard
to find alternative sponsors.
</P>
<P>
It added that the advertising level for Formula One would be
regulated, and the exemption would not be extended to sports such
as snooker or horse racing.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Formula One organizers had threatened to move
from Europe if there was a ban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Health Department said, "We think tobacco
sponsorship can be phased out in other sports over a period, but
it just won't work with Formula One."

<HEADLINE> Sudan's President Leaves for Lome Convention Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omer
Al-Bashir left here this morning for the Gabonese capital
Libreville to participate in the three-day Lome Convention summit
due to open today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir will make a speech at the summit on Sudan's position
on the Lome Convention, namely, Sudan's opposition to linking
economic assistance with political preconditions. He will argue
that international cooperation should be based on equality, mutual
interest and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention was first signed in 1975 by 46 developing
countries in African, Caribbean and Pacific regions and nine
European Economic Community (EEC) member states and became
effective on April 1, 1976.
</P>
<P>
It gave industrial and agricultural products of those
developing countries free access to the markets of the EEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention has since been renewed and enlarged to include
more developing countries. It offered to provide EEC funds to help
financial projects in those developing countries through grants
and loans from the European Investment Bank and from the European
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which joined the convention in 1975, has obtained some 1
billion U.S. dollars in loans from the EEC on projects of food
production, rural development and aids to foreign refugees in
various parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Reaches Record Levels in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Both the number and rate of
abortions in Canada reached record levels in 1995, Statistics
Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the rise of 0.4 percent in the number of abortions
presented the smallest increase since Canada's Supreme Court
struck down the nation's abortion law in 1988, the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Canadian women obtained 106,658 abortions, up 0.4
percent from that of 1994. This was well below the 1.8 percent
rise in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The national rate increased slightly to 28.2 abortions per 100
live births from 27.6 in 1994. Part of the rise in the abortion
rate is due to a decrease in the number of live births in 1995
compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that single women and those in their mid-20s
accounted for most hospital abortions in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the proportion of abortions in Canada
has increased for women who had at least one prior delivery, at
least one prior abortion, or been pregnant less than 13 weeks, the
agency said.

northeast region from both government army and the forces of
former rebel movement the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Therefore, U.N. observers and the observer countries of the
United States, Russia and Portugal urged the two sides to stop
immediately actions obstructing their mission.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of disbanding the remaining UNITA forces, the
joint commission believed that the number of demobilized fighters
was quite small, for only 5,344 UNITA militiamen were registered
while the number of remaining forces announced by UNITA had been
7,311.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission hoped that UNITA would undertake actively
the work of re-establishing national authority in its occupied
areas.
</P>
<P>
The commission meeting on the implementation of Lusaka Peace
Accord was the first plenary session since U.N. declared
sanctions on UNITA on October 29.

<HEADLINE> Dick Spring Resigns As Irish Labor Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's former deputy prime
minister and foreign minister Dick Spring announced in Dublin
today that he would step down as leader of the country's third
largest political Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Spring, who has been the leader of the Irish Labor Party for 15
years, told a meeting of Labor parliamentarians that he would
tender his resignation, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"I have to advise the parliamentary party, with regret, that I
have decided to resign as leader of the Party," Spring said,
adding the best memories of his time in office centered on
mediating the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Spring, one of the longest serving political leaders in Europe,
gained international recognition during Ireland's six-month
European Union (EU) presidency by acting as chairman of the EU
Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party suffered a crashing defeat at the country's
general election last June and Spring had since been under
increasing pressure to stand down.

<HEADLINE> Irish Exporters Suffer from French Truckers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Exporters' Association
(IEA) announced in Dublin today that about 10 million Irish pounds
(about 15 million U.S. dollars) of exports per day were severely
affected by the wide-spread French drivers' blockade.
</P>
<P>
IEA chief Colum MacDonnell was quoted by reports from Dublin as
urging for a radical shakeup of European transport to avoid such
incidents.
</P>
<P>
MacDonnell noted that perishable exports such as meat, fish and
dairy products, which accounted for an estimated 1.5 million Irish
pounds per day (about 2.3 million dollars), would be lost for
good.
</P>
<P>
"That is lost definitively. What they do not eat today they are
not going to eat tomorrow," he said. "If it goes on for a week
there will be 70 million pounds (about 105 million dollars)
postponed or distorted."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ireland's pharmaceutical, chemical and
computer companies, many of which are simply assembly plants that
rely on the delivery of components, had been hard hit by the
blockade in France.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran Confronts US Government, Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated today that Iran is confronting with
the U.S. government, not the American nation or any other nations.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the remark when addressing a group of students to
mark "Student Day" of November 4, the anniversary of the takeover
of the U.S. embassy by Iranian students in Tehran in 1979 right
after the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader reiterated that Iran would not resume
relations with the United States, saying that this policy was in
full agreement with the Iranian national interests.
</P>
<P>
Establishing links or negotiating with Washington would solve
none of the problems facing a nation who wants to resist the
U.S. hegemonism, Khamenei said, terming the U.S. as "international
dictator" and "symbol of world arrogance."
</P>
<P>
The key to successfully confront the U.S. or any other arrogant
power is reliance on spiritual strength and persistent resistance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei noted that the U.S. intervention in various global
issues was in line with the interests of cartels and big
capitalists in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Accusing Washington of adopting an antagonistic policy against
the Iranian government, particularly the U.S. economic sanctions,
the Iranian leader said, the U.S. is angry with the Iranian
nation for its anti-arrogance campaign, a desire for independence
and control over its own destiny.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is trying to make Iran change its stance on
the Palestinian issue and officially recognize the Israeli regime
and further welcome presence of the U.S. in various parts of
the world, he specified.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei stressed, a nation who believes in Islam,
would never submit to the tyranny and bullying by any
country, especially by a country such as the U.S. with a
history of hostility against it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Increase for Fourth Consecutive Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. factory orders for
chemical and metal products in September increased for the fourth
consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Orders rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
336.5 billion U.S. dollars after a large 1.2 percent advance in
August, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The month's orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items such
as autos and computers -- inched up just 0.1 percent. Still, that
was considerably better than an earlier estimate of a 0.6 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods jumped 0.8 percent, led by
chemicals and chemical products. All non-durable goods industries
reported increases except for petroleum and coal products and
food.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders were strongest for primary metals such as
steel, up 4.2 percent. Stone, clay and glass product orders rose 4
percent; instruments such as medical, measuring and navigation
devices and cameras, 3.6 percent; fabricated metals products, 2.7
percent, and industrial machinery, 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for electronic equipment declined by 7.6
percent, after soaring 29.4 percent in August. Transportation
equipment orders fell 1.2 percent, pulled down by drops in
aircraft and autos.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, a measure of current production,
rose 1.6 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 335.3
billion dollars following a 0.8 percent drop in August, mainly
blamed to the United Parcel Service strike.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shipment increase, the backlog of unfilled orders
rose a modest 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted 528.2 billion
dollars following a 0.9 percent increase in August. Too rapid a
rise in unfilled orders is an inflation warning signal because it
implies factories are having problems keeping up with demand.
</P>
<P>
Factory inventories, up for the ninth consecutive month, also
rose 0.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted 449.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against Turkish Provocations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has protested to the
United Nations about the recent Turkish military provocations in
the northern part of this eastern Mediterranean island, Cyprus
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus made the protest in a letter which was sent to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by Ambassador Sotos Zakheos,
Cypriot Permanent Representative to the U.N., the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot diplomat said that the Turkish "new provocative
actions", such as the strengthening of the Turkish forces on the
occupying part of the island, the recent Turkish warplanes'
violations of Cyprus' airspace and the illegal mooring of Turkish
battleships in the closed ports of Famagusta and Kyrenia increased
tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
These actions, Zakheos said, violated the sovereignty and
integrity of Cyprus as well as international law, the
U.N. Charter and the Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military provocations took place during the
current two maneuvers launched Saturday and Monday by Turkey's
armed forces in collaboration with the Turkish Cypriot regime in
the Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently in response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises in
the Greek Cypriot-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took
over the northern third of the island following a short-lived
Greek Cypriot coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only by
Turkey, which maintains a 35,000-strong troops on the island.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Increase Overseas Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain today pledged a steady
increase in foreign aid spending from 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a policy White Paper which puts new emphasis on sustainable
development and elimination of poverty, International Development
Secretary Clare Short said the move reflected both a moral duty to
reach out to the poor and enlightened self-interest.
</P>
<P>
Britain's current 2.3 billion pound (3.9 billion U.S. dollars)
aid budget represents just 0.27 percent of national income,
compared with the official United Nations target for developed
countries of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said the government was "committed to reversing
the decline in the British development assistance budget" and to
the U.N. target.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed Britain's commitment to halving the number
of people living in extreme poverty and achieving universal
primary education by 2015.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of international development can only be resolved
if there is the political will to address them in both poorer and
richer countries," the White Paper said.

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan's Friend Worthy of Trust: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China is a friend of Pakistan
worthy of trust, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said
today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks here this evening at a
welcoming dinner hosted by him in honor of the Chinese delegation
headed by Chen Muhua, special envoy of China and deputy
chairperson of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan said Pakistan and China enjoy a special friendly
relationship which has stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
In the last 50 years since the inception of Pakistan, China has
always stood side by side with Pakistan, especially in those
difficult times, he noted. "China is a friend of Pakistan worthy
of trust," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Pakistani people are very
happy to welcome Chen who is here in the capacity of the special
envoy on the occasion of Pakistan's Golden Jubilee celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Chen said on the occasion the road that Pakistan has traversed
since its independence has been extraordinary and glorious, as
evidenced by the tremendous changes in the face of the country.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her believe that "under the leadership of the
Pakistani government, the Pakistani people of various ethnic
groups will take the 50th anniversary as a fresh start upon which
to build an even better future with concerted efforts."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached importance to and
treasured the special traditional friendship between the two
countries, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government takes the consolidation and
strengthening of the good-neighborly, friendly and mutually
beneficial cooperation between us as its unshakable policy, rather
than a mere expedient," she added.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her believe that with joint efforts of the two
governments and peoples, the friendly relations between China and
Pakistan will enjoy durable and steady growth, and an all-round
cooperative partnership oriented towards the 21st century will
certainly become reality.
</P>
<P>
Attending the welcoming dinner this evening were also Deputy
Speaker of the National Assembly Jaffer Iqbal, Minister of State
for Woman Development and Social Welfare Tehmeena Daultana,
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain and other high-ranking
government officials as well as officials from the All Pak-China
Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Chen and her entourage arrived here today at the invitation of
the Pakistani government. The Chinese delegation will stay in
Pakistan until November 10. Besides the capital city of Islamabad,
they will also visit Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, and
the southern port city of Karachi.

<HEADLINE> WB Approves Credit for Pak National Drainage Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
285 million U.S. dollars for Pakistan's National Drainage Program
(NDP) which supports the implementation of major reforms in water
sector and finances urgently-needed investment in irrigation and
drainage.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the credit approved by the World
Bank will help activate a combined financing package of 785
million dollars from the Pakistani government, the Asian
Development Bank and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the credit for the NDP project would also help
promote research to strengthen Pakistan's technical knowledge base
on irrigation and drainage.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Indus Basic Irrigation System is the lifeblood of
its agriculture and the largest integrated irrigation network in
the world, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent or 17 million hectares of Pakistan's cultivated
area is irrigated, said the sources, adding the irrigated
agriculture accounts for more than 90 percent of agricultural
output and 22 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The sources said lack of an effective drainage system to combat
the twin menace of waterlogging and salinity is a principal threat
to the survival of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In response to the crisis, the NDP project is designed to
develop a network to drain saline effluent safely to the sea and
thereby restore environmentally-sound irrigated agriculture in
Pakistan, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Auto Giants Beef up Presence in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite currency crisis in
Southeast Asia, automakers of the United States and Japan did not
lose heart in the region, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor is going to open its new factory in Vietnam on
Thursday and is expected to open more new assembly plants in other
parts of Southeast Asia, along with General Motors, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
None of U.S. and Japanese automakers have closed a factory or
canceled expansion plans, the paper said, with a graphic showing
that even in Thailand, where the currency storm originated, G.M.
and Chrysler are to open their plants in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
G.M., which has opened 23 factories in East Asia and Southeast
Asia since 1992, aims at catching a market share of ten percent in
Asia Pacific by 2005, while Ford has projected to gain the same
size of market share within ten years.
</P>
<P>
Though some analysts see the move as unreasonable in view of
the impact of the currency crisis, the automakers think that the
impact is a short-term one.
</P>
<P>
"When the currencies settle down, as they will, I think they
may have a greater competitive advantage," Ford chairman and chief
executive Alexander J. Trotman was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Election Sees Lowest Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- As the final result of Jordan's
parliamentary election poured out today, it became known that
there had been the lowest turnout in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency Petra, only 54.4 percent
of about 1.4 million eligible voters cast their ballots Tuesday,
compared with 68 percent in 1993, and 62 percent in 1989 when
Jordanians were for the first time allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
Of the 80 elected members of the Lower House, 68 are for and 12
are against the government. Among the anti-government members, six
are independent Islamists, two are from a major Islamic opposition
party and the rest four from leftist opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has expressed satisfaction with the voting process,
which they said had a high degree of fairness and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Local reports attributed the low participation rate partly to a
 common sentiment among the people that focused on their own
living rather than political activity during a time of "economic
recession" which began earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
And some reports insisted that widespread accusation of
election fraud froze people's desire to vote.
</P>
<P>
The election was also disturbed by the boycott of the Muslim
Brotherhood and a few opposition parties which rejected the 1994
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty and amendments to the Press and
Publication Law introduced in May to further drown opposition
voices.
</P>
<P>
The boycott decreased the number of candidates for this
year's election to 521, compared with 559 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Parliament contains the Upper House and the
Lower House. All the 40 Upper House members are appointed by King
Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Panel Appointed to Clear Air on Rabin's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today
appointed a special committee to determine whether to publicize
classified materials on investigations of the murder of former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to clear conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
The order to set up the panel was given by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on the occasion of the second anniversary of
Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which comprises Netanyahu's legal advisers and
judicial officials from the State Attorney's Office, will review
a report compiled by the Shamgar Committee which was in charge of
investigating the killing of Rabin on November 4, 1995, by a
radical Jew named Yigal Amir.
</P>
<P>
It's creation was due to the feverish resurgency of the
theories which alleged that there was a conspiracy behind Rabin's
death, which involved the secret General Security Service (GSS)
and Rabin's successor, former Labor Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to reveal a secret section in the Shamgar
Committee report so to clear the air over Rabin's killing.
</P>
<P>
The Shamgar Committee, named after its head, former Supreme
Court President Meir Shamgar, concluded in its final report that
there was no basis for the conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
In its secret section, the report dealt with the role played by
GSS agent Avishai Raviv, who also headed an ultra-rightist group
and was a close friend of Rabin's assassin Yigal Amir, who is now
serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
Raviv's position as a GSS agent and his activities in launching
the anti-Rabin inciting campaign aroused suspicion that the GSS
was involved in killing Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a report published this week by the religious
newspaper Hatzofeh put up another conspiracy theory over Rabin's
murder. It claimed that Rabin himself knew of a plot against him
and ordered the bullets changed to blanks, but then Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres authorized a deal with a senior GSS officer
to retain the live bullets in return for appointing him as head of
the service.
</P>
<P>
Most politicians reacted quickly to the conspiracy theories,
denying there was anything to support such claims which will
only hurt the security services and further damage the nation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, widely blamed for partially responsible for the
incitement campaign that led to Rabin's killing, rejected Tuesday
the Hatzofeh report as "rubbish." Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi
denounced those who spread the conspiracy theories as equals to
those who denied the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy theories were the central topic of the heated
debate in today's Knesset (Parliament), as the ruling and
opposition camps traded accusations over Rabin's commemoration and
the leftist demonstrations against the current government.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein said he would review the
files on Raviv to decide whether to bring him to trial for his
active role in organizing the inciting campaign against Rabin,
during which Rabin was depicted as a traitor and a Nazi dressed
in the Nazi SS uniform.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebels Demand More at Nairobi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Movement (SPLM) today set a two-year limit for a
referendum on self-determination for south Sudan, possibly
cornering the government at the on-going peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan shall be governed as a confederate union of two states,
namely, the southern state and the northern state," said a SPLM
statement.
</P>
<P>
SPLM is the political wing of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
The organization repeated demands for a separation of religion
from the state, repeal of Muslim Sharia law and political
pluralism.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohamed Taha requested
Monday the interim suspend of talks to consider the new request
by the rebels, local sources said. The talks were believed to
re-start on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The high-level peace negotiations, the first since 1994,
actually resumed last Friday under the auspices of the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD), embracing
Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Uganda and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
During an IGAD summit here in July, the Sudanese government
accepted the Declaration of Principles drafted by IGAD leaders in
1994 as the basis for peace talks, making it possible to re-start
the IGAD mediation for ending 14-year war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The document favors the right of self-determination for the
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and
made tens of thousands displaced since 1983 when the SPLA rose to
fight against the Islamic-backed Khartoum government for a
secular state and more autonomy in the Christian-dominated south.

<HEADLINE> BP's Asian Plan Based On Long View, Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) - Oil giant British
Petroleum (BP) is pressing ahead with big Asian projects
despite recent financial turbulence in the area.
</P>
<P>
Its 200 million pounds (320 million U.S. dollars) to 250
million pounds (500 million U.S. dollars) investment plan in
China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore will "rise over
time", reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe the market situation will materially
change our projections," said chief executive John Browne.
"We expect world-wide demand for oil to continue to grow
at 2 percent."
</P>
<P>
"Growth is still taking place," Browne said. China,
BP's main target, "looks to be on a steady growth pattern",
he added.
</P>
<P>
Asia has too many refineries and BP's profits in the
area are being hit. But Browne said that he took the long
view.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, BP is already close to meeting the
financial goals it set for the year 2000, so it will
unveil a new set of its performance targets.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi is due in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Saturday to start a
tour of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, Iranian Ambassador
in Saudi Arabia Mohammad Reza Nouri said today.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying in Saudi
capital Riyadh that Kharrazi would carry two messages to Saudi
King Fahd and Deputy Prime Minister Prince Abdallah Ben Abdel
Aziz from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that Kharrazi would review with King Fahd and Prince
Abdallah a number of issues that aim at consolidating relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that strategy of the Iranian new government of
President Khatami who took office early August is to develop good
neighborly relations on all spheres with the GCC states and in
particular with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a political, economic and defense regional organization
established in 1982, groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said his country was convinced that the elimination of
tension from the Gulf region was possible once mutual confidence
was established between GCC and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said Iranian President Khatami was determined to remove
all causes of tension between Iran and the GCC and turn a
new page in their relations.
</P>
<P>
The visit would be a new sign of improvement of bilateral ties
between Iran and the Gulf Arab states whose cooperation is seen
as vital for stability in a region that boasts of two thirds of
the world's oil reserves, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian ties with GCC, especially with Saudi Arabia, had often
been tense since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, mainly over
GCC's support to Iraq during Iran-Iraq war, the presence of
Western forces in the Gulf countries and Tehran's military build-up.
</P>
<P>
But relations were warming up since the start of this
year, especially after the new moderate President Khatami took
office in August.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Report on Primakov's Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Lebanon
Oleg Perassypkine today denied that Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov had said Israel would launch a major military operation
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after meeting with Secretary General
of Lebanese Foreign Minitry Safiel Hasan today.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Primakov had told Jordanian officials
during his Middle East tour last month that the possibility of
Israeli military operation against anti-Israeli military group
Hezbollah always remains.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Jordanian officials couldn't properly understand the
foreign minister and put some change into his remarks," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia believes that the danger posed by Israelis
exists, but it has no information about any major operation or
preparations to be launched by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Jordan, Primakov was quoted by an unnamed
Jordanian official as saying that the situation in south Lebanon
was expected to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Primakov said he had information about preparations by
the Israeli army for a major operation against Hezbollah," the
official told the press.
</P>
<P>
This remark, filed by the French news agency AFP and published
by most newspapers, caused a panic across Lebanon. The Shiite
Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to
end Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.

LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) - MARKS &AMP; SPENCER, Britain's
biggest retailer, today unveiled plans to take on 5,000 more staff
as it challenges supermarket giants to become Britain's top food
retailer.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it intends to increase retail space by 33
percent as it rolls out three of its most successful formats: town
center department stores, edge-of-town superstores and smaller
food stores.

billion pounds (2.24 billion U.S. dollars) by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Richard Greenbury, the company's chairman, said that his
company would maintain its product balance of clothing, food and
house-hold products without targeting any one area for particular
expansion.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qatar Calls for Restraint in UN-Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Qatar today urged all sides
involved in the U.N.-Iraqi crisis to exercise restraint until the
dispute is defused "diplomatically," the Qatari News Agency (QNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was sparked by Baghdad's threat last Wednesday to
expel three Americans working with the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly meeting held in capital Doha, the Qatari Cabinet
called upon all sides involved in the U.N.-Iraqi crisis on
missions of UNSCOM to exercise restraint and cooperation, the QNA
said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also expressed its hope of "solving the crisis
diplomatically to reach a settlement enabling Iraq to implement
U.N. Security Council's resolutions and keeping the region away
from a tense atmosphere," it added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants to drive the U.S. inspectors out, blaming Washington
for obstructing the lift of the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the related U.N. resolutions, the embargo will not be
lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Iraq agreed to suspend its expulsion order and
called for dialogue with the U.N..

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that he is sure that Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's visit to China will strengthen bilateral relations of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the foreign minister as saying
that the main aim of the president's visit is to develop relations
with China that would become trustworthy and strategically
directed at cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Yeltsin's visit will also give a powerful
impetus to vigorous development of economic relations with China,
which are not adequate yet to the entire potential the two nations
have.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent visit by the Chinese leader Jiang Zemin
to the United States, Primakov said, "this does not run counter to
our interests whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Russian Parliament Upper House Yegor Stroyev
said the importance and goals of the forthcoming visit of the
Russian President to China should be estimated. He described China
as "our eternal neighbor."
</P>
<P>
Noting the fact that the Russian border with China stretches
for more than 7,000 kilometres, Stroyev stressed that "it is
necessary to be a wise politician and to maintain all-round
relations with China with prospects for the future."
</P>
<P>
Russian Minister of the Nuclear Power Viktor Mikhailov, who
will accompany Yeltsin on the visit to China, said various aspects
of Russian-Chinese cooperation in nuclear power will possibly be
discussed when the Russian President visits China.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the signing of the contract for construction
of the Lianyungang nuclear power station will be quite possible.
According to him, the preparatory work for the conclusion of this
contract has been done for several years and has now virtually
been completed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention Oil Spills Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100,000 kilograms
of cooking oil is spilling out of jerrycans stockpiled in the
central store in Nazret, about 90 kms south-east of Addis Ababa,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tafesse Yeshitila, representative of the office of the Nazret
Food Security Reserve, was quoted as saying that the spill over
was caused by the melting of jerrycans due to intense
temperature.
</P>
<P>
The oil was owned by the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission of Ethiopia (DPPCE).
</P>
<P>
Tafesse said although the office had repeatedly requested the
DPPCE to take back the oil in three months, but it had failed to
do so.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the spill over, efforts are underway to fill 23
jerrycans of oil into barrels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted the team leader of public relations of
the commission as saying that the store keeper is to blame and
will take the responsibility for the damage.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the central store who declined to be named were
quoted as saying that the edible oil which has been stored for
more than one year, should have been distributed to the needy in
time.
</P>
<P>
The wrong arrangement of the jerrycans in the store is the
major factor for the damage, the employees said.

ANKARA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish colonel was killed
today during a military drill, code-named "Toros-2/97", which is
going on in and near northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Vural Berkay was shot in his chest by a ricocheting
bullet during the exercises, which were launched on Monday,
according to a report from Turkish private television Kanal D
tonight.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to a military hospital in northern Cyprus for
treatment after being shot, but died at 19:00 local time (17:00
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Before the "Toros-2/97", Turkey staged another military
exercise, code-named "Determination' 97", on November 1.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently in response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriot's maneuvers in the Greek
Cypriot-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Greece have been worsening since
the Cypriot government announced that it would not give up the
controversial plan to buy the Russian-made 150-kilometer-range
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took
over the northern third of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus
following a short-lived pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey maintains a 35,000-strong troops on the
island.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Tries to Stop Gas Flaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria took a solid step today
towards stopping gas flaring at its many oil fields, with the
official inauguration of a 550 million U.S. Dollar gas project.
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah Useni, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory
attended the official ceremony held in Escravos, Delta State, on
behalf of the head of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Escravos Gas Project is a joint venture between the
Chevron Nigeria Limited and its local partner, the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the gathering of associated gas from two
fields in the Chevron's operations in Escravos, extracting and
exporting condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and
supplying dry gas to local industries.
</P>
<P>
According to company document, the project currently processes
165 million cubic feet of gas per day, producing 8,000 barrels of
LPG, 150 million cubic meters of dry gas and 2,000 barrels of
condensate.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project, for which the design work has
started, will bring the daily processing capacity to 285 million
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
The Escravos project, which started in 1992, went into
operation in May this year and exported its first vessel of LPG
to the U.S. in September.
</P>
<P>
Besides reducing gas flaring and thus ensuring a cleaner and
safer environment, the project will also substantially broaden
Nigeria's economic base.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's proven gas preserve is put at more than 3,400
billion cubic meters. Its oil fields are said to be producing 2.2
billion cubic feet of gas, 75 percent of which are being flared
into the air.
</P>
<P>
To meet the government's deadline of stopping gas flaring by
the year 2010, major foreign oil firms operating in Nigeria have
all started their gas utilizing projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year or the first quarter of 1998, Mobil
Producing Nigeria is expected to put into operation a 810 million
dollar liquefied natural gas project, with a daily capacity of
600 million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
After that, there will be the 3.6 billion dollar Nigeria
liquefied natural gas project funded by Shell, Elf and others,
expected to process 7.1 billion cubic meters of gas annually upon
inauguration in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) --The Kenya Association of Food
and Agriculture Journalists (AFAJ) has won the biennial Boerma
Award for its commitment to the coverage of food, agricultural
and environment issues.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here today, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that AFAJ launched a major
campaign to publicize the dangers of water hyacinth in Lake
Victoria and current agricultural problems faced by East Africa.
</P>
<P>
In nominating AFAJ for the award, the FAO office in Nairobi
noted, "It is indeed rare that a journalist association could
mobilize such a campaign and gain support not only nationally but
also from donor governments and international organizations."
</P>
<P>
AFAJ shares this year's award with Inter Press Service (IPS)
which is an independent association of journalists based in Rome,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
IPS won the award for "its significant contribution over the
past thirty years to covering sustainable agriculture and rural
development in more than a hundred countries, filling the
information gap between the North and South".
</P>
<P>
The winners will receive their prizes from FAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf at a special awards ceremony at
FAO Headquarters in Rome on November 7.
</P>
<P>
The Boerma Award was established in 1975 to honor journalists
who focus public attention on world food problems, mainly issues
related to agricultural and rural development in the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The award is named after former FAO Director-General Addeke
Hendrik Boerma from the Netherlands.

OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called on Canada to
free itself from the U.S. "obsession" with the international
embargo against the country, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also called on the Canadian government
to re-establish its diplomatic ties with his country.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq is open to having good relations with

Canada to open its embassy here (in Iraq)."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he appreciated the attitude the Canadian government
took towards Cuba and the American embargo of that country.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have an obsession with Cuba, and they have an
obsession with us. They say they want to change the government in
Iraq, but the government here, as in Cuba, won't change," Aziz was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In breaking the U.N. embargo against Iraq, Canada would show
the same independent resolve it demonstrated against the U.S.
economic blockade against Cuba, Aziz noted.

annual increase rate of 60 to 70 percent, said Shi Guangsheng,
deputy minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two sides in 1996 was more than 1.35 billion
U.S. dollars and could be expected to reach 1.5 billion dollars
this year, he said at the opening ceremony of a demonstration
village of Chinese low-cost light color steel houses.
</P>
<P>
If Hong Kong's trade with South Africa were included, China's
total trade volume with South Africa was more than 3 billion
dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who is leading a massive Chinese trade and economic
delegation, arrived in South Africa today for an 11-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The 100-strong delegation, made up of chief Chinese trade and
economic officials and representatives of some 50 leading Chinese
companies, is the biggest Chinese mission and most important one
ever sent to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is an important investment destination for China,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese commodities are wanted by South Africa and China,
in turn, is in need of South African products, such as minerals,
machinery, mining equipment, among others.
</P>
<P>
The visit of his delegation, which is aimed at enhancing
mutual understanding and exchange of views between the business
circles of the two countries, clearly showed that China attaches
importance to developing trade and economic relations, as well as
investment cooperation, with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg Mayor Isaac Mogase, who visited the demonstration
village, told Shi that he warmly welcomed the Chinese delegation
and that he appreciated efforts to promote trade in the Gauteng
province, where Johannesburg is located.
</P>
<P>
South African people are grateful for China's long-standing
support during the anti-apartheid era, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is proud of South African President Nelson
Mandela's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Housing is a problem facing all South African local
governments, Mogase said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of South Africans were unable to own their own homes
and the Chinese project is surely welcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
On display in the village are several light steel houses
designed by China's steel giant, Baosteel.
</P>
<P>
The houses, which are suitable for simple homes, schools,
clinics and hotels, could be erected in a matter of hours and do
not require digging foundations.
</P>
<P>
The houses has a duration of 50 years and no service is needed
in the first 15 years, Baosteel designers said.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government and
Congress have agreed American troops should stay in Bosnia beyond
next June's deadline, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of talks Tuesday between President Bill Clinton,
top aides and 35 congressional leaders, "a consensus is developing
that there will be or should be some form of U.S. military
presence post-SFOR," the NATO-led Stabilization Force now in
Bosnia, Albright told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Nurses Predicted in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- By the time Canada's baby
boomers are getting old and using hospitals, there will not be
enough nurses to go around, a new study warns.
</P>
<P>
The study, released by the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA),
says that despite layoffs and high unemployment now, there could
be a severe shortage of nurses in the country by 2011.
</P>
<P>
"In this time of health reform, some of the decisions that are
being taken are very shortsighted," said CNA chief executive
officer Mary Ellen.
</P>
<P>
Canada should have a much longer-range vision, which must
include ideas on how to recruit new nurses, she said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the mean age of a Canadian registered nurse is
about 44 years, and enrolement in nursing schools is falling.
</P>
<P>
The combination of an aging workforce and lack of supply of new
recruits could mean a severe shortage in the years to come, the
study says.
</P>
<P>
Depending on demand, Canada could be short of 60,000 nurses; at
worst it will need 113,000 more than it will have.
</P>
<P>
Canada now has 264,000 nurses across the country.
</P>
<P>
Demand for nurses will steadily increase as the country's
population ages, the study predicts.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Adopt Punitive Measures Against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
announced that it will adopt punitive measures against the United
States to revenge its economic sanctions against the country,
Sudan News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement
today, describing the sanctions announced Tuesday by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright as "aggressive and unjust" and as
threats to international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It called on the world community to denounce the U.S. sanctions
on Sudan, saying that the U.S. decision was contradictory to
its alleged encouragement for the peace process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the sanctions at this time, the statement said, the
U.S. meant to weaken the negotiating position of the Sudanese
government with the John Garang faction, a main rebel group in
southern Sudan, as negotiations were effectively taking place in
the town of Karn, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Albright announced Tuesday that the U.S. decided to impose new
and extensive economic sanctions against the Sudanese government
for its continued support for international terrorism, its
attempts to disrupt stability in neighboring countries, and its
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include freezing all Sudanese assets in the
U.S. and barring U.S. investment in Sudan and a ban on bank loans
to Sudan and on all U.S. exports and imports with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that while rejecting the U.S. decision, the
Sudanese government is aware of its negative repercussions on the
peace process in Sudan and in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
It accused the U.S. of aiming at boosting the morale of the
John Garang movement as well as that of the "hostile" neighboring
countries, but the statement failed to name the states.
</P>
<P>
The Garang led Sudan People's Liberation Army and several other
rebel factions have been fighting the Islamic government since
1983 for greater autonomy for the Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has been under U.N. sanctions of air traffic ban for its
failure to surrender the three suspects allegedly involved in the
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1995.

</P>
<P>
Leghari made the remarks when meeting a Chinese delegation led
by Chen Muhua, special envoy of the Chinese government and vice
chairperson of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges to Speed up Higher Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice premier Li Lanqing
has urged that reforms in higher education be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
During a recent inspection tour in southwest China's Sichuan
Province and Chongqing municipality, Li said problems with China's
higher education system are the result of its irrational
structure, which have led to low-level redundant construction
projects and have ended ties between universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
"This is in fact a waste of educational resources and funds and
does nothing to improving teaching quality," said Li, who is also
a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Coomunist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the problems, we must make readjustments including
merging some universities or departments, facilitating exchanges
and cooperation between schools of higher learning," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said central government departments and local governments
should join hands in launching colleges or universities in order
to make the best use of limited funds and human resources and
improve teaching quality.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee, stressed that both
teachers and students should make an effort to improve their
skills.
</P>
<P>
Students of sciences and engineering must learn something about
liberal arts, and students of liberal arts must familiarize
themselves with modern technology.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also advised leading officials of universities
and colleges to safeguard the well-being of teachers and help them
solve practical problems, especially housing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection tour from November 1 to 5, Li visited
factories and villages as well as universities.

order on a more equitable basis.
</P>

will attain to a new height in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates Pakistan's efforts for the settlement

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Damaging UNSCOM Surveillance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf denied that Iraq has damaged on purpose any of the
surveillance cameras belonging to the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
This came in a message forwarded by al-Sahhaf to the
U.N. Security Council president and published by Iraqi News Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
It was an accident that some of the U.N. surveillance cameras
installed at Iraq's Motassem site, a military one, were damaged
Wednesday during a missile engine test, al-Sahhaf explained.
</P>
<P>
The test of the two engines of the unbanned Ababil missiles,
with a range of 50 kilometers, at the Motassem site within a
maintenance plan, was known to the 15th U.N. Surveillance Group
operating in Baghdad Surveillance Center, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
During the test, one of the two engines burst out, causing some
damages to the equipments at the site, including the surveillance
cameras belonging to both Iraq and the UNSCOM, the minister said,
adding that Iraq notified today the 15th Surveillance Group of
this accident in a message.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM had fixed some surveillance cameras on a number of
Iraqi military sites. Iraq is forbidden to possess missiles with a
range exceeding 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said in his message that since it is likely to come
under a military attack by the U.S., Iraq had moved some equipment
liable to military strikes to alternative sites.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq would return those equipment to their former
sites and would invite the U.N. arms inspection teams to see them
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has not prevented the U.N. arms inspection teams, with the
exception of the U.S. members of these teams, from inspecting Iraqi
sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz described today UNSCOM
chief Richard Butler's statement, in which he said that Iraq
moved some military equipment from sites under surveillance, as an
attempt to worsen the situation in Iraq and to mislead both the
U.N. Security Council and world public opinion.

<HEADLINE> China, S. Africa Need More Cooperation: Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China and South Africa,
which are facing a new historical period in terms of bilateral
relations, need to further cooperate, especially in trade and
economic sphere, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, head of a Chinese economic and trade
delegation to South Africa, said the coming normalization of
relations between China and South Africa will pave the way to
deeper and wider development of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who arrived here on Wednesday, made the remarks in a
meeting with Premier of Gauteng Province Tokyo Sexwale.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November
last year that his country would sever "diplomatic ties" with
Taiwan and establish "comprehensive diplomatic relations" with
the People's Republic of China at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shi who is also deputy minister for foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said the peoples of China and South Africa have been
constantly supporting each other in history.
</P>
<P>
Describing Sexwale as "an old friend of China", Shi also
expressed appreciation toward the premier's persistent "one
China" stand.
</P>
<P>
Sexwale said the South African people and himself are paying
close attention to the development in China, and are glad to have
seen great changes taking place in the country.
</P>
<P>
"China's great achievements have made the Western countries to
study and treat China in a more serious way," he said, noting his
province would like to play an active part in promoting bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Describing Mandela's decision to forge official diplomatic
relations with China as a "brave and realistic" move, Sexwale
expressed belief that cooperation between the two countries will
be further promoted after the normalization of bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> What Makes Hydraulic Master Change View on Three Gorges Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pan Jiazheng,
a noted Chinese hydraulic expert, became a man under limelight at
home and overseas as he changed his early-1980s stance of opposing
the Three Gorges project and became a supporter to the giant
hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
Pan, an academician of both the Chinese academies of sciences
and engineering sciences, viewed his attitude in opposition to the
Three Gorges Project in 1986 when it was about to be launched.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the State Council approved a feasibility study on the
hydro-power project in Three Gorges on the basis of
three-decade-long survey, planning, designing and expositions
offered by hundreds of scientists.
</P>
<P>
"Then, three problems worried me most," Pan said. "First, I did
not know what to do with siltation. Secondly, an unprecedented
flow of one million people to be displaced might affect adversely
on social stability and, thirdly, the national strength cannot
bear the tremendous amount of investment involved in the mammoth
project," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The views of Pan and some other hydro-electric, economic and
other experts drew the attention of the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
and the State Council entrusted the Ministry of Water Conservation
to invite more than 400 experts and scholars in different academic
fields to study and appraise again the program on the Three Gorges
Project. Pan, then the chief hydroelectric engineer of the
Ministry of Energy, was appointed deputy head of the program's
leading group and chief of its technology section.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of the central authorities repeatedly called for
relying on the experts and soliciting different opinions," Pan
said in an interview with Xinhua, adding this has given an
adequate proof of their scientific and democratic decision-making
process in the pre-construction preparations.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, the experts and scholars re-checked
all previous research findings and made further studies on the
problems that may occur during the course of construction.
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced of the solutions to those knotty problems
that had been raised as I increased my understanding of the project
during the three years of re-study," he said. "And it was at that
time I started to change my previous approach on the project."
</P>
<P>
Pan delivered a report to the State Council in 1990 on behalf
of the group, in which, he held that the construction of the Three
Gorges was necessary for China's economic growth, feasible in
technology and rational in financially. "It is better to build the
project than not to build it and it is more beneficial to launch
the project earlier than later," he said.

<P>
Moreover, he added, "It is easy to voice disagreement than to
nod in agreement," as a metaphor prevalent among the people of
the hydro-electric circles goes.
</P>
<P>
In Pan's own words, it is easier to find flaws and errors as an
outsider but as a scitist, however, he has to have tremendous
sense of responsibility and courage to support a big project."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he acknowledged that critics of the
project contributed more than its supporters since the repeated
questioning and interrogation of the former were helpful to
clarify every potential error, so that the subsequent improved
blueprint will be still better and more comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
On April 3, 1992, the resolution on the Three Gorges Project
was approved by people's deputies at the Fifth Session of the
Seventh National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval, beer and fireworks were sold out
quickly in the city of Yichang where the Three Gorges Project is
located. Locals took to the streets and cheered. However, when
asked how he celebrated the approval, Pan replied, "Simply go home
and have a sound sleep."
</P>
<P>
"When the people across China endorsed the project, I felt at
ease and, I feel still greater pressure as the arduous design and
construction are far from completion," Pan noted.
</P>
<P>
Pan, already in his 70s, who had involved himself in such large
and medium-scale water control projects as those on Xin'anjiang
river, Longyang Gorge and Gezhouba, dedicated himself to the
construction of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, he was appointed deputy head of the State Council
Yangtze Blockage Appraisal Committee to give quality assessment
to the first-phase construction.
</P>
<P>
"Water is a merciless judge, and it penetrates into any
loophole. A minor neglect in such a big project can cause big
troubles, and consequence is worse than anything imaginable," Pan
often admonished his colleagues and staff.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be most cautious and adopt a scientific attitude to
ensure the first-class quality project. Otherwise, we will
fail to live up to the history and the expectation of the Chinese
people."

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Take Heavy Toll of Botswana's Work Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- AIDS will bite Botswana's
work force heavily as 30 percent of the population is predicted
to be HIV-positive by the year 2021, South African Press
Association quoted official projections as showing.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) will lead to AIDS, an
incurable and deadly disease that destroys the immune system of
the human body.
</P>
<P>
Botswana will start to experience negative population growth
at that time as annual growth in some age groups will be negative
and in the others close to zero, according to projections of
Botswana's Central Statistics Office (CSO) this week.
</P>
<P>
The projections are based on a high AIDS/HIV scenario -- an
annual increase of 5.2 percent until half of the adult population
is infected.
</P>
<P>
The report said by the year 2021, the annual population growth
in the 20-24 year age group will be 0.5 percent, dropping from
18.6 percent at the turn of the century. In that group, the
population will be 76 percent of what it would have been without
the AIDS factor.
</P>
<P>
In the older working age group of 45-64 years, annual growth
will drop from 19.2 percent in the year 2000 to 3.7 percent in
2021.
</P>
<P>
Taking the potentially more highly productive junior to middle
management sub-group of 25-44 years, and the 45-54 years group
from which senior management could be recruited, the picture is
more gloomy.
</P>
<P>
By 2021, the CSO projects, the younger group will be reduced
by 30 percent and annual growth will turn to a negative 3.5
percent from a positive 18 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The older group will drop by 43 percent and growth will be
down to 2.2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The 15-19 year age group will remain remarkably HIV free, with
less than a 0.5 percent prevalence predicted over the period to
2021.
</P>
<P>
From now to 2021, HIV infection in the 20-24 group will rise
from 2.7 percent to 12.3 percent, the 25-44 group from 20.6 to
60.7 percent, and the 45-54 group from 14.5 percent to 48.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2021, the overall population of Botswana is
projected to be a little more than 2 million, with 30 percent of
which being HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Development expenditure to combat HIV/AIDS to date has been
more than 10 million pula (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars), of
which the government has contributed more than 85 percent.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation in the
European Union (EU) in September remained unchanged from the
previous month at 1.8 percent, Eurostat reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statistical arm of the 15-nation union said that nine EU
members were below the EU average with six of these in the range
of 1.5-1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lowest rate of 0.6 percent was registered in Ireland and
the highest of 4.9 percent was in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate in the same month from a year earlier
was 2.2 percent, the Luxembourg-based statistical bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat also said the inflation rate remained at 2.2 percent
in the United States and increased to 2.4 percent in Japan, the
main references often drawn by the agency as a comparison.
</P>
<P>
However, the calculation methods used in the United States and
Japan are different from that used by Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat figure is calculated as an average of what is
known as the harmonized indices of consumer prices of EU member
states.

had been viewed as a significant step by the government to
liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
Describing the nine-month-old law as "unconstitutional", the
court explained that it violated the constitutional prohibition of
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The oil deregulation law, which ended 20 years of government
control of the oil industry, is a principal component of the
government's liberalization policy under a deregulated economy.
</P>
<P>
The law allowed oil companies to raise their retail prices and
did away with the old system under which they had to get
government approval for such increase.
</P>
<P>
Under the new ruling, however, the Energy Regulatory Board will
be empowered again to decide whether or not the country's oil
firms should be allowed to raise fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the high tribunal issued
restraining order on the local oil industry, but it was the first
time under the Ramos administration the court decided to declare a
law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the court decided to freeze a price hike
decision for 30 days by three dominant local oil companies, after
a five-day nationwide protest against oil price hikes and the oil
deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
The three oil companies wanted to raise oil prices to
compensate for the sharp devaluation of the peso, which has fallen
nearly 35 percent against the U.S. dollar since its floatation
this July.
</P>
<P>
The ruling stopping oil deregulation has generated widespread
concerns among the government and the business community, which
feared it could worsen the country's already-gloomy economic
situation and scare away investors.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said today he was surprised by the ruling
and ordered government agencies concerned to "study the impact of
the decision on various government programs and in regard to
investor confidence."
</P>
<P>
But Ramos stopped short of calling for the court to reconsider
its ruling. Instead, he called on the Congress to pass a new oil
deregulation law to sustain the development momentum of the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
"I think this will have extensive repercussions not only
against the oil companies, but also the whole country which is
trying to attract investors," said Monico Jacob, president of the
country's biggest oil firm Petron Corp.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling would shake investors' confidence in the
Ramos government's open market policy because they have
experienced an abrupt reversal of economic laws by the Supreme
Court in the past.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the court struck down the sale of the
historic Manila Hotel to a bid-winning Malaysian business group,
citing "Filipino First" principle stipulated in the constitution.
The hotel was awarded to a local firm which had earlier lost in
the auction.
</P>
<P>
Raul Concepcion, president of the Federation of Philippine
Industries, warned that the government will again face the
prospect of having to subsidize oil consumption at a time when it
is already suffering from a currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the oil deregulation, the government had to provide a
special oil price support fund to subsidize the losses incurred by
the oil companies if the international price of oil outpaced the
local prices.
</P>
<P>
The government, which was reluctant to raise oil prices for
fear of protests, incurred an accumulated deficit in the oil price
support fund of a staggering 9 billion pesos (340 million U.S.
dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Japan Protests South Korea Berth on Disputed Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan lodged a protest with South
Korea today over ship berthing facilities completed on a small
island claimed by both Tokyo and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai summoned South
Korean Ambassador to Japan Kim Tae Zhee and expressed strong
regret over the construction which went ahead despite Tokyo's
repeated demands for a halt, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Yanai made the protest after South Korea held a ceremony
earlier today to mark the completion of the facilities on the
disputed island, which is in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The vice foreign minister also urged South Korea to remove all
the facilities from the island.
</P>
<P>
Top government spokesman Kanezo Muraoka told reporters earlier
in the day that Japan wants to prevent the event from having
adverse effects on the overall relationship between Tokyo and
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are currently negotiating a new fisheries
treaty that will include waters around the island.
</P>
<P>
The island, known as Takeshima in Japan and Tokto in South
Korea, lies midway between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The berth on the island, built at a cost of 17.72 billion won
(about 19 million U.S. dollars), can handle a 500-ton
ship. Construction began in December 1995 and was completed eight
months ahead of schedule.

<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Flower Marketing Board had decided that
flowers exported by the Palestinians would be sold separately from
those produced in Israel, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which would go into effect this month, was made
following a loss of 5 million shekels (about 1.4 million
U.S. dollars) suffered by Israeli producers due to former customs
arrangements with the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel would host the third annual conference of
the International Electronic Industry Organization next week,
according to local daily The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 17 countries were expected to attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The world electronic industry was estimated to produce an
output worth 1,000 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The international bid for the construction of the
Kars-Tbilisi railway to connect Turkey and Georgia would be opened
this month, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 120-kilometer railway, which was
estimated to cost 400 million U.S. dollars, would last from 1998
to 2001, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The railway was believed to play a role in promoting the trade
between Turkey, Georgia, Central Asian and European countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran was to put 12 petrochemical projects with an
estimated cost of 1.6 billion dollars on international tender,
according to local daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
They included plants to produce methanol, engineering polymers,
olefine, and paraxylene.
</P>
<P>
These projects, after being built, would increase an annual
petrochemical production of 5 million tonnes, of which 2 million
tonnes are for export.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has approved to set up a special economic zone
in Bandar Rajai, a Persian Gulf port city of Hormozgan Province,
Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The special zone was granted all the same privileges enjoyed by
other special economic zones, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
It would serve the interest of the free trade zone of Qeshm
Island, several kilometers off Iran's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran had announced to establish a number
of free trade zones and special economic zones in a bid to promote
its non-oil industries and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite hard efforts and pledges to guarantee the safety and
interest of foreign investors, Iran had made little progress in
absorbing foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> GM Senior Official Fully Confident in China Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Upon his return to Beijing from
the United States, Rudy Schlais, president of General Motors (GM)
China Operations, today expressed his confidence in GM's
operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Schlais told reporters that GM's investment in China was to hit
two billion US dollars in 1998, and the figure might rocket up to
three billion yuan in 1999, which would make GM one of China's top
three overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
GM's strategic development goal is to become China's largest
supplier of automotive parts and components and one of the top
three complete vehicle makers in the country, according to Schlais.
</P>
<P>
GM has so far set up 16 cooperative projects in China,
including three solely-funded ones. Several new projects are now
in negotiation, Schlais said.
</P>
<P>
Schlais was named vice-president of GM and the president of GM
China Operations in 1994. His efforts contributed to the
successful founding in June this year of Shanghai-GM Automobile
Co., Ltd., a joint venture by Shanghai Automobile Industry (Group)
Corp. and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
New Buick cars with displacement volume of 2.98 liters are to
be put to production in the second half of 1998. By the end of
next year, the company will be able to assemble the new Buicks
with more than 50 percent of the parts and components made
domestically, according to company plans.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to get international loans are also going smoothly,
and money raised will be put in the Buick project.
</P>
<P>
Schlais described the project in Shanghai as a "tremendous
success." Its products will mainly be marketed in China; when the
first phase project is accomplished, six percent of its products
will be exported.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that this will relieve China's need to import
medium- and high-grade cars.
</P>
<P>
Schlais encouraged overseas business people to actively
participate in the investment in China, saying that China's
economy is growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the US government to grant permanent
Most-Favored-Nation trade status to China.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in South Korea Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite the prolonged economic
slump and instability in the financial sector, foreign direct
investment in South Korea this year is likely to show a two-fold
increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy said foreign investments in
the first nine months of this year amounted to 5.46 billion
U.S. dollars, up 189.1 percent from 1.89 billion dollars recorded
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"As an additional 1 billion dollars worth of foreign investment
is expected in the last quarter, the total volume will rise to 6.5
billion dollars, some two-fold over 3.2 billion dollars recorded
for last year," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
In industry, investments in service and manufacturing
businesses accounted for 74.2 percent and 25.4 percent of the
nine-month volume, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that foreign investors are paying greater attention
to South Korea's long-term economic prospects, despite the current
economic woes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Monthly foreign investments, however, slowed from 1.56 billion
dollars in April to 169 million dollars in August, before rising
again to 429 million dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
"Rising foreign investments will also result in a huge influx
of foreign currency, which should help stabilize the foreign
exchange rate next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment volume in South Korea has been on a
steep rise since 1993. The year-on-year gains in foreign
investments stood at 16.8 percent in 1993, 26.2 percent in 1994,
47.4 percent in 1995 and 65 percent in 1996.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The third session of U.N.-Iraq
talks to end the current standoff between the two sides started
here today as the U.N. delegation expressed satisfaction over the
atmosphere of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The session was held when for the fourth consecutive day today,
Iraq barred U.S. members of the U.N. inspection team responsible
for disarming Iraq of mass destructive weapons from visiting
inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported the U.N. inspection groups
returned from targeted sites after entry of U.S. inspectors was
denied.
</P>
<P>
The session was attended by Iraqi delegation led by Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and a U.N. mission headed by Lakhdar
Al-Ibrahimi.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Ibrahimi as praising the atmosphere of the talks,
and Emilio Kardinas, a U.N. mission member, as talking about the
outspokeness and understanding during the talks.
</P>
<P>
But no official statement on the outcome of the talks has been
issued by Iraq or the UN mission as yet.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi is due to hold a press conference tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ibrahimi had met Saadoun Hammadi, chairman of
Iraq's National Assembly (Parliament). But INA did not give
further details.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission arrived here Wednesday to defuse the crisis
regarding the U.N. inspection of mass destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to expel the six U.S. inspectors working
with the 40-member inspection team. The United Nations urged
Baghdad not to do so and the United States threatened to use force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Iraq agreed to suspend its expulsion order and
called for dialog.

<HEADLINE> Impacts of Asian Currency Crisis on Australian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- There was good news and bad
news for Australia in the recent Asian currency crisis, the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The good news was that Australia could benefit at the expense
of the weaker Asian countries, attracting investor interest.
</P>
<P>
The bad news was that the extent and reach of the downturn had
not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary committee on Financial Institutions
and Public Administration, RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane said in
contrast to the South-East Asian economic turmoil, Australia could
be an attractive place to do business.
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought it's possible that these events will have
some positive benefits spin off to Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Macfarlane also conceded the picture was not complete,
saying it was too early to tell what the impact of the crisis in
Asia would be on Australia's domestic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said he remained optimistic about Asia's growth prospects
and downplayed the effects of the financial crisis spreading
further, "that seems less likely now but we should not speak too
soon".
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual statement on monetary policy released just
prior to Macfarlane's speech, the RBA said the Australian economy
was well placed to weather the worst of the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
However, it said the likelihood that south and north east Asian
trading partners would experience lower growth for a time, while
Japan remained weak provided a "difficult external environment for
Australia".
</P>
<P>
The RBA said much will depend on the size and duration of the
slowing in growth in Australia's Asian trading partners, and what
happens in the rest of the world - where the other half of
Australia's exports are sold.
</P>
<P>
"While the acute difficulties were likely to be confined
largely to the four ASEAN countries initially hit by the
turbulence, the implications for Australia were likely to be
reasonably contained," the bank said in its statement.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Funds Bomb-Blasted Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is to
grant a bulk of 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the bomb-damaged
Galadari Hotel in the center of Colombo to carry out initial
repair work, hotel official disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made following the government's assurances of
financial assistance to the badly affected institutions after the
downtown area of the capital was hit by a massive truck-bomb on
October 15 by the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Galadari Hotel officials said they discussed the issue of
financial assistance with Tourism and Aviation Minister Dharmasiri
Senanayake Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack claimed 18 lives and injured more than 100
others. Many buildings in the business center, including the
Galadari and Hilton hotels, were seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
The damage to the Galadari is estimated at around 10 million
dollars, according to hotel officials. At the time of the bomb
blast, the hotel had an occupancy rate of around 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the government wants it to reopen by the end
of the year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
The Hilton resumed operation partially on November 1 with 100
guest rooms ready for occupancy.

<HEADLINE> Pak Takes Steps to Combat Sectarian Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
taken steps to combat sectarian terrorism, Interior Minister
Chaudhry Shujat Hussain said here today.
</P>
<P>
These steps include the constitution of Intelligence
Coordination Committees at provincial level and listing out most
militants and terrorists, the minister told the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The lists of militants and terrorists and those involved in
syndicated crimes are provided to the Special Task Force
established in each province, said Hussain, adding the force is
mounting well-planned operations to apprehend these elements.
</P>
<P>
He said the intelligence agencies had also been asked to
identify sources of funds and weapons for the militant sectarian
organizations and terrorist elements.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a high powered standing commission has been
set up to promote sectarian peace and harmony, Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement agencies of the provincial governments
maintain vigilance and security at mosques to prevent them from
any act of violence and terrorism, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Use Parliament to Stamp out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Speaker of
Parliament Cyril Ndebele today pledged to use the house to help
stamp out corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a three-day workshop organised by
Transparency International (TI), a non-governmental organisation
monitoring corruption, Ndebele pledged to help enhance
accountability.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament is best placed to deal with this problem of
corruption, which has national, regional and trans-national
dimensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is wasteful of resources and renders government
less effective and raises the cost of doing business and destroys
competitiveness of enterprises in the domestic and international
markets," Ndebele said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, whose theme is "the role of parliament in
promoting transparency and accountability", is attended by
Zimbabwe's members of parliament, economists and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament has the duty and responsibility to demand that
those whose actions affect public interest should be transparent
in their actions, and accountable," the speaker noted.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the press to expose corrupt activities.
</P>
<P>
"Transparency and accountability are mere empty words without
a vibrant free and responsible press. The role of the press is
therefore crucial to expose activities both in the public and
private sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The press, however, could itself be corrupt and should face
the same tests of transparency and accountability, Ndebele added.

RIO DE JANEIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Fluminense, allowed
back into the top division of the Brazilian championship despite
going down last year, was knocked out of the pool again after a
heart-broken loss.
</P>
<P>
Fluminense needed Corinthians to drop at least a point on
Wednesday to keep alive its hopes of staying up but its dreams
were shattered by a seond half goal through Edilson.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) allowed Fluminense
and Bragantino, also relegated last year, back into the top
division in June in a decision that most people felt they should
stay in the top level league.
</P>
<P>
In the other game, Santos qualified for the semifinal stage by
beating America-Natal 2-0 and joined Vasco da Gama, Internacional,
Atletico Mineiro, Portuguesa and Flamengo.
</P>
<P>
The top eight in the first stage qualify for the semifinal

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Canadian Devoted to Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- As the damming of the Three
Gorges Project on the Yangtze River draws nearer, Henry Hui Yao
Wang, a Chinese-Canadian, can barely contain his excitement, just
like so many others involved in this gigantic project.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is 38, is director of the Asianada International
Group Ltd. (Canada) and a Beijing-based vice-president of the
Monenco AGRA Inc., the largest engineering contractor in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Being an overseas Chinese, I feel very honored to have the
opportunity to help the Three Gorges Project, and I'm extremely
proud of my motherland which has launched such a gigantic
project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been invited to attend a ceremony for the damming on
November 8, as an honored guest for his outstanding contribution
to the project over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Wang had worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation until the mid-80s, when he left Beijing for
Canada. Later, he realized his dream of getting an MBA.
</P>
<P>
From 1990-93, Wang was the first Chinese-Canadian to be
appointed by the provincial government of Quebec as its Councilor
of Commerce to Beijing and Hong Kong. During the period, he
brought nearly 30 Canadian companies into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
His involvement in the dam project can be traced back to as
early as 1987, when he persuaded the Canadian government to grant
20 million Canadian dollars for a feasibility study on the project.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, AGRA signed an agreement with the China Yangtze River
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation (CYRTGPDC), which
owns the project, on establishing a managerial system for the work
with 30 million Canadian dollars in loans from the Canadian
government.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that an advanced foreign managerial system
has been adopted in a major Chinese project, and the system has
been described as a "revolution in management" by CYRTGPDC General
Manager Lu Youmei.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Wang received over 1.5 million Canadian dollar-loans
from the Canadian government to help set up the Beijing
Information Center on the Three Gorges Project. Currently, his
company is undertaking the planning and consultative work on the
project's transmission and transformation networks.
</P>
<P>
"I am rooted in China and a bigger part of my job is related to
the Three Gorges Project," he said.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The third session of U.N.-Iraq
talks to end the current standoff between the two sides started
here today as the U.N. delegation expressed satisfaction over the
atmosphere of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The session was attended by Iraqi delegation led by Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and a U.N. mission headed by Lakhdar
Al-Ibrahimi.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Ibrahimi as praising the
atmosphere of the talks, and Emilio Kardinas, a U.N. mission
member, as talking about the outspokeness and understanding during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
But no official statement on the outcome of the talks has been
issued by Iraq or the UN mission as yet.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi is due to hold a press conference tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ibrahimi had met Saadoun Hammadi, chairman of
Iraq's National Assembly (Parliament). But INA did not give
further details.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission arrived here Wednesday to defuse the crisis
regarding the U.N. inspection team which is responsible for
disarming Iraq of mass destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week decided to expel the six U.S. inspectors working
with the 40-member inspection team. The United Nations urged
Baghdad not to do so and the United States threatened to use force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Iraq agreed to suspend its expulsion order and
called for dialog.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Explains Budget for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said this morning that the 1998 budget presented by
her government will keep the economy on the right track.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference that the three budgets presented by
her government since the ruling People's Alliance assumed power in
1994 "had brought the economy on the right track" and she assured
the fourth budget for the next year will maintain that momentum.
</P>
<P>
She said the major aspect of the 1998 budget is that "the
country has achieved the first step of economic stability" and
"the government is successfully going to the next phase to
establish a strong, stable and durable economic development in the
country."
</P>
<P>
she said due to a very tight budget policy, the unemployment
rate this year has been controlled at around 10 percent and the
economic growth rate is 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that all these had been achieved in the face of
two major obstacles, namely the war with the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam and the consistent campaign by the major opposition
party to undermine government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
She said some members of the opposition went abroad and gave
all forms of false statements in order to shake foreign investors'
confidence on her government.
</P>
<P>
The government's budget for the fiscal year 1998 was presented
to the parliament Tuesday afternoon by Deputy Finance Minister
G.L. Peiris.
</P>
<P>
The bill anticipates to reduce the budget deficit to 6.5
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) next year as against
this year's deficit of 7.6 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The budget aims at promoting the sectors of research and
development, agriculture, tourism, gem and jewelry and textile,
which are considered to have potentials for rapid economic
expansion and generation of employment and income.
</P>
<P>
In the previous budgets, the government formulated to give
incentives to larger investors. With a stronger economy, the 1998
budget is able to promise similar incentives to small and medium
scale investors in order to attract more investment, the president
said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Lower on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index lost another 9.49 points to close at 1690.53
points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said trading was underpinned by sentiment over the fall
of the Hong Kong bourse. But earlier they said selling was spurred
after a U.S. investment house reportedly issued a sell order on
index-linked shares and the weakening of the Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 113.16 million units, valued
at 230.51 million Singapore dollars (about 147.76 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overtook advances by 207 to 126, while 277
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
RHB Capital Warrant99 was again the most actively traded
counter as it registered a turnover of 7.47 million units. It was
followed by MBf Land which had 4.27 million shares traded. The
Singapore Telecom was next with 3.99 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.7 dollars to finish at 43.2 Singapore
dollars. Sea View increased by 1.25 dollars to end at 8.75
Singapore dollars. First Capital picked up by 1.18 dollars to
close at 3.76 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Tasek was the biggest loser as it declined by
1.04 dollars to end at 1.96 Singapore dollars. Oriental Holdings
fell by 78 cents to close at 3.32 Singapore dollars. GE Life lost
40 cents to finish at 13.5 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Safety Plan Drafted for Smooth Navigation on Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 6 (Xinhua) -- An emergency
safety plan has been put to effect today to help guarantee normal
navigation in a water diversion channel, a man-made section of the
Yangtze at the site of Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Three Gorges Navigation
Headquarters, since the only water route for vessels sailing on
the Yangtze before the temporary shiplock goes into use next May,
safe navigation in the channel under emergent circumstances will
be vital to the progress of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The plan will help cope with such emergencies arising from
traffic accidents on the channel, rapid water flow with per second
discharge of more than 10,000 cu m, removal of silt, and adverse
natural conditions for navigation, said Li Zheng, deputy chief of
the navigation headquarters.
</P>
<P>
If any traffic accidents occur on the channel, according to Li,
the navigation authorities will impose a blockage on the channel,
while taking immediate rescue measures.
</P>
<P>
Traffic will be cut off to vessels to the maximum of 500
horsepowers, provided that the per second water discharge exceeds
10,000 cu m, and to all vessels if the discharge should run up to
20,000 cu m, or there is a heavy fog or a sudden upsurge in water
level, said the navigation official.
</P>
<P>
Only one-way navigation will be permitted on the diversion
channel whenever the silt built-up in it is being cleared and
removed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 3,726-m-long channel has reported smooth navigation since
it was put to use a full month ago, with more than 6,000 vessels
sailing across it.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Confident in Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, today reiterated the SAR government's determination to
maintain Hong Kong's exchange rate regime pegged with the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government has the absolute total ability to maintain the
linked exchange rate because Hong Kong's economic fundamentals are
"really very good and very sound," Tung told reporters at a media
session after officiating at the Council Inauguration and Honorary
Degree Congregation of the Open University of Hong Kong this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how long the higher interest rate will last, Tung
said that he has noticed that there has been some degree of
interest rate volatility and that last night and this morning, the
one-to-three-month interest rate went up.
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that we will succeed in defending the linked
exchange rate because our fundamentals are good and as soon as
this has happened, interest rate will start to get back," Tung
added.
</P>
<P>
As of the question whether the government will lower the land
price, Tung said that the government's land policy will remain
unchanged and the government will set land premium according to
market forces.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the problem of housing price, Tung said that the
short-term drop in the housing price due to higher interest rate
is good for the society.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there will be no problem about the housing
price from the long-term perspective because the demand for houses
is high due to fast population growth of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Quality Optical Goods is to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Demand for quality optical
goods is certain to expand significantly as the economy of China
and the Asia-Pacific region continues to grow, a leading Hong Kong
businessman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony for the Hong Kong Optical Fair
'97, Philip Wong, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce said there is a steady shift of the optical industry
towards Asia, both as a production base and an expanding market.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's optical companies, in meeting the challenge
of the fast-changing market, have responded by increasing
investment in technology to upgrade their product design and
quality to meet international requirements.
</P>
<P>
Many Hong Kong manufacturers have successfully established
their brand names, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, many of the labor-intensive product operations
have been relocated to manufacturing bases in Guangdong Province,
which has enabled local producers to remain competitive," said
Wong.
</P>
<P>
"However, manufacturing continues to maintain the headquarters
in the Special Administrational Region, focusing on higher
value-added activities such as design, marketing, distribution and
quality control, he added.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Hong Kong Optical Fair, staged in the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, has drawn 350 exhibitors from 15
countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Fair, organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) and co-organized by the Hong Kong Optical Manufacturers
Association (HKOMA), is the largest of its kind in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The China Optomatric and Optical Association organized, for the
first time, a delegation of more than 40 exhibitors from China's
mainland. However, some Chinese exhibitors had participated in
the previous Hong Kong optical fairs.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's opening ceremony were Tony Chow,
President of the HKOMA), and Michael Sze, TDC's Executive
Director.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of Hong Kong's optical industry output is
for export. Last year's total exports of optical goods, optical
instruments and apparatus from Hong Kong amounted to 10.68 billion
HK dollars (1.63 billion U.S. dollars), up 16 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
A two-day conference titled "The Changing Face of Asia and the
Global Optical Markets" is being held in conjunction with the
Fair, with focus placed on the future development and trade
prospect of the global optical market.

<HEADLINE> Militia Commanders Killed in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- There has been renewed
tension within the armed militiamen supporting Hussein Mohamed
Aidid in Baidoa and Mogadishu, with two senior militia commanders
of Aidid killed in separate attacks yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Khalif Gurei Dhunkal, head of Hussein Aidid's special
security unit, was gunned down at Baidoa, a town 245 km southwest
of the capital when he was trying to mediate two rival
militiamen, both of whom are supporters of Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, one of the rival militiamen aimed
at Colonel Dhunkal, shot with several rounds of AK-47 and killed
him on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The fired rounds have also seriously wounded commander of
Aidid's forces in Bay Region, Ali Yare. Also, one more militiaman
was confirmed to have died on the spot.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the assailants of Colonel Dhunkal
were annoyed by the killing of one of their colleagues at Baidoa
town two days ago by militia members close in sub-clan with late
Colonel Dhunkal. Colonel Dhunkal and a team of militia officers
were sent from Mogadishu to mediate the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a top militia commander loyal to Hussein
Aidid was shot and killed by armed militiamen manning a
checkpoint at KM-13 yesterday evening. The killing of Colonel
Hashi Sangal followed after he ordered the militiamen to disperse
at the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The news of the killing of the two colonels shook South
Mogadishu's atmosphere and militia sympathizers were seen moving
around with their technical wagons for a possible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of militia officials with more than 10
technicals have set up a strong checkpoint outside the capital to
stop all militia movements coming in or going out of the capital.
Meanwhile, clan elders have issued a statement, calling on the
people to practise maximum restraint.
</P>
<P>
The killings took place at a time when all major leaders of
South Mogadishu's government are away from home on a trip to
Cairo where the three main factions led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
Osman Hassan Ali Atto and Hussein Aidid himself are due to meet
for a possible solution in talks to Somalia's long-standing
political crises.

<HEADLINE> HK Open University to explore Technology in Distance Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Professor Tam Sheung-wai,
president of the Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK), stated today
that the OUHK will further tap the potential of applying new
technologies in distance learning education.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the university's First
Foundation Day, Tam said: "We hope to become an outstanding
distance learning establishment by successful exploitation of
electronic communication devices as distance teaching tools."
</P>
<P>
"Using such modern methods will be beneficial to implementing
suitable programs in the mainland and overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The university, officially established a year ago on the basis
of the seven-year-old Open Learning Institute, has been utilizing
multimedia channels and computer networks for the transmission of
course materials. A newly-designed electronic library worth 40
million Hong Kong dollars (5.14 million U.S. dollars) is expected
to come on line in the university next August.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the promise to keep abreast of the rapidly
developing technology, the OUHK also plans to upgrade its
language standard of students and to develop high-quality Chinese
course materials, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
Optimum coordination of the three aspects -- language teaching,
distance education and vast student numbers, he pointed out, would
produce a unique teaching mode that brings economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Later this evening, more than 600 guests, students, staff and
tutors will converge at Hotel Miramar here for the Foundation Day
banquet, in which Secretary for Education and Manpower of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Joseph Wong Wing-ping
will deliver an address.
</P>
<P>
In a message carried by a local newspaper today to mark the
university's foundation day, HKSAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
said: "Since its establishment, the OUHK has pursued vigorously
its mission of providing open education opportunities to all,
regardless of their age and academic standards."
</P>
<P>
"It offers a second chance to those who have missed the
opportunity of receiving tertiary education and has contributed
significantly towards upgrading our human resources," Tung said.
"Given its dedication, prudence and dynamism, I am sure that the
university will continue to forge ahead."

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- On the third day of the strike of lorry drivers, more than
150 barriers remained in place on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning,
talks between the employers and employees resumed, with the
participation of the Union of Federations of Transport, the
biggest union of owners of trucking companies in France. The
employers had made a big concession during the day by agreeing to
the principle of minimum hourly pays for the lorry drivers.
</P>
<P>
-- A study by the humanitarian group Modecins Sans Frantieres
said that during the persecution of Hutu refugees by the forces of
Laurent-Desire Kabila during the war in former Zaire in the first
half of this year, only 17 percent of the refugees fled to
neighboring Congo Republic in a 1,500-kilometer trek through
Zaire, while 2 percent of them could have returned to Rwanda, 1
percent could have died of diseases or accident, 20 percent openly
killed, and 60 percent "disappeared."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- With the strike of lorry drivers and the nomination of
Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, as the
candidate for the future European Central Bank, France is annoying
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Protests are multiplying from other European countries for the
blocking of highways in France by the lorry drivers, as
negotiations resumed Wednesday morning until late in the night at
the Ministry of Transport to put an end to the strike of lorry
drivers which hinders the free circulation in the country.
</P>
<P>
-- The year of 1996 was one of "transition" for employment
structural reform in France which came along with big reforms in
the social system and the military, although no big change came
from the field of employment or unemployment, said the French
state statistics and economics institution INSEE in a report on
the social situation of France in 1996. One relatively big event
about employment is that social dialogue in signing contracts
between employers and employees was launched, with 9,274 labor
contracts signed.

<HEADLINE> No Change in HK Land Premium Policy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The policy of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to set land premium according
to market forces remains unchanged, an official of the SAR
government said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We always follow market prices and there has been no change in
this policy, no matter whether in setting prices for lots put up
for auction or in calculating premium for agricultural lots to be
converted to building land," Robert Pope, director of lands of the
SAR government, said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to allegations that the SAR
government would lower the prices of government land.
</P>
<P>
Property prices are a determining factor for land prices and,
naturally, at a time when property prices come down, land prices
will follow the trend, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
The government will not withhold the sale of a lot only because
it fails to fetch a certain price, unless the offers are
ridiculous, he added.
</P>
<P>
But, on the other hand, this certainly does not mean that the
government will deliberately reduce the prices of land, Pope said,
adding that market prices will always prevail.

<HEADLINE> Medical Value of Insects to be Researched in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Spiders, butterflies and bees
may harbor the medicines of the future, according to scientists
engaged in a novel research project announced today in Brisbane,
capital city of eastern Australia's Queensland state.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years some 800 insects from the seashore,
mountains and tropics of Australia will be collected in a bid to
develop new pharmaceutical products, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local company BioDiscovery Ltd announced a joint venture with
the Commonwealth of Scientific, Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), a national academy of sciences, to provide insects to the
Glaxo Wellcome Medicine Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Professor Joan Dawes, BioDiscovery's scientific director, said
half of all drugs on today's market were derived from natural
sources.
</P>
<P>
Extensive research is underway into rainforest plants and
marine resources, but until now there has been little systematic
screening of the potential of insects, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
"We're tapping into an area which hasn't really been explored,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
It is already known that mosquitoes have anticoagulant
properties, spiders may have usable toxins and bees could provide
clues about stemming the growth of bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
"We think bees must have strong antibiotics and anti-fungal
properties because although bee hives have the perfect environment
for bacteria to grow, it simply never does," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
"The insect library project is a unique attempt to tap into
the insect world for the drugs of the future."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced today, scientists at the CSIRO
division of entomology will range throughout Australia "with
butterfly nets and spades" to collect and catalogue a wide variety
of species, spokesman John Oakeshott said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Oakeshott, leader of the CSIRO biotechnology program, said
only Merck's Inbio project in central America came close to
comparing with the scope of the Australian venture.
</P>
<P>
Insects will be put into cold storage and frozen and their
individual essences extracted for screening by the Glaxo Wellcome
Medicine Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The CSIRO has the technical resources and expertise to gather
enough of the sometimes obscure insects for investigation, and to
return to collect more if something shows promise, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally we like to start with about 10 grams of material
which is okay if you have a great big grub but if you are looking
at gathering aphids then it's a time-consuming job," Dr. Oakeshott
said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be looking at everything including mites, spiders,
nematodes, stick insects and butterflies."
</P>
<P>
Dawes said insects have been a source for Chinese treatments
for more than 2,000 years, with some 54 species nominated in
ancient medical texts.
</P>
<P>
Australian Aborigines have also made use of insects, for
example, boiling down the nests of green ants to treat respiratory
infections.

<HEADLINE> Fairchild Technologies Introduces New Disc System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Fairchild Technologies, a
major supplier of equipment for optical disc manufacturing in the
world, has unveiled a new line of optical disc manufacturing
systems at the REPLItech Asia trade show in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Designed to grow with the changing needs of disc replicators,
the products of the Fairchild Technologies, a U.S.-based company
designing and manufacturing leading-edge equipment for the optical
disc and semiconductor manufacturing industries, are upgradable
from compact disc (CD) to video compact disc (VCD) and then to
digital versatile disc (DVD).
</P>
<P>
Its equipment for the manufacturing of recordable compact disc
(CD-R) can also be upgraded to manufacture recordable video
compact disc (VCD-R) and recordable digital versatile disc
(DVD-R), from two basic platforms, William Liggett, president of
the Optical Disc Equipment Group of the Fairchild Technologies.
</P>
<P>
Products of the Fairchild Technologies have occupied 30 percent
of the total world market, half of which is in Asia, Liggett said.
</P>
<P>
"The recordable optical disc market is a formidable business in
Asia right now, and continues to grow at a phenomenal rate," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the optical disc equipment market is forecast to
reach approximately 240 million U.S. dollars in 1997 and nearly
750 million dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three-day REPLItech Asia, which opened Tuesday at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, is the region's only trade
show dedicated to the replication and duplication of magnetic and
 optical media.
</P>
<P>
It highlights products from 151 companies, which include audio
tape, video tape and floppy disk duplicators, optical disc
replicators, software publishers, printers and CD pressers.
</P>
<P>
REPLItech Asia is now in its third year and it was previously
held in Singapore. The show complements two other annual REPLItech
events, REPLItech Europe every spring and REPLItech North America
each June.

<HEADLINE> Disaster of AIDS Hovers Over South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A "catastrophe" is about
to hit South Africans with one in every four or five people to be
infected with HIV/AIDS when the epidemic reaches its peak between
the years 2005 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
About 18 to 25 percent of the population would be infected
when the epidemic hits its peak in eight to 13 years' time, "The
Citizen" newspaper today quoted Helen Starke, chief director of
social welfare services, as telling the South African
parliament's Welfare Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 14 percent of South Africans are HIV
positive, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The committee was warned that AIDS would kill mainly younger,
economically active sector of the population, and place an
enormous strain on the country's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
AIDS killed those who grew the crops, worked in the mines and
factories, and ran the schools and hospitals, she said.
</P>
<P>
Even children were not spared, she said. It was estimated that
5 percent of South African children were already infected and the
figure would reach 16 percent at the epidemic's peak.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on families and
individuals is severe," Starke said.
</P>
<P>
Already identified as high risk groups in South Africa were
mine workers, migrants, sex workers, military forces, transport
workers, drug abusers and traveling marketing and sales
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The province with the highest HIV incidence is North West with
an infection rate of 25.1 percent by the end of 1996, followed by
Kwazulu-Natal with 19.9 and Free State, 17.5.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape has the lowest infection rate of 1.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) may lead to AIDS (acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome).

<HEADLINE> Economic Revival in France Stronger Than Expected: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that the economic
revival in France is "stronger than expected" mainly in the field
of investment.
</P>
<P>
"The revival is there. It is stronger and more rapid than
expected notably in the field of investment," said Strauss-Kahn in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
He said that "a positive evolution" of the French economy is
seen through the rising morale of French enterprise managers as was
shown by a study of the state statistics and economics institution
INSEE published today.
</P>
<P>
France's export could be affected by the expected slowdown of
economic growth in Asia, although that could be compensated by a
stronger growth in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that a 2.3 percent growth of GDP in France in
1997 can be realized and that the "acquisition of growth in the
1997-98 period is stronger than predicted."
</P>
<P>
"All that reinforces the reliability of our predictions in
1998" about a 3 percent growth of GDP by the government, he
added.

The girls, aged between 20 and 28, were fleeing to Ukraine,

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight persons including two men believed to be
financiers of the prostitutes were being quizzed by the airport
police command.
</P>
<P>
According to Airport Police Deputy Commissioner Muhammed
Abubakar, the girls claimed they were travelling abroad for
further education after leaving secondary schools in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He notd that the girls were not found with authentic travel
documents.
</P>
<P>
The police officer claimed the trade in prostitution was a
syndicate with connivance of some yet to be identified travel
agencies and notable Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The pressure from prominent Nigerians for their release made
it difficult to prosecute the girls, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the embassies for issuing visas to some of
these girls "whom they never met physically".
</P>
<P>
According to him, one of the ways to identify the girls was
their flashy dressing, smattering and substandard English.
</P>
<P>
This alone was enough to raise suspicion on the intention of
the girls abroad, the police officer added.

Co. Ltd. in east China's Anhui Province recently announced plans
to purchase the Anqing Copper Mine as part of an asset
rearrangement program.
</P>
<P>
Tongdu, the first listed company in China's copper sector, has
operated smoothly since going public last year.
</P>
<P>
A mid-term assessment of general performance of China's listed

<HEADLINE> Air Zimbabwe to Avoid Mid-air Collisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Air Zimbabwe is installing the
traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) 11 or airborne
collision avoidance system (ACAS) on its two Boeing 767 aircraft
to avert mid-air collisions.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier and South African Airways are the first
two airlines in the region to install TCAS.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance system enables a nearby aircraft equipped
with the transmitter to be shown on a traffic display in the
cockpit, said spokesman for Air Zimbabwe David Mwenga yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Once detected, TCAS 11/ACAS tracked and continued to evaluate
the threat potential of these aircraft to its own aircraft, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Should TCAS 11/ACAS predict that certain safe boundaries may
be violated, it will alert the crew that closing traffic was in
the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The decision to install the system follows concerns raised by
the World Pilots' Body regarding safety over the African
continent in particular, and worldwide in general.
</P>
<P>
By installing the system, Air Zimbabwe will ensure its
corporate commitment to safety, quality, technology and security,
an objective that will enhance the comfort and safety of its
travelling public.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Enterprises Introduce Anti-Crisis Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean giant conglomerates
are pushing for an intensive management innovation and
restructuring drive in an all-out struggle to overcome the
deepening economic crisis, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) said in the poll of
39 flagship companies of 27 main business groups that their
innovation drives are focused on debt reduction and organizational
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree on the point that the nation's economic
crisis was caused by the old practice of heavy dependence on
overseas borrowing and missing the appropriate time for
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The long-term, fundamental plans for restructuring should be
mapped out in order to overcome the current economic crisis, they
added.
</P>
<P>
"Management innovation campaigns had been focused on wage
freeze and personnel reshuffle until last year, but the survey
demonstrates that this year the scope of large businesses' bailout
efforts were extended to include equity structure," said Ahn
Jong-hyon, a financial analyst of the FKI who compiled the report.
</P>
<P>
With respect to cost cuts, the groups have tightened their
budgets for advertising, promotional events and receptions.
</P>
<P>
In personnel management, the groups are preparing for major
manpower shake-up, with some groups having already reduced their
work force and others cutting down on annual recruitment.
</P>
<P>
While wage freezing adopted in 12 groups, 10 other groups have
switched to a merit-based yearly pay system from the previous
seniority-based one.
</P>
<P>
In terms of investment and productivity, only two groups have
increased their overseas investments, while 11 groups have become
more selective in strategic investments both at home and abroad,
with eight groups rearranging investment priorities.
</P>
<P>
Almost 60 percent of top 30 groups also said that they would
refrain from new capital investments next year.

<HEADLINE> Importance of non-traditional exports stressed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The overall position of exports
of Zambia will be worse without the support of non-traditional
exports, Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) has said.
</P>
<P>
The Post today quoted EBZ director Mwansa Musonda as saying
here Wednesday that EBZ had projected a figure of 297 million
U.S. Dollars in non-traditional exports earnings for 1997 "but it
now appears likely that this figure may be exceeded by the year
end".
</P>
<P>
"Currently, non-traditional exports are contributing
significantly to the country's total foreign exchange earnings
rising from eight percent in 1990 to 24.3 percent in 1996," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Musonda, however, pointed out that there is need for the
government to provide more finance to the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He said major constraints to the expansion of manufacturing
include the unavailability of credit from financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He complained that banks are offering "very short-term" credit
which is inconvenient to potential exporters.
</P>
<P>
Musonda said that Zambia's primary focus on South Africa is to
advance bilateral negotiations to level the playing field on
selected products.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is taking advantage of the Zambian duty
structure. While our tariffs are banded into 15 percent, 25
percent and 35 percent depending on the product, the South
African tariffs on textiles for example are too high at 45 to 65
percent. this is what has to be levelled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) recently said that
it did not support the ban of foreign products as a solution but
urged the government to negotiate for the access of Zambian
products into the regional market.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa's exports to Zambia equalled to 300 million
Dollars in 1996, Zambia's exports to South Africa totalled only
15 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia now has to look for alternative markets for some of its
non-traditional exports as the Lome Convention's duty free
arrangement with European union (EU) draws to a close on March 1,
in the year 2000. The facility affords countries from the
African, Caribbean and Pacific states to pay lower tariffs on
their exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of Zambia's non-traditional exports are
exported to the EU.

TOKYO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States today
held first joint naval exercises after issuing their new defense
cooperation guidelines in September, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Kyodo didn't mention the specific site of the
maneuver, the first one held in Japanese waters.
</P>
<P>
The naval exercises, which is scheduled to finish next

enemy submarines, surface ships and aircraft as well as training
in information warfare. Japan's Air-Self-Defense Force (ASDF) will
also take part in the exercises.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Inflation Down by Tight Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate in
Kenya fell in October thanks to tight monetary policy and the
Shilling's recovery, according to the latest report from the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation dropped to 8.74 percent in October from 8.84
percent in September, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation rate, which excludes food prices,
also went down to 6.53 percent in October compared to 6.79
percent in September.
</P>
<P>
"The rate at which money supply has been growing has been more
than satisfactorily slow for a period of more than six months,"
said CBK chief Maurice Kanga.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling's recovery since its August fall has also helped,
said Kanga. "That has also acted as a brake on the upward move in
inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Overall and underlying inflation had risen in September as the
suspension of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan worth 205
million U.S. Dollars took effect in August.
</P>
<P>
The suspension prompted a sharp fall in the Shilling, of
around 25 percent to more than 70 to the Dollar in August,
pushing up import prices.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a package of government tax increases to
plug the gap left by the IMF money also pushed up inflation.
</P>
<P>
But in September and October the Shilling recovered, trading
between 60 and 65 to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said annual inflation rates should continue to fall
as the current rains put downward pressure on food prices.

SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Calendars depicting local
conditions and customs in old Shanghai have gained great
popularity with collectors in the municipality, according to local
experts.
</P>
<P>
Fan Ganping, the representative of a local auction company,
said that calendars dating from the end of Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) to the Republic of China (1912-1949) era have high
artistic value and are valuable for studies of modern history, as
well as China's history of painting and business.
</P>
<P>
A large number of the calendars, which feature famous actors
during the period, contain the characteristics of both western and
traditional Chinese painting. Fan said the calendars are
considered to be the first form of modern advertising in China.
</P>
<P>
An auction scheduled for November 20-22 will feature seven old
calendars painted by famous artists, including "Women of China" by
Zhen Mantuo, one of the originators of Shanghai calendars. The
calander is expected to sell for between 10,000-15,000 yuan
(1,200-1,800 US dollars). "Tennis Girl" by Xie Zhiguang is
expected to sell for between 8,000-10,000 yuan.

Old calendars, especially works painted by famous artists such
as Zhou Muqiao, Hang Zhiying and Jin Meisheng, were sold for high

<HEADLINE> Electric Power Bill Passed in Kenyan Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Electric Power Bill has
gone through the second reading in Kenyan Parliament with a view
to liberalizing the generation and distribution of electricity in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily Nation today noted that the Bill
would end the monopoly of power generation and distribution in
Kenya by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
It provides for a five percent levy to be charged on power
consumed in the country for development of power distribution,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi M'Mukindia as
saying Wednesday that only 10 percent of the Kenyan population
enjoy power supply and that the levy is meant to increase the
percentage.
</P>
<P>
During the debate on the Bill, Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti noted that the Bill would open the way for private sector
participation in the generation and distribution of power.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the passage of the Bill would facilitate the
release of funds withheld by donors for the power sector as the
Bill featured in the decision of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to suspend a 205 million U.S. Dollars loan to Kenya last
July.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party Leader Stresses Role of Cooperative Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's top leader Do Muoi said
the cooperative economic sector and cooperatives play a very great
role and substantially contribute to the current process of
national industrialization and modernization.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam made
this remarks at a national conference on model cooperatives held
here Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over more than four decades, the party has always affirmed the
role of the cooperative economic sector and cooperatives in the
national economy, Muoi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, at the onset of a new period when a new
economic policy was implemented, the party and government had not
been well prepared for the changes, leading to many state and
cooperative establishments finding themselves in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
He praised the efforts of the cooperative economic sector to
rise out of its crisis by reorganizing itself and changing its
performance.
</P>
<P>
The party leader was optimistic that the sector and
cooperatives have been making more and more production, creating
more jobs and increasing the incomes of employees. their operation
has contributed positively to the economic development of the
country as well as localities.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the country's policy of a multi-sectoral economy,
the general secretary reaffirmed the party's persistence with the
policy, "encouraging all businesses, and all individuals in the
country, including those from abroad to make further investment in
long-term, legal businesses."
</P>
<P>
He declared that "all economic sectors are equal before laws,
regardless of their forms of ownership and business."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to bring the potential and positive
nature of all economic sectors into full play while at the same
time renovating and developing the state and cooperative sectors
to turn them into the foundation of the national economy,
consistent with the socialist-oriented line of Vietnam's
multi-sectoral economy.
</P>
<P>
Muoi said, "any signs of separating reform and development of
the state economic sector and cooperative sector, or belittling
the role of the cooperative sector in the multi-sectoral economy,
go against the views of the party and state."

</P>
<P>
In July of this year, central China's Anhui Province chose
seven colleges to conduct free training for displaced
workers. More than 600 people attended courses on the maintenance
of household electrical devices, computer applications and other
practical skills during a one-month period. Many found new jobs
after completing their training.
</P>
<P>
Those who have relatively good jobs also learn practical
knowledge about improving their opportunities.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the People's University and concerned
departments of the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau show that
in 1996, 81 percent of Beijing residents over the age of 15 had
attended training courses.
</P>
<P>
Foreign language was the leading choice of training, with 33
percent of surveyed people. The second choice was social sciences
which includes accounting, law, finance, trade, enterprise
management, and computer applications. The remainder fell under
medical treatment and health care, industrial technologies,
culture and art, natural sciences, cosmetology and family affairs.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese people also are buying practical
books. Information from Xinhua Book Stores in Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, shows that the monthly sales
volume of six kinds of books -- foreign languages, computers,
market economic theory, law, modern science and technology, and
teaching materials for adults to study on themselves -- double the
figures from three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Investors confidence intact in Zambia after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's central bank has said
that investor confidence in Zambian economy remains intact after
the October 28 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Maily today quoted Kabinga Pande, public
relations manager of Bank of Zambia (BOZ) as saying Wednesday
that "investors anywhere in the world are very sensitive toward
any sudden shocks. it is, therefore, perfectly normal to expect
the coup attempt to have some jitters reverberating in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"However, they are counteracted by stronger confidence factors
such as the foiling of the coup and the nation-wide support for
government exhibited in the aftermath," he said in a statement
here.
</P>
<P>
Pande said the confidence in the Zambian economy was further
manifested in the insignificant movement of the exchange rate in
the past few days which had largely remained stable.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the exchange rate could be attributed to the
favorable supply conditions and the strong performance by
non-traditional exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pande said, "in addition, ZCCM (Zambia consolidated Copper
Mines) has continued to sell foreign exchange smoothly to the
market. This has helped to boost confidence in the foreign
exchange market."

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The last boundary marker on
the eastern section of the China-Russia border has been erected
recently, marking the completion of a field survey of the border.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have erected 1,170 boundary markers along the
4,300-km eastern section of the Sino-Russian border. The field
survey began in April of 1993, with the first boundary marker
erected by the Tumen River.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shiqiu, the Chinese chief representative to the
Sino-Russian Joint Borderline Survey Commission, described the
completion as "being of major political and historical
significance," especially on the eve of the fifth summit meeting
between the heads of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> d p s  2502 China-Three Gorges-Resettlement Resettlement Drive Leads to Wider Prospects for Development: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 6 (Xinhua) -- Although a
total of 1.2 million residents will have to move out of their
native places, the Three Gorges Project will give rise to a more
vigorous economy in the backward reservoir areas, a senior project
official declared here today.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement drive for the Three Gorges Project is of
crucial importance to the project, and in the past five years,
initial results have been scored in relocating local residents
with a cumulative state input of 8.575 billion yuan, said Qi Lin,
vice-chairman of the State Council Three Gorges Construction
Committee, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A total of 82,300 residents have moved out of their original
homes by the end of September, and the number to be relocated is
expected to rise to 10,000 at the year-end.
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement of residents in both dam and reservoir areas
have been going on smoothly, thereby paving the way for a steady
progress of the project," according to Qi, who is also director of
the Resettlement and Development Bureau under the construction
committee.
</P>
<P>
Qi went on to say that the relocation endeavor also lifted
people in backward reservoir areas out of poverty. The net income
of peasant farmers in Wanxian, Fuling, and Yichang of the
reservoir area in 1996, for instance, was more than double the
figures in 1993 and exceeding the rate of income growth in the
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
But the relocation work for the first-phase project was only a
beginning of the resettlement drive, as the number of local
displaced accounts merely for one tenth of the 1.2 million
residents to be relocated when the project is completed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
And a total of 500,000 residents would be resettled and 624
enterprises moved during the second phase of the project, between
1998 and 2003, he said. Another 71,600 residents are expected to
displaced next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the resettlement target for the second phase is sure
to be materialized, thanks to adequate experience accumulated in
the development-oriented resettlement program, th upgraded
infrastructures in the reservoir area, the implementation of still
more state preferential policies to be granted by the State
Council, and intensified financial support from some 50 government
departments, 20 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions,
and particularly 10 designated cities, Qi said.

<HEADLINE> 518 Youths Rescued from Rebel Group in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 518 rebels and
youths captured by Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) have either been
rescued and surrendered since October 2, a report from the north
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper "The New Vision" quoted Brigadier
James Kazini, commander of the Fourth Division of the Ugandan
army, as saying that 212 of them with 80 rifles surrendered or
were captured by the Ugandan army in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said another 306 youths held in the army
barracks in the north have been handed over to the World Vision
International, a non-government organization for medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The LRA, abducting youths or children to fill its ranks, has
700-1,000 members now, Kazini told local journalists last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The mixture of the real rebels and the abducted youths or even
children imposed additional difficulties to the army, the
brigadier said.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is a rebel group of Christian fundamentalists acting
in the north which launched a 10-year guerilla war to overthrow
the Ugandan government led by President Yoweri Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Businesses Flock to Three Gorges Area (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 5 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yu, 27,
and his wife live in southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality
and work for the Wahaha Group Fuling Co. Ltd., a venture with
projected 1997 sales of over 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors admire the couple which will have combined earnings
of over 24,000 yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yu spoke emotionally about his experiences while working at
the Fuling Cannery in Sichuan Province some three years ago. He
noted that the Three Gorges Project will inundate the area around
the cannery. Liu said his family formerly lived in a dormitory
with only 10 sq.m. of living space and he earned less than a
quarter of his present income.
</P>
<P>
The Wahaha Group in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, currently provides assistance to Fuling City in the
Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The fact that Wahaha has merged and
reorganized three local loss-making factories in the area
scheduled for inundation has brought great changes to Liu's family.
</P>
<P>
The most important aspect, however, rests with company's great
success.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhijian, general manager of Fuling Co. Ltd., a Wahaha
subsidiary, said the group took the lead by investing in Fuling in
line with the central government's call for companies to provide
support for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. He said the move
enabled the company to record an 8-fold increase in its market
share in the southwest China market.
</P>
<P>
One economist noted that the Wahaha Group's success is not only
the result of government support and encouragement, but also the
natural outcome for enterprises attempting to expand under fierce
market competitions.
</P>
<P>
Designated assistance programs are a form of preferential
policies the State Council adopted to advance resettlement efforts
in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The ultimate goal is to
increase the resettlement capacity, develop leading industries and
advance economic development in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lixing, general manager of the Shanghai Baimao (White Cat)
Co. Ltd. in Southwest China, points to the fact that Chinese
enterprises have entered a developmental period featuring
structural readjustments of property rights, offering an
opportunity for enterprises to undertake transregional takeovers,
partnerships or mergers, in order to ensure that assistance
programs expand opportunities for development.

<HEADLINE> Rains Kill 4 More People in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Continuous heavy rains have
killed at least four more people, including a five-year-old girl
and caused about 5,000 livestock drowned in raging floods in the
central and coastal Kenya during the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Three people drowned in Mathira Division of Nyeri District
while another was swept away by the swollen Tana River in
Kirinyaga District, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 head of cattle and about 4,000 goats drowned
in raging floods in Tana River district.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 200 travellers are stranded in Kilifi town by
flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Kenya's Meteorological Department (MD) show
that the port city of Mombasa had received 761 mm of rainfall in
20 days last month while its usual October average is 97 mm.
</P>
<P>
The department said the unrelenting rains are caused by the
"El Nino" which started in March/April and would reach maturity
in December with most rains falling in November in this east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The "El Nino" phenomenon is the result of abnormal rises in
sea surface temperatures in the Pacific region, leading to
extreme worldwide climatic conditions such as cyclones, floods
and droughts.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, its effects were last registered in the 1984
drought.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Nutrition Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A four-day UNESCO-sponsored
conference opened here Wednesday, bringing together international
academics to discuss latest research on nutritional diseases.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first to be held in Africa, will among
other topics, focus on nutritional and health aspects of
traditional African diets and anti-oxidant properties of
essential indigenous oils and ethnic foods.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps,
officially opening the conference, noted that the meeting came at
a time when the prospects of good harvests were questionable
because of the El Nino factor.
</P>
<P>
''It is during this time that proper selection of food and
cash crops should be emphasised in order to prevent and control
diseases,'' said Stamps.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there was a tendency in developing countries
to presume that ''over-refined'' western diets were better than
less refined traditional diets.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this mistaken view had brought about diseases
which Africa's forefathers never experienced notwithstanding the
inherent health costs of western diets, he said.
</P>
<P>
''When addressing health problems the fundamental importance
of adequate nutrition can never be over emphasised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''there is need to focus and elaborate not only
on nutritional quantity but quality as practical solutions to
disease control.''

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Law to Hit India's Seafood Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India's seafood exports to
the United States are expected to be hit by the latter's new law
on food hygiene, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, all seafood items imported by the United
States will have to meet the hazard analysis critical control
point (HACCP) guidelines. The norms, which come into effect on
December 18, pose a threat to India's seafood exports worth about
5 billion rupees (138.89 million U.S. dollars) to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move follows a ban imposed by the European Union (EU)
earlier on imports of Indian seafood items for failure to meet
hygiene conditions.
</P>
<P>
India's seafood exports have suffered a setback during the
current year due to the ban imposed by the EU, which has also
recommended a total ban for an unlimited period after an
inspection of the Indian production units by an EU team revealed
poor hygiene conditions.
</P>
<P>
The EU has stipulated that these farms must meet EU standards
of hygiene if they are to export to the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The ban, if it were to continue for an entire year, would hit
exports worth about 15 billion rupees (416.67 million dollars) as

almost 30 percent of India's seafood exports are to the EU
countries. Exports to the United States account for another 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the EU case, the Indian Commerce Ministry is to give
a guarantee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on behalf of
the Indian units whereby the government certifies that the
exporters are meeting HACCP guidelines.

DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Wednesday held out a bounteous offer of incentives for
foreign capital investment in her country, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The incentives include foreign ownership virtually without
limit, generous tax holidays, legal protection to investment,
repatriation of capital and profits with capital gains and
residency permits for foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
"Besides being a good domestic market, Bangladesh is also a
gateway to the huge market in South Asia, where the concept of
free trade is taking firm roots," the prime minister told a group
of prospective investors attending a three-day investors' forum
from November 5 to 7.
</P>
<P>
"With the dawning of the new century not too far away,
Bangladesh stands poised to enter an era of unprecedented
opportunities to achieve sustained industrial development," Hasina
said. She invited the foreign investors to seize the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister assured that her government would continue
to pursue policies to make Bangladesh a very attractive place for
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
She also apprised the investors that sectors like power
generation, oil and gas exploration, telecommunications, port
development and highways and bridges construction have already
been opened for private investment.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said government policies are geared toward creating an
environment where the private sector could play its role
effectively as the engine for growth.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all sectors of the economy are now open for private
investment," she added.
</P>
<P>
"You are most welcome to see for yourselves the many
opportunities for investment that we have created since we took
charge of the administration in June last year," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives of 50 international companies are attending
the forum jointly organized by the Bangladeshi government and The
Financial Times, a newspaper published in London, to promote
foreign investment in this undeveloped South Asian country.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in north China's
Hebei Province are to promote a special card among motorists with
the aim of reducing the number of hit-and-run cases, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The card, known as the Green Aid Card, was first issued last
year in the city of Luquan by the local traffic department in
collaboration with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing-based Legal Daily, victims of accidents
caused by card-holding drivers are entitled to immediate free
medical treatment in Luquan Accident Emergency Center or other
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The card guarantees medical treatment up to 10,000 yuan. The
annual fee for the card is 80 yuan for a car driver and 60 yuan
for a motorcyclist.
</P>
<P>
Many drivers admitted that they fled after the accidents
because they feared having to pay large amounts of compensation to
victims.
</P>
<P>
"By introducing the Green Aid Card, we are aiming to reduce
pressure on one single driver in an accident by sharing the
expenses incurred", said Du Zhicheng, chief of Hebei Traffic
Administration Bureau's Accident Department.
</P>
<P>
A government report said there were more than one million
traffic accidents reported in China last year, 20 percent of these
involved hit-and-run drivers.

<HEADLINE> India to Promote Trade Ties With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India expects to promote trade
ties with and investment in Myanmar through a trade exhibition due
to open here tomorrow, Indian Ambassador to Myanmar Shyam Saram
told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The week-long Indian Trade Exhibition, sponsored by the Indian
Trade Promotion Organization, will be participated by two dozen
prestigious Indian companies, which will display a wide range of
products and technologies covering pharmacy, machinery, textiles,
cosmetics and food, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second trade exhibition India has held in
Myanmar since the first one in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
A seminar associated with the exhibition will also take place
and panelists will explore new opportunities for investment and
trade after Myanmar's entry into Association of Southeast Asian
Nations earlier this year and its proposed entry into BIST-EC
(Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand-Economic Cooperation),
he said.
</P>
<P>
India is one of Myanmar's five major trading partners, with
trade volume between them amounting to about 240 million U.S.
dollars in the 1995-96 fiscal year. Of the total, India's exports
to Myanmar were 35 million to 40 million dollars while its imports
from the country were valued at 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade between the two countries has been
traditionally in favor of Myanmar, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
India mainly sells to Myanmar iron and steel products, cement,
chemicals, rubber products, transport equipment, drugs, jute
products and cotton yarn while importing from it beans and pulses,
timber and timber products.
</P>
<P>
India formally entered into a border trade agreement in April
1995 with Myanmar, one of its immediate neighbors, and border
trade activities are carried out at points of Moreh (India) and
Tamu (Myanmar).
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian ambassador, the border trade between
the two countries was recorded at 15 million to 20 million dollars
since its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Shri
Saleem I Shervani is due to arrive here later today for the
inauguration of the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vast Potential for Sino-Russia Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia have seen their
trade and economic cooperation develop smoothly in recent years
and bilateral trade has remained high.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that bilateral trade value in 1993 hit a record
high of 7.68 billion U.S. dollars and reached 6.85 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russia has been China's eighth largest trading partner
and China ranks among the three leading partners of Russia in its
trade with countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation
has been developing at multiple levels, including the governmental
level, regional level and entrepreneurial level.
</P>
<P>
China is sending more trade delegates to Russia and trading
exchanges between small enterprises and individual businessmen are
also occurring often. As a result, Russia has seen a continuous
influx of consumer products from China into its markets.
</P>
<P>
Each year, China supplies Russia with tens of thousands of tons
of pork. Instant noodles, canned meats and spices from China are
no rare things in Moscow's food markets. Today, Chinese
manufactured goods, including toys, stationery and children's
clothing make a large proportion of the commodities on sale in
Moscow's "Children's World" department store.
</P>
<P>
And Moscow residents like leather shoes, fur clothing and
knitwear from China, which is usually reasonably priced and good
in quality.
</P>
<P>
As two of Asia's biggest neighboring countries, China and
Russia have a vast potential for conducting economic and trade
cooperation, with their economies complementary to each other very
well. The two countries are now working very hard to bring
bilateral trade volume up to 20 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
Now conditions exist for the two countries to speed up their
pace of cooperation in extra-large projects, such as those of
energy, timber and nonferrous metals. The Far East of Russia has
shown interest in sending natural gas, oil and electricity to
China. With one of the world's largest timber deposits, more than
half of which are mature and ready for cutting, the Russian side
also enjoys bright prospects for cooperation with the Chinese in
the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the cooperation arena can be even wider if
the two sides can be more positive in replacing capital investment
with technological investment. The reason is that Russia has some
advanced technologies that are waiting to be applied in industry,
while China has many applied technologies in the consumer goods
and electric appliance area.
</P>
<P>
Russia still enjoys a competitive edge in the industries of air,
space, and power instruments. If it can change its way of payment,
and better its after-sales service, it can gain some advantages in
the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In order to allow Russian consumers to gain a better knowledge
of Chinese brand-name products and cultivate a good image, the
Chinese side is preparing to open large Chinese department stores
in Russia, each containing several thousand square meters.
</P>
<P>
The department stores will mainly provide middle-priced Chinese
commodities and Chinese snacks. The Chinese side also suggests
that Russia organize its big entrepreneurs and have them visit
China and see what the Chinese markets have to offer with their
own eyes and to buy Chinese commodities in China so as to reduce
the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
With the economy of China and Russia continuing to develop, the
future of economic cooperation between the two countries grows
even brighter.

NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
agreed on privatization of Internet service in the country in a
bid to increase Internet users, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
There will be no limit on the number of private Internet
service providers (PISPs), for whom port and leased line charges
will be fixed at "promotional rates."
</P>
<P>
The railways, power grid corporation and state electricity
boards have been permitted to lease out their excess capacity to
PISPs, who have also been given the freedom to choose the gateway
to be used, subject to the approval of the Inter-Ministerial
Implementation Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Market forces will be allowed to determine the access fee
which PISPs will charge from their respective users," the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has adopted the Internet privatization
policy to increase the number of Internet users in the country
from 40,000 to between 1.5 million and 2 million by the turn of
the century, the sources stressed.

MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Belarus Foreign Minister Ivan

neutral state by joining the Non-aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Antonovich made the remarks while meeting the press in the

A motivation behind Belarus' efforts to acquire a membership of
the Non-aligned Movement, he explained, is the policy priority to
reiterate the country's neutrality in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Non-aligned Movement's member nations and former Soviet
republics have many of their characteristics in common, such as
the vulnerability of their economic structures, he noted.

LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed
and at least 25 others were injured today when an explosion ripped
through a toy factory in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred about 3:20 p.m. on the second floor in the
manufacturing area of the Imperial Toy Corp. building. It blew the
windows out of the block-long building in an industrial area.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people work in the building.
</P>
<P>
Fire department spokesman Steve Ruda told reporters that most
of the injured were treated at the scene and some were taken to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, though
fire officials said a machine used for shrink-wrap might have been
involved. The factory uses gunpowder to make caps for toy pistols.
</P>
<P>
Imperial Toy Corp. is licensed to produce toys for Universal
Studios and Pepsi, among others. The company also makes marbles,
soap bubbles, jump ropes, balls, toy soldiers and other
playthings.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $10 Billion Stand-By Credit for Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved stand-by credit for Indonesia by
authorizing withdrawals of 10.14 billion U.S. dollars over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The credit is earmarked to support Indonesia's macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform program. Of the total, 3.04
billion dollars are available immediately, and a further SDR
(special drawing rights) 2.2 billion will be available after March
15, 1998, provided that the end of the year performance targets
have been met and the first review of the program completed.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent disbursements, on a quarterly basis, will be made
available subject to the attainment of performance targets and
program reviews.
</P>
<P>
The stand-by credit is equivalent to 490 percent of Indonesia's
quota of about 2.07 billion dollars equivalent in the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In approving Indonesia's request for the stand-by credit, the
IMF made use of the accelerated procedures established under the
Emergency Financing Mechanism (EFM), which was adopted in
September 1995. The EFM strengthens the IMF's ability to respond
swiftly in support of a member country facing an external
financial crisis and seeking financial assistance from the IMF to
help a strong economic adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of Indonesia's program are to limit the
downturn in growth, to reduce the current account deficit to 2
percent of GDP, and maintain gross official reserves at about 5
months of imports.
</P>
<P>
In addition to IMF funding, the Indonesian reform program
will be supported by financing from the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank, which have made notable contributions.
Meanwhile, Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore, and the United States have indicated that they would
provide additional resources if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, the IMF Managing Director, said today's
approval "marks an important step in the process of stabilizing the
financial markets in Southeast Asia. The bold policy actions
being undertaken by the authorities should not only help restore
confidence in the Indonesian economy, but also do much to help
calm the turmoil that has been sweeping the region since July."

<HEADLINE> Renaming of Los Angeles Airport Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles International
Airport will be renamed Jimmy Stewart International Airport if a
proposal is endorsed by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mike Antonovich, city council supervisor of this second largest
U.S. metropolis, said today that the airport should be renamed
after the actor who flew 20 World War II combat missions.
</P>
<P>
Few people know Gen. Jimmy Stewart as a brilliant fighter
against fascism rather than a star in Hollywood movies such as
"It's Wonderful Life," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and
"Vertigo," Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the supervisor said, he would ask other members of
the city council to back his recommendation to the L.A. Airport
Commission.
</P>
<P>
After playing successfully many roles in Hollywood, Stewart
joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at the age of 32 and was assigned
to command the 703rd Squadron in Britain, where he earned the
Distinguished Flying Cross and became colonel of the Second Air
Division.
</P>
<P>
All these, Antonovich said, are the reasons that are more than
enough to honor Stewart, who after the war served as an Air Force
reserve officer and died July 2 at age of 89.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles International Airport is the fourth busiest airport
in the world based on the number of passengers and the first based
on tons of air cargo handled.

YANGON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making efforts to

</P>
<P>
The MDE exported the first Myanmar-built ship, a 38-meter sea

the second one in January 1996 which was a 29-meter pusher tug.
</P>
<P>
This year, the MDE is contracted to build eight vessels for
Singapore and Chinese companies.

<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has built 31 vessels
by itself for cargo and passenger services while having imported
103 vessels in the past nine years to improve its inland water
transport.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that the country had 721 state-owned

<HEADLINE> Chinese Steel Company Awarded ISO Quality Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua Iron and Steel
(Group) Co, a large State-owned enterprise in southwest China ,
has passed quality accreditation for some of its products and been
awarded ISO9000 certification, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the two years' efforts by the company to
implement ISO9000 series of quality standards, said Hong Jibi, the
group's president.
</P>
<P>
"The certification gives us a passport to enter the
international market and acquire a larger market share," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
To assure clients of its quality, the company began to apply
for ISO9000 certification two years ago.
</P>
<P>
So far, 110 Chinese metallurgical enterprises have passed
ISO9000 standards accreditation. This has improved their market
share and enhanced their reputation, according to the Ministry of
the Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua Iron and Steel (Group) Co is one of the country's
largest iron and steel producers and the largest producer of
vanadium, titanium and steel for railway lines.
</P>
<P>
The company will continue its efforts to diversify production
and services to satisfy domestic and foreign customers, although
it faces difficulties, including lower level of corporate
investment, slow payment from clients and heavy social burdens.
</P>
<P>
The company's annual steel production capacity will reach 3
million tons this year. It will continue to diversify its
fund-raising activities in coming years, by using such methods as
organizing joint-stock companies and listing its subsidiaries on
stock exchanges, Hong said.
</P>
<P>
The company is now working towards listing H shares on the Hong
Kong stock market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Minsheng Banking Corp, a
non-State bank of China, will consolidate its links with the
country's private sector by intensifying its financial support for
non-State businesses while amplifying studies of the sector,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The private sector was upgraded from "a supplement part" to "a
significant constituent" of the national economy during the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng, whose shares are held mainly by private firms, should
seek synchronous development with the sector, said the bank's new
president, Cai Lulun.
</P>
<P>
Cai said his bank intended to partner the All-China Federation
of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) to research the development of
China's private economy, thus gaining a clearer picture of the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The result of the research will serve as basic knowledge for
Minsheng's cooperation with these firms. The research is also
expected to generate beneficial information for private firms'
business development, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng's total capital, registered at 1.3 billion yuan (166
million U.S. dollars) when it opened, had reached 8.6 billion yuan
(1.03 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of last year. Experts
estimated that the figure has now exceeded 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank managed to earn 12 million yuan (1.4 million
U.S. dollars) in its first year of operation, and is already in
discussions with the International Financial Corp (IFC), the
private arm of the World Bank, regarding IFC equity investment in
the bank.
</P>
<P>
It is the first partnership between an international body and a
Chinese non-State bank.
</P>
<P>
IFC has started a technical assistance program for the
bank. It also plans to arrange long-term lending.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Defense Ministry Warns of Forged Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry
said Wednesday that a warning letter issued on October 18 under
the name of the ministry was a forged document.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that it had never issued
such a letter under the heading "general security warning to all
public, mercantile and banking sector establishments" and asked
all institutions concerned to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to some banking and mercantile institutions
three days after the massive bombing of Colombo's downtown
business center by the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam on October 15 and signed by an "H. S. de Silva" purporting
to be a secretary of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Typed on paper with a Defense Ministry letterhead, the letter
said, "Investigators have positively identified three
organizations which are run as individual companies, but are
financed by the terrorist movement."
</P>
<P>
The letter advised the institutions to exercise "extreme
caution" and avoid doing business with the three companies, which
it said are run as office equipment suppliers and computer and
software sellers. It even listed the names and addresses of the
three companies.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry denied in the press release that there is
such a person by that name in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The letter was taken seriously by the business circle following
the truck bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
The ministry charged that the letter had been issued for some
ulterior purposes and it has asked police to probe into the
matter.

<HEADLINE> Czech Foreign Exchange Reserves Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange reserves of the
Czech Republic dropped sharply this year as a result of economic
hardships and sluggish economic development, a spokesman from the
Czech National Bank said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pavel Palivec said the
country's foreign exchange reserves had totaled 14.68 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of September, 2.79 billion less than the
figure at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the sharp drop in foreign exchange
reserves was also attributed to huge financial deficits, the
weakening of the national currency and huge foreign trade deficits
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
To increase its reserves, the Czech government is seeking loans
from international banks while taking a series of austerity
measures, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Endorse Acupuncture Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. medical expert
committee today endorsed Chinese traditional needle therapy
acupuncture as part of the mainstream American medicine.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member committee selected by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) said that "clear evidence" has been found that
acupuncture effectively treats pain after surgery or dental
procedures and controls nausea and vomiting caused by cancer
chemotherapy or pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The committee also said in a report that acupuncture also is
effective in some patients for tennis elbow, muscle pain and
menstrual cramps.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time there is a public statement from the Health
and Human Services that acupuncture might have a role in treating
certain health problems," said Dr. Helga Well-Apelt, a medical
doctor who uses Chinese medicine in her practice.
</P>
<P>
"It can now be called real medicine," said Dr. Bradley J.
Williams, president of the American Academy of Medical
Acupuncture, an organization of about 3,000 doctors certified to
perform acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
With a history of more than 2,000 years, acupuncture is a major
part of an Asian tradition of medicine. The practice of the
therapy involves sticking thin, sharpened needles into specific
nerve junction points on the body. The needles often are rotated
or electrically stimulated.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in
the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation
only after late U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in
1972.

<HEADLINE> Giant Project Monument in World's Water Control History (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to
block the Yangtze River - the world's third largest river in two
days. The damming process will be the most difficult and complex
in the history of the human race's endeavor to tame waters.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate the designed discharge and maxim water depth
at the damming point will be 1.75 times and 1.3 times respectively
the current world records. So the damming is therefore cited as
the biggest challenge for the Three Gorges project, the world's
largest water control scheme, since its initiation five years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not the first, let alone the last world-class
problem that has to be dealt with in the mammoth project. A
3,726-m "man-made Yangtze", or the water diversion channel to
handle navigation after the damming, is 58 m deep and its bed is
about 350 m wide. Both figures surpass those of the Suez and
Panama canals.
</P>
<P>
The two 80-plus-m-high earth and stone cofferdams to be built
after the river blockage will be the biggest deep-water cofferdams
in the world.
</P>
<P>
A permanent shiplock of the project demands hewing a ravine
with a width of several hundred meters and a depth of 170 m from
its bottom, while a supporting shiplift will be able to lift a
3,000-DWT (dead weight tonnage) 130 m, making it the world's
largest shiplift.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Three Gorges Dam requires the pouring of
twice the amount of concrete for Brazil's Itaipu hydropower
station, currently the world's biggest.
</P>
<P>
Upon its completion in the year 2009, the Three Gorges
Hydropower Station will have a total installed capacity of 18.2
million kw and generate a total of 84.7 billion kwh a year, 5.6
million kw and 13 billion kwhs more than those of Itaipu.

JAKARTA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Fire razed 240 houses in
Indonesia's South Sumatra provincial capital of Palembang before
dawn on Wednesday, rendering 1,581 people homeless and injuring
three others, Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the houses were traditional ones built of wood, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters who mobilized 16 fire engines managed to put out
the blaze three hours later.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Palembang Municipality Risdan Zein estimated the
material loss caused by the fire at 2 billion rupiah (about
650,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report did not give the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of fires in the country in the past few
months due to prolonged drought. The forest fires raging in
Sumatra, Kalimantan, Irian Jaya and Java Islands since mid-August
this year have damaged more than 1.7 million hectares of forest
and caused a total loss of 3.5 billion dollars, official sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban FM Hails U.N. Vote Against U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina said today that the United Nations' vote against the
United States' embargo on his country is a vote of
dignity, courage, justice and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said the wide support in the General Assembly given to
his government's call for immediate lift of the long-imposed
embargo was a clear sign that the world is not willing to accept
anything against sovereignty of states and liberty of commerce.
</P>
<P>
"The United States attempted to deviate and influence the
position of Ibero-American countries towards Cuba, but all the
countries that it intended to incite against Cuba voted today in
support of it. The message could not be more clear and louder," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister interpreted today's victory as a "proof
that his country will never be let alone in its struggle and that
humanity confide in its perseverance, in its talent to find
solutions and in its vocation of winner."
</P>
<P>
Robaina also stressed the importance of the U.N. support for
Cuba, which came days before the beginning of the Ibero-American
Summit in the Margarita Island, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
In today's vote, there are 137 votes in favor of Cuba`s call
and 25 abstentions, with the United States, Israel and Uzbekistan
voting against it.

<TEXT>
<P>
Owing to all these achievements, the Three Gorges project can
be rated as a monument in the history of water conservation
endeavors, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
When water conservation experts both at home and overseas
regard participation in the Three Gorges project as a rare
opportunity, more international businesses view their linkage with
the project as an invisible asset in market competition.
</P>
<P>
Per Olav Kvarv, a Norwegian consultant on the damsite, said the
Three Gorges project is "the most exciting" one among the water
control projects he has taken part in. And a Swedish manufacturer
of building machinery called it a precious business opportunity as
well as a milestone in water conservation techniques.
</P>
<P>
To win the orders for the project's first batch of 14
generating units#,almost all the world's leading businesses from
Britain, France, Germany, the Switzerland, Canada, Norway and
Russia incorporated preferential export credit in their bidding
letters.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian-German group and a French-Swiss group won the bid
eventually. A high-ranking official from the CYTGPDC, the
project's proprietor, called the prices of the units and auxiliary
preferences "very paying".
</P>
<P>
More than 4,600 hydroelectric and dam specialists from over 40
countries and regions have since 1994 come to the Three Gorges
worksite, contributing their invaluable opinions on the techniques
for river blockage, pouring of high-intensity concrete, and
digging of the permanent shiplock.
</P>
<P>
CYTGPDC Deputy General Manager Wang Jiazhu noted that more
knotty, world-class technical problems might crop up during the
next 12 years for the project.
</P>
<P>
"However, China will strive to cope with them, and will
sincerely welcome cooperation from experts and business firms from
the international water conservation circles," said Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China has opened its first
national wholesale market of audio and video products, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Guangdong Audio and Video Emporium (GDAVE),
under the Ministry of Culture supervision, is the first of four
planned markets.
</P>
<P>
It added the other three will open in Beijing, Shanghai and
Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanfang, vice-governor of Guangdong province, said GDAVE was
created as a result of the province's success in eradicating
illegally copied and pornographic audio and visual products.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, the province has broken 45 illegal
disk production lines and closed six disk factories implicated in
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
It also banned more than 30 illegal audio and visual product
distribution centers. Provincial officials confiscated more than
six million illegally copied audio and visual products.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xiaoju, vice-minister of culture, said at the opening
ceremony that the market's
operation, with the other three centers, will consolidate China's
achievements in battling production of pornographic and illegally
copied audio and video items.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Audio and Video Emporium will be the general
distribution center of audio and video products in the
province. Other wholesale activities will be strictly forbidden.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President
Ernesto Perez Balladares, in a radio speech today, ruled out the
possibility of privatizing some of the Panama Canal services.
</P>
<P>
The Canal, he said, will always work for the national interest.
</P>
<P>
"Panama does not mean a Canal, not politics, ... it means the
essence of we all who live in this land, so I am struggling to
defend this inside and outside our borders," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Canal, now under U.S. control but scheduled to return to
the Panamanian sovereignty before the year 2000, will be
administered by the Panamanian people, Balladares added.
</P>
<P>
The Torrijos-Carter Treaties, signed between Panama and the
United States in 1977, are to abolish a colonial system and to
return to Panama its most important geographical resource, he said.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Moises Mizrachi, a Canal administration official,
suggested selling some services in the strait, an idea which
sparked persistent protests by employees working for the Canal.

BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises, the
backbone of China's rural economies, produced a value-added output
of 676.3 billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, up
17.8 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Rural firms supplied export commodities worth 400.8 billion
yuan in the first three quarters, up 17.6 percent from the same
period last year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, although facing shrinking market demand, the
sales-production ratio of the sector improved to 91.4 percent,
a 0.3 percentage point higher than last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the growth rate of rural industrial
value-added output in the central and western regions lagged
behind that in eastern regions, with 15.7 percent in the central
areas, 16.9 percent in the west and 18.9 percent in the east.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, with resources and manpower
advantages, central and western regions used to have higher growth
rates of rural industries than eastern regions, where rural
industries set out early and have fully boomed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese township enterprises are now responsible for nearly
half the country's industrial output and supply one-third of
China's exports. The sector supplied 135 million jobs in the rural
areas last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Penal Recognizes Acupuncture Merits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. National Institutes of
Health sponsored panel has concluded that acupuncture merits
inclusion in the comprehensive treatment for certain common
conditions, and called for further research in its application.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angles-based American Academy of Medical Acupuncture
(AAMA) announced this today and said in a press release that it is
pleased about the conclusions made by the NIH Consensus
Development Conference.
</P>
<P>
"The NIH-sponsored panel pointed out that when incorporated
into a comprehensive medical teatment program, acupuncture may be
as effective as many accepted conventional medical therapies,"
AAMA said.
</P>
<P>
"The panel particularly cited the low incidence of side effects
of acupuncture when compared to many accepted Western medical
therapies such as medications and invasive procedures," it added.
</P>
<P>
"These conclusions support AAMA's mission to offer the highest
quality health care to patients by combining the best of both
worlds into safe and effective medical care," it said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are
recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for
significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture
to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the
American healthcare system.
</P>
<P>
according to AAMA, NIH sees acupuncture applicable to treat low
back pain, asthma, adult post-operative and chemotherapy nausea,
post-operative dental pain, addiction, stroke rehabilitation,
headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, and carpal
tunnel syndrome.

CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard scraped his
controversial nursing home fees last night, declaring he had made
a mistake and promising the elderly they would no longer be forced
to sell their homes to pay the fees, a move considered by critics
as an attempt to win the votes of the aged in the next election.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal Parliament's bipartisan plan for
reconciliation by the Centenary of Federation in 2001 was in
tatters last night as head of an official aboriginal committee
declared war on a Native Title bill and the federal government,
and took the fight international.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Five of Australia's most dangerous criminals were on the run
last night after a jailbreak in the coastal city of Brisbane, in
which snipers from the outside fired high-powered rifles at guards
while the prisoners cut their way to freedom with bolt cutters and
diamond-encrusted wire.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney's headlong rush into new apartment developments is
showing signs of a slowdown, with two of the city's biggest

The project is designed to minimize saline drainable surplus,
and facilitate the eventual evacuation of all saline drainable
surplus from the Indus Basin to the Arabian Sea, and thereby
restore environmentally-sound irrigated agriculture in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> US: Israeli-Palestinian Talks Serious, Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators near
Washington were "serious and constructive" but "gaps remain."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously gaps remain, but the parties are getting down to
business," a State Department spokesman said. It was the first
U.S. comment on the Israeli-Palestinian talks, which went into a
second day today in Arlington, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added the U.S.-brokered talks, aimed at breaking
an eight-month negotiating deadlock, "were serious and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials gave differing assessments of
progress after the first day of talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The gaps are still there, especially on the main issues of
further redeployment and unilateral steps," Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said. "We are trying to work out the differences, but
we need a long, long time."
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy cited an improved
atmosphere and "huge efforts" being made by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that an agreement on a "full package" of measures
broadening the peace could be reached by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of an agreement, I hope by the end of the week
we'll be able to come to one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Carpet Found on Sun's Surface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists reported
today that they found that a high-energy "magnetic carpet"
wrapping the Sun could pack enough raw power to heat up its fiery
corona.
</P>
<P>
The carpet was envisioned as a vast carpet speckled with white
and black magnetic fields, some positive and some negative in
images made with data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO), a joint project of NASA and the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 of such magnetic fields are constantly shifting,
appearing and disappearing on the Sun's surface at any one time,
scientists told a briefing at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
Magnetic bands extend from positive to negative splotches, and
may carry energy from inside the Sun into the corona, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Each one of the carpet loops carries about as much energy as a
major power plant generates on Earth in a million years, Mandy
Hagenaar of the Utrecht University in the Netherlands said at the
briefing.
</P>
<P>
NASA's Joseph Gurman said there was enough evidence to confirm
that somehow, the heat transfer was taking place: "We think we
have enough energy in this continually replaced small scale
magnetic field that goes everywhere on the Sun to do the job."
</P>
<P>
However, Gurman said scientists still do not know what makes
the magnetic splotches appear in the carpet and then fade away.
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to understand how such a short-lived effect
could be driven by the magnetic dynamo layer that is over 100,000
miles (160,000 km) beneath the surface of the Sun," lead
researcher Alan Title said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This may be evidence that unknown processes are at work in or
near the solar surface that continuously form these loops all over
the Sun," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> US Scientists Report Gamma-Ray Halo Around Milky Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- American scientists said
that they have found a previously unknown gamma-ray halo
surrounding the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
It was found by NASA's Compton observatory, an orbiting
satellite that carries a gamma ray telescope and the findings were
presented Tuesday at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society.
</P>
<P>
"Some high-energy process is occurring out there," said Dave
Dixon, a researcher at the University of California-Riverside who
reported the halo's existence. "The space around our galaxy is
rather empty of the kind of things we would expect to generate
gamma rays in the observed brightness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The halo measures several trillion kilometers thick and extends
deep into outer space from the Milky Way, the galaxy containing
Earth.
</P>
<P>
In a system used to measure electromagnetic energy, a single
gamma ray photon has about 1 billion times as much energy as a
photon of ordinary visible light. But gamma rays are not visible
from Earth because they are absorbed by the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are trying to determine if gamma rays are generated
by some of the most fundamentally interesting events in the
universe, including the birth of a galaxy and the death throes of
a star.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Royal Opera House Saved From Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of donors came in time
and have saved Britain's Royal Opera House from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the opera house said today that a group of new
donors "has stepped in. I cannot reveal who they are. They are
financially underpinning our current difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The Royal Opera House, one of the most famous opera houses in
the world, has run into huge debt and might have to close within
days if no donors were come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
The opera's Covent Garden site is currently being redeveloped
in a controversial 358 million U.S. dollar scheme due for
completion by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lord Chadlington, chairman of the opera house, had admitted to
parliamentarians that the Royal Opera House's debts, which totaled
nearly 8 million U.S. dollars last April, might double by the time
the Covent Garden reopened.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Culture Secretary Chris Smith proposed that the
Royal Opera House and the English National Opera should share a
stage under radical government plans to solve the financial crisis
as the government could no longer afford to carry on subsidizing
two opera houses in London.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has angered many Britons who say having two
opera houses creates healthy competition.

<HEADLINE> US Official: UN Team to Press Saddam to Allow Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- the U.S. ambassador to the
U.N. said on Wednesday that a U.N. team dispatched to Baghdad was
not to negotiate, but to "read the riot act" to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, so that he could abide by U.N. decisions on
inspections of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"they have no mandate to negotiate... They will read Saddam
Hussein the riot act," bill Richardson told the House of
Representatives International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, consisting of three diplomats, held talks on
Wednesday with Iraqi officials in Baghdad on a dispute over Iraq's
refusal of Americans in three U.N. weapons inspection teams to
enter the country.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the U.N. team handed over a letter from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Saddam. According to the team, the
talks "ended with a very nice atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Richardson told the House panel the U.N. team would press upon
Saddam that he must "fully and unconditionally" allow the weapons
inspection teams to operate in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Iraqis) have no right to pick or choose who will be
on the teams... there is no room for any negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the United States would continue to work
through U.N. diplomatic channels on resolving the crisis, but he
added: "We are not -- and I repeat, we are not -- withholding
action of any kind."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Patience Over Suspension of U-2 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
urged patience for a U.N. decision of delaying U-2 flights over
Iraq as they would soon be resumed for the U.N. mission to monitor
the possible development of weapons of mass destruction there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Oval Office with reporters, Clinton said, "I
would ask the American people, and our allies around the world,
not to get too frustrated; to be patient, but to be firm (in
dealing with Iraq)."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has suspended flights of the U-2 spy planes,
originally scheduled to fly today through Friday, when a three-man
U.N. team is in Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi officials in an
effort to defuse a recent crisis triggered by Iraq's refusal of
Americans in three U.N. weapons inspection teams to enter the
country and threatening of shooting down U-2 planes if they fly
over its territorial sky.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the U.N. chief weapons inspector, said the
flights would resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that while U.N. suspension was a "frustrating
policy" as it "requires long-term patience and discipline," there
was reason not to be "too frustrated" as an inspection regime was
set up.
</P>
<P>
"Let's try to hold on to this inspection regime because that is
the most peaceful way" of dealing with weapons of mass
destructions, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed there
would be no negotiations with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
U-2 overflights. She said they would be resumed next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she had verified in a telephone conversation with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the U.N. three-man team
dispatched to Baghdad was not to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"They have no mandate to negotiate and they are not doing so,"
she said at a joint news conference with visiting German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
She also said she had been in touch with Butler and was told
that the U-2 overflights had not been canceled.
</P>
<P>
"It is merely postponed, so that that same flight will be
taking place, beginning next week," she said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Nears Deal to Invest in Cable TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The software giant Microsoft
Corporation is close to an agreement to invest up to 1 billion U.S.
dollars in the cable television operations of U S West, a regional
Bell telephone company, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft would buy as much as 6.3 percent of U S West's cable
business at the current stock price. More important, it would
further the software giant's strategy of turning the nation's
cable systems into the primary providers of high-speed access to
the Internet -- with Microsoft hoping to control the cable TV
customers to get on line.
</P>
<P>
In June, it said, in a similar deal, Microsoft agreed to pay
about the same amount for an 11.5 percent stake in another big
cable company, the Comcast Corporation.
</P>
<P>
It was also in close talks with the cable company
Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI). All its efforts were to press the
cable industry to make the large investments in the digital
technology and set-top boxes necessary for updating their
high-capacity networks for widespread Internet use.
</P>
<P>
The software maker also tried to convince the cable TV
providers that money spent on Internet technology will pay off in
the future. Already, the news has improved the cable industry's
status with Wall Street, having driven up the stock prices of many
cable companies, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The company also spent 425 million U.S. dollars earlier this
year to acquire WebTV Networks Inc., an Internet service provider,
and it is said to be working on ways to blend WebTV's set-top
technology with the Windows CE operating systems.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Urges Immediate End to U.S. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the
National Assembly of the Republic of Cuba Ricardo Alarcon de
Quesada today urged to put an end to U.S. embargo against his
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General assembly,
Quesada said since 1992, the General Assembly had been analyzing
the need to end the economic, commercial and financial blockade
against his country, but the United States had ignored the
resolutions adopted and had taken new measures to strengthen the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
Quesada said Washington could not cite a single
inter-governmental, religious or trade union organization in support
of its action. No other government, parliament or political party
endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Quesada said the infamous Helms-Burton Act of 1996 denied
Cuba's independence and overtly proclaimed the intention of
dominating Cuba totally, reviving the regulations and practices
that the world had been rejected for thirty years and included new
and more unsound ones, in contradiction with the international law
and the legitimate rights of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said nationalizations carried out by the Cuban
revolution were conducted in compliance with international law and
Cuban legislation, which contemplates proper, fair compensation
for the former owners regardless of their nationality. Based on
the laws, the matter was successfully solved with other states.
The United states was the only exception.
</P>
<P>
He said the blockade was not intended to defend the interests
of the former United States owners and had, in fact, harmed them.
The Helms-Burton Act, besides setting up a plan for the colonial
absorption of Cuba and seriously working against the rights of
other states, introduced an element which radically changed even
the United states position.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Vietnam in Inland Waterways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of a 73 million U.S. dollar equivalent
credit for Vietnam's inland waterways and port rehabilitation
project.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed to help restore key waterway routes and
port facilities in the Mekong Region. By improving waterways and
port infrastructure, the project will improve the life of the
people in the Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the project will enhance the capacity, efficiency
and safety of inland waterway transport in the Mekong Delta by
upgrading two main waterway routes to include: dredging and
widening 250 km of canals, rebuilding five bridges, and installing
24-hour navigation aids.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will restore the cargo-handling capacity of the
region's central port of Can Tho through critical investment in
port infrastructure and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 84.9 million
dollars. Apart from the bank's credit, which will be channeled
through the International Development Association, the World
Bank's concessionary lending arm for developing countries, Vietnam
will provide the remaining 11.9 million dollars equivalent.
</P>
<P>
This project is the 8th project the World Bank has funded for
infrastructure investments since beginning its program in the
country in 1993. Ongoing projects include highway rehabilitation,
irrigation rehabilitation, power sector irrigation and
rehabilitation, power development, rural transport and water
supply project.

<HEADLINE> US Leaders Want Troops to Stay in Bosnia Beyond Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government and
Congress have agreed American troops should stay in Bosnia beyond
next June's deadline, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of talks Tuesday between President Bill Clinton,
top aides and 35 congressional leaders, "a consensus is developing
that there will be or should be some form of U.S. military
presence post-SFOR," the NATO-led Stabilization Force now in
Bosnia, Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at a news conference before a meeting
with visiting German Foreign Minister Klause Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, there is a consensus that we need to do whatever is
necessary to make it work," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it is important for the Europeans to stay and to
continue also in some kind of a military presence, and strengthen
also the police functions there," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that Clinton has not made any decision on
how many U.S. troops should stay in Bosnia or what the mission
will be.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Congress early this year when he swore in for a
second term that some 8,000 U.S. troops stationed in Bosnia will
be withdrawn from the region by June 1998.

<HEADLINE> IATA Chief Predicts Booming Air Transport Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A booming air transport market
was expected throughout 1997 and its growth rate over the previous
year might be over 8 percent, a top expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Jeanniot, director general of the International Air
Transport Association (IATA), said the growth trend in world air
transport market is continuing because of global economic health.
</P>
<P>
The IATA has just concluded its 53rd annual meeting in Amman.
Jeanniot explained the business and leisure are sensitive to
economic health. "If the economy picks up by 3 percent, business
travelers may increase by 2 percent," he said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A strong and vibrant world economy means more business tours,
more commodities to be airlifted and more tourist traveling by air.
</P>
<P>
Asia's air transport market in particular would have a faster
growth rate than the average of the world, as it is now a new
center of development, and business people, commodities and
tourists had been flooding into this region, Jeanniot said.
</P>
<P>
World air transport market suffered from an increase of fuel
price last year, which pushed some airlines into red. This year
oil prices have stabilized at around 20 U.S. dollars per barrel,
enabling most of the airlines to make profits again.
</P>
<P>
Jeanniot said IATA is promoting the Future Air Navigation
System (FANS) all over the world, which featured the use of
satellite rather than numerous radar station on the ground to help
aircraft find their accurate position on their navigation lines.
</P>
<P>
FANS was easier to operate and more economic than radar
stations and if it was adopted by all the IATA members, cost would
be cut off by a large margin for airlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
IATA is trying to secure a loan of 200 billion dollars for its
new plans including the promotion of FANS. "We need to accelerate
the implementation of FANS," he added.
</P>
<P>
IATA was established in 1945 in Havana, Cuba, to promote safe,
standard and economic air transport. With 256 air transport
companies as its members, it makes up 98 percent of the world's
total airliners.

his Iranian counterpart Khamal Kharrazi said today.
</P>
<P>
Karrazi, who headed an Iranian delegation to the third session
of the joint commission between South Africa and Iran, left
Pretoria after a four-day visit to South Africa.

links between the 14-member Southern African Development
Community and the Economic Cooperation Organization, which
includes Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the six Muslim
republics of the former Soviet Union.
</P>

They also called for the establishment of the Middle East as a
zone free from weapons of mass destruction, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Arabs to Launch Contacts to Revive Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and other Arab countries
will hold intensive contacts in the coming days to seek ways to
push forward the stalled peace process, the Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Group to the United Nations, grouping representatives
from the Arab countries to the U.N., will start intensive contacts
soon for holding a U.N. General Assembly session to adopt a
resolution on the Israeli settlement building in occupied Arab
lands, said Arab League Assistant Secretary General for Arab
Affairs Ahmed Bin Heli.
</P>
<P>
Bin Heli expressed hope that the international community can
make a clear-cut decision on the Israeli settlement activities
which constitute a stumbling block before establishing peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Assembly at its previous sessions earlier this year
denounced the Israeli settlement building but failed to curb it.
</P>
<P>
A just and durable peace in the region requires resumption of
the peace talks on the Syrian track from the point where they had
stopped and implementation of Security Council resolution 425 on
Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MENA reported that Cairo will witness intensive
diplomatic activities over the coming weeks to revive the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister of Luxembourg Jacques Poos will arrive here on
next Tuesday to meet with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on
Egyptian-European joint efforts to save the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also meet with Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van
Mierlo, who will pay a visit here on November 17-19, escorting the
Dutch queen.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also meet his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine,
who is due here on November 26 as a part of French efforts to put
the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
A Belarussian deputy foreign minister will also arrive here on
November 18 to hold talks with senior Egyptian diplomats on the
recent developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinian and Israeli officials resumed negotiations
in Washington on Monday, Egypt, a key mediator in the Arab-Israeli
talks, voiced its frustration with the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was attending the G-15
summit in Malaysia, said today that he has lost hope that the
peace march can move forward.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Winds Up Southern African Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Heir to the British
throne, Prince Charles ended his eight-day Southern African tour
and left South Africa for home today.
</P>
<P>
Besides South Africa, he also visited Swaziland and Lesotho
where he attended the coronation of King Letsie III of Lesotho,
together with South African President Nelson Mandela Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, he met President Mandela,
visited a rural school in the Kwazulu-Natal province and attended
a Spice Girls charity concert in Johannesburg with his son,
Prince Harry.
</P>
<P>
This is Charles' first official state visit since the tragic
death of his former wife, Princess Diana, two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He addressed a banquet Tuesday night hosted by Mandela in Cape
Town, where he thanked South Africans for their condolences for
the death of Diana, saying that he was doing so on behalf of
himself and his two sons, William and Harry.
</P>
<P>
"She made a real difference in the lives of very many people
on the (African) continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Charles' visit was an opportunity to acknowledge
once again the extensive program of development cooperation from
which South Africa had benefited since 1994.

<HEADLINE> White House, House Reach Agreement on Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and House Republicans today reached a compromise to set 2000 as
the starting year for national test in schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has announced his plan to let schools to have
voluntary, standardized tests in fourth-grade reading and
eighth-grade math starting in 1999. The deal puts the tests one
year later.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said more work was needed to turn the agreement into
reality.
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line for the American people is, I think we
have opened the door to giving people in every state, every school
district and every school the assurance that their children's
performance in reading and math can actually be measured," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The test would make children's academic performance "meaningful
in terms of what every child in America should know," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the tests was widespread and broad-based.
Conservatives fear that the arrangement will lead to more federal
control of education, and the black and Hispanic caucuses in the
House contend they will be used to discriminate against
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Last week, House and Senate negotiators found a bipartisan
compromise on the tests. The agreement would have allowed the
administration to develop and give the tests on a trial basis but
would have required Congress to pass a separate bill before the
tests could be administered widely in 1999, as planned.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Urges Support for Civil Rights Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today asked for supporting the embattled nomination of Bill
Lann Lee, President Bill Clinton's choice to head the Justice
Department's civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Republican attacks on Lee's support for affirmative
action -- an effort for providing increased employment and
schooling opportunities for women and minorities to overcome past
discrimination, Reno said the Constitution's framers "simply did
not envision a process where the Senate would only confirm
nominees who denounce the views of the president who nominates
them."
</P>
<P>
Lee's nomination is in jeopardy with the Tuesday announcement
by Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch that he opposes it.
Hatch's committee is scheduled to vote on Lee nomination Thursday,
and Democrats are counting only nine "for" votes on the 18-member
panel.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Reno said, "Unfortunately, in the
past few days, some have suggested that the vote on Mr. Lee should
instead be turned into a larger referendum on the administration's
longstanding policies and interpretation of constitutional law."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the opposition to the nominee stemmed in part
from Lee's Asian American heritage, Reno said, "I would hope with
all my heart and my soul that that is not true."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reno and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder have
reportedly been calling committee Republicans in an attempt to
pick up the crucial 10-vote majority to have the nomination
recommended to the entire Senate.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration and

Meanwhile, speaking at a briefing, White House spokesman
Michael McCurry said June 1998 "is the end of the current mission.
Whether international presence exists in Bosnia beyond June 1998 has
not been determined."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton was encouraged by the discussion late on
Tuesday. "I think he became far less pessimistic that there would
be a lack of support for the work the United States is doing in
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that more must be done. "I don't think it would be
fair to say there is any consensus now," McCurry said. "I think
what was clear at the meeting was that there is the prospect the
president could build that consensus with hard work."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for End to US Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
should earnestly reflect on its actions, renounce confrontation
and seek to settle its disputes with Cuba through dialogues,
Chinese delegate Yu Daqing stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
On voting the General Assembly's resolution on ending the U.S.
embargo against Cuba, Yu Daqing said the U.S embargo and blockade
against Cuba had been going on for years, inflicting economic
losses amounting to tens of billions of U.S. dollars and causing
grave difficulties for Cuba's economic and social development, as
well as its restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
Yu said sanctions and blockade measures had led to the
reduction of external investment, owing to the increased risks
involved. The steep rise of the market prices resulting from the
measures has directly affected the improvement of the level of
production and livelihood of the Cuban people, seriously damaging
their welfare and health, especially that of women and children.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the cooperation between Cuba and relevant international
organizations had also been adversely affected. Further, the
unilateral action by the U.S. government had hampered the normal
economic contacts and trade relations between Cuba and many other
countries, thus gravely encroaching upon the legitimate interests
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Yu said by doing so, the U.S. government was also hurting the
interests of American companies and individuals that intended to
have normal economic and trade contacts with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the 51st session of the General assembly adopted
Resolution 51/17, reaffirming that all states should comply with
their obligations under the United Nations Charter and
international law, urging them to refrain form promulgating and
applying laws and measures that affected the legitimate rights and
interests of other countries, and calling on those states that
continued to apply such laws and measures to take necessary steps
to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Yu said China had been hoping the U.S. government would heed
the just call of the international community, renounce its power
politics, and seek to resolve issues between states through
constructive dialogues and negotiations.
