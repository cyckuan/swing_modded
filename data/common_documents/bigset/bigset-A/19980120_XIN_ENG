<HEADLINE> German Truckers to Sue France over Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- German trucking companies said
Monday in Frankfurt they would sue French authorities in French
courts for losses caused by French strikers' blockades last
November.
</P>
<P>
The companies said their trans-European freight was delayed
because of the French strikers' barricades, resulting in losses
estimated at around 20 million marks (11 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, their claims based on bills of lading and tachometer
readings from the detained trucks had been rejected by most French
regional administrations. They said the documentation was
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The tachometer is a sealed device carried by all trucks in the
European Union which details time, speed and distance of travel.
</P>
<P>
The French strike last year caused about 50 million dollars' in
losses to German truck companies. Some claims from the companies
have not yet been settled.

WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Three decades after the
murder of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.,
the nation is honoring him with prayers and marches across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore planned to visit Monday the Atlanta
church where King once preached. Gore reportedly will announce a
civil rights initiative to be presented to Congress.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would raise civil rights spending in the 1999
budget, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would strengthen enforcement of fair-housing laws,
investigation of police brutality and enforcement of the Americans
With Disabilities Act. Money would be spent to ease the caseload
at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by placing greater
emphasis on mediators to settle job discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
King is to be honored at dozens of ceremonies across the
country, who was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4,
1968. He was 39.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Supreme Court Discusses Recommendations by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The recommendation made by
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa of Nepal to dissolve the
parliament and hold mid-term polls gained the upper hand on the
first day of the discussions held Monday by the Supreme Court on
the opinion it is to present to King Birendra, the official RSS
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The RSS said Attorney General Prem Bahadur Bista argued that
the recommendation by Prime Minister Thapa is in accordance with
the constitution and has already been activated, therefore it
should be given the preference.
</P>
<P>
He said the submission to call a special session of the
parliament should not have been made on the basis of mere
assumptions that the government is on the verge of losing its
majority, adding that the prime minister commanded a majority of
107 MPs on his side at the time.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Thapa made the recommendation to King Birendra
on January 8 after learning that the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) had planned a
no-confidence motion against his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the CPN-UML and nine MPs from Thapa's own
National Democratic Party (RPP) asked the King to convene a
special session of the parliament to discuss their no-confidence
motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
After days of consultations with advisors, legal experts and
party leaders, King Birendra could not make a decision, so he
referred the matter to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The court had handed down conflicting verdicts over prime
ministers' recommendations to dissolve parliament and hold fresh
polls. In 1994, it ruled that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
of the Nepali Congress (NC) was within his constitutional
authority to make such a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
But the following year, it overturned the similar
recommendation made to the King by Prime Minister Man Mohan
Adhikari of the CPN-UML, ruling that dissolution was not allowed
if an alternative government could be formed from the existing
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NC's representative argued during Monday's
discussions that the prime minister recommended the dissolution of
the parliament well before the submission seeking a special
session, so the prime minister's recommendation should take
precedence.
</P>
<P>
Senior Prosecutor Balaram K.C. supported the NC's stand.
</P>
<P>
Laxman Lal Karna, representative of the ruling Nepal Sadbhavana
Party, argued that Article 53 (4) has provided for the dissolution
of parliament as a privilege of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no possibility of forming a stable alternative
government under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Thapa's is the fourth government since the mid-term polls in
late 1994. He came to power on October 7, 1997 after the NC
brought down the former coalition government with a no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
The discussions are expected to last days before the Supreme
Court can come up with an opinion for King Birendra.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on the international society to make
greater efforts to protect and promote human rights.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to the Martin Luther King Day, January 19,
Annan said this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which had been a fundamental source
of inspiration for national and international efforts to protect
and promote human rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the main principles of the
Declaration have inspired the constitutions of many countries which
have become independent since it was written.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said conceived as a "common standard of
achievement for all peoples and nations", the Declaration has
become a yardstick by which to measure the respect for, and
compliance with, international human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed human rights are African rights. They are also
Asian rights; they are European rights; they are American rights.
They belong to no government, they are limited to no continent,
for they are fundamental to humankind itself.

BAGHDAD -- Chief arms inspector of the U.N. Richard Butler
arrived here Monday afternoon on a three-day visit to Iraq in a
bid to solve the current crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, will hold talks
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on the question of
arm inspectors' access to Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Butler paid his last visit to Baghdad five weeks ago, during
which he failed to persuade Iraq into agreeing to grant access to
arms inspectors to presidential sites, which Iraq views as symbols
of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement
after Butler reported results of his Baghdad visit, asking Iraq
to allow arms inspectors to go any where, at any time immediately
and without conditions.

</P>
<P>
"The massacre occurred as the bus transporting the employees
from the town was stopped by a small group of armed criminals,"
officials in Gisenyi said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five bodies were killed on the spot, while 10 of the 35
seriously wounded died at Gisenyi Hospital where they have been
taken to for treatment.
</P>

The death toll is expected to rise as many more workers who
jumped out of the bus remain unaccounted for, the officials
pointed out.

KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Monday that his government would consider the International
Monetary Fund (IMF)'s suggestion on raising local interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"I think the IMF is a responsible international body which does
not threaten... it is giving advice to us," Mahathir told
reporters after chairing the 4th Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
Implementation Council Meeting at Cyberjaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion came from IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
 after he wrapped up initial consultations with Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim as well as
Malaysian Treasury and State Bank officials here last week.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in Malaysia are currently hovering at around 9.5
 percent from an average of 7.5 percent before the attacks on
regional currencies last July, while the local currency of ringgit
 which fell to a low of 4.88 against the U.S. dollar two weeks
ago, has recovered to a high of 4.05 level in intra-day trading
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the United States
Congress, headed by House of Representatives Foreign Committee
Chairman Benjamin Gilman, is paying a two-day visit to France from
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation members discussed with French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine a series of issues from U.S. extra-territorial laws
to Franco-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the visit by the U.S. Congressmen, the first in several
years, is of "particular importance" for France.
</P>
<P>
Besides Gilman, the delegation consists of six other House
Representatives, both Republican and Democrat. They will meet
President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Defense
Minister Alain Richard on Tuesday before leaving for Poland.
</P>
<P>
"We are in fact paying great importance to developing our
relations with the Congress of the United States which plays a
considerable role in the American foreign policy," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted diplomatic sources as saying
that Vedrine talked with the delegation the peace process in the
Middle East, Bosnia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq as well as the
extra-territorial laws passed by the U.S. Congress such as the
Helms-Burton and D'Amato laws which ban foreign companies from
doing business in Cuba and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine stressed the "complementarity" rather than
confrontation between the European Union and the United States
over all these issues, said AFP.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Shops in and around Harare,
capital of Zimbabwe were looted today by people who were
demonstrating against recent price hikes of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Mabvuku left a trail of destruction at
Tsokachena, the biggest shopping center in the area, as people
stoned shops and looted mostly essential goods such as
mealie-meal, sugar and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
The residents also broke into shops such as Bata Shoe Company,
a retail shop, Powersales and a Marowa bottle store.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the looters were youths and women, some with
babies strapped on their backs.
</P>
<P>
In Chitungwiza, demonstrators picketed around Makoni Shopping
Center after dismantling an Aroma Bakeries truck, a marketing car
and a Lobels truck, leaving a trail of destruction as they tried
to loot.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators chanted anti-white and anti-government
slogans.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were triggered by the recent 20 percent
price hike of commodities due to the devaluation of the
Zimbabwean Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government said today that it had reversed the move by
millers to increase the prices of mealie-meal by 21 percent and
would review prices of all commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The government no longer controls prices. Prices are now set
by producers of each commodities," said Nathan Shamuyarira,
Minister of Industry and Commerce Minister. However, he added
that the government has looked into proposed increases by
millers.
</P>
<P>
Millers had planned to increase the price of mealie-meal by 21
percent with effect from today, citing the drying up of maize
sources. This is the third hike within two and a half months.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Blamed for Goods' Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) today said the recent price hikes on almost all
basic commodities should not be blamed on the whites, but also on
the gross mismanagement of the country's macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
UP's Information Secretary General Isaac Manyemba said heavy
taxation and high interest rates were forcing business
entrepreneurs to increase prices of their goods and services so
as to remain in business.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the fact that the recent price increments were
being caused by whites trying to sabotage the economy, there are
other factors. This is emanating from the gross macro-economic
mismanagement of policies by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prices on basic commodities were raised early this month by
over 20 percent with producers citing the rise on the devaluation
of the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Harare South member of parliament Margaret Dongo said the
government must accept responsibility for the strike and damages
incurred during the demonstrations which turned violent in most
high density suburbs. Shops in the central business district
were forced to close today.
</P>
<P>
"The mismanagement of the economy by the government has
resulted in all this. Where did they think things will go?" she
asked.
</P>
<P>
Ropafadzo Benjamin, coordinator of the National Association of
Social Workers, implored the Ministry of Industry and Commerce,
the private sector and other stake-holders to find a solution to
the price increases through dialogue now.

<HEADLINE> Namiba's Oldest English Newspaper Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Windhoek Advertizer,
Namibia's oldest English-language newspaper, closed down today
after its sustained financial difficulties and staff shortage,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old newspaper, run by the Democratic Media
Holdings (DMH) group, was last year turned into Nambia's first
afternoon daily in an effort to rescue it from financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
The paper was reportedly running at about 200,000 U.S.
Dollars' loss. Besides, three journalists recently resigned from
the newspaper, leaving it with only three full-time news
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Following the close-down of the newspaper, its staff members
will be integrated into the Afrikaans daily Die Repbulikein, and
will publish an English insert for the paper.
</P>
<P>
Windhoek Advertizer appeared for the first time on July 4,
1919, and was originally a news sheet for members of the United
Club -- a social club for Union of South African Servicemen
stationed in Namibia after the Germans surrendered in 1915.
</P>
<P>
It was then bought by Windhoek businessman Johan Meinert. In
the 1970s, the paper was run by well-known Namibian newsman
Hannes Smit, now editor-in-chief for the Observer.

massive ice storm that struck several U.S. states and a large area
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The January 8 storm left hundreds of thousands of residents,
including 250,000 in Maine, without power.
</P>
<P>
Despite utility workers from the state with federal assistance
have been busying with the restoration of electricity, continued
snow storms in the last few days dragged the pace.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of crews of Maine's largest utility, Central
Maine Power, were continuing to hook up the remaining 30,000 homes
and businesses still off line, the United Press International said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
State officials said there were still 330 people staying in
shelters overnight Sunday and 37 shelters remained open Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local officials estimate that the damage by the storm was up to
100 million U.S. dollars in the Maine.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Merger Dominates Big M&AMP;A in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks' merger
activities have dominated big deals of U.S. mergers and
acquisitions (M&AMP;A) in the last five years, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,492 mergers worth over 200 billion U.S. dollars
took place in U.S. commercial banks, standing in the first line of
big M&AMP;A deals, the Securities Data Company (SDC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Radio and television have accounted for the second biggest M&AMP;A
with 1,435 deals worth 162 billion dollars, the SDC was quoted by
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Other big deals in M&AMP;A include the insurance industry with
5,114 deals worth 110 billion dollars completed; health services
worth 107 billion dollars; investment brokers, 104 billion
dollars; utilities, 100 billion dollars; oil and gas refining, 96
billion dollars and hotel and casinos, 84 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the United States saw not only the record amount of
M&AMP;A totaling 1 trillion dollars, but also the unprecedented number
of big M&AMP;As.
</P>
<P>
There were 156 mergers of 1 billion dollars or more, 60 percent
higher than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The economic turmoil in Asia has not halted the M&AMP;A drive of
many U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
In the first two weeks of 1998, there were reports of AT&AMP;T's of
11.3 billion dollars to acquire Teleport Communications Group and
SBC Communications' offer of 4.4 billion dollars to buy Southern
New England Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The M&AMP;A drive has gained momentum as a result of a change in
the strategy of companies from downsizing themselves to trying to
be bigger as key to profitability when globalization became a
trend.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Urged to Stop Prejudice Against Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today called on Qatar to stop all measures against
Egyptians working in the small rich Arab emirate, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He issued the call in the wake of the Qatari Interior
Ministry's decision to lay off large numbers of Egyptian
expatriates. About 160 Egyptians have been fired after tensions
mounted between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian diplomats in the Qatari capital of Doha,
the rest of the 5,000 Egyptians working in Qatar's public sector
can expect their dismissal by summer if relations between the two
countries do not improve.
</P>
<P>
Hiring Egyptian workers in Qatar has been banned since November
1996, according to the MENA.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that "it is inappropriate that such
measures are adopted against the Egyptians who carry out their
duties in full in Qatar."
</P>
<P>
He termed these measures as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened as the two sides quarreled over alleged
Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Qatar in February 1996,
and Egypt's opposition to a regional economic conference in Doha
in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The war of words led to the suspension of a meeting of the
eight-member Damascus Declaration states scheduled in Doha on
December 1-2, 1997, to which they belong.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's mediation in December between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani
failed to produce concrete results.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 Egyptians are living in Qatar, whose foreign labor
accounts for two thirds of the countrys' entire residents.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports on Progress of Identification for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Great progress has been
made in the identification for participation in the referendum to
decide the future of the Western Sahara, but a lot remained
undone, UN Secretary-General said today.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan said
between August 1994, when the identification process was launched,
and December 1995, when it came to a standstill, a total of 77,058
persons had been convoked, of whom 60,112 had been identified.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said between December 3, 1997 and January
10, 1998, a total of 18,688 persons were convoked, and 13,227
identified.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted the completion of the identification phase by May
31, 1998 will be a daunting and arduous task since there are still
100,000 applicants remaining to be convoked and identified in less
than five months.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said in conformity with the Houston agreement, he
had decided to instruct the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to proceed as soon as
possible with the identification of those unconvoked individuals
who represented themselves on the days of convocation of their
respective tribal groups.
</P>
<P>
Annan said with regard to applicants from non-contested tribes
resident in northern Morocco, who were initially expected to
travel to the identification centers in southern Morocco, he has
concluded to convoke and identify them in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urged Morocco and the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de oro(POLISARIO) to
ensure that the identification proceed smoothly. He also urged the
two sides to keep the momentum so as to start the transitional
period in June 1998 as planned.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the security Council of the United Nations and
the General Assembly to extend all necessary support in this
regard, so that the overall objective of holding the referendum by
the end of 1998 may still be maintained.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans to Hike Meat, Hide Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Prime
Minister Kassu Ilala announced here that the country has plans
this year to launch a program aimed at boosting its meat and hide
and skin export to the international market.
</P>
<P>
According to a today's report from the Ethiopian News Agency,
Kassu said Ethiopia's meat export is very low quantity-wise and the
volume of hide and skin enters the foreign market is insignificant.
</P>
<P>
He said his Horn of African states' share in the 17 billion
U.S. Dollars worth of meat supplied to the world market last year
was only 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative is hoped to promote the country's access to
the world and particularly the Middle East market, he said, and
added that the government has plans to increase fodder supply and
improve the species of the cattle with the loan obtained from the
African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia stands first in Africa and 10th in the world in its
livestock resource. Hide and skin export is second largest export
item in the country next to coffee.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urged to Comply with UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector
Richard Butler said here Monday that Iraq should comply with the
decisions of the Security Council with respect to U.N. arms
inspectors' access to Iraq's presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, told a news
conference that he hoped that the two sides can come to terms with
respect to the issue of access.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the Security Council has asked him to find
ways to respect Iraq's sovereignty, dignity and national security.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that this should not be against the principle
of ensuring inspectors' complete access.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he would hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Monday evening and Tuesday, and he would end
his visit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said he will be discussing with Aziz the issues of access,
and the UNSCOM' s continuing monitoring and inspection work in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When asked how he thinks of the deadline that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein set for the inspectors to end their work, Butler
said he has to know more about what is intended in Saddam's speech.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that as long as Iraq is fully cooperative,
the inspection work can be very quick.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said in his address marking the seventh anniversary of
the Gulf War last Saturday that Iraq would stop its cooperation
with UNSCOM unless the Security Council honors its promise that it
will lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq after it has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president reiterated the deadline which the Iraqi
National Assembly had set for arms inspectors to end their work
within six months.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Russian, French, Chinese and Canadian
Representatives in the UNSCOM would attend the talks between him
and Aziz.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A Protestant shopkeeper died
Monday in hospital after being gunned down on the outskirts of
Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Police said two men shot Jim Guiney in a carpet shop in
Dunmurry, in the south of the city early in the day.
</P>
<P>
The nationalist terrorist group Irish National Liberation Army
claimed responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
A security operation is being carried out at a house near to
where the murder took place. There is a large army and police
presence.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews, while condemning the
murder, called on those carrying out sectarian killings to desist
in their attempts to destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A pro-British loyalist paramilitary group carried out the
murder of a Catholic man in County Londonderry in Northern Ireland
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) - The World Trade Organization
(WTO) has called on world leaders to make a united and public
stand against the threat of protectionism that has arisen owning
to the economic crisis in South-East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Renato Ruggiers, WTO Director-General, disclosed that he
intends to use the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the
formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),
the predecessor of WTO, to send a powerful free-trade message.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, he said: "A great part of the
solution (to the financial turmoil in Asia) will be trade. Only by
keeping markets open can we alleviate this crisis and shorten the
period of crisis."
</P>
<P>
Signor Ruggiero hopes that heads of government, by attending a
high-profile celebration of free trade, will become less likely to
be tempted by protectionist measures as South-East Asia tries to
export its way back to economic health.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was confident that the existence of the WTO,
with its binding commitments and disputes settlement procedure
agreed to by 130 countries, would be a formidable barrier against
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
However, he regards a strong political commitments as necessary
to prevent "creeping protectionism" such as anti-dumping actions.
</P>
<P>
WTO officials said Signor Ruggiero was asking governments to
say by the end of the month whether they were prepared to send
heads of government to the May 20 meeting.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on

Sinn Fein wanted peace and "an end to all killings, but the
peace could only be achieved through dialogue, Adams added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Second Redeployment No More Than 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu heading for Washington for talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, an Israeli minister said Monday the
percentage of second troop redeployment would not exceed 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications Minister Limor Livnat told Israel Radio that
the cabinet would never accept a double-digit redeployment in the
West Bank. She was commenting on the pending talks between
Netanyahu and Clinton, during which the Israeli redeployment will
be a top issue.
</P>
<P>
"What I can say is that we are not talking about two-digit,
definitely not. And I believe this is the majority (view) of the
cabinet. This government will not take any decision of more than
one digit, or more than 10 percent," she said.
</P>
<P>
Livnat, a hawkish cabinet member, said the cabinet is waiting
to see the results of the Netanyahu-Clinton meeting and the
fulfillment of commitments by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA). She said Israel would not bow to any outside pressure, even
from Washington, to make compromise on territorial issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly trying to persuade Israel to redeploy
from 12-15 percent of the West Bank in the second of three-phase
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Livnat made it clear that Israel would not take any dictations
from anybody including the U.S.. "I believe it's in the American
interests to have a safe Israel, to have a strong Israel, and to
let us to take the decision about our future, about our existence
by ourselves," she added.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, leading moderate within the
cabinet, expressed the hope that during the talks Clinton would
hold with Netanyahu and PNA leader Yasser Arafat, a principle
would be found on how to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the ceremony held at the Hatzerim Air
Force Base in southern Israel for the arrival of two F-15I fighter
planes from the U.S., Mordechai said Israel is urging the PNA to
fulfill its commitments to the signed agreements before deciding
to implement the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition leaders have publicly lowered their
expectations for the Washington talks. Former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, one of the leading architects of the peace process,
said Clinton would do no more than just trying to persuade
Netanyahu and Arafat to soften their positions.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed the belief that Clinton would not go so far as
to issue an ultimatum to both sides to push forward the peace
process. He noted that Netanyahu's manoeuvring room was limited
by the hardliners who dominate his coalition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Meretz Party's leader Yossi Sarid, meanwhile,
called on Clinton to support the establishment of an independent
and sovereign Palestinian state. He said this was the new fact of
political life in the region, and will be the basis for fruitful
negotiations between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
But Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky dismissed
Sarid's remarks as "ridiculous." He blasted Sarid for trying to
create new realities in the peace process, saying "this is not
the way to help the peace process in general, and the
Israeli people in particular."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria-Japan Trade Records Continuous Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between Nigeria

the News Agency of Nigeria reported today, quoting figures from
the Japanese External Trade Organization.

advantage in the three years under review.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Japan exported 179.1 million Dollars worth of exports
to Nigeria and imported goods valued at 134.7 million Dollars.
The two figures expanded to 310 million Dollars and 166.5 million

<HEADLINE> Butler to Start Talks in Baghdad: U.N. Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left his hotel in Baghdad "moments ago" to
start his talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, U.N.
Spokesman Fred Eckhard said at the noon briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
The main item of Butler's agenda remains the question of access
to all sites by UNSCOM, Butler's U.N. Special Commission, charged
with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler also indicated that he wants to seek a clarification from
Aziz on Iraq's statement issued over the weekend that it intends
to set a deadline for the work of UNSCOM unless the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq are lifted, Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reported to have said on
Saturday that he might implement a six-month deadline set by Iraq's
parliament for the inspectors to complete their work.
</P>
<P>
Butler has rejected the deadline on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraqi dispute flared again last week when Iraq barred
an inspection team led by American Scott Ritter from operating,
accusing him of spying for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council in a statement called again for
unstricted access to inspectors.

In an interview with national radio Shevardnadze said "for this
reason we have been continuing the negotiation process" which has
already lasted for more than four years, although it so far has
yielded no positive results.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze noted that Georgia is against resumption of the
war on Abkhazia and "if somebody calls for the war, he must bear
responsibility for it."
</P>
<P>
He calls on the conflicting sides not to be carried away by
emotion and continue the search for peaceful solutions.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian peacekeepers in the area the president
reaffirmed that the Russian troops should leave unless they
protect the return of Georgian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze on January 2 told reporters that his country would
not refuse to use so-called "Bosnian format" and compulsion
elements to settle the Abkhazian conflict, if there are no real
steps to return refugee home and restore the territorial integrity
of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze today also expressed hope that the international
community will support such a proposal in which this question is
raised.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Iraq to Form Committees to Settle Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq have agreed to
form two committees to solve their disputes to pave the way for
their rapprochement, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, who arrived here last Friday on his first official
visit, the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
One of the committees is for settling the issue of prisoners of
war and those missing in action, which is left over by the war
from 1980 to 1988 between the two neighbors, according to the IRNA.
</P>
<P>
It will also take up other humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has released 49,196 Iraqi POWs and that some
15,000 Iranian POWs are still held in Iraq. But Iraq has rejected
the claim and accused Iran of holding some 18,000 Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
The other committee is to deal with issues of commerce and
pilgrimage, with a mission to find ways of improving bilateral
commercial cooperation based on the United Nations resolutions on
Iraq and easing travels of people between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is considered as a constructive step to improve
the relations of the two former foes, since the issue of POWs is
the major hurdle for their rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill signal to Iran, the Iraqi government unilaterally
lifted the ban of Iranian citizens on paying pilgrimage to the
Shiite holy sites in Iraq last August.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth summit of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference held here last December, the two countries expressed
willingness to improve their relations and underlined the need to
resolve their disputes for future cooperation.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Claims Recapture of Diamond Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- There has been a stream of
claims and counter-claims since Sierra Leone's Kamajor militia
captured the diamond rich town of Tongofield in the east of the
country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Freetown, the ruling military junta has
conceded the fall of the town but announced the recapture of it
by driving away the Kamajors, a group of hunter militiamen who
have been fighting to restore ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
since the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
"This morning i got a telephone call from the Chief of Army
Staff that Tongo had been recaptured at about 10:00 a.m.
yesterday," said Aliu Kamara, spokesman with the junta, quoted by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to him, about 1,000 soldiers loyal to the junta were
put in the heavy fighting to retake the diamond production base,
a key source of government revenue.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were allegedly killed by the junta
forces.
</P>
<P>
But the Kamajor commander has denied to have the information
about the loss of Tongofield to the junta, saying that if it was
true, the civil defense unit would try to take it back again.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the town has forced thousands of local people
to flee by roads to Kenema, the eastern capital about 20 km away,
according to relief agency officials.
</P>
<P>
Kenema residents said reportedly that lines of refugees were
trudging along the road, leaving their homes for refuge camps
organized by a number of international and local relief
agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to agency reports, the relief agencies are
coordinating their efforts to provide food, shelter and medicine
for the thousands who were pouring into the camps.

<HEADLINE> 2 F-15Is Delivered to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The first two of 25
U.S.-made F-15I long-range strike aircrafts arrived in Israel
Monday in a high-profile welcome aimed at showcasing its
technological superiority and deterrence.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai attended the welcome
ceremony held at the Hatzerim Air Force Base in southern
Israel. The planes, code-named Thunder, are the most advanced and
expensive jets in Israel's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Using the annual military aid of 1.8 billion dollars from the
United States, Israel has purchased 25 F-15Is from Boeing company
in a deal worth 2.5 billion dollars. The last will be delivered by
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The jets were officially handed over to Israel at the rolling
out ceremony in St. Louis, United States, last November and
Israeli crews have been under training in the U.S. for the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
The F-15I has a range of at least 4,500 kilometers and can
carry 11 tonnes of missiles and bombs. It is able to reach any
target in the Middle East, fight in any kind of weather, day or
night, and carry a variety of weapons and bombs. It is also a
strategic bomber that is quite capable of engaging the enemy in
dog fights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Air Force Commander Eitan Ben Eliyahu said once the
F-15Is become operational, Israeli air forces can carry out
missions that could not be done in the past.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that, as the F-15Is are equipped with advanced
avionics, precision guided weaponry, and enlarged fuel tanks,
they enable Israel to strike targets as far as Iraq, Iran and
Libya without refueling. The three countries are top rivals in the
region which Israel considers as leading military threats.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes US for Arming Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday criticized the
United States for arming Israel "in an excessive way," the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
that Israel's military build-up is "dangerous to the Middle
East," calling on Muslim countries to stop remaining indifferent
towards Washington's military support for Israel's expansionist
policies.
</P>
<P>
The annual military aid from the United States to Israel now
stands at 1.8 billion U.S. dollars. The first two of 25 U.S.-made
F-15I long-range strike aircraft arrived in Israel Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that to divert public opinion in the region from
Israel's military build-up, the U.S. has launched baseless
propaganda campaign against Iran by accusing Tehran of purchasing
long-range missiles from China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The United States repeatedly accused Iran of seeking weapons
of mass destruction and some U.S. military officials even claimed
that Tehran has got access to long-range missiles, with which
Iran can attack Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi stressed that Iran has based its regional policy
of detente on ridding the Middle East region of weapons of
mass destruction, saying that Iran called on Muslim countries
to put pressure on Israel to accept supervision of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Foreign Policy Aides on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday met with his foreign policy advisers, aimed at setting a
tone for the upcoming talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders
over deadlocked preace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute meeting included Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk,
White House spokesman Barry Toiv told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A Clinton administration official said the president intended
to remind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Chairman of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat "that they
are partners in the peace process" and must take each other's
need into account.
</P>
<P>
In her interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday,
Albright emphasized that the United States would work hard to
"get the parties to come together and get the peace process back
on track."
</P>
<P>
She said President Clinton would make his views known during
his talks with Netanyahu and Arafat, but "ultimately the
decisions required have to come from the leaders."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will meet Netanyahu on Tuesday, and some analysts said
that during just one-hour meeting the U.S. president appears to be
lending a slightly frosty tone to the Israeli prime minister by
stripping it of the courtesies that typically mark summits between
U.S. and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's an unlimited amount of time here,"
Berger told CBS's "Face the Nation" program on Sunday. "There's
a sense of urgency that we have, and this is the time for tough
decisions."
</P>
<P>
The White House said last week that the talks will focus
merely on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process without covering
other regional issues.
</P>
<P>
It also will not offer the Israeli prime minister a lunch or
dinner with Clinton, nor will Netanyahu stay in the Blair House
official guest residence. And the two leaders will also not appear
side-by-side at a news conference after their talks.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the appropriate way to do this visit,"
Toiv said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on Sunday delayed any decision on how
much land to give up in the next West Bank withdrawal until
after Netanyahu's meeting with Clinton. The Israeli prime
minister told CNN that the size and pace of that withdrawal was
"something I plan to take up with the president (Clinton)."

<HEADLINE> French Judiciary Urged to Reconsider Garaudy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Head of Iranian judiciary
Mohammad Yazdi Monday called on the French judiciary to reconsider
the trial on French writer Roger Garaudy.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that the French judiciary should not be intimidated
by political hue and cry in defending justice, according to the
Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Iranian judicial officials, Yazdi said
that by trying Garaudy, a French Muslim philosopher, the French
judiciary in fact put freedom on trial.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, 84, is on trial for his book "Les Mythes Fondeteurs
de la Politique Israelienne" (Founding Myths of Israeli Politics)
published in 1996. He denied in the book the existence of gas
chambers for the extermination of Jews, saying that the
extermination of 6 million Jews during World War II by the
Nazis is a myth used to justify everything Israel has demanded
and obtained from Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that thinkers and freedom lovers all over the world
never expect such an act from a country as France who stakes
claims to human rights and freedom of expression and thought.
</P>
<P>
Iranian press also launched strong attack on the French
government over Garaudy's case.
</P>
<P>
Following the reports about Garaudy's trial, hundreds of
Iranian journalists and writers announced their support for the
French writer, saying that the trial was carried out under
political influence of Zionism in the west.

WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- With Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's flying to Washington for talks on the Middle
East peace process, U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Monday
that he had "high hopes" for revitalizing the deadlocked peace
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We're all going to have to make some moves if we're going to
get there," Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to the meeting. I'm committed to making it
a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton met with his foreign policy advisers, aimed at
setting a tone for the upcoming talks with Netanyahu and Chairman
of Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat, which will take place
separately on Tuesday and Thursday..

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Russia's Reaction to Turkish Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Monday
welcomed Russia's response to an agreement signed recently
between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides said that "we endorse fully
Moscow's strong reaction to Ankara's decision to sign a
cooperation protocol with the so-called foreign ministry of the
illegal Turkish Cypriot regime."
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed last week by the Turkish Cypriot
"Foreign and Defense Minister" Taner Etkin and Turkish Foreign
Ministry Under-Secretary Korkmaz Haktanir,
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, diplomats of the self-proclaimed
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)" will take on duties
in Turkish embassies around the world for training purpose and
"TRNC" representatives will participate in Turkish delegations at
relevant meetings.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valeri Nesteruskin was
quoted as saying last Saturday that the "signing of the protocol
for closer cooperation between the Turkish Foreign Ministry and
the illegal, secessionist fabrication (TRNC) will undoubtedly make
prospects in finding a just and viable Cyprus settlement more
difficult."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish move was regarded here as a step toward the
promised partial integration with northern Cyprus in response to
the European Union decision last month to start accession talks
with the Cypriot government in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared the breakaway TRNC in 1983, which
was only recognized by Turkey.

<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is ready for the
presidential elections due to be held on February 8, said an
official press release issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release of the office of Cyprus' Chief
Returning Officer, more than 1,000 polling stations will operate
in five of the six districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
No polling will take place in Kyrenia as it is in the north of
the Mediterranean island controlled by the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
over the northern third to protect the Turkish Cypriot minorities
after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The press release said four polling stations in the districts
of Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos will operate specially
for the Greek Cypriots, mainly elderly, who live in the north.
</P>
<P>
More than 410,000 voters at the age of 18 and above will cast
ballot in the presidential elections, which is compulsory by law.
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates including incumbent President Glafcos
Clerides will run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, if no candidate secures more than 50
percent of the votes, the two front-runners will compete in a
run-off on the following Sunday, or February 15.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Turkey to Refrain From Using Military Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece today called on
neighboring Turkey to refrain from using military force as it had
done up to now, describing the use of force as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that irregular military action contributed to
the deterioration of relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He described the position adopted by Turkey concerning the
holding of military exercises in the Aegean as "irrational" and
"much more than inconsistent."
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkey has conducted a series of large-scale military
exercises in the eastern Aegean and Turkish jet fighters have
continued to violate Greek airspace, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here do not rule out the possibility of a
direct military conflict between the two countries in the Aegean
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that Greece was not proposing any moratorium but
wanted Turkey to show good faith by respecting international law
and international treaties.
</P>
<P>
As for the banning of the Turkish main opposition Welfare
Party, he said that such a decision might cause further political
instability in the neighboring country and consequently affect
Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the banning of the biggest party in Turkey's
parliament illustrated once again the "lack of democracy" in the
country and confirmed that institutions were not functioning in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Turkey's judiciary dissolved the Welfare Party and
imposed a five-year political ban on former Prime Minister and
party leader Necmettin Erbakan in an anti-Islamist crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan Govt Strives to Restore Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- To rehabilitate economy and
promote development, the Angolan government has been striving
hard in the recent years to restore the country's railway
transport cut short by the civil war for over seven years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport has revealed that in the first half
of this year, trains will once again arrive in the northern city
of Malanje and Menongue in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Railway had been a major means of transportation in Angola,
with a total length of 2,900 km. There are the Luanda Railway in
the north, Namibe Railway in the south and Benguela Railway
crossing the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Benguela, as the most important railway in Angola with a
length of 1,340 km, passes grain-producing Bie and Huambo
provinces and further connects itself with the railway network in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, thus becoming a key
line in southern Africa, transporting a large part of mineral
products from Congo (K) and copper ore from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
However, the 19-year-long civil war in Angola has devastated
its railway system, with nearly all of it in a paralyzed state. A
big section of the railway cannot work because of the mines.
Consequently air transport, expensive and limited as it is,
became a major way for transport.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, in its bid to pave the way for
economic development, has invested 15 million U.S. Dollars to
restore the Luanda line in the north. After three years' efforts,
passenger and cargo transport is now resumed from Luanda to
Dondo, capital city of Kuanza-Norte province.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, repair work is in full swing on the
Luanda-Malanje line so that it will be opened for operation in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 420-km line from Namibe to Matala, Huila province in the
south has been the longest operating line in the country. To
ensure its operation, the government has put in over 400 million
Dollars for the repair work. It is expected that the
Matala-Menongue section will start its operation by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
What is more, research is undertaken by Angola to connect the
Namibe line with railways in neighboring Namibia. Once the
feasibility study is completed, the government will build the
railway through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
The Benguela line only has 30 km working now. The repair on
the whole line takes a total of 100 million Dollars. The Angolan
government has decided to cooperate with Italy to restore the
line under an agreement signed in October 1997. According to the
Ministry of Transport, repair work on the line will begin this
year.
</P>
<P>
With the consolidation of peace in the war-torn country,
Angola will usher in a period of large-scaled construction, which
will include the export of industrial and agricultural products
to the sea ports from the central region and import of raw
materials from the other way round.
</P>
<P>
The country's railways, once re-opened after rehabilitation,
will surely help the transport of products and raw materials in
the country so as to boost its national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sales of the personal computer
in the United States are forecast to grow from 31.9 million units
in 1997 to 49.2 million in 2001 as the machines are getting
cheaper, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
PC Sales could grow by 15 percent to 36.7 million units this
year and the robust trend may go on till 2001 with 1999 expected
to see sales reaching 41.3 million units and another 45.3 million
are projected for 2000, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Investor's Business Daily, citing figures from industry
sources, said the trend could be helped by the fast-growing market
where the PC penetration into American homes may rise from 43
percent in 1997 to 45.5 percent this year and 51.4 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
The market is seeing more consumers because falling technology
prices in the 1990s have benefited PC retailers and wholesalers by
creating new markets for their products such as today's sub-1000
U.S. dollar computers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that average PC prices fell from around 1,700
dollars per unit in mid-1996 to about 1,300 dollars per unit at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sub-800 dollar PCs are hitting the market and some even expect
sub-500 dollar PCs to come out by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
More mergers and acquisitions are expected to take place in the
PC industry amid fierce competition and higher-end PCs could find
more orders when narrow margins of lower-end products are not
attractive to retailers, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams Greece for Discriminating Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday criticized
Greece for its discriminative attitude toward the ethnic Turks on
citizenship issue, describing it as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that the new Greek
citizenship law would harm the interests of the Turks living in
the Greek province of Western Thrace.
</P>
<P>
Under the 19th article of the citizenship law, those Greek
citizens without Greek extraction will be stripped of their
citizenship if they leave Greece for permanent residence abroad.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that the Greek move proved that it based
citizenship on ethnic background.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Greece will amend its legislation and introduce
new rules with no discrimination based on ethnic origin," he added.
</P>
<P>
Around 150,000 ethnic Turks are now living in Western
Thrace. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of taking a
discriminative attitude toward them.

<HEADLINE> Controversial French Writer to Visit Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The controversial French writer
Roger Garaudy, who is standing trial in France on anti-Semitism
charges, will arrive here on February 12 for a visit to Egypt, the
Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Invited by Egyptian Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni, Garaudy
will meet on the same day of his arrival with Egyptian thinkers
and intellectuals at a symposium held by organizers of the annual
Cairo Book Fair which will start on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy stood trial before a Paris criminal court last week on
charges of trivializing the alleged Nazi Holocaust of Jews in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, who denies any wrongdoing, was brought to trial after
several anti-racism groups accused him of denying crimes against
humanity in his book "The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics."
</P>
<P>
Garaudy has argued that Hitler's killing of Jews amounted to
"massacres," but it was an exaggeration to call the Nazi crimes
"genocide" or a "Holocaust." He also ruled out that 6 million Jews
were killed.
</P>
<P>
An official of the General Egyptian Book Organization said
Garaudy was invited to Egypt "in a concrete gesture of solidarity
with the Muslim man (Garaudy) who is facing trial because he dared
to air his views on Zionism."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Writers Union has issued a statement in support of
Garaudy and of human rights and free speech. The Egyptian Women
Writers Association sent a plea to French intellectuals to support
Garaudy during his trial.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Garaudy's wife Salma el-Farouk hosted
earlier this week a banquet for Egyptian writers and intellectuals
in Cairo to lobby support for her husband.

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes New Measures against Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
today unveiled a White House initiative to step up efforts against
discrimination in employment and housing during a commemorative
service at an Atlanta church where slain civil rights leader Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. preached.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the Clinton administration plans "the largest single
increase in the enforcement of our civil rights laws in nearly two
decades." There would be "new reforms and heightened commitment to
enforcement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aides said a Clinton budget to be presented to Congress next
month would include an 86 million dollar increase in spending to
target employers and landlords who discriminate based on race or
color, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would increase the use of mediators in an effort
to cut a backlog of 64,000 discrimination cases pending at the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
Gore said, "Dr. King would not let us forget that
African-Americans still earn roughly 62 cents on each dollar that
white Americans earn. He would not let us forget that black
unemployment is still twice as high as unemployment for whites."
</P>
<P>
Gore spoke from the pulpit at an annual ecumenical service at
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King worshiped as a child. He
co-pastored the church with his father from 1960 until he was
assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The service, attended by numerous dignitaries, marked the 69th
birthday of the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta service was one of dozens held across the country
to honor King.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Expands in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The oil spill in southeast
Nigeria's Akwa Ibom State caused by a pipeline leakage, has
expanded to the Bayelsa State to the west, the News Agency of
Nigeria said today.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by Yomi Adeyemi-Wilson, the external
affairs manager of the Mobil Producing Nigerian Unlimited, said
oil patches have been found in the mouth of the Pennington River
and in a fishing village.
</P>
<P>
"Patches of oil were found on the beach, large patches for
about 500 feet with small patches extending for about a mile,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The spill, the worst ever in Nigeria, occurred last Monday
when one of the pipelines linking Mobil's "Idomo" oil field and
its Qua Iboe Export Terminal ruptured.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 40,000 barrels of crude oil are
spilled. The accident also halted oil delivery at the terminal.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mobil is working with the state
and local government agencies with assurance that the company is
taking all appropriate measures to clean up the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Company sources said earlier that about half of the spilled
oil have been cleaned up by last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Western oil companies operating in Nigeria have tense
relations with their operating communities, which have been
demanding compensations for environment damages resulting from
constant spills.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Party Leader Calls Court Ruling Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish pro-Islamic politician
Necmettin Erbakan said Monday that the Constitutional Court made
"a serious mistake" by ordering the closure of the Welfare Party
(RP) led by him.
</P>
<P>
There is no legal reason to shut down the RP which was set up
in accordance with the law, Erbakan told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a state based on law. The mistake of the (court)
decision will be corrected," Erbakan said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Constitutional Court, the country's supreme
judicial organ, announced the closure of the RP on the ground of
its anti-secular stand.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Erbakan and several other RP leaders were also
deprived of their parliamentarian status and will be banned from
engaging in politics for five years.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan met with Bulent Ecevit and Husamettin Cindoruk,
chairmen of two major political parties in the Parliament before
the press conference, but declined to give details of the talks.
Erbakan said he is not intending to rally support against the
Constitutional Court decision.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, also former Turkish prime minister, is expected to
meet other parliamentary party leaders and Parliament Speaker
Hikmet Cetin as well.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his RP have long been accused by the powerful
Turkish military of undermining the country's secular and
democratic systems. As a result, the RP-led coalition government
was forced to step down last summer.
</P>
<P>
The RP, however, denied the charges, saying that it has no plan
to shake Turkey's secularism.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court's ruling on the closure of the RP
also aroused concern from other political parties, which held
that it is so rash to shut down the RP, the largest political
party in the country.
</P>
<P>
The RP followers also organized rallies around the country to
protest against the court decision, but no clashes have been
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
RP Deputy Chairman Ahmet Tekdal said last Friday that no
matter what happens, the party will continue to advance its
course.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Fuel Consumption Increases by 200 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran has witnessed an increase
of nearly 200 percent in fuel consumption in the past 20 years and
it will have to stop exporting oil in 15 years with the trend,
Tehran radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily fuel consumption in Iran has risen to the current 1.5
million barrels of crude oil from 509,000 barrels 20 years ago,
the state-run radio quoted an oil official, who declined to be
named, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that with the current fuel consumption rate, Iran
will not only have to stop exporting oil in 15 years, but import
oil to meet the needs of the domestic market as well.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fast growth of the fuel consumption to
government's subsidies, which he put at 11 billion U.S. dollars,
or twice of Iran's spendings on development plans.
</P>
<P>
The present price of one liter gasoline is 160 rials (about 3-5
cents), less than the cost of transportation from oil refineries
to filling stations.
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian officials have criticized government policy of
subsidizing fuel consumption, and called on the people to save
fuel resources for future generations.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadar has said earlier that
if the government doubles the present fuel prices, the demand for
fuel in Iran will not fall.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil reserves are estimated at about 93 billion barrels,
ranking the fourth in the world, and its gas reserves at 21
trillion cubic meters, the second after Russia.
</P>
<P>
It's oil output set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries stands at 3.94 million barrels per day (bpd), of which
about 2.5 million bpd are for export.
</P>
<P>
It also imports large amount of oil product annually for
domestic demand.

News Agency (INA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Iraqi Health Ministry,
6,163 children below five died last December of diarrhea pleurisy

<HEADLINE> EU Cautiously Backs Italy's Place in EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) finance
and economic ministers today cautiously backed Italy for joining
the economic and monetary union (EMU) after they approved its
projections for public finances.
</P>
<P>
The EU's finance and economic ministers arrived in Brussels
today to attend the first Ecofin meeting held since Britain took
over the rotating EU presidency in January. They were scheduled
to discuss EMU and the Asian crisis at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the EU said measures outlined
in Italy's 1998 budget should keep its deficit below the
EMU-required 3 percent of GDP (gross domestic product), indicating
that progress achieved in 1997 was sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"The council considered that the measures included in the 1998
budget should allow the deficit target of 2.8 percent to be
achieved," the EU said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU also encouraged Italy to vigorously implement the budget
in order to reduce its deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP in the year
2000, which is targeted in its convergence program.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany and the Netherlands still maintain their
neutral position on the cautious support expressed by the council
for Italy's place in EMU. They were the two major critics in the
past of Italy's budgetary performance.
</P>
<P>
They insisted they said nothing about the decision EU leaders
have to take on participants of the first wave of EMU in May,
which is going to be launched in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries admitted that Italy had done a better job
in cleaning up its finances. "We don't have a special position on
Italy. We have no historical or geographical prejudgement as far
as Italy is concerned," said Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi indicated that
Germany and the Netherlands should have had no difficulty in
approving the Ecofin statement.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism about Italy's prospects for joining the
EMU at its launch, adding that "the question of post-EMU
sustainability" remained a problem for all.
</P>
<P>
Italy's huge debt has become its biggest headache. Standing at
123 percent of GDP, it is more than twice the reference of 60
percent set in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said the Italian authorities would try to cut the debt
by 2002 to 100 percent of GDP and reduce it further to 60 percent
by 2010.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Stress Need for Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing financial crisis
in Asia has shown that Europe should be united in order to have a
stronger voice in world affairs and a better defense against
global financial turmoil, European Union finance and economic
ministers said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministers arrived in Brussels today for the first Ecofin
meeting ever held since Britain took over the rotating EU
presidency in January. They also discussed the planned single
currency on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the planned single currency in 1999 would add to
global stability and reinforce Europe's international role, French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He held out hopes that the euro would make the voices of EU
countries be heard "much more loudly and clearly in the world."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the EU needed to ensure Europe was still a
"pole of stability" in a time of instability in Asia. "We need
stability in Asia, but we also need it in Europe," said the French
minister.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi expressed the
same view by saying, "Europe must have a greater voice in world
affairs. The crisis in Asia has shown that Europe has a role and
we must reinforce this."
</P>
<P>
Their Belgian counterpart, Philippe Maystadt, suggested that a
new group be set up to study what kind of role the euro could play
in the international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
However, most EU finance ministers said they saw no real danger
of a severe impact on Europe growth from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordan Brown, who
chaired today's meeting, told reporters that the EU had to be
always alert to what was happening in Asia since, as he said,
"Europe has a higher volume of exports to the region than the
United States, a greater banking exposure than the United States
and Japan combined."
</P>
<P>
The Asian region is now being haunted by a creeping spread of
devaluation, payments problems and financial market instability.
International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund
has been forced to wade in to help.

WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today deplored the incident in which the Guatemalan gunmen robbed
and assaulted a group of American college students in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of concern, obviously, for the victims and their
families," Clinton told reporters while he helped renovate a local
high school at a King Day service project. "It's a terrible
thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed his confidence that the Guatemalan
government is taking "appropriate action."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a bus carrying 16 students and teachers from St.
Mary's College in Maryland was ambushed by a group of gunmen on an
isolated Guatemalan highway. Five women were raped.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between British Prime Minister, Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on Monday in Downing
Street was "constructive and worthwhile," the British prime
minister's official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that recent killings are an attempt to derail the
process and that we must not be deflected from the democratic and
peaceful path," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the second between Blair and Adams in recent
weeks, the prime minister said he was absolutely committed to the
process and it was a government priority to save the fragile peace
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair and Adams used "virtually the same words" in
condemning the wave of tit-for-tat killings since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
A prominent pro-British Protestant was killed in his carpet
shop on the outskirts of Belfast hours before Blair met with
Adams. And soon after the meeting, a Catholic taxi driver died in
hospital in Belfast after suffering five gunshot wounds in his
upper body.
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed that the most recent Anglo-Irish peace plan,
which Sinn Fein has rejected, was merely a basis for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Adams said the talks were frank, but
he told Blair that Sinn Fein rejected a new Anglo-Irish peace
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who thought proposals for a power-sharing assembly in
Northern Ireland would work was not "living in the real world," he
told reporters.

BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Belgium said today it was
banning all imports of pigs from Germany where more than 80,000
animals had been slaughtered due to two recent outbreaks of
classic swine fever.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Belgian Farm Minister Karel
Pinxten said the ban, which would go into effect at midnight, was
aimed at hindering the highly infectious disease from crossing
into Belgium.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all pig farmers in the country who had imported
German pigs lately to be on alert to any signs of the disease
developing.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s veterinary authorities are scheduled
to discuss the swine fever outbreak Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An aide to EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said an export
ban was possible if Germany failed to control the outbreak by
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes Higher Spending on Civil Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Marking the Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday Monday, U.S. Vice President Al Gore proposed
increasing civil rights spending.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration will propose spending 602 million
dollars to enforce civil rights laws in the 1999 budget, up from
516 million dollars this year, Gore said at Ebenezer Baptist
Church in Atlanta, Georgia, King's hometown.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere across the country, the slain civil rights leader was
honored with prayers, service projects, parades and, for the first
time, a halt in trading on U.S. financial markets. King turned 69
last week.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the proposed civil rights spending boost will include
a 22 million-dollar increase for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to fight housing discrimination. Other changes
would strengthen investigations of police brutality and
enforcement of the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
Details will be included in the budget to be submitted by
President Bill Clinton next month.
</P>
<P>
King "would be proud to see how much we have done to banish
discrimination from our laws. But I believe he would tell us that
we still have much to do in banishing discrimination from our
hearts," Gore was quoted as saying by new reports.
</P>
<P>
The service was one of hundreds of events around the country
honoring King three decades after his assassination in Memphis,
Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
Clinton helped renovate a school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people in St. Louis observed the day at
ceremony at the Old Courthouse where the Dred Scott case, a
pivotal test of pre-Civil War slavery law, was tried more than 150
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Monday was the first ever King holiday for Ocoee, Florida,
where a 1920 race riot killed at least six people and drove blacks
away.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Humanitarian Aid for China Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
today it had approved humanitarian aid worth 525,000 ECUs (some
630,000 U.S. dollars) for victims of a recent earthquake in the
Hebei province of northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which took place on January 10, reportedly killed 50
people, injured about 10,000 and left tens of thousands homeless
(please check).
</P>
<P>
The EU said on the same day that it had also approved
humanitarian aid for victims of El Nino, a warming Pacific Ocean
current which disrupts climate pattern, in Andean countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said it had
rushed through humanitarian aid worth 4.1 million ECUs (about 4.8
million dollars) for the El Nino victims.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has caused widespread damage across the globe in recent
months, including heavy flooding in South America and raging bush
fires in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The aid would enable European non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) to carry out emergency aid programs in Ecuador, Peru and
Bolivia, the EU executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has also approved humanitarian aid worth 10
million ECUs (12 million dollars) for regions of Poland and the
Czech Republic which suffered catastrophic floods last summer.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of inmates in U.S.
jails and prisons reached more than 1.7 million last June, local
press reported today, citing official figures.
</P>
<P>
The incarceration rate of the United States stood at 645 per
100,000 people in 1997, compared to 313 per 100,000 in 1985, the
New York Times quoted a Justice Department study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, jails house those awaiting trail or serving
terms of less than a year, while prisons are considered as those
holding convicts serving longer sentences.
</P>
<P>
Drug offenses have accounted for over a third of the growth in
the incarcerated people since early 1970s and the incarceration
rate for drug arrests has climbed 1,000 percent since 1980,
criminologist Alfred Blumsterin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the incarceration rate for drug offenders alone
accounts for about 145 per 100,000 today.
</P>
<P>
Professor John J. DiIulio Jr of Princeton University said he
has found that 25 percent of the new inmates in New York State are
drug-only offenders, not involving other types of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the proportion of criminals entering the
prison for the second or more time has gone up steadily since
1980.

BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
investigation team today set out for a 24-hour mission to Algeria
for unprecedented talks with its authorities on six years of
bloodshed in the oil-rich North African state.
</P>
<P>
The three junior ministers, led by British junior foreign
minister Derek Fatchett and accompanied by European Commissioner
Manual Marin, were due to arrive in Algiers later on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett and his counterparts from Luxembourg and Austria will
meet Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, opposition members of
parliament and newspaper editors before returning home late on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss a wave of massacres that has taken the lives
of more than 1,100 men, women and children in the past three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time the Algerian government has showed
willingness to discuss the conflict with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
After repeatedly rejecting such discussions as interference in
its internal affairs, Algeria agreed to the mission under intense
pressure, but stood firm on its insistence that the talks should
focus on joint efforts to confront "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Algiers has also rejected any inquiry into the massacres, for
which, as for the rest of the six-year-old conflict, it blames
Muslim rebels.

<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece announced on Monday that
Stratis Stratigis would head the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee
of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said that the country had decided to establish two committees,
namely the National Olympic Committee and the Athens 2004
Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the Aegis of Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, the
National Olympic Commitee would monitor preparation and evaluate
the work carried out.
</P>
<P>
The main responsibility for organization and execution of the
works would be undetaken by the Athens 2004 Organizing Commitee,
which would operate as a societe anonyme, to be headed by the
64-year-old Stratigis, a lawyer and former new democracry and
democratic renewal parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
It was the Greek government's desire to set up "an efficient
and flexible scheme" which would guarantee the preparation and
execution of the games under a regime of absolute transparency and
control, he said, adding that "this set-up meets that aspiration,
as Greece's goal is to prove that it is capable of successfully
completing the task it has undertaken."
</P>
<P>
Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who headed the Athens 2004
Bidding Committee, would be a member of the National Olympic
Committee after her personal request not to participate in the
organizing committee for "personal reasons."
</P>
<P>
In early September last year, Athens won the right to stage the
2004 summer Olympic Games after defeating the other four cities
such as Rome, Cape Town, Stockholm and Buenos Aires.

Hundreds of tests had been conducted on the instrument before
two field experiments, which respectively took place in a port

During the two field tests, the collector dived 140 meters
deep, and 13 of its sampling bottles were filled with collected
sediments, when it came back out of the water.

<HEADLINE> Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven Bid for World Heritage Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
applied for the inclusion of Beijing's Summer Palace and Temple of
Heaven on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will inspect the two sites next
month.
</P>
<P>
The Summer Palace, initiated in the mid-18th century, was
burned by the British and French Joint Forces in 1860 and rebuilt
in 1886. Famous for its buildings combined with mountains and
lakes, China's largest imperial garden attracts 40-50 million
tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southern part of Beijing, the Temple of Heaven
was where emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties worshipped for a good harvest. It is an example of
ancient sacrificial structure.
</P>
<P>
China has 19 sites on the World Heritage List, including the
Great Wall and the Forbidden City. The Suzhou Gardens in east
China's Jiangsu Province was added to the list last month.

<HEADLINE> Talks Only Way Forward in N.Ireland, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam appealed on Tuesday to all parties
involved in the peace talks in Northern Ireland to be ready to
change their stance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mowlam said negotiation was "the way
we are going to deal with extremists on both sides."
</P>
<P>
Despite the violence in the divided province in recent weeks,
the British government would seek to do everything possible to
move the talks forward, she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also vowed to stand firm against a wave of
sectarian revenge killings in Northern Ireland, saying the
government would not allow splinter guerrilla groups to derail the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined not to let our will be broken by these
splinter-groups...who are just interested in breaking the peace
talks," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic taxi driver was shot dead on Monday in the
third tit-for-tat killing in the troubled province, the seventh
bloody murder since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The killings overshadowed the talks in London between Prime
Minister Tony Blair and leaders of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican
Army's political wing.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told reporters after the talks
with Blair that his party rejected the proposal for a
power-sharing assembly for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who thinks an internal settlement is going to work, or
some assembly with a few nationalist knobs stuck on to it is going
to work is not living in the real world," Adams said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry Margaret Backett said on Tuesday her
country has particular interest in investing in Pakistan's power
generation and oil exploration sectors.
</P>
<P>
Backett, who is also president of the Board of Trade of
Britain, said this when she called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She was accompanied by a large delegation of officials and
business executives representing major British companies doing
business in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Backett praised the prime minister's economic policies which
she said had attracted considerable interest of British companies
in Pakistan, particularly in power generation, distribution and
transmission as well as oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
Sharif described Pakistan's relations with Britain as important
and said that the optimistic economic outlook of the country would
attract greater British interest in investment and joint ventures
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He assured the delegation that there would be no impediments in
their business operations and his government would try its utmost
to facilitate greater economic and commercial contacts and
exchanges between Pakistan and the United Kingdom.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, extended new year's greetings
to more than 2,000 retired officials who gathered in a reception
at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Hu stressed that Party officials at
all levels should put people's interests foremost and should not
cut themselves off from the masses.
</P>
<P>
At present, leading officials should help address problems
facing laid-off workers, the retired and the poor, Hu said, and
concern themselves with the well-being of these people.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the Party committee at all levels should discipline
themselves, get rid of lax work habits and strive for a situation
under which misconduct is ruthlessly exposed and criticized.
</P>
<P>
Hu described the Party veterans as "the treasure of the Party
and the nation" and urged concerned departments to take care of
their needs, especially those in less-developed areas and in
poorly operated enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The reception was given by the Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee, the General Political Department of the
People's Liberation Army and the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee.

<HEADLINE> Top Leaders Show Concern for Tibetans Hit by Snowstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Jiang
Chunyun today urged governments at all levels to spare no effort
in supporting the fight against the effects of a severe snowstorm
that hit Nagqu in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"We must work to ensure the safety of all those hit by the
snowstorm, and create necessary conditions for post-storm
rebuilding of the area," Jiang told a group that just returned
from Nagqu in north Tibet, where they conveyed the solicitude of
central authorities to local people.
</P>
<P>
Since the storm hit the area last month, Chinese president
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng repeatedly have concerned
themselves with conditions in the disaster area. A special group
was dispatched by the central authorities on Jan. 7 to help with
disaster relief in Nagqu.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the great difficulties of disaster relief in a
high-altitude area such as Nagqu, Jiang called for governments at
all levels to boost their confidence in fighting the disaster.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his belief that, with the correct leadership and
deep concern of the central authorities as well as support from
across the nation, people affected by the snowstorm are bound to
overcome the disaster.

<HEADLINE> DPRK in Urgent Need of Foreign Food Aid: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Because of summer's serious
drought, the amount of food per person in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) from October 1997 to September 1998 is a
mere 180 grams a day, a senior official says.
</P>
<P>
Cha Limsok, deputy director of the Farm Produce Bureau of the
Agricultural Commission under the Administration Council, said
DPRK people were in urgent need of international help. He was
speaking in a recent interview with the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the DPRK had revealed such statistics to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Cha said the DPRK's gross grain output in 1997 amounted to
2.685 million tons, which was processed into 2.148 million tons of
cereals.
</P>
<P>
The minimum need for grain between October 1997 and September
1998 is estimated at 4.022 million tons, but this figure falls
short by 60 percent now, he said.
</P>
<P>
After deducting seeds and feed grains, the country only had
1.422 million tons of grain in storage by the end of September
last year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to make good the food deficit, the central government
plans to import 500,000 tons of grain and will appeal to the
international community for another 700,000 tons of aid in grain.
</P>
<P>
The disaster area hit by summer's drought covers 466,000
hectares of cultivated land in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In late August, the country's western coastal grain-producing
region was struck by typhoon and tsunami. These caused an
additional grain loss of 700,000 tons. The number of victims of
the natural calamities totaled 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Cha said the DPRK government and the people will try their best
to achieve a good harvest in 1998, but are still short of more
than 7,000 tons of barley seeds, 1000 tons of corn seeds and
considerable amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Stays Under Control in HK: Yam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Corruption has continued to
be effectively contained in Hong Kong after the handover, Lily Yam
Kwan Pui-ying, the commissioner of the Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC), said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some people had worried about a deterioration of corruption in
the newly established Special Administrative Region (SAR), but
things have turned out to be different, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts made by the ICAC staff and the wide support from
the local community are viewed as major reasons why Hong Kong
stays a clean place.
</P>
<P>
ICAC figures revealed that in the year 1997, corruption reports
(excluding election reports) received by the ICAC totaled 3,057,
down 1 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
A high 68 percent of people gave their names when reporting to
the ICAC, demonstrating their confidence in the
corruption-fighting body, Yam noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the total reports, 512 reports or some 17 percent were
related to the police force, down 11 percent from the previous
year's 576 reports.
</P>
<P>
Around half of the reports were related to the private sector,
in particular the construction sector, the financial sector and
the property sector. "The ICAC will intensify preventive
education in the business sector this year," Yam pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The remaining reports concerned other government departments
and public bodies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 314 people were prosecuted in 1997, dropping 8
percent from 1996, while 208 people were convicted, down 14
percent. But government servants recommended for consideration of
disciplinary or administrative action soared by 60 percent to
total 356.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border corruption recorded 74 cases in 1997, down from 92
cases in 1996. Yam pointed out that the ICAC will continue its
cooperation with authorities on China's inland areas, in
particular the neighboring Guangdong province, in the crackdown on
the cross-border corruption.

KATHMANDU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to grant a technical assistance of 500,000 U.S.
dollars to assist the Nepali government in strengthening its
project performance management system, the ADB said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance will support the establishment of an
accountable and result-oriented institutional framework for the
programming, budgeting and management of development projects, the
bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The improved procedures and systems will enable the Nepali
government to formulate and prioritize projects based on clear
development criteria, implement and monitor these projects
effectively by keeping track of and comparing project results with
actual and expected outputs and impacts, identify implementation
issues for timely and necessary corrective actions, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The press release noted that Nepal is a resource-constrained
country, so there is a need to improve the efficiency of
utilization of the available resources, which can be achieved
through prioritization of development projects and strengthening
of project formulation and management capacity.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is a member of the Nepal Aid Group.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Enjoys Easy First Round Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Martina
Hingis breezed into the second round of the Australian Open
Wednesday after routing German Wiltrud Probst 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Hingis has often used the early rounds in grand slams as a time
to experiment and the World No.1 saw no reason to change after
collecting three major titles last year.
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty good," Hingis said. "It was a fine win for me
and good to try out a lot of things."
</P>
<P>
Hingis is back at the scene of her major breakthrough, the
place where the 17-year-old Swiss collected her first major
tournament.
</P>
<P>
She went on last year to capture Wimbledon and the US Open,
thus becoming the third teenager after Steffi Graf and Monica
Seles to win three or more grand slam singles titles in one year.
</P>
<P>
Hingis' main worry shouldn't come until the fourth round where
she is on track for a meeting with Belgian Dominique Van Roost,
the No.14 seed.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost's best grand slam performance was here last year when
she reached the quarter-finals and was forced to retire with an
abdominal strain while trailing Mary Joe Fernandez 7-5, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's match, Van Roost beat Canadian Rene Simpson 6-3,
6-2 to move into the second round but was given treatment by a
trainer at courtside for what appeared to be a shoulder complaint.
</P>
<P>
Russian teenager Anna Kournikova swept into round two with a
speedy 6-2, 6-1 win over Slovakian Katarina Studenikova and at the
other end of the spectrum Czech veteran Helena Sukova bowed out of
singles tennis with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-0 loss to American Anne Miller.

grant of 2.6 million U.S. dollars to selected Asian countries for
banking, capital market and international competitiveness reforms.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance, to be funded from the

totaling around 8.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance will be implemented initially for a
period of one year this year, with possible additional funding for
two years, the ADB said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Specialists will assist the selected countries' finance,
planning, trade and industry ministries in designing and
implementing sector reforms and programs.
</P>
<P>
The consultants will also submit a comprehensive report on how
the crisis was handled through sector reforms at the end of the
first year.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad plans to meet Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai next month to discuss the
regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Tuesday he would exchange views on the crisis

Mahathir said the Singapore leader was of the view that if the
countries of the region were not careful the economic problem
could become more serious.
</P>
<P>
"However, he saw signs of recovery and hoped the situation in

<HEADLINE> Businesses Call for Protection of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four large and
super-large manufacturing businesses in eight provinces along the
Yangtze River have called for less pollution of the longest river
in China.
</P>
<P>
At a forum to protect the Yangtze River, also Asia's longest
and the world's third longest, held recently in Wuhan, a hub on
the middle reaches of the river, representatives of the businesses
urged factories in the Yangtze River Valley to reduce their
discharge of wastes and polluting materials into the river,
according to Beijing-based China Women's News.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the state enact laws and regulations
to protect the Yangtze from further pollution.
</P>
<P>
About 15 billion tons of waste water is discharged into the
Yangtze and its tributaries each year, according to the Bureau of
Protection of Water Resources in the Yangtze Valley.
</P>
<P>
And 70 percent of the waste water dumped into the Yangtze are
from industrial sources, and large and super-large factories are
responsible for 80 percent of the industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four of 59 major cities in the valley have a water
shortage as a result of the pollution, and experts predict the
problem will be exacerbated with further economic expansion of the
river.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of French Teachers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of teachers
across France went on a strike Tuesday to protest about unequal
pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The protesting teachers are "instituteurs" who are older and
who are categorized by the government as state employees.
</P>
<P>
They claim that they are paid less than "professeurs d'ecoles,"
their colleagues who are younger, college trained license holders.
</P>
<P>
The strikers say they should be paid the same as the
professeurs d'ecole, because both are doing the same job in front
of the same kids.
</P>
<P>
But the government has set a quota for the number of
instituteurs and professseurs d'ecole, because an overall
integration of the two groups would cost billions of francs.
</P>
<P>
The union which represents the instituteurs said that half the
teachers were on strike Tuesday, in 75 percent of the departments
registered with the union.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A multi-media data base
consultation system developed to replace the traditional
exhibition fair has opened today in Beijing. The system offers
access from home to China's 60,000 major pieces of scientific data
collected during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
As a key technical project in China's Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), the multi-media system passed an expert
assessment today and was put into use by the State Planning
Commission (SPC).
</P>
<P>
Lu Da, deputy director of the Optical Memory National
Engineering Research Center of Qinghua University, said the giant
system contains information on video and audio frequencies as well
as graphics and characters equaling the storage of 60 optical
disks.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who participated in the development of the system, said any
overseas subscriber can gain access via the Internet with SPC
authorization.
</P>
<P>
China used to held an exhibition fair every five years to
display its scientific achievements at a cost of at least 10
million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
An official from the SPC said the system not only keeps
scientific documents on record and replaces the exhibition fair,
but also accelerates their promotion.
</P>
<P>
China has poured nine billion yuan (1.08 billion U.S. dollars)
into 180 major scientific research programs in the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period, and reaped an economic return of more than
60 billion yuan (7.2 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Feature: British Man to Bicycle Along Yellow River (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a photographer, he is already anticipating a variety of
natural landscapes along the river, which got "yellow" in its name
because of the muddy water.
</P>
<P>
He expects to take in focus the fertile flat on the lower
reaches of the river, the Loess Plateau at the middle, a vast
desert area where Genghis Khan's tomb lies and rocky Qinghai
Province, the source of the river.
</P>
<P>
Bishop's cycling on the Yellow River would be 500 miles further
away from his major of business management in a British
University. Since graduation, he worked nine years in a
company. Then he realized that he needed to be out in the nature
and quit his job. He spend the next three years traveling in
Africa, and then headed straight to the Silk Road in China, before
settling down in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Bishop said that his years of trekking on the fields and
tapping on the keyboards has been very rewarding and enhanced his
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago, if someone had said to me, 'you can write a
book,' I would have thought they were mad. But I had the idea and
I had the desire to do the book, so I proved to myself that if you
want to do something, you'll find a way to do it, and if you work
hard enough, you succeed in doing something," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bishop hopes that his experiences would encourage "people who
have doubts that they maybe can't do something."
</P>
<P>
"If they really want to do something, they can find a way," he
stressed.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 China's anti-drug

<HEADLINE> Ancient Stone Structure Rivals Greek Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists claim
they have found a 2,000-year-old stone structure that rivals
ancient Greek or Roman relics.
</P>
<P>
The structure, a 200-meter stone canal connected with a pool,
was found at the site of the imperial palaces of the Nanyue
Kingdom which ruled over present-day Guangdong Province during the
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD). The site is in downtown
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The canal, 1.4 meters wide, was made of stones that were paved
in a broken-ice crackle design. On the bottom were black cobbles
dotted with yellow ones.
</P>
<P>
Two stone dams were set up in the canal to create a spray.
</P>
<P>
To the eastern end of the canal was a pool in the shape of a
crescent moon. Among the silt at the bottom of the pool were
remains of hundreds of turtles, with the largest turtle shell
measuring 44 centimeters wide.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Beijing-based State Bureau of Cultural Relics
said that the stone structure was the same as that built in the
imperial palace complex of Liu Bang, the first emperor of the
Western Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that Liu built such a stone canal
between Changle and Weiyang palaces in Changan, present-day Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. No remnants of that
structure have ever been found.

<HEADLINE> HK's Customs Achieves Fruitful Results in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Customs and
Excise Department had achieved "considerable" achievements in
various areas of work in the past year, Lawrence Li, commissioner
of customs and excise of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Protection of intellectual property rights was high on the list
of priorities of the department, Li said in a year-end statement
to review the department's work in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Additional resources were allocated to this area and new
legislation was introduced to strengthen enforcement capabilities
in the fight against copyright pirates, Li said.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the department arrested 1,568 persons in 1,473
cases for copyright offenses and 959 persons in 1,087 cases for
counterfeit offenses, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Value of goods seized amounted to 397.7 million HK dollars
(50.99 million U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our most notable success was in driving the copyright pirates
out of the most notorious shopping arcades," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the protection of intellectual property rights,
the department also achieved fruitful results in collecting
revenue, fighting smuggling and protecting consumers' interests,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The department collected a total of 10,298.3 million HK dollars
(1,320.3 million U.S. dollars) of revenue in 1997, roughly six
percent of the government's annual income in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Hong Kong has maintained its full capability as a
customs service after the handover on July 1, 1997, and it
continued to function in the way that it was used to.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong customs department has maintained a healthy and
growing cooperative relationship with the colleagues in China's
inland areas, "but we make our own decisions," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We have continued to participate in international conferences
and maintained and developed our relationship with other customs
administrations and law enforcement agencies around the world," he
added.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the challenges in the years ahead, the
department is undergoing a process of modernization and has
already launched a number of new projects.
</P>
<P>
These include new computer systems, construction of a new
customhouse which will commerce in April this year, additional
customs launches, new installations for customs at the new airport
at Chek Lap Kok and planning for a customs headquarters
building.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty people and two units were
awarded prizes today granted by the China Aviation Fund for
dedication to the country's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Those honored are technicians working on the first line of
aviation research, production and experimentation, and they have
contributed to China's aviation science and technology, especially
the six successful rocket launchings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of recommendations by the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense and the China
Aviation Industrial Corp., the people and units were selected by
Chinese aviation experts through secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
China Aviation Fund was established in October of 1996 to honor
devoted aviation figures, finance scientific exchange programs and
foster talents in the aviation field. Its main funding source is
donations from domestic and overseas enterprises, units and
individuals supporting China's aviation industry.

The Yellow River book, like the book on the imperial way, will
have company sponsors' names, logos and even a CEO's speech, the
40-year-old man said.
</P>
<P>
Bishop, who has short silvery hair and black whiskers, chose to
write on the Yellow River, China's second longest river, instead
of the longer Yangtze, because much has been written about the
latter.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment everyone else is writing about Yangtze, because
it's a hot topic with the Three Gorges dam -- they talk about
environmental issues," he said. "In fact there already have been
several books on the Yangtze, from different angles."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Bishop finds a blank area concerning information
on the Yellow River. He punched "Yellow River" on a computer but
nothing came up. In a library he got a mere couple of paragraphs
on the river from books writing about China.
</P>
<P>
"The Yellow River seems to have been neglected, but it's still
an important river, but nobody is writing about it at the moment,"
he said. "So I thought, well, it's high time it was written about
again."
</P>
<P>
Bishop believes that his second book, which is on the Yellow
River, would be more interesting and successful. The first book,
on the imperial way, had sold 5,000 copies.

<HEADLINE> France Wishes to Further Develop Ties With China: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Monday that France wishes to further develop its
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists on the eve of his
official visit to China scheduled for January 22-23, Vedrine said
that the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
attaches as much importance to developing relations with China as
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that during his visit to China in May last year,
President Chirac signed with Chinese President Jiang Zemin a joint
political declaration on establishing global partnership between
France and China.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that France and China are two very important
countries in the world, and that both of them are permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, the
reinforcement of bilateral consultations and a comparison of their
views will contribute to the construction of a multipolar world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no field of contention between France and
China and that his forthcoming visit to China will enable him to
discuss with Chinese leaders bilateral relations and international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also pointed out that economic relations between France
and China are insufficient as compared with the political
relations between them.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to redouble the efforts by both
sides to increase economic exchanges, especially in the field of
aeronautics, nuclear energy, financial service and agriculture and
food.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that France supports a useful
dialogue rather than confrontation over human rights with China.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that the French government is committed to
the 1994 Sino-French joint communique in which France promised not
to sell arms to Taiwan from then on.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of China, Benin Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
here today held talks with Benin President Mathieu Kerekou,
exchanging opinions on bilateral relations and other issues of
common interests in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed Kerekou to China for the third time, and said
that Kerekou is the first foreign head of state to visit China in
the new year. The Benin president is a familiar and respectable
friend of the Chinese people, Jiang said, who has greatly
contributed to the promotion of mutual understanding and
friendship between the two nations and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believed the Benin president's visit would
further the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the restoration of diplomatic relations
25 years ago, the peoples of China and Benin have respected each
other, trusted each other and supported each other. The two
nations have demonstrated friendly and fruitful cooperation in
such areas as politics, trade, military and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between China and Benin has withstood the test
of time and a changeable world situation, Jiang stressed, adding
that China was satisfied with the development of their bilateral
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Benin, both developing countries, share many common
interests in international affairs, and have cooperated in the
United Nations and other multi-lateral areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must thank the president and Benin government for their
constant support to China on human right issues and on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The president attaches great importance to the friendship with
China, adheres to the 'one China' policy, and supports China's
reunification cause."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people treasure the traditional
friendship with Benin, Jiang said, adding that on the basis of
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China is ready to join
with Benin to further develop long-term and stable, sincere and
friendly bilateral links of overall cooperation geared to the
future. The two countries should constantly advance the bilateral
friendship and cooperative ties to a new stage, he added.

<P>
Kerekou recalled his visit to China in 1986. He said he felt
honored to be granted an interview with the great Deng Xiaoping,
who was a great friend to African people, and toward whom the
African people cherish a feeling of great reverence.
</P>
<P>
Kerekou said China provided valuable assistance to Benin during
the past 25 years. Many places in Benin carry the mark of China's
assistance in helping to build and develop the country.
</P>
<P>
China also supported Benin's fight for independence and
sovereignty, he said, offering on behalf of the Benin government
and people his sincere thanks to China.
</P>
<P>
China is Benin's most sincere friend, he said. The friendship
between the two nations will exist for a long time no matter what
happens, he said, and Benin will always be China's reliable friend.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world, he said, and the Benin
government recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of
China as the sole legitimate government on behalf of all the
Chinese people and Taiwan as one of its provinces. Benin firmly
supports China's bid for reunification.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government values its economic and trade
cooperation with Benin. During the last 25 years, the two
countries have developed various and effective cooperation in
these areas on the basis of equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Although China's assistance to Benin is limited in amount, its
help is sincere and unselfish, Jiang said, adding that China is
willing to continue its assistance to Benin, and to actively probe
new areas and ways to develop bilateral cooperation based on
equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is ready to promote trade between Chinese
companies and Benin, and encourage Chinese companies to expand
imports from Benin, and visit Benin to discuss joint equity or
cooperation between the two nation's businesses, Jiang said.

Africa and in the world and the latter also briefed the Benin
president on China's policy toward Africa.

<HEADLINE> Most S. Koreans Prefer Wage Cuts to Mass Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Six out of every 10 South Koreans
would like to share the country's current hardships through wage
cuts instead of mass layoffs, said a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Hyundai Research Institute among 500
adults across the nation, showed that 63 percent of those surveyed
said they or their families feared losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
To survive the economic restructuring set by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for the rescue loans of 57 billion
U.S. dollars, 68 percent said they preferred sharing pains through
cutting labor hours and wages.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three percent said they were willing to endure a 10
percent wage cut if it would help avoid large-scale layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Once the 11th largest economy in the world, the country has
been in serious financial crisis since the late 1997. It was
triggered by the failure of conglomerates and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The per capita productivity in the nation has dropped to 9,400
U.S. dollars from the previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Voter Registration Ends with Good Results (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A two-month-odd registration
drive for the Hong Kong Legislative Council election concluded
with a total of 2.77 million eligible people registered in
geographical constituencies.
</P>
<P>
This represented a registration rate of nearly 70 percent of
3.96 million eligible electors in Hong Kong and an increase of
240,000 compared with the figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, half of an estimate of 230,000 eligible people in
Functional constituencies have also registered.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the Electoral Affairs
Commission, expressed the satisfaction with the final result,
saying that he was quite happy about it.
</P>
<P>
The smooth voter registration is believed to be a result of
common efforts by both the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the May Legislative Council election,
the first of its kind since Hong Kong returned to China last July,
is regarded as one of the important steps for the Hong Kong people
to govern Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the election is to produce a Legislative
Council which is credible and representative. The 60-member
legislature will be made up of 20 to be returned from the
geographical constituencies through direct election, 30 by
functional constituencies and 10 by an 800-member Election
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is committed to ensuring that the
arrangements for the election are fair, open and honest and is
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government has attached great importance to
the voter registration drive from November 5 last year to January
16 this year and spared no efforts to make it convenient for
every eligible resident to exercise their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
Posters bearing "Hong Kong is our home" and "Let's create our
future together" both in Chinese and English were specially
designed for the election registration and could be seen on walls
of major office and residential buildings during the registration
period.

The Home Affairs Department set up counters at MTR stations and
bus termini to help people register.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30,000 voter registration ambassadors, who are
mostly teenage students, walked out to knock doors of every family
throughout Hong Kong in early December to help those who are Hong
Kong permanent residents and are 18 years old or above sign up as
electors for the Legislative Council election.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they visited nearly two million households during
the voter registration week from December 6 to 12.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a very impressive record. Every household has
been given the opportunity and convenience at their doorstep to
sign up as electors," Woo said.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office also had a series of
briefings for major organizations to explain the registration
process and made thousands of telephone calls to urge all eligible
people in functional constituencies to register.
</P>
<P>
In addition, David Lan Hong-tsun, secretary for Home Affairs,
visited a center for the elderly to help senior citizens to
complete the registration form. Other officials also went to
hospitals, universities and some other organizations to help
people get registered.
</P>
<P>
The concerted efforts of the government and people have brought
about a good beginning for the Legislative Council election.
However, much work still remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
The Registration and Electoral Office is now working flat out
to process the data collected from new applicants and previously
registered electors.
</P>
<P>
The revised guidelines on election-related activities for the
Legislative Council general election on May 24 and the Election
Committee subsector election in April are expected to be published
in February based on wide-ranging public consultations.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the objectives set by the government will
be surely realized so long as the principle of Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong is fully implemented.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Recruit All Civil Servants Through Open Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The system of recruiting new
civil servants through open exams is now practiced in all
departments of China's central government, as well as every
provincial government across the country, an official with the
Ministry of Personnel said here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the State Council issued the Provisional Regulations on
Civil Servants in 1993, the Chinese central government has
organized nine major exams to recruit nearly 3,000 civil servants
from over 40,000 candidates, said Liu Jialin, director of the Exam
and Recruitment Department under the Personnel Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"To date, all departments under the State Council, except four
which have no vacancy, have adopted the exam system in their
recruitment," he said, adding that provincial governments of the
31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across China
have all followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, governments at the provincial, prefectural,
county and township levels in 18 provinces even held unified exams
to recruit new blood. A total of 520,000 people competed for the
53,000 offered positions.
</P>
<P>
"Among all these newly-recruited civil servants, 2,636 used to
be farmers, and 664 used not to be residents of the places where
they are now serving as public servants," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At a recent conference in Beijing, Dai Guangqian, vice minister
of personnel, pointed out that at present, most Chinese people
know that anyone who wants to be civil servants can participate in
and must pass the open exam of recruitment.
</P>
<P>
"This should be regarded as a major step forward in China's
reform of personnel system and adoption of the civil service
system," he commented.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that due to the upcoming government streamlining,
which was decided during the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China last September, it would be impossible
for the central government bodies to enroll too many people this
year.
</P>
<P>
"But we should by no means lower our standards on choosing the
people, and the principle of basing all recruitments on open exams
would never be abandoned or changed," he vowed.

BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,722 people were
killed by more than 140,000 major fires last year in China,
causing a total property loss of 1.54 billion yuan (193 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fires also injured 4,930, according to a senior official
with the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, 5,600 people were rescued and 168.5
billion yuan worth of property was saved because of the efforts of
relevant departments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The number of fires was increasing, but there were fewer
conflagrations which caused great human and property losses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires were attributed to inadequate safety
precautions in buildings, a lack of fire-control systems and
public fire-prevention facilities, and inadequate awareness of the
danger of fires among the general public, he added.

This would be his second such long march after he covered the

Kevin Bishop, who's been residing in Hong Kong for ten years,

for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Only able to make simple and superfacial conversations in
Chinese, the 190-cm-tall man is also looking around for an
English-speaking Chinese assistant to cycle with him along the
river. The man will also be responsible for making research on the
Yellow River and arranging interviews for him with local people.
</P>
<P>
Bishop, told Xinhua in a recent snowy day that he is also
contacting some big companies who work along the Yellow River for
sponsors. Because the proceeds of Yellow River book will go to a
charity, the Orbis, whose flying eye hospital is active in China,
he hopes that some companies will like his idea and regard their
contribution as worthwhile.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Substantial Progress in Sino-U.S. Strategic Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's first snow of the new
year in mid-January ushered in the first U.S. cabinet member --
Defense Secretary William Cohen, which indicates a good beginning
for the Sino-U.S. strategic dialogue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local media agreed that Cohen, who led a 57-member delegation
on an official visit here Jan. 17-20, represents another
high-level contact between the two countries since President Jiang
Zemin's successful state visit to the United States in October
last year and the continuation of Sino-U.S. strategic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The media noted that the ties between the two states and the
two armies have been further improved and are more mature, and
substantial progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's just-ended visit is another step of a substantial
nature for the two countries toward establishing a constructive
strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century, and should
serve to lay a solid foundation for this year's visit to China by
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Cohen was warmly received and
honored with high courtesy and his achievements were obvious in
his 68-hour stay in Beijing: meetings with Jiang and Vice-Premier
Qian Qichen, and talks and meetings with senior Chinese military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also visited military facilities in Beijing and was the
first U.S. secretary of defense to speak at the Academy of
Military Science of the People's Liberation Army. He signed an
agreement establishing a consultation mechanism to strengthen
maritime military safety.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and his Chinese hosts exchanged views "in a frank way" on
international and regional situations, bilateral relations and
other issues of shared concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Cohen during their meeting that both sides regarded
his October visit to the United States as a complete
success. Jiang said he welcomes Clinton's upcoming visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, commenting on military ties, said in the past year that
contacts between the two armies have been active and that both
sides had fruitful talks during Cohen's current visit. He said he
hoped the new year would see greater progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also foreign minister of China, said leaders of the two
nations have set a goal of making concerted efforts toward the
establishment of a Sino-U.S. constructive strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current Sino-U.S. ties as good, Qian said this
relationship is now faced with new opportunities and the ties
between the two armies should lead to even greater progress
following the improvement of state ties.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chinese military sector, Qian said that in the past
year military ties have gained momentum and now enter into a new
period of advancement in which Cohen's visit signals a good
beginning.
</P>
<P>
The military leaders stressed that the signing of the agreement
on a military consultation mechanism indicates the army ties have
made substantial progress, which is conducive to peace and
stability in Asia and the Pacific, and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will serve to enhance mutual understanding, trust
and cooperation, a concrete indication of the positive efforts of
both sides for peace and stability, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China has made positive efforts to safeguard world and regional
peace and stability, Qian said, and its ties with all powers
within the region have improved, while good neighbor ties have
been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that China has become an important yet
positive factor to promote peace, stability and prosperity in
Asia, the Pacific and the world, Qian said.

<P>
However, there have been problems in Sino-U.S. ties, the most
important and most sensitive of which is the Taiwan issue. If this
can be handled well, bilateral ties are expected to advance.
Otherwise, there could be some rough spots in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
On a series of occasions, Cohen stressed that it is very
important for the United States to develop ties with China, as
both countries are powers with great influence as well as
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Both nations will try to strengthen consultations and
cooperation, and jointly promote stability and prosperity in Asia,
the Pacific and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the United States attaches great importance to
its ties with China, as this is in the interests and aspirations
of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the U.S. government will adhere to the "one
China" policy, observe the three joint communiques signed by the
two nations, and continue its "engagement policy" toward China, as
it deems the last U.S.-China summit has been successful and the
bilateral constructive strategic partnership is moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
Although differences still exist on the issues of Taiwan and
human rights, a framework has been guiding bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
As an important part of the state-to-state relationship,
military ties have already had a good beginning, according to the
consensus reached between Jiang and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said contacts between the two armies have reached an
unprecedented level in the past year, saying this is not only in
the interests of the two nations, but also beneficial to peace and
stability in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes high-level and professional contacts
continue, cooperation be reinforced and new ways of cooperation be
explored, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary said the document on a military mechanism
has reflected the army ties as mature and that this is conducive
to improve and strengthen the understanding, communication and
contacts between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Local observers point out that Cohen's visit opened the curtain
of U.S. "Asia Diplomacy" this year, which would serve to deepen,
broaden and promote the strategic dialogue between China and the
United States, and push the improved state ties and the
increasingly mature military ties to a new period of progress.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Remains World's Busiest Container Port (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to beat
all the other rivals to rank as the world's busiest container port
for the sixth year in a row in 1997, Richard Yuen, deputy
secretary for economic services, said.
</P>
<P>
The total container throughput is projected to reach 14.5
million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), up 8.5 percent from
the previous year, Yuen said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the container traffic is handled by the eight
existing container terminals located at Kwai Chung, which have
been built and operated by the private sector. Hong Kong is the
world's only major port that does not have a port authority.
</P>
<P>
The remaining container traffic is handled mid-stream, or by
river trade, taking advantage of the waterway of the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
"The great achievement in 1997 should be attributed to the
double-digit increase in the export of South China and the
continued healthy economic performance of the United States," Yuen
observed.
</P>
<P>
The importance of China's inland areas, particularly South
China, to Hong Kong can never be overvalued, said Yuen, who is
also secretary for the Port Development Board which advises the
government on port development.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has been serving far beyond itself to be the leading
port in South China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cargo throughput of a port is a key barometer of the economic
and trade development of a country or a region, Yuen noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, winning the title of the world's busiest
container port is an indication of the enviable economic growth in
China.
</P>
<P>
Yuen believes that so long as China maintains a sustained
economic growth, Hong Kong will surely enjoy a steady increase in
container throughput well into the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1, 1997, the
port's leading position has been further enhanced thanks to the
"one country, two systems" principle, Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
"One country" facilitates exchanges and coordination between
the two economically integrated sides while "two systems"
preserves all the factors contributing to Hong Kong's past
success, including free economy, free port and high efficiency,
Yuen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Port Development Board has been in frequent contact with
the port authorities of neighboring Shenzhen city and China's
Ministry of Communications. Yuen himself has visited nearly all
the ports along China's winding coastline, from Shenzhen's Shekou
and Yantian northward to Dalian.
</P>
<P>
One of his board's major jobs is to compile medium- and
long-term port cargo forecasts by examining economic and trade
development, containerization trends and potential competition
from other ports. The forecasts serve as the basis of the
government's port development program and are revised every two
years.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecasts, published in 1996, projected an annual
growth rate of 5.9 percent in container throughput through to the
year 2016 when the port is expected to handle 3.9 million TEUs, or
five TEUs every four seconds. The next forecasts will be published
early this year.
</P>
<P>
To cope with demand, construction of a ninth container terminal
on Tsing Yi Island, opposite the container port at Kwai Chung,
will start soon. Moreover, a new container port is being planned
for Lantau Island and next to the new airport.
</P>
<P>
As a large share of cargo passing through Hong Kong is
entreport trade with South China, the waterway of the Pearl River
is being increasingly used. Work on the construction of Hong
Kong's first river trade terminal (RTT) is now under way near Tuen
Mun in the northwestern part of the "New Territories." The first
phase of the RTT is due to begin operation in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges Austerity in ASEAN Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines, which currently
chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has
called for austerity measures in the conduct of ASEAN meetings and
related activities, the Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs said it has submitted a set
of proposals to the ASEAN Secretary General in Jakarta, Rodolfo
Severino, intended to cut costs of ASEAN meetings.
</P>
<P>
The four-point proposal the Philippines submitted includes the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- Maximizing the participation of embassies in ASEAN meetings
with the secretariat scheduling various meetings early to enable
embassies to prepare for such meetings;
</P>
<P>
-- Holding meetings in ASEAN capitals only if such meetings
should be outside the secretariat in Jakarta to avoid connecting
flights for delegates;
</P>
<P>
-- Shortening duration of meetings by having more informal
working dinners or lunches and limiting the reading of formal
statements to reduce hosting costs; and
</P>
<P>
-- Reviewing documentation practices to reduce paper and
duplication costs, and adopting a document coding system for their
efficient classification and retrieval.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine proposal, initiated in reaction to the current
economic difficulties resulting from the currency crisis sweeping
the ASEAN region, will be taken up during the second meeting of
the 31st ASEAN Standing Committee in Jakarta from February 10 to
12.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta meeting, the report added, will also consider the
matter of reducing ASEAN meetings by resorting to ad-referendum on
certain matters as may be agreed upon.

<HEADLINE> Continous Anti-Corruption Vital to Success in 1998: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Continuous anti-corruption is
vital to smooth accomplishment of all the tasks for 1998, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second session of the Central Commission of
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which
opened today in Beijing, Wei Jianxing, Standing Committee member
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said
greater efforts must be made to build an honest and clean
government in accordance with the guidelines set forth at the 15th
National Party Congress in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also secretary of the commission, said 1998 is the first
year for an overall fulfilment of the tasks set out at the 15th
Party Congress and therefore, continuous anti-corruption this year
is vital to accomplish all the tasks.
</P>
<P>
He called on Party committees and discipline inspection
commissions at various levels to adhere more firmly and
consciously to the guidelines drawn by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to proceed from China's actual situation of the
primary stage of socialism, be well aware of the importance of
anti-corruption in the reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory should be the guidance for all the work
relating to Party building and anti-corruption in 1998, Wei
reiterated.

NEW DELHI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices in India
continued to lean down on the bullion market Tuesday in the wake
of persistent inflow of supply against any worthwhile buying
support.
</P>
<P>
Market men said that some offering of gold in the market by
importers in the absence of buying activity created easy
availability of the commodity. Though gold prices in Hong Kong
market were up at 288.25 U.S. dollars an ounce on short-covering,
it failed to impact the markets here.
</P>
<P>
Standard gold and ornaments dropped by 85 rupees (2.30 U.S.
dollars) each at 4,015 and 3,865 rupees (108.51-104.46 U.S.
dollars) per 10 gram, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, sovereign gained by 25 rupees at 3,550 (95.95 U.S.

<HEADLINE> HK Telecom Agrees to Early Terminate Exclusive Licence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Telecom
International Limited (HKTI) has agreed to the termination of its
exclusive international licence on March 31 before its schedule
expiry in October 2006.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed between Stephen Ip, Secretary for
Economic Services, and Linus Cheung, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Telecom International here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The HKTI currently holds an exclusive licence to provide
external telecommunications services and circuits, including
international direct dial (IDD) voice telephony services. Its
exclusive licence was issued in 1981 and was due to expire in
2006.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will seek from the Finance
Committee of the Provisional Legislative Council a sum of 6.7
billion Hong Kong dollars (858.97 million U.S. dollars) as
compensation to the HKTI early termination of its exclusive
rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also waive all royalty by the
HKTI as from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ip hailed the agreement as another major breakthrough in the
development of telecommunications in Hong Kong, adding: "before
this agreement, our external telecommunications sector was out of
line with the best current international practice and this has had
adverse implications for our regional competitiveness in
telecommunications."
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that we are able to remove this remaining anomaly
in our otherwise fully liberalized telecommunications market,
thereby furthering our policy objective of maintaining Hong Kong
as the pre-eminent telecommunications hub in the Asian Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
"This liberalization coming at this time of economic
uncertainty in the region will also give Hong Kong a significant
economic stimulus," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang welcomed this agreement as a
major step in enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Telecommunications plays a vital role in underpinning the
service sector which contributes to more than 83 percent of our
Gross Domestic Product and enhancing our competitiveness against
other economies in the region and in the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly so as we enter the Information Age where
the efficient flow and effective utilization of information will
be a key to the competitiveness of an economy," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said: "this agreement balances the interests of all
stakeholders and provides fair compensation to Hong Kong Telecom
for giving up a valuable asset."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China to Train More Enterprise Administrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Experts say that China will
need at least 100,000 licensed accountants, 200,000 masters of
business administration (MBA), as well as one million enterprise
executives with proper training in business administration to
fulfill the goal for advancing market economy and expanding
enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
Based on this prediction, more than one million on-job workers
and reserve working force in China's state-owned enterprises will
have to be trained in the coming years. Therefore, training
enterprise administrative personnel has become an urgent matter.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Commission for Economy and Trade say
that training administrative personnel for enterprises will be
focused on improving these people's structure of knowledge and the
capacity to understand the market.
</P>
<P>

of different enterprises in China have participated in various
kinds of training courses on business administration, including
19,000 managing executives of large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Commission for Economy and Trade have jointly

In the meantime, the country's major universities offer MBA
courses and short-term training courses to enterprise
administrative workers.
</P>
<P>
China has also cooperated with foreign countries in training
more enterprise administrative personnel.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Economy Still Full of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The much expected economic
recovery in Pakistan is still uncertain as the performance of the
major economic sectors during the first half of the current fiscal
year turned out to be unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
A six-month economic review reveals the recession is still
plaguing. The vital industrial sector has not picked up as desired
and the expected growth rate of this sector could hardly be
achieved in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the review of economic performance for the first six
months (July-December) of 1997-98 last weekend, Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz admitted that the reform packages announced by the
current government this year could not produce the desired
results.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic growth rate as projected in the last
budget at six percent would be difficult to achieve in the face of
shortfall in the production of cotton and the slower than expected
performance of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
However, he was confident that the growth rate might range
between 5.2 and 5.5 percent which would conform to the targets as
set forth in the agreement with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
One worrying thing in the half-year economic review is the
lower than expected tax revenue. Figures contained in the review
show that the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) was facing a
shortfall of at least 10 percent during the first half of 1997-98
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
After managing to collect about 41 percent, or 135 billion
rupees (about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars) during the first six
months of the current fiscal year, the CBR is facing an uphill
task to generate 59 percent, or 189 billion rupees (4.3 billion
dollars) during the remaining half.
</P>
<P>
The revenue target for the current fiscal year is 324 billion
rupees (7.4 billion dollars) based on the assumption of a 14
percent growth over the preceding year's 282 billion rupees (6.4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, during the first half of 1997-98, tax revenue showed a
negative growth of about one percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public sector corporations are still in heavy
losses, exacerbating the government's already fragile financial
position, though so far the government's bank borrowing has been
contained in the budget limit.
</P>
<P>
One major positive thing in the half-year economic performance
was that the external balance improved by 1.6 billion dollars.
However, it was mainly due to transitory factors. Export growth
remained low at eight percent against the 15 percent target.
</P>
<P>
Most worrisome is the industrial sector decline. Industrial
growth of a nominal one percent obviously made the target of seven
percent hard to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Local economists are of the view that the overall growth in the
economy will be lower than the six percent target set for this
fiscal year. Given the poor cotton crop and the industrial slump,
the growth rate of around 5.5 percent as projected by the
government also seems hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
While a bumper crop of sugarcane at 51 million tons shows an
increase of four percent, rice will grow by more than four
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, cotton crop, which is the backbone of Pakistan's
economy, is pretty weak this year. The crop, hit by rains causing
a loss of one million bales, is expected be less than last year's
9.4 million bales.
</P>
<P>
Following the worst manufacturing year which recorded a
negative growth of 1.45 percent, the sector recorded growth of one
percent during the five months ending last November in the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The output, however, improved by 5.1 percent in November,
possibly because of the 8.7 percent devaluation of the Pak
currency in October which made exports cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's large scale manufacturing sector has been the
weakest in the economy for the last five years when the
performance was far below five percent while the target of growth
rate was seven to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that higher industrial growth is the key
to larger revenues, more exports, particularly the value-added,
higher employment, better stock market prices and better repayment
of loans.
</P>
<P>
But because of the poor industrial growth there have been
setbacks all round in the economy despite the various incentives
announced by the government, including tax relief.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the benefits of the reform packages
initiated by the present government since it came to power in
February last year could not materialize over these months because
of the domestic political crisis and the financial crisis in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is by any means encouraging for Pakistan's economy that the
country has come out without any serious damage from the recent
financial crisis in East Asia, though the four-month-long domestic
political crisis has undoubtedly slowed down recovery process and
adversely affected exports.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the overall investment climate has remained
within manageable limits despite all those negative factors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that as the financial crisis in East Asia is
subsiding and political stability in the country has been
restored, better economic results should emerge.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Explains Policy on S. Leone, Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The April 22 deadline for Sierra
Leone's military junta to quit remains despite hiccups in the
planned disarmament of conflicting parties, the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has announced.
</P>
<P>
But the sub-regional body seeks a compromise with Liberian
President Charles Taylor in the row over the role of the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Monday at the Nigerian capital of Abuja,
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said there was no
going back on the date set for the junta to restore President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was ousted in a coup on May 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which signed a peace accord last October agreeing
to hand over power on the set date, threatened later to postpone
the end of the peace process due to delay in disarmament and
delivery of international relief goods.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS scribe was also optimistic that a disagreement
between ECOWAS and the United Nations on troops deployment to
Sierra Leone will be amicably resolved.
</P>
<P>
According to former ECOMOG force Commander Maj.-Gen. Victor
Malu, about 15,000 troops will be needed for the Sierra Leone
assignment.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the logistics, Kouyate said "the UN wants ECOMOG to
deploy into Sierra Leone first, but we are disagreeing. We think
they should land there before us."
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Five on Sierra Leone, which is
expected to meet early next month on the disagreement, "needs
concrete deeds to make deployment to Sierra Leone possible," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, consultations between ECOWAS and UN on all
fronts are currently underway.
</P>
<P>
"The UN has practically endorsed all the decisions we have
taken. But we are eagerly awaiting their observer mission."
</P>
<P>
A UN fact-finding team, led by the organization's special
envoy to Sierra Leone, paid a three-day visit to the tiny west
African country last week to pave the way for the observers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ex-President to Be Given Even-handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
magistrate set to try former state president P W Botha promised
Monday that he would give an even-handed trial to the man who
ruled the country in height of the Apartheit years.
</P>
<P>
Victor Lugaju, the president of the Western Cape Regional
Court, said he would treat the matter "like any other case", the
Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We dispense justice to all persons in the same way. We do not
differentiate," said Lugaju, who will preside over the court
hearing Friday on Botha's failure to appear before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
Botha, who had defied a third subpoena from the TRC last
December to testify for hearings of the former State Security
Council, was served with a summon from Western Cape
Attorney-General Frank Kahn earlier this month to appear in
George Regional Court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lugaju, 49, said he wanted to show that the "justice system is
real in South Africa".
</P>
<P>
He said that he chose to take the case himself as the top
magistrate in the Western Cape province, when other magistrates
had full schedules.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the idea that he had any personal desire to handle
the case, Lugaju said: "I can take any case. There is nothing
special about it."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 81, faces a two-year imprisonment and/or fines if
convicted. But observers said that a fine is more likely due to
his age and physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
During his 11 years in power, including the prime minister
office between 1978 and 1984 and later as state president until
1989, Botha enacted emergency laws to crack down on
anti-apartheid groups.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Resume Pharmaceutical Export to Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to soon
resume export of its pharmaceutical products to Ghana after
nearly four years of suspension ordered by the Ghanaian
government.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by the Ghana Food and Drugs Board (GFDB)
which ended a week-long fact-finding visit to Nigeria last
weekend, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ghana clamped a ban in early 1994 on importation of
pharmaceutical products from west African countries, including
Nigeria, in the wake of rampant circulation of fake and spurious
drugs in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to GFDB Chief Executive Theophilus Corquaye, the
suspension order will soon be lifted to enable Nigeria to resume
exportation of the commodities.
</P>
<P>
Noting that drug manufacturing facilities in Nigeria compared
favorably with those in advanced countries in the world, Corquaye
said, his team would evaluate its findings and make
recommendations to the Ghanaian government accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Corquaye, leader of the five-member team, said the structures
already in place for the trade in drugs had to be addressed
before importation could resume.
</P>
<P>
The export is expected to increase the capacity utilization of
Nigerian manufacturing companies by 20 percent, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian pharmaceutical manufacturers are preparing
to hold a symposium-exhibition of Nigeria-made drugs in Ghana as
soon as the permission for formal export of local pharmaceuticals
is granted.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Remains Stagnant, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy still remains at
a standstill, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Tuesday in its monthly
report.
</P>
<P>
"The positive growth cycle of production, income and
expenditures has stalled," the central bank said, adding that
sluggish domestic demand, especially in the area of household
expenditures, has hurt production, employment and income.
</P>
<P>
Net exports have continued to increase, and business investment
has risen moderately -- primarily in the manufacturing sector,
said the report, which covered this month's financial and economic
developments.
</P>
<P>
Poor demand helped spread inventory adjustment pressures and
industrial production has slightly declined, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ external demand is expected to continue to support
economic growth, and special tax-cut measures announced in
December 1997 could help household spending.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the overall economy is likely to remain stagnant
for a while and to be vulnerable to further negative impacts, the
bank said.

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov said that the reduction of tax burden is
the priority task of the government in 1998, the Itar-Tass news

In an interview with the press, Nemtsov outlined seven main

<P>
"The first thing," he said, "is to adopt a new tax legislation,
then to reduce dramatically the number of taxes."
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said the second task is to bring down bank rates, as
money should be channeled into the production sector from the
speculation market.
</P>
<P>
He also outlined the other tasks such as concrete social
assistance to the poorest; fulfillment of the program of training
managerial personnel abroad; help to retired officers, and the
problem of non-payments and wage debts.

MACAO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 401 Macao residents
applied to enter China's inland universities for post-graduate and
doctorate degrees in 1998, an increase of 55 percent over that in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Figures released on Tuesday by the Macao Foundation, which
assists China's State Education Commission for the recruitment in
Macao, showed that they are applying to enter 31 universities in
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
China's inland degrees have become increasingly attractive to
many Macao applicants as China is to resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Macao in less than two years time, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
While Zhongshan University and the Overseas Chinese University
remain the two most favored, attracting half of the applicants.
</P>
<P>
The applicants will have to pass the entrance examinations on
April 5 and 6, and those passed through will have to study for
three to four years before acquiring their desired degrees.
</P>

SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices drifted lower on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index declined by 30.27 points to close at 1296.91 on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Experts Assess Locust Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan crop protection experts
have been rushed to parts of Central Province following reports
of a locusts invasion into the region, the Daily Nation reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Among areas reportedly threatened by the devastating insects
include Murang'a and Maragua districts in Central Province and
Turkana in the arid north of the country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper quoted a source in the Agriculture Ministry of
Kenya as saying that the teams of experts were dispatched as part
of the government response to the locust threat.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police last week warned of a major locust invasion from
neighbouring Ethiopia where the locusts have been breeding for
several months.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner Geoffrey Mwathe said that he had
confirmed with his Ethiopian counterpart reports of locusts along
the Kenya-Ethiopia border this month.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that locusts had been breeding in Sudan,
Eritrea, Ethiopia and in the Red Sea belt, and the recent heavy
rains in the region favoured the insects' breeding in arid areas.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, a Food and Agriculture Organization mission
warned that swarms of African migratory locusts had been reported
to be moving out of their traditional outbreak areas... to major
agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Desert locusts which are the most devastating species feed on
green vegetation and explosive outbreaks can wipe out food
harvests over large areas of Africa, the Middle East and Western
Asia with heartbreaking efficiency, said a statement issued by
the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology last
November.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Political Figures' Trips to Southeast Asia Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang today told a news briefing that China hopes
Southeast Asian countries concerned will maintain vigilance
against the political motives of the Taiwan authorities and
properly handle their relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that some political figures of Taiwan have recently
made frequent trips to some countries in Southeast Asia and
conducted activities there, capitalizing on the temporary
difficulties of these countries caused by the financial crisis and
carrying out "pragmatic diplomacy" in this region in an attempt to
realize their set political motivations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those figures claimed to revive the "policy of
advancing South" and demanded in explicit terms for "political
reward" from these southeast Asian countries for Taiwan's
financial assistance and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, this is a well-planned and premeditated political
move which is aimed at upgrading Taiwan's so-called 'substantive
relationship' with Southeast Asian countries and furthermore
undermining the friendly relations and cooperation between China
and the countries concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What the Taiwan authorities have done is unpopular and doomed

</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that there is only one China in the
world, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legal government representing the whole China, and Taiwan is
an inalienable part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The position of the Chinese government on the question of
Taiwan is consistent, clear-cut, firm and unshakable, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese government understands the
special difficulties and predicament of some Southeast Asian
countries and therefore takes no objection to the non-governmental
economic contacts and trade between the countries concerned and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are resolutely opposed to any form of official
contacts with Taiwan by countries having diplomatic relations with
China," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will never do anything which jeopardizes the
interests of the countries concerned who are at the moment still
caught in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
"We urge countries concerned to respect the position of China,
strictly honor their commitment to the 'one China' policy and
jointly maintain the overall interests of their friendship and
cooperation with China, so that the friendship and cooperation
will continue to forge ahead in a healthy and steady manner," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Blacks' History Not Taught in S. African Schools: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four years have
passed since South Africa abolished apartheid in 1994, but many
students studying in poorly resourced schools still have no
access to learn the history of blacks in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sowetan quoted unidentified sources as reporting
that for many South African students history of the country began
in 1652 when the first white settler, Jan van Riebeeck, arrived
at what is now Cape Town, the legislative capital of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
During apartheid time, public school teachers did not teach
black history before the Van Riebeeck. Textbooks made no mention
of the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
Only a few years ago, teachers in black schools could be
banished for violating curriculum restrictions imposed by the
minority white government.
</P>
<P>
"If you stepped out of bounds, you were demoted, and if you
did it again, you were sent to the rural area. If you refused to
go, you lost your job," a history teacher recalled.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the first non-racial general elections in 1994,
which ended white minority rule, new edition of series of
textbooks about South African history involving blacks, whites
and colored people, have been available in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest history books are far from popular. "The
old texts are still used, especially in poorly resourced
schools," because "many schools can't afford to buy new stuff,"
said Sue Krige, who teaches education at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
In addition, several new history books were reportedly
available in South Africa, but only three of the country's nine
provinces have formally approved the new books for use in public
schools this year.

CHANGSHA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed two celadon kilns dating back over 1,000 years in
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
They note that the discovery represents the first ever
well-preserved kilns dating to the Five Dynasties Period (907-960).
</P>
<P>
The Chenjian Kilns, located in Hengnan County, were used to
produce the period's famous blue and white porcelain.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists also unearthed abundant historical relics over a
three month period, including bowls, plates, ink stones and blue
jars tinged with grey or yellow.
</P>
<P>
One kiln also yielded a number of porcelain boxes, cups and
pillows. Archeologists say the relics will provide valuable clues
for research into the development of ancient porcelain
production.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Effective Protection of Foreign IPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to provide
effective protection for the intellectual property rights (IPR) of
foreign investors in China and other business partners, according
to a government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"IPR protection is an international obligation," according to a
spokesman for the State Council's IPR Work Conference
Office. "China seriously abides by international conventions and
bilateral agreements on IPR, which China has joined or signed,
expands exchanges, and deals with IPR relations with other
countries based on the principle of mutual benefit", the spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that China is considering further steps to protect
IPR in areas such as human genes, genetic engineering and new
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
He said China will include IPR protection in both state and
regional development plans and will make it part of its economic
system and scientific programs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that China adopted a major policy on
strengthening IPR protection in 1994 and has since recorded
monumental progress in adhering to international norms.
</P>
<P>
Provinces and major cities across the nation have established
IPR conference offices, with some 20 forming IPR tribunals. In
addition, more than one million government workers are directly
participating in the drive.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, China has closed 53 illegal CD production
lines, and under high pressure some lines had to be removed
abroad. Therefore, customs departments should remain on full alert
to halt imports and exports of equipment and products involving
piracy.
</P>
<P>
Criminal punishment must be imposed for serious cases, and
violators must be apprehended, regardless of the circumstances,
according to spokesman. In addition, all Chinese officials above
the county level will receive training in IPR laws over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also pay close attention to the
piracy of Chinese products on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Ready to Run for 7th Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
on Tuesday expressed his readiness to run for the president for
the 1998-2003 period.
</P>
<P>
"AL-HAJ Mohamad Soeharto is prepared to be renominated for
presidency in the upcoming general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly for the 1998-2003 term of office," General
Chairman of the ruling Functional Group (Golkar) Harmoko announced
at the Bina Graha Presidential Office here.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko, together with chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) Gen. Feisal Tanjung and Minister for Home Affairs Yogie S.
Memed, called on President Soeharto at Bina Graha.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko further announced the criteria for choosing the next
vice president, which includes mastery of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the president suggested to Golkar last year
to reconsider his renomination, the party had to ask the opinion
of its members from the central executive board down to the
provincial chapters.
</P>
<P>
"All letters sent (by the provincial chapters) to the party's
central executive board only gave one name, AL-HAJ Mohamad
Soeharto," said Harmoko, who is also speaker of the House of
Representatives (DPR) and the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR).
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of the people have expressed their
willingness to renominate the president for a seventh term.
</P>
<P>
On the criteria for choosing the next vice president, Harmoko
said the candidate must be able to maintain national unity, must
have a vision of the future and a strong sense of nationalism and
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko also said that the nominee must have a vision on
science and technology, have deep knowledge of industry and its
usage, and be ready to assist the president in solving various
problems that may emerge in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 76, has ruled the country for 31 years since 1967.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 members of the MPR will convene in March to elect a
president and vice president and establish the state policy
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has won all six elections held under President Soeharto.
Last May in a landslide election victory, Golkar obtained 74.3
percent of the votes, a significant increase from the 68 percent
it won in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 600 Ugandans escaped
drowning in Lake Kyoga in a rare marine accident, The Monitor
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wamukomwe Sud, one of the 13 floating islands in the lake in
central Uganda, has been divided into two parts and started
sinking on January 16 night when a heavy downpour hit the lake.
</P>
<P>
Kasisaki Nsibirwa, the former local council vice-councillor of
Kalungi sub-county, Nakasongola District, told the paper that
part of it was breaking away and removed from its usual place and
got submerged. Some residents and vendors visiting the Sud to
collect fish started to desert the floating island by canoes.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims are still missing for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds escaped to the three other nearby Suds and the
neighbor mainland districts, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Suds are floating islands in the waters of Nile River system
consisting of rotten branches and soil and covered with
vegetation. An interesting fact is that there were no cholera
cases in these Suds when half of the districts of the country was
hit by the epidemic.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Crisis to Be focused at 2nd ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The current economic
crisis in Asia is expected to take center stage at the Second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to be held in London next April,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the single European currency next
year, the currency depreciation and economic crisis in this region
were crucial, he told reporters after meeting an 11-member
European Union (EU) parliamentary delegation led by Gunter Rinsche
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
ASEM is a forum which groups 15 EU member countries, China,
Japan, South Korea and several ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that he took the opportunity to explain to the
visitors that ASEAN was united in tackling the economic woes and
the weakening of the region's currencies and in boosting
intra-trade among them.
</P>
<P>
"I told them that ASEAN is aware that the problems cannot be
resolved by the grouping alone as they have a global dimension and
linked to the world currency trading," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN would continue their close ties among member
countries to overcome economic problems.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and the Philippines have been badly hit by the economic
crisis resulted from the speculative attacks on their currencies
since last July.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said he told the EU delegation that corrective measures
taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help the
badly-hit countries had not shown the desired results.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has only sought technical advice from the IMF to tide
over the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation was happy with the strengthening of the local
unit -- the ringgit and hoped that it would be a pointer for a
better economic situation in future, Badawi said.

CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was sold
off Tuesday as the Indonesian rupiah fell to an all-time low, the
Japanese yen slipped against the U.S. dollar, and gold prices
declined.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed lower at 66.24 U.S. cents from 66.53
Monday, as the latest developments to the north renewed market
pessimism on the outlook for Asian growth.
</P>
<P>
"It's been sold off all day basically," Bank of America foreign
exchange dealer Andrew Le said.
</P>
<P>
Le said the selling was sparked by the further devaluation of
the Indonesian rupiah Tuesday, which hit a new low of 10,575 to
the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.61 yen from 85.83 in Sydney

<P>
HEFEI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite unfavorable natural
conditions, east China's Anhui Province reaped a good grain
harvest of 28.5 million tons last year, up 5.6 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cotton output jumped by 11.5 percent to 300,000 tons and the
output of oil-bearing corps increased by 10 percent to reach 1.95
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of local farmers surpassed 1,800
yuan, up 200 yuan on the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest was the result of substantial investments in
agricultural production, local government officials say.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested nearly 7.7 billion yuan in
agriculture since 1993, with an annual growth rate in agricultural
investment standing at 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Increased funding has significantly improved the conditions for
local agricultural development and helped transform over 530,000
ha of low-yielding farmland.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of new technology also contributed greatly to
the increased grain output. Hybrid and high-quality seeds have
been introduced to 88 percent of local farmland.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
expanded by 8.4 percent at current prices in December 1997 on a
three-month moving average basis, with exports and imports
increasing by 9.1 percent and 7.7 percent respectively, the
government Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the month, non-oil domestic exports grew by 11.1 percent
while re-exports registered a growth of 10.8 percent. Oil domestic
exports, however, declined by 9.6 percent, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It said that non-oil domestic exports increased by 11.1 percent
to reach 8.5 billion Singapore dollars (5.06 billion US dollars)
in December, while re-exports reached seven billion Singapore
dollars (4.17 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in re-exports came mainly from shipments of
integrated circuits, computer parts and peripherals, disk drives,
and other products.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil were weak, the TDB said, adding that
this was probably affected by keen competition from regional
refineries. It declined by 9.6 percent due mainly to lower
shipments of oil to Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the TDB said non-oil domestic exports rose
by 13.3 percent in December 1997, as domestic exports of
integrated circuits and printed circuit boards assembled (PCBA)
continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of disk drives, which accounted for 19 percent of the
non-oil domestic exports, slowed further, growing only marginally
by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports increased by 12.8 percent on a monthly basis. The
TDB noted that while re-exports of electronic products to the
United States, European Union, and Hong Kong expanded strongly,
this was partially offset by the drop in re-exports to Malaysia,
Singapore's top re-export market, and Thailand of 6.3 percent and
28.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
As exports grew, imports increased in December, according to
the TDB figures. Non-oil imports expanded by 8.3 percent to reach
15.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 9.4 billion US dollars) in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Increases were recorded in imports of integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, parts of
semiconductors, parts of aircraft, cigarettes, parts of color
television sets and radios, printed circuits, capacitors, and
other products, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It also said, however, that there were declines in imports of
blank computer tapes and discs, and parts of video cassette
recorders (VCRs).

quarter last year, largely due to the economic crisis spreading
across Asia, The Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report presented to the Knesset
(Parliament) by the Industry and Trade Ministry as saying that
Israel's exports to Far East last year declined by 1 percent to
3.644 billion dollars from 3.679 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list, food and agriculture exports fell by 22
percent last year, while diamond exports declined 12 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset Economic Committee convened a meeting of trade
officials and Asian diplomats Monday to discuss Israeli-Asian
trade and economic relations in light of the Asian monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Ministry Director-General Dov Mishor told
the meeting that despite the International Monetary Fund speaks
of decreased growth in world trade during 1998, the Israeli
government is still predicting a 9 percent growth in exports to
Asia this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Ambassador to Israel Ronarong Nopakun said he
expected Israeli defense industries to be heavily hit by the
ongoing economic crisis in Asia because some countries lack hard
currency to pay for the purchase of advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturers Association's Textiles Division head Yair
Rotlevy estimated that the Asian crisis could cause Israeli
industry to lose 1 billion dollars in total. He said, to South
Korea alone, Israeli exports could shrink by 260 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Korean bilateral trade topped 700 million dollars in
1996, and was expected to rise to 1 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky urged Israeli
companies not to lose faith in the Asian tigers. He said Israel
would not change policies toward Asia despite the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Trying to allay concerns of Israeli exporters, South Korean
Ambassador Eui Yong Chung also played down the long-term major
impact the Asian crisis might have on Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said, of Israel's 530 million dollar exports to South Korea
in the first 11 months of 1997, about 400 million dollars were
high-tech products exports. The remainder principally comprised
components destined for end products in South Korea and 15 million
dollars in diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any major impact, rather it's a good time for
potential investors from Israel to look at expanding their
interests in the region," Chung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
finished a lackluster day's trade slightly lower, marked by an
afternoon of thin trading with virtually no overseas direction.
</P>
<P>
Weaker resource stocks, impacted by lower metals prices
overnight, weighed on the market.
</P>
<P>
Nevitts broker Craig Wright said Tuesday's trade had been
marked by some profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
It was pretty quiet Tuesday with volumes low and not much
happening, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
"In the Asian markets there wasn't much direction. There was a
little bit of profit-taking and a bit of weakness in resources
with the overnight drop in metal prices."
</P>

The All Ordinaries Index closed down 11.3 points at 2639.4.

Among major resource companies, BHP company shed 25 cents to 14
Australian dollars and global miner Rio Tinto fell 31.8 cents to

<HEADLINE> Foreign Car Manufacturers to Expand Business in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Car manufacturers from
France, Italy, Sweden and Korea are expected to expand business
in South Africa in the near future, local daily Sowetan reported
today.
</P>
<P>
French motor giant Renault is to relocate its entire export
operations center for the East Africa and Indian Ocean regions to
South Africa from March 1.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Italian car manufacturer Fiat and Swedish car maker
Volvo will also make similar announcement soon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite bleak predictions for the motor industry this year,
local motor industrialists said, Volvo, Fiat and Renault will
feature more prominantly in South Africa, while Korean
manufacturers Hyundai, Daewoo and Sanyong are also looking at
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The move by Renault is regarded as a significant step for the
car maker, one of the ten top manufacturers in the world, and
will include all export, distribution of vehicles and after sales
aspects.
</P>
<P>
"This move reflects not only the importance with which Renault
France views South Africa as a hub for business activities within
the region, but also the increasing prominence of the country as
an export market for the company's products," said Richard
Nyhout, Renault's current regional director.
</P>
<P>
Renault has had a fairly successful run in the local motoring
industry since re-entering South Africa more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Manny de Canha, managing director of Renault's South African
partner Imperial Car Imports, predicted recently that the number
of Renault dealerships would be doubled from 10 to 20 over the
next year.

HEFEI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province today
records this winter's coldest morning, with the capital Hefei City
recording temperatures at 10.5 degrees below zero centigrade.
</P>
<P>
This morning's temperature was seventh lowest on record, said
Liu Xiaochang, deputy-director of Anhui Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Anhui had experienced higher than normal winter temperatures
since October in advance of the first extremely cold spell which
hit on January 13.
</P>
<P>
Snow and ice have since caused great inconvenience to local
residents. Two expressways from downtown Hefei to the local
airport were temporarily closed, and a mere 33 percent of Hefei's
taxi remains in operation.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are attempting to stablize vegetable prices
amidst prevailing shortages on the markets.
</P>
<P>
However, meteorologists note that crops will most likely
benefit from the cold snap.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Pan African Papermill
is scheduled to replant trees this year on about 3,000 hectares
of land in west Kenya to protect environment, according to a
Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted the firm's forest manager, Philip
Diro, as saying that the trees would be replanted where the
company had harvested as well as in open areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the company harvests about 1,000 hectares of trees
each year, he noted, it always replants on a larger area.
</P>
<P>
The firm has replanted trees on some 26,500 hectares since
1987 against 14,000 hectares harvested since the company started
its operations in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Webuye-based company manufactures pulp and paper for both

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Market Capitalization Drops in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' stock market
capitalization in 1997 fell by 41 percent to 1.251 trillion pesos
(30.5 billion U.S. dollars) from a year ago, due to the financial
storm sweeping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Tuesday quoted a year-end report
made by the Philippine Stock Exchange as saying the fall of the
market capitalization was mainly caused by less initial public
offerings (IPOs) and flights of funds.
</P>
<P>
The report said the IPOs only accounted for 1.7 percent of the
total capitalization last year.
</P>
<P>
Most corporations decided to suspend their IPOs until the
financial meltdown has stabilized while those going to the public
experienced a lull in their share performance, it added.
</P>
<P>
Due to less IPOs, the report said, the capital raised from the
new corporations decreased by 63 percent to about 10.074 billion
pesos (245.7 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite this scenario, there is a strong indication that the
stock market kicked off on a positive note this year, with its
composite index reaching a record high in last week's rally, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the stock market would enjoy brisk trading buoyed
by the strong economic fundamentals the government has laid out to
cushion the impact of further economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund also predicted that the
Philippines had posted the highest growth rate in the region in
1997 and would first weather the financial storm before the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
"Given the proper restraint and sound economic decisions, the
Philippines is set to survive the financial crisis in the region,"
the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea and Burundi have
agreed to reinforce their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of English weekly, Eritrea
Profile, this was contained in a joint communique issued in
Asmara, capial of Eritrea at the end of a two-day official visit
to Eritrea by President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, Eritrea President Isaias Afwerki and his
Burundian counterpart expressed their satisfaction at the general
agreement of cooperation signed in Bujunbura on December 8, 1997
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Burundian president and Isaias held talks on
Eritrean-Burundian ties as well as regional and international
issues, according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Burundi, Isaias recalled that while the
government of Eritrea had welcomed the Arusha peace initiative as
an appropriate regional forum for facilitating a solution to the
situation, it had consistently rejected the imposition of
economic sanctions which was bound to be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said the overall security situation in Burundi has
improved significantly in spite of the difficulties resulting
from the economic sanctions, and expressed his firm belief that
the internal dialogue underway will impose itself as the driving
element in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya paid a visit to Eritrea last week.

<HEADLINE> mee012001hke - Khatami Reiterates No Need to Have Ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) - Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has reiterated that there is no need for Iran to resume
ties with the United States since Washington still adopts
hegemonist policies.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA Tuesday, Khatami
made the remark Monday night while addressing a large group of
people at the mausoleum of the late spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"Today we do not need to have the United States at our side, we
can go ahead without the help of the United States," he said,
accusing Washington of "behaving like lords of the world and
imposing sanctions on every country."
</P>
<P>
In his first televised speech to the American people as
president on January 8, Khatami said "Iran feels no need to have
diplomatic ties with the U.S." since Washington did not change its
policies towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he called for cultural dialogue between the Iranian
and American nations. His call was interpreted as a goodwill
signal that, if handled well, could lead to a thaw in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Washington welcomed Khatami's signal but call for direct
government-to-government dialogue. And it set as conditions that
Tehran stop "sponsoring international terrorism, seeking weapons
of mass destruction and sabotaging the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, nevertheless, on
Friday ruled out ties between the two governments, saying any
relationship with the U.S. would be harmful to the Iranian nation
and the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei stressed that the Iranian nation would never give up
its values and beliefs under pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Khamenei's stance, Khatami also said "We have decided
not to succumb to oppressive pressure and as long as there are
people who apply coercive pressure on others and resort to force,
and as long as there are world powers which seek to base their
relations with other nations on the principle of oppressive
pressure on those nations, they cannot expect anything from the
Iranian nation."
</P>
<P>
He said the fruit of the Islamic Revolution has been Iran's
liberation from the yoke of the U.S. The Iranian people "attained
their lost dignity after paying a very high cost for it and they
would never give it away at any price," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran aims at eliminating tension in the world and
forging relations with world nations on the basis of mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
He further diagnosed the "main reason for Washington's improper
policies as the existence of the Zionist regime (Israel) in the
region" and termed Israel as the main cause of tension in the
world.
</P>
<P>
It is a group of terrorists that want to oppress world nations
and impose their own selfish will, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets British Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that the establishment and development of long-term,
stable, friendly and cooperative Sino-British relations will not
only be in the fundamental interests of the two countries and
their people, but will also be conducive to Sino-European
cooperation and worldwide peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks this morning during a meeting with
visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his pleasure at once again meeting Cook in
Beijing, and expressed hope that the visit will promote
understanding between the two countries and raise bilateral
relations to a new plateau.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that he and Prince Charles presided over the
June 30 hand over ceremony in Hong Kong, and recounted his talks
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the high-degree of autonomy has been practically
and effectively implemented since Hong Kong's return in line with
the principle of "one country, two systems", and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has enjoyed
prosperity and stability, and has withstood various tests,
including adverse influences resulting from the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The good momentum for the improvement and development of
Sino-British relations continues, said Jiang, adding that the
highly desirable situation is worth treasuring by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Cook pointed to the smooth transition in Hong Kong, and noted
that both sides should be proud of the successful efforts to
implement the concepts of "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Hong Kong has been a bridge for the development
of Sino-British relations, rather than an obstacle. He pointed to
the vitality and strength of the Hong Kong economy, and expressed
his belief that Hong Kong will withstand the financial crisis in
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed to the new international situation and noted that
the common interests of China and Britain are increasing, rather
than decreasing, and that the potential for bilateral cooperation
is expanding, rather than diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Cook expressed hope that the prevailing situation will provide
a new starting point for strengthened bilateral relations between
the two important nations, and added that Britain hopes to develop
wide-ranging cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed the British delegation on China's political and
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that it is very important the Chinese currency
(Renminbi) remains stable and strong in order to maintain Hong
Kong's economic stability and help relevant Asian countries
extricate themselves from financial difficulties at an early
date.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange inflow into
Zambia in 1997 was 268.782 million U.S. Dollars, 1.084 million
dollars more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the amount, 140.207 million dollars came from donors,
according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
Debt servicing continued to consume most of the foreign
exchange as out of the total inflow 146.013 million went to
service debt, according to the weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Receipts from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) amounted
to 45.05 million dollars while the rest came from other
non-government sources such as non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
The increase in purchase from ZCCM came as a result of
shortage of foreign exchange between September and December
compounded by the need to import maize from abroad to meet the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Bank of Zambia, the need for more
exchange also forced the central bank to offload foreign exchange
onto the exchange market with a hope of stabilizing the Kwacha
(Zambian currency).

<HEADLINE> African Ports Urged to Be Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- African ports should modernize
their operations so as to serve their economies effectively, East
African Standard today quoted Kenyan Minister for Transport and
Communication William Ntimama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day African Ports seminar opened Monday in
the port city of Mombasa, the minister urged African ports to
adopt modern technology to enable them to compete effectively
with other ports around the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the volume of international trade grows and
larger vessels enter service ports, there is need for efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Ntimama said that the success of African ports would depend on
the quality of service to clients as the demand for a more
efficient service at a lower cost was getting rise.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he pointed out, "we have to focus our plans on
rehabilitation, expansion and replacement of some of our port
facilities."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Kenya Ports Authority Managing Director,
Lenny Mwangola, said that ports in most African countries are
operated under restrictive conditions due to lack of equipment.
</P>
<P>
It is important to computerize port services and incorporate
modern information technology, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the challenges facing many African ports ranged
from technological, socio-economic, managerial, ownership, and
education and training.
</P>
<P>
African ports lack well-trained pilots, engineers and other
professionals to ensure quick and efficient delivery of service
as there is lack of well-equipped modern maritime training
institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the seminar is "The Challenges Facing African
Ports in the Next Millennium".
</P>
<P>
The seminar is co-hosted by the Port Management Association of
Eastern and Southern Africa, the Port Management Association of
Western and Central Africa and the International Association of
Ports and Harbors.

<HEADLINE> Aborted Coup Hurts Zambia's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's tourism has suffered
from the October 28 aborted coup especially immediately after the
coup attempt, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The local weekly newspaper today quoted Gaudenzio Rossi,
President of Hotels and Catering Association of Zambia (HCAZ), as
saying that his country has suffered from bad publicity in the
last few months following the foiled coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I am really depressed, the room occupancy in most hotels has
drastically gone down. Some hotels are completely empty. I do not
think I have seen a situation like this in the last 20 years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fact that some donors seem to be biased
against the Zambian government is also affecting tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The industry now faces great liquidity problems as a result
of these bad months. We cannot even borrow from financial
institutions because most hotels have already overborrowed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are even facing problems of pay taxes and salaries for our
workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
From about December 1996 and throughout 1997, there was a booming
business in the hotel industry until the last three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tourism official urged all politicians to resolve their
differences as soon as possible so that the industry as well as
others can survive.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an industry, it lacks a good public relations
which could go in other countries to counteract these bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
Rossi called on the government to put in place a strong public
relations company to do this job.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A program to treat 50 key
industrial pollution sources in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has
greatly improved environment quality in affected areas,
according to the the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The program has involved suspending operations, relocating,
merging and introducing technical renovations to polluting
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government invested 104 million yuan (13 million
US dollars) to construct a new suburban factory for the Beijing
Bituminous Concrete Plant. Relocation of the plant, previously
located in downtown Beijing, has greatly reduced noise and dust
emissions in the former area.
</P>
<P>
The new plant is equipped with pollution treatment equipment
which effectively reduces emissions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China Aerospace Industrial Corporation raised
funds from both state and regional governments to build waste
water treatment plant with a daily capacity of 8,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The plant can effectively treat waste water discharged by more
than 60 factories in a five sq.km. area.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
undertake a 2.34 billion-taka (about 51.71 million U.S. dollars)
package of development projects in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT), the national new agency BSS reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be implemented by the CHT Development Board
(CHTDB) from March this year in the three districts of Rangamati,
Khagrachhari and Bandarban, following the restoration of peace
there after the signing of the CHT agreement between the
government and the tribals there early last month.
</P>
<P>
The package is divided into 30 sub-projects including
rehabilitation of 21,000 families affected by insurgency in the
past two decades; construction of 132 kilometers of road, 90 free
primary schools and 34 secondary schools; renovation of 150
existing educational institutions; and raising of horticulture
gardens on private land.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1976, the CHTDB has been carrying out
multidimensional development activities to uplift the

<HEADLINE> Changqing Oilfield of China Sets Record in Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Changqing
Oilfield produced a record 3.3 million tons of oil in 1997, up
550,000 tons on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The added output accounts for some one third of the country's
total increase in its onshore oil output for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Changqing oilfield gained fame for oil and gas discoveries
in 1997 by digging 1,139 wells and increasing its production
capacity by some 1.38 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield also constructed three oil pipelines stretching
over 200 kilometers in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Changqing has also conducted extensive scientific and
technological research and has recorded over 30 world-level
achievements.
</P>
<P>
It has introduced advanced technology and equipment from abroad
and sent some 4,000 engineers and technicians to other countries
for training.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Gets Less Threatening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The chronic infectious
disease of leprosy has become less threatening in the world, the
chairman of the International Federation of Dermatology, Dr
Terence Ryan has said.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy cases globally have dropped to less than a million at
present from two million 35 years ago, Ryan told the Third
International Continuing Medical Education Conference in Moshi in
north Tanzania, Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although the prevalence of the disease in Brazil, India,
Myanmar, Nigeria and Indonesia remains to be a public health
hazard, he said, it is not as perilous as in other countries
where patients need not to be isolated, he told some 100 medical
experts from the United States, European and African countries
attending the conference last week.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy, caused by microbacterium, lepra, chiefly affects skin
and peripheral nerves.
</P>
<P>
Ryan, from Britain, said untreated cases of leprosy have
resulted in deformities and disabilities such as severe visual
impairment.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is when the disease becomes rare many people tend
to forget about it," he said, adding that the only way is to look
at the skin to detect symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Ryan said IFD is supported by 130 national dermatological
societies representing 30,000 dermatologists worldwide. The
organizations provide ideas, facilities and funds to support IFD
activities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Sees Off Muster, Ivanisevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Eighth seeded Thomas Muster
and thirteenth seeded Goran Ivanisevic ended their title chasing
from start as both were eliminated by their first-round opponents
on Tuesday, biggest surprise so far in the Australian Open in
Melbourne, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Muster, world number 10, was huliminated by Swedish journeyman
Jan Apell in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, while
Ivanisevic, 15th in the world, fell to Dutch Jan Siemerink after
four sets,  6-2, 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Muster, winner of the 1995 French Open, piled up little answer
to Apell, who is 233 ranking places below him, when the Swede
stole the spotlight from the former world number one player.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian saved two match points in the 10th game, but could
not hold on, and Apell celebrated his victory by punching the air
in delight after he sent Muster packed.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst performance for the Austrian in his ten-year
appearance in the first Grand Slam of the year.
</P>
<P>
And Ivanisevic, who also was beaten in the first round here in
1990, never recovered from a dubious line call on a break point at
4-4 which was judged favour to the Dutch, surrendering his match
after he fought out six more deuce points after appeal.
</P>
<P>
Apell next meets the winner of the first-round match between
compatriot Thomas Nydahl and Frenchman Lionel Roux, while
Siemerink is likely to face Britain's Tim Henman.
</P>
<P>
World number one Martina Hingis survived in Tuesday's match in
the Melbourne Park by beating German Wiltrud Probst 6-1, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Can Get Larger Jute Market Share: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jute industrial experts have
urged the Bangladeshi government to take measures to expand the
country's share in the international jute market, according to a
local press report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's jute industry enjoys an ample scope for expansion
and could compete with other jute product manufacturing countries,
Shams-ul-Haque, an adviser of the Bangladesh Supreme Jute and
Knitex Ltd. (SJKL), was quoted as saying at a meeting on jute
industrial management recently.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported 790,000 tons of jute products in the
1996-97 fiscal year, accounting for 54 percent of the world market
demand and earning 6.4 billion taka (about 142 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Competing for the remaining 46 percent of the market would not
be hard work if jute products could be made price-competitive in
the global market, Shams-ul-Haque said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that jute is facing challenges from
artificial fibers and synthetics. "But artificial fibers and
synthetics are hazardous for the environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manzoor-ul Karim, chairman of the Board of Directors of the
SJKL, said annual global demand for jute yarn stands at 250,000
tons, of which Bangladesh meets 47 percent, but "we could easily
go for meeting 65 percent of the world demand."
</P>
<P>
The jute industry, the backbone of Bangladesh's national
economy, has been neglected for years, he stated, urging the
government and jute industrialists to find ways to develop it.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh government is going to submit a report to the
World Bank (WB) soon at the latter's request for the WB-aided
Revised Jute Sector Reform Program to help boost the country's
jute sector, the press report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said today that his visit to China has had a
positive impact on promoting bilateral and military
relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his three-day
official visit, Cohen said that relations between the two countries
have greatly improved since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit
to the U.S. in October last year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for China's "very constructive" moves
to promote the relations between the two armies and two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that military cooperation between the two
countries is proceeding smoothly in many areas, including exchanges of
visit by senior officials, reciprocal naval visits and
cooperation in humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the defense departments of the two
countries will continue to expand cooperation. He said the
two sides will adopt a modest, step-by-step approach to
establish mechanisms to increase confidence and reducing
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said his visit will have a positive effect on the
progress of multilevel and multichannel cooperation between the
two sides, and will help create a sound atmosphere for President
Bill Clinton's visit to China later this year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Foreign Reserve Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserve rose by 4.4 percent to 1.67 billion U.S. dollars on
January 8 from 1.6 billion dollars about a month earlier, the
local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which dropped to a record low of 1.58 billion
dollars at the end of November, showed a rising trend which
officials of Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, said was
the result of a satisfactory increase in export.
</P>
<P>
The country registered a 20-percent growth in export in the
first five months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings rose to 2.11 billion dollars in the
July-November period, as against the 1.76 billion dollars in the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials, however, termed the present position of foreign
exchange reserve as "not safe" although the position has
"stabilized to a great extent."
</P>
<P>
Normally, a country's foreign exchange reserve is considered
"safe" if it is enough for paying three and half months' import
bills. But Bangladesh's present foreign exchange reserve could
meet import bills only for a maximum of three months, a high
official at the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
the country's inadequate foreign exchange reserve position
might be further affected by the recent economic crisis in
Southeast Asian countries and South Korea, the official said,
referring to the money sent home by Bangladeshi workers in those
countries.

<HEADLINE> Stop Propagating Against Afghanistan, US Told </HEADLINE>

ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Supreme leader of the Afghan
Taliban militia Mohammad Umar has said the United States should
refrain from propagating against the Islamic government of
Afghanistan and portraying Taliban as major threat to womenfolk,
according to local newspaper The Muslim on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from Kandahar, Taliban's stronghold in
southern Afghanistan, Umar also said the student militia would not
succumb to any outside pressure regarding the present state of the
Afghan women, under Taliban's Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is well aware of the rights
of Afghan women and they have been given all due rights under
Islamic laws," the paper quoted Umar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader said "the Afghan women were living a
peaceful life under the Taliban rule and they enjoyed full
protection under the principles laid down in Islam."
</P>
<P>
"We don't care for the Americans and the Europeans who want to
promote vulgarity and obscenity in Afghanistan by demanding the
kind of freedom of women granted to females in their own
countries," Umar said.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania: Charter With U.S. Not Directed at Third Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A pact signed Friday between the
three Baltic states and the United States is not directed at other
countries, said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas Monday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Washington to the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius, Brazauskas said the Charter of Partnership is not a bad
thing for Russia and should not lead to its negative responses.
</P>
<P>
He told the Interfax news agency at the airport that his
country and Russia might one day sign a similar document.
</P>
<P>
There should be continued preparation to create favorable
conditions for cooperation and confidence-building between Vilnius
and Moscow, so as to forge documents governing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Russian President Boris Yeltsin offered, in what
Brazauskas described as "a positive move," to forge relations of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust with the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas said many people paid attention only to Russia's
offer of security cover for the Baltic states, but did not notice
its call for cooperation on economic and ecological issues.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian president said the U.S.-Baltic Charter of
Partnership signed in Washington is an important step for his
country to approach the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Lithuania could join the NATO in five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership, the United States
promised to help Lithuania, Estonia and Lativa acquire full NATO
memberships.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Buyers lead Thai Bourse Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors' renewed
buying helped push up the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index
by 9.8 percent on Monday, the local press quoted analysts as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The surge indicated foreigners' renewed confidence in the
country's financial reform program, they said.
</P>
<P>
The SET index rose 37.71 points in heavy volume to close at
420.72, the first time since early December the Thai bourse traded
over the 420-point mark, as foreign and local buyers snapped up
banking and technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
The rally came after International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief
Michel Camdessus on Friday praised the Thai government's efforts
to stick to the terms set in the 17.2 billion US dollar bailout
program.
</P>
<P>
The market was anticipating positive news from Washington,
where visiting Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda began a
series of talks with IMF and American officials for more funding
and easier terms.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are high that Tarrin will win relaxation of the strict
austerity measures attached to the IMF rescue package, in
particular the condition that Thailand showed a budget surplus
equal to one percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal
1998, which ends in the coming September.
</P>
<P>
On the currency market, the baht closed lightly stronger at
52.90-53.00 from Friday's close of 52.95-53.30.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia' Stock Prices Surge, Rupiah Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah descended
sharply to 9,550 against the U.S. dollar Monday on a combination
of political tensions and mounting concerns over the private
sector debt, "the Jakarta Post" daily Tuesday quoted currency
dealers as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the weakening rupiah did not riddle the stock market
as stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange rose 6.06 percent
after five local private banks announced a merger, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The merged banks will constitute the country's largest listed
private bank with total assets of 50 trillion rupiah (5.55 billion
U.S. dollars) and total equity of 5 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a bit strange to see the movement of the rupiah
Monday. It stabilized in the morning session before plunged to
almost 10,000 after lunch break," a local private bank chief
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The spot rupiah closed at 9,550/9,750 to the dollar against an
opening of 8,600/8,800 in the morning before nose-diving to 9,900
after lunch break.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to a record low of 11,000 per dollar on January
8, but it strengthened to between 7,800 and 8,500 after Indonesia
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) signed a reform package
on January 15.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 200 percent of its value against
the dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said reports on rioting in several small towns in East
Java and a protest at the House of Representatives compound put
more pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said angry mobs attacked on shops and rice mills
in the area of Banyuwangi, East Java last Saturday. On Monday,
about 200 people held a protest at the House of Representatives
building, demanding that President Soeharto step down and calling
on the government to reduce the soaring prices of staples.
</P>
<P>
"Adding to the political tension, the rupiah's fall is largely
attributed to foreign investors' concern about the private sector
debt in Indonesia," a chief dealer said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a pity the government has not mentioned any solution
to this problem (private sector debt) in the economic reforms
announced by the government last week," the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact signed here last Thursday by Indonesia
and the IMF, Indonesia will conduct a wide-ranging economic and
financial reform, including reviewing the 1998-99 state budget
draft, curtailing the government financial support for the
national car project and scrapping some agriculture monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government said the country's overall external
debt was 140 billion dollars at the end of last year. It did not
mention the private sector portion, but an earlier figure showed
private sector debt accounted for about 55 percent of the total
debt.
</P>
<P>
About 9.6 billion dollars of the total amount will mature by
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Inter-ASEAN Exports Grow at 28.3 Percent Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Exports among ASEAN countries
have grown from 43.26 billion US dollars in 1993 to almost 80
billion in 1996, an average yearly growth of 28.3 percent, ASEAN
Secretary General Rodolfo C. Severino said.
</P>
<P>
In the process, inter-ASEAN exports rose from almost 21 percent
to 24.7 percent, as a share of total ASEAN exports, Severino said
at a briefing for the mission of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council
here Monday, officials at the ASEAN secretariat disclosed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Severino said the figures show the results of the
implementation of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
scheme.
</P>
<P>
"We are now only five years away from the completion of the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). 42,252 tariff lines - more than 90
percent of all ASEAN tariff lines - have already been included in
the CEPT scheme leading to AFTA. Since 1993, when CEPT started,
average tariffs on the products involved have fallen by half, from
12.76 to 6.38 percent today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General emphasized that with the admission of
Laos and Myanmar, the ASEAN market is now as large as China's, and
according to the World Trade Organization (WTO), ASEAN is now the
fourth in exports, behind the European Union, the United States
and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Move Tamil Inmates to Barracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Tamil
prisoners, including many rebel suspects, in the Kalutara New
Prison in southern Sri Lanka are to be transferred to the Boossa
military detention barracks further south, government officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Boossa barracks will be exclusively used
to hold Tamil prisoners. The transfer will take place early next
month once the facilities in Boossa are ready to accommodate the
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The decision to transfer the Tamil prisoners followed a riot
that erupted at the Kalutara New Prison last December, which led
to the deaths of two Tamil inmates and one Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Prison authorities had complained that at the time of the
incident prison guards were unable to stop the clash between the
Sinhala and Tamil inmates as they didn't have proper equipment
like tear gas, rubber bullets and shields to deal with such a
situation.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Army will be in charge of outer security
of the Boossa barracks while the inner facilities will be run by
the Prisons Department.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A small bomb exploded at a
low-cost apartment building in Tanah Tinggi, Central Jakarta,
Sunday evening, injuring at least two people, security authorities
and news reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosion, which also damaged the apartment
building, was carried out by supporters of the outlawed People's
Democratic Party (PRD).
</P>
<P>
Police arrested several leaders of the PRD for allegedly
masterminding riots on July 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Central Jakarta police precinct Iman Haryatna said one
of the apartment building occupants has been caught and detained
while search is under way for two others on suspicion that they
played a key role in the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
Haryatna said the bomb, which was apparently intended to
trigger social unrest, exploded unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
From the apartment, police seized nine detonators, one timer,
eight jars containing gun powder, two cellular phones, three
beepers, a laptop computer, batteries, wires, a number of
documents including books on international terrorism and private
letters, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The intended target of the bomb has not yet been confirmed by
police, said Haryatna.
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating this," he said, adding that it was
possible the activities were aimed at sparking unrest and violence
ahead of the plenary session of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR).

ROME, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Monday warned Somalia's leaders that international aid to
rebuild the country will come only after the process of national
reconciliation has begun.
</P>
<P>
His comments came one month ahead of scheduled talks between
the country's two main warlords to finalize the terms of a peace
accord they agreed upon in Cairo last month.
</P>
<P>
Dini said at the meeting of ministers of member states and
partners of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
that Somali leaders should set aside "the illusion that they can
solve their differences by force."
</P>
<P>
He urged them to seek an urgent negotiated settlement. "Without
that, there can be no funds to reconstruct their country," Dini
said.
</P>
<P>
Six of the IGAD member states -- Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Kenya, Sudan and Uganda -- together with representatives from
donor countries Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Norway,
Switzerland, the United States, and the European Union, as well as
U.N. delegates, attended the meeting.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green on Monday warned some foreign groups against their
alleged involvement in the four-year conflict in Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid, humanitarian and rights groups, Green said, are
welcome as long as they limit themselves to the role of observers
in the restive state where Zapatista rebels rose up in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, they would be prosecuted upon exceeding
their role as observers, because Mexican law forbids foreigners to
become involved in the country's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, immigration authorities expelled 11 foreign-born
priests from Chiapas, mostly on charges of violating the terms of
their visas by engaging in political activities.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a French journalist was ordered out for visiting
a Chiapas village controlled by Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
Green said she would meet her European Union counterparts next
month to explain the Mexican government's response to the December
22 massacre of 45 people in the Chiapas hamlet of Acteal.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rupee Depreciates by 8.7 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan currency, the
rupee, depreciated by 8.7 percent in 1997 and the value of the
currency is expected to decline at a faster pace this year, local
economic analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the sharp currency depreciations in Southeast Asia
last year, there had been pressure for a devaluation of the Sri
Lankan rupee, they said.
</P>
<P>
After remaining relatively stable in the third quarter of 1997
at 58 per U.S. dollar, the rupee dropped to 61.6 per dollar by the
end of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the government would not devalue the currency
this year, given the central bank's stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The bank has opposed a steep devaluation of the currency,
fearing it would have an adverse impact on inflation, interest
rates and fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the bank will maintain its stance until it
assesses the impact of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia on
the Sri Lankan economy and the degree of stability that would
re-emerge in the Asian currency market.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed out that a continuing current account
deficit and weaker capital inflows, due to the Southeast Asian
economic turmoil, would put pressure on the rupee.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, while trying to avoid a devaluation, is
likely to let the rupee undergo an accelerated depreciation in
1998, the analysts said, predicting a 10- to 12-percent slide for
this year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airline to Seek Delay of New Aircraft Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) has decided to open talks with Boeing and Airbus aircraft
producers for postponing the delivery of 17 new planes by at least
three years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 planes ordered, 11 are scheduled for delivery this
year while the remainder are due in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The proposed delivery delay is aimed at reducing THAI's
expenditure and minimizing the impact on the Thai currency baht
and stock market, the newspaper The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1997, THAI's net profit was down by 600 million baht
from 1996, but sales costs surged by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the airline's revenue is derived from its international
operation while its domestic flights operate at a loss.
</P>
<P>
Because of a sharp decline in the number of travelers in Asia,
THAI will cut its flights to Seoul and Ho Chi Minh City and other
unprofitable routes to Indonesia and the Philippines may also come
under the ax.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Transport and Communications Ministry has
requested THAI to cut its 1998 budget by 6 billion baht (112
million U.S. dollars) through canceling some loss-making
international routes and suspending overtime pay for its
engineers.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Three Indians of the
Guarani-Kaiowa tripe in western Brazil committed suicide in the
last two weeks, an Indian rights group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nereu Schneider, of the Indian Missionary Council, said that 27
members of the village in Bororo, Mato Grosso do Sul, committed
suicide in 1997, bringing the total of suicides to 158 in the past
11 years.
</P>
<P>
Schneider blamed the suicides on poverty, alcoholism, and the
loss of ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
The Guarani-Kaiowa tripe have lost more than half of their land
to ranchers as settlers flow into the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 250,000 Indians in Brazil, down from an
estimated 5 million when European explorers arrived in 1500.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
today that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat to block
U.N. weapons inspections could only dig a "deeper hole" without
any prospect of lifting sanctions upon the country.

does not solve the situation for Saddam Hussein," Albright told
NBC's "Meet the Press."

<HEADLINE> Manila Pushes for ASEAN Currency-to-Currency Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
pushing for the immediate adoption of the proposed
currency-to-currency trade payment scheme among the members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista
on Tuesday as saying that Manila wants to immediately implement
the scheme with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, three ASEAN
members who were currently trapped in the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
The plan requires countries to settle trade flows among
themselves in their own currencies through an offset mechanism
instead of using the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would lower the countries' demand for the greenback
by at least 30 percent and conserve foreign exchange reserves,
thus helping stabilize the exchange rate between dollar and their
respective currencies.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the scheme, conceptualized during the Manila
meeting of ASEAN finance ministers in November last year, is being
reviewed by the central banks of the corresponding ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
He added that the scheme was not against the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"It is a sensible scheme, it is not against the IMF, and no new
legislation is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.

<HEADLINE> 91-day Treasury Bill Rate Drops in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The interest rate of the 91-day
Treasury bill, a benchmark used by banks to price their loans,
Monday dropped for the first time in eight weeks as the peso
continued gaining strength, local newspaper Business World
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the yield of the 91-day Treasury bill
plunged 1.537 percentage points to 18.587 percent from a six-year
high of 20.134 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the rate of the 91-day Treasury bill would help
lower commercial banks' interest rates which were raised to
unreasonable levels as a result of the depreciation of the peso
since July last year.
</P>
<P>
It would also be beneficial to the manufacturing sector. In the
long run, it would help the country rebuild its economy which was
slowing down due to the financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the drop in Treasury bill yields was because of the
appreciation of the peso, and an increase in the prices of the
stocks... obviously, money is back into the financial system and
banks are liquid again," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The peso had strengthened for the ninth consecutive trading day
on Monday, appreciating to an average of 41 pesos against the U.S.
dollar from 41.352.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange traders said the peso continued to be boosted
by the dollar sales of banks and exporters. But analysts were not
yet convinced that the momentum will sustain for long since the
regional financial storm has not shown signs of termination.
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, the peso fell to a historic low of 46.5
pesos per dollar, a fall of 76 percent from its pre-devaluation
average of 26.4 pesos a dollar.
