<HEADLINE> Navy Unit Frowns on Fraternizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The commander of the Blue Angels  
investigated and found nothing to a rumor that one of his pilots 
was having an affair with a female officer in the Navy's precision 
flying squadron. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was not the end of the story in this time of heightened  
sensitivity about male-female relationships in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 8, both officers still ended up being removed from the  
team, based at Pensacola Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	They were reassigned for disobeying written and verbal orders to  
avoid contact, to avoid any perception that something inappropriate 
was going on, according to a Navy official who did not want to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ``personal relationship'' involved non-sexual activities  
such as jogging and working out together, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hearing about more and more of these no-contact orders,''  
said Eugene R. Fidell, a civilian lawyer and president of the 
National Institute of Military Justice, a private informational and 
educational group. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it says is `avoid problems,' '' Fidell said in a  
telephone interview from his Washington office Thursday. ``Such an 
order is a shot across the bow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military commanders are trying to avoid such highly publicized  
situations as the resignation of 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn, the Air 
Force's first female B-52 pilot, and the Navy's Tailhook scandal, 
Fidell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force let Flinn resign in 1997, relenting on plans for a  
court-martial that could have meant a prison term, after she 
disobeyed orders to end an affair with an enlisted woman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Female officers accused drunken Navy and Marine Corps aviators  
of grabbing and groping them during a Tailhook Association 
convention in 1991 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Commanders are getting pro-active on this,'' Fidell said.  
</P>
<P>
	But commanders risk crossing a line that separates rights of  
personal association and the need to maintain good military order. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a lot of confusion where the lines are,'' said  
Frank Spinner, the Fairfax, Va., lawyer who represented Ms. Flinn. 
``It's not a healthy environment at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Blue Angels case, a news release announcing the  
reassignments said only that Marine Maj. Scott Wedemeyer, a married 
pilot, and Navy Lt. Tanya Wallace, a public affairs officer who is 
single, had been removed ``due to a loss of trust and confidence'' 
and for safety reasons ``to ensure that squadron personnel are not 
distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the team has flown with five planes instead of the  
usual six. A former Blue Angels pilot has been called in to replace 
Wedemeyer for the rest of the air show season that ends in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of simple friendships in the military is an outgrowth  
of struggles with sexual relationships and fraternization -- 
prohibited personal relationships, not necessarily sexual, between 
officers and enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said two camps have emerged: One wants to throw the book  
at anyone who violates moral standards while the other says ``don't 
kill a fly with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In any given case, a commander may be feeling tugged in both  
directions,'' Spinner said. ``I don't see a resolution of this 
problem any time soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tod Ensign, director of Citizen Soldier, a New York-based  
military advocacy group, said he thought Wedemeyer and Wallace 
might have a good case if they challenged their reassignments. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be removed from such a unit is definitely an adverse  
personnel action'' and could affect future promotions and 
assignments, Ensign said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidell, however, said transferring people before a problem  
occurs can be considered good management. ``In principle, it's very 
hard to object to this assuming there was some cogent basis for the 
order,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said the Blue Angels may be atypical because of the  
unit's high visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are living in a fish bowl,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Police Dog Mauls Pregnant Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) -- A police dog escaped from a squad car and  
mauled an innocent pregnant woman during a drunken-driving arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came last week as Isabel Ford was leaving a dance  
recital with her husband, mother-in-law and 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	While crossing the street, she saw officers running toward a DUI  
suspect who had become combative. 
</P>
<P>
	As Officer Dennis Newman joined the pursuit, his police dog,  
Rex, escaped. Instead of helping the officers, the Belgian Malinois 
knocked Ford to the ground and bit her repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly the most terrifying thing I've ever been  
through,'' Ford said. ``The dog was relentless. My husband is the 
hero. I'd be dead without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terrance Ford punched and kicked the dog until Newman could  
bring it under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ford suffered wounds to her buttocks, hip and arm that  
required 30 stitches. Doctors assured Ford that her baby was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our sincerest apologies. I know the city of Chandler will do  
what's necessary to help this woman,'' said Police Chief Bobby Joe 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the dog will be taken off the streets pending an  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said Newman's cruiser had been hit by another  
squad car while he was halting the suspect motorist. The dog ran 
free when Newman ran to assist in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``These dogs inherently are protective of their patrol car,''  
Harris said. ``When that car got bumped, I'm sure that set the 
animal off.''

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Study Affects Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Hispanic and black children are apparently more  
prone to developing an adult form of diabetes that can lead to 
heart attacks, strokes, blindness and amputations if it's not 
diagnosed and treated early, researchers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But more research needs to be done to target specific risk  
factors among different ethnic groups, said the scientists, who 
released their findings at the annual conference of the American 
Diabetes Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Two separate studies conducted by researchers at New York's  
Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia Presbyterian Center and 
the UCSD School of Medicine concluded that obesity also plays a 
major factor in whether children will develop Type II diabetes, a 
form of diabetes usually seen in people 45 years and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 16 million people in the United States have diabetes, the  
sixth-leading cause of death in the country. The most common and 
serious form of diabetes is Type II; Type I is less common, but 
easier to diagnose and generally affects children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Type II diabetes was practically unheard of in young people  
until the last few years, and its recent appearance is alarming,'' 
said Dr. Robin S. Goland, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCSD study assessed 58 children and teen-agers of different  
ethnicities who had been diagnosed with Type II diabetes. All 
except one were overweight. More than 50 percent were Hispanic and 
19 percent were black. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Columbia Presbyterian study, researchers studied 19 obese  
children. Nearly half were Hispanic and 37 percent were black. 
</P>
<P>
	In both studies, Caucasian, Asian, American Indian children were  
also part of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers believe lifestyle -- rather than genetics --  
plays a bigger role in vulnerability to diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching TV greater than five hours a day increases the risk  
of diabetes 2.5 times,'' said Dr. Bernard Zinman, a scientist at 
the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute at the University of 
Western Ontario in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinman, who was not connected to either of the two reports  
presented Saturday, has studied 445 people ages 2 to 19 and found 
that obesity was more common among diabetics than in the general 
population.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Sign Pact With KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Concerned about reports of revenge  
attacks by ethnic Albanian rebels, NATO has pledged to put more 
military police on the streets of Kosovo to make the shattered 
province safe for Serbs fleeing by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further effort to keep order in Kosovo, NATO intended to  
sign an agreement today with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army 
specifying terms of its demilitarization, alliance spokesman Maj. 
Jam Yoosten said. 
</P>
<P>
	While NATO forces seek to impose control, Serb troops are  
withdrawing from Kosovo on schedule, Yoosten said. He said the 
Serbs were on track to have all 40,000 of their troops and special 
police out of the province by noon Sunday. The deadline was 
midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Finland, negotiators reached agreement late Friday  
after three days of intense talks on Russia's role in the 
peacekeeping operation. The matter took on added urgency after 
Moscow sent 200 troops into Pristina, Kosovo's capital, last 
weekend and gained control of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, France, Britain, Germany and Italy have  
divided Kosovo into five sectors for peacekeeping. Russia had 
wanted its own sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, 3,000 Russian troops will serve under  
Russian command and control, but Russians will work with NATO 
commanders in the sectors controlled by the United States, France 
and Germany. The Pristina airport will be opened to all nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, evidence of Serb atrocities during NATO's bombing  
campaign continued to mount. The discoveries were all too familiar: 
a well filled with decomposing bodies; a prison filled with 
apparent instruments of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers in Dragacin, north of Prizren, told German troops that  
the well was filled with the bodies of 11 elderly men killed in 
late April. 
</P>
<P>
	There have also been reports of atrocities against Serbs, with a  
couple found dead on their home's doorstep and a 16-year-old killed 
in an ambush on a country road. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report that could not be independently confirmed, the Serb  
Media Center said KLA rebels killed three Serbs in central Novo 
Selo and southern Kosovska Kamenica and kidnapped 18 Serbs in 
villages near Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO peacekeepers arrested 25 Kosovo Liberation Army rebels  
Friday after German peacekeepers rescued 15 battered Gypsies and 
ethnic Albanians in what they said might be a KLA torture chamber 
for alleged collaborators in Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found the corpse of an elderly man chained to a chair.  
He appeared to have died shortly before the Germans arrived, said 
German army spokesman Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 50,000 Serb civilians have left Kosovo, and the rest are  
increasingly fearful as Serb troops pull out. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church came to the city of  
Pec, the church's birthplace, pleading with his faithful to follow 
his example and remain in what Serbs consider the cradle of their 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But the German forces responsible for southwestern Kosovo said  
that in Orahovac, 30 miles southwest of Pristina, a delegation led 
by Lt. Col. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic of the Serbian special police was 
urging the last 3,000 Serbs in town to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the province, Serb civilians seemed increasingly eager to  
listen to such talk. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eastern town of Pasjane, after KLA members pulled two  
Serbs from their car and beat them, a group of Serbs surrounded a 
U.S. Marine checkpoint where the men were taken, demanding that 
peacekeepers protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You made the security leave, now you have to replace it,'' one  
of the Serbs shouted. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO began to respond to those demands, setting up roadblocks in  
Pristina and seizing dozens of weapons. At one checkpoint, soldiers 
reached into civilian cars and fished out rifles, grenades and 
ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	While German troops had let rebels bring guns in across the  
Albanian border only a day earlier, commanders said they were 
cracking down and banned rebels from carrying weapons in Prizren as 
of midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers ``will be evenhanded in protecting all ethnic  
groups,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, 
Belgium. ``And I would like ... to urge the Kosovo Serbian 
population not to leave, but to give peace a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry's liaison with the peacekeepers,  
Nebojsa Vujovic, met with the force's commander, British Lt. Gen. 
Mike Jackson, and said he recognized that peacekeepers were trying 
to crack down on rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The allied nations and the international war crimes tribunal for  
Yugoslavia also agreed Friday that the peacekeepers will take an 
active role in bringing suspected war criminals to justice. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four top aides were 
indicted last month on war crimes charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada said the allies' role  
in dealing with suspected war criminals will be ``considerably 
different'' from that of the NATO-led force in Bosnia, which has 
been criticized for not detaining indicted Serb leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian refugees continued to pour into Kosovo on cars,  
trucks and tractors. About 50,000 had come back by Thursday night 
and thousands more streamed across the borders on Friday, the U.N. 
refugee agency said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nevada Star Arrested For DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Former Nevada quarterback Chris Vargas was  
arrested for investigation of drunken driving following a 
two-vehicle collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas was released on his own recognizance Friday evening from  
the Washoe County Jail after being booked on one count of felony 
driving under the influence causing substantial bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Highway Patrol said Vargas was westbound on the Mount  
Rose Highway late Thursday when he collided with a car driven by 
Carrie Fry, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas was released from Washoe Medical Center after treatment  
for a leg injury. Fry, who was thrown from her car, was treated for 
head and leg injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas was cut last summer by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers after  
five seasons in the CFL. He also played for the Edmonton Eskimos 
and British Columbia Lions. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Champions Among Those Cut at Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Both knees buckled as the putt slid by  
the hole. Ernie Els, a two-time winner of the U.S. Open, won't get 
a chance to play this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	He is known as the Big Easy, in part for his laissez-faire  
attitude, but this one clearly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even explain it,'' Els said after missing the cut  
Friday at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only prominent player sent packing by the stiff  
winds and baked greens at Pinehurst No. 2. Masters champion Jose 
Maria Olazabal, Greg Norman, Fred Couples, Mark O'Meara, Nick Faldo 
and Jack Nicklaus didn't play well enough to hang around, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Els, who won the Open in 1994 and '97, made two double-bogeys  
during a round of 76, but still would have survived with a birdie 
on one of the last four holes. He missed a 25-foot putt at 16, an 
18-footer at 17 and a 10-footer at 18 after a sparkling second 
shot, both knees cringing as the ball slid by the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got a break,'' said Els, who finished with an 8-over  
148 to miss the cut by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman has played sparingly since his third-place finish at the  
Masters, and his level of play during two days in North Carolina 
was shockingly inept. He shot a 73 in the first round before 
hitting just two of 18 greens Friday for an 8-over 78. He missed 
the cut by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a physical thing for me,'' said Norman, who  
sat out most of last year after shoulder surgery. ``I guess I'd 
like to work on my head a little bit. I need to get fired up about 
playing again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most painful departure belonged to Olazabal, who didn't even  
get to play the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard angrily punched a hotel wall Thursday night after  
an opening-round 75, breaking a bone in his right hand. He was 
forced to withdraw and will be sidelined up to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did something I should not have,'' said Olazabal, who could  
miss the British Open in July. ``Now, I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, a six-time major champion trapped in the worst slump of  
his career, has now missed the cut in six of his last 10 majors 
after consecutive rounds of 74 left him one shot short. The 
Englishman was 5-over with four holes remaining before three 
straight bogeys knocked him below the line that separates those who 
play and those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who won the Masters and British Open last year, missed  
the cut at the U.S. Open for the first time in four years with a 
10-over 150, though this hardly one of his favorite tournaments. He 
hasn't finished in the top 10 since tying for third in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Nicklaus, making his 43rd consecutive Open  
appearance, was never in contention. He had rounds of 78 and 75 for 
a 13-over total. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I would make the cut,'' said Nicklaus, who had not  
missed the cut at the Open since 1995. ``I made the cut in my last 
tournament (the Memorial). Why not here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he equaled his highest two-round score in an Open.  
Nicklaus also shot 153 in 1963, missing the cut after the first of 
his four titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The current defending champion, Lee Janzen, struggled to rounds  
of 74 and 73 but narrowly made the cut because he is within 10 
shots of leaders Payne Stewart, David Duval and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a great effort tomorrow to get back in the  
hunt, and another one on Sunday,'' Janzen said. ``But if you make 
the cut, it's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such comeback is possible for players like Lee Westwood, who  
finished sixth at the Masters but slumped to a 9-over 149 in the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking relieved when it was over, he was asked to name the  
toughest holes on the Donald Ross-designed course. 
</P>
<P>
	``All 18 of them,'' he said with a sigh.

<HEADLINE> Genetically Altered Food Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of consumer advocates wants labels  
required for genetically altered foods, continuing a biotechnology 
debate that has already swept across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Natural Law Party, with consumer groups, scientists and  
farmers, announced last week it had gathered 500,000 signatures of 
Americans in support of government labeling of genetically 
engineered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to submit the signatures to the White House, members  
of Congress and several federal agencies in hopes of forcing 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say why rush it onto the market before we know it's safe,''  
said Bob Ross, a spokesman for the Natural Law Party. ``Why not 
give consumers a choice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of urban and environmental  
policy at Tufts University, ``Until we are satisfied that we know 
what questions to ask and that we are fully empowered to test the 
products of biotechnology, industry and regulators will be 
operating by seat-of-the-pants assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also were behind the campaign last year in which the  
Agriculture Department received more than 250,000 letters urging 
that national standards for organic products bar genetic 
engineering. The agency agreed to the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	While critics say labels on biotech foods will give consumers a  
choice, the food and biotechnology industries say the proposal is 
expensive and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The products of ag biotechnology have been subjected to more  
scrutiny than any other products in humanity,'' said Val Giddings, 
vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, adding 
that the products have been tested extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no scientific basis for putting that on. If you put  
that on a label, the implication will unavoidably be that this has 
some health significance, and it does not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal task force of representatives from the Agriculture  
Department, Food and Drug Administration, State Department, 
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Trade Representative's 
office is reviewing the labeling issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has stressed there has been  
no change in the government's policy that food should be labeled 
only if ingredients change the nutritional content or could cause 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence in biotechnology and the industry's confidence  
in biotechnology are ultimately irrelevant if the consumers aren't 
buying,'' Glickman said last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't force-feed GMOs (genetically modified organisms) to  
reluctant consumers. We have to bring them along. The public 
opinion poll is as important as the test tube.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the largest producer of bioengineered  
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops that are often genetically altered and used in products  
include corn for chips and cereals, tomatoes for spaghetti sauce, 
cotton for blue jeans, and corn syrup for sodas. 
</P>
<P>
	By breeding genes in crops, U.S. scientists say they have  
managed to improve taste and make plants more resistant to disease 
and insects. Advocates contend that insect-resistant crops reduce 
the need for heavy doses of pesticides and other chemicals.

	But U.S. enthusiasm for genetically engineered crops is far from  
matched overseas, particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European and Asian nations are implementing or proposing  
labeling laws that would distinguish foods containing genetically 
modified ingredients. Some food companies overseas, especially in 
Great Britain, say they will not sell food with bioengineered 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the United States managed to avert labeling demands  
by several countries as part of a U.N.-initiated Biosafety 
Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, American scientists revealed they had discovered  
that pollen from a widely planted laboratory-designed strain of 
corn can kill monarch butterflies -- a finding noted by opponents of 
genetic engineering though refuted by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another piece of news that has eroded the consumers  
confidence in the whole process of genetic engineering,'' Ross 
said. ``The American people ... are not going to sit back anymore 
and take food being forced on them by the biotech industry.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	PEWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- A police officer who regularly pumps iron  
lifted a 500-pound riding mower off a man who was pinned beneath 
the overturned machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the home of Terry DeSandre on Thursday  
after his 15-year-old tractor lost traction, threw him off and 
tumbled down a hill after him. 
</P>
<P>
	The machine landed on top of DeSandre in a small ravine, leaving  
him gasping for air, while the blade was still spinning on the side 
facing away from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very lucky the tractor came down the way it did,  
otherwise I would've been ground into hamburger,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first officer to arrive was Craig Drummey, who stands 6 feet  
7 inches tall, tips the scales at 260 pounds and pumps iron three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it the ol' one-two and lifted it up. It felt great,''  
said Drummey, who has been on the job just four months. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSandre, 59, was sore but relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea how he managed to lift it all by himself. I'm  
grateful.''

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Denmark 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- As soon as they walked onto the  
field, they knew Saturday would be something special. Something 
historic. Something unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. team beat Denmark 3-0 in the opener of the  
Women's World Cup, the players didn't want to leave. They wanted to 
soak in the atmosphere created by the biggest crowd ever to watch a 
women's sporting event in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was awesome, the noise was unbelievable,'' Mia Hamm  
said of the 78,972 fans who came to celebrate women's soccer and 
their own team. ``I think we all had goose bumps when we stepped 
onto the field. How could you not have goose bumps when you see the 
stadium filled and people chanting `U-S-A, U-S-A?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful way to start the tournament. This is what we  
always dreamed the World Cup should be. To see the crowd and the 
atmosphere is phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm certainly thrilled the fans. The career goal-scoring leader  
with 110, she demonstrated all of her skills with a goal and an 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mia was awesome,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. ``Just awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
	She scored a masterful goal in the 17th minute. Her passes  
either sprung teammates for open shots or found them in threatening 
positions. She created space for herself, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But not until Julie Foudy converted a long cross from Hamm with  
17 minutes left could the home team feel secure. Kristine Lilly 
scored from 18 yards in the 89th minute as the U.S. veterans led 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``A team can only shut us down for so long,'' said goalkeeper  
Briana Scurry, who rarely was tested in getting her 50th career 
shutout. ``They might slow us for a half, but they won't stop us 
for a full game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, with American flags waving everywhere, the players  
hugged, then trotted around the field, clapping and saluting the 
fans. Most of them looked like they didn't want to leave, and no 
one could blame them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People outside soccer know this stadium, the name Giants  
Stadium, and that what happens here is great events,'' Brandi 
Chastain said. ``And women's soccer now can be put right up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team that favors the quick strike was more methodical in  
wearing down the Danes. Led by Hamm's brilliant playmaking, the 
Americans had numerous scoring chances in the second half, as 
Denmark seemed to tire. 
</P>
<P>
	But the marksmanship wasn't there nearly all day. Cindy Parlow  
hit the crossbar. So did Lilly. Then Lilly missed by inches while 
wide open in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish goalkeeper Dorthe Larsen made a brilliant punch save on  
Tiffeny Milbrett as the Americans -- who won the first World Cup in 
1991 and took the 1996 Olympic gold medal -- continued their charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hamm's cross soared over Lilly's head, but right to  
Foudy, who put a left-footed kick into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly finished it off with a bending left-footer.  
</P>
<P>
	``We dominated the game,'' Lilly said. ``I'm glad we got those  
two at the end. I think it gave us a big boost going into our next 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will be Thursday against Nigeria in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
	In the second game of Saturday's doubleheader, Brazil routed  
Mexico 7-1 as Sissi and Pretinha each scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, in San Jose, Calif., it was China against Sweden and  
Japan playing Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge crowd, which included United Nations secretary-general  
Kofi Annan, New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and Pele, 
soccer's biggest star, was entertained by the pop group 'N Sync 
before the game. Other than Hamm's goal, the singers drew the 
loudest cheers through the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes won most of Scurry's goal kicks, which helped them  
form some quick attacks. But those forays generally fizzled as the 
American defense, led by captain Carla Overbeck, kept the goal area 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett took a beating early, twice colliding with Danish  
players, sending her to the ground. Each time, she got up slowly 
and rarely was she able to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	But the other forwards, Hamm and Parlow, made several dangerous  
moves. Parlow's lack of speed and the close marking on Hamm 
prevented the Americans from getting more than the early goal -- 
until their fitness and flair took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all remember this day,'' Hamm said. ``With this kind of  
support, it's a wonderful feeling playing in front of this group.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Rights Family May Lose Cottage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Graham family believes strongly in the  
Methodist Church and civil rights, including the rights of gays and 
lesbians to live free of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Their beliefs have earned them an eviction notice from a cottage  
they have at a Methodist campground in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The notice came after Bill and Nannette Graham's 16-year-old  
daughter, Amelia, posted signs in the cottage's windows supporting 
gay friends the Chicago family claims were being discriminated 
against by the campground. 
</P>
<P>
	Her move angered trustees at the Historic United Methodist  
Campground, who told the Grahams to be out by Monday and threatened 
to change their cottage's locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-area Methodist leaders say they will investigate the  
dispute. Meanwhile, the Grahams aren't budging. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bigger issue than gay or lesbian rights to us,''  
Mrs. Graham said Friday. ``We would have taken a stand for anyone's 
civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Graham said the dispute started last summer when two men  
rented one of the 100 cottages on the campground, located in 
suburban Des Plaines. The family has owned a cottage there for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	After rumors surfaced that the men were homosexual, camp  
residents held a prayer vigil in front of their cottage and chanted 
scripture against homosexuality, she said. At the end of the 
summer, the men were told by camp trustees that they would not be 
allowed to rent there again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grahams then sent a letter to the Chicago District  
Campground Association board, which runs the camp, informing them 
that the two men would be their house guests. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted the board to say such an invitation would violate  
camp rules. Amelia responded with her posters. 
</P>
<P>
	One read: ``Gays and lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders,  
welcome.'' The other called the Graham home a ``reconciling'' 
cottage, referring to Methodists who support the inclusion of 
homosexuals in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Grahams received a letter from the board  
informing them that they were being evicted for violating their 
``privilege of ownership of a cottage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The sign displayed in your cottage windows incites conflict  
and inhibits harmonious environment of the campground,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the campground offices were not returned  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Joseph Sprague, leader of the 142,000 Methodists in  
Northern Illinois, said Friday the church will investigate the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``While United Methodism -- for theological reasons -- has  
determined that clergy may not celebrate services of holy union for 
gays and lesbians, at the same time, the church is very clear in 
its advocacy of the sacred worth and civil rights of gay and 
lesbian people,'' Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Graham said she hopes the United Methodist Church will take  
a stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to say: 'This is wrong, shape up,''' she said. ``I  
don't want them to tie it up in a bag and throw it away.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Hooker Ring Broken Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A couple that seemed to fit in just fine  
in this quiet north Fulton County neighborhood, is charged with 
operating a metro-wide prostitution ring from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Williams, 38, and Lamon Williams, 48, were charged with  
racketeering and pimping after authorities say they confiscated 
records detailing a prostitution ring, pornography and a home 
computer police allege was used to recruit and solicit prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've certainly updated the oldest profession for the next  
millennium,'' said DeKalb County Police Capt. Doug Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were held on bonds exceeding $50,000 following their arrest  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the couple operated the prostitution ring under  
the umbrella of Diamond's Escort agency, which serviced businessmen 
who could afford $200-an-hour fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton says nearly 30,000 visited the World Wide Web site, which  
advertises: ``Black beauties. The Most Glamorous Women Of ... To Be 
Your Escort ... Sweet Treats For You Today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, which faced similar charges last year that were  
later dropped in Gwinnett County, also ran ads in local newspapers, 
adult magazines and strip clubs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams' two school-age sons, who regularly played  
basketball in the driveway with other neighbors, are in the custody 
of their 19-year-old son.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Might Give Lemieux Leverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The deal that the Pittsburgh Penguins struck  
with Civic Arena manager SMG Inc. in 1991 is a loan, not a lease, a 
judge ruled in a decision that could give Mario Lemieux more 
leverage to rescue the bankrupt team. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 31-page opinion, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz  
ruled in favor of the Penguins' claim regarding the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could give Lemieux, the team's former star center,  
and Pittsburgh officials new leverage to force SMG to renegotiate 
the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Pittsburgh officials accused SMG of refusing to talk  
seriously and threatened to cancel the Philadelphia-based 
management group's contract to schedule events at the Civic Arena. 
SMG officials had no immediate reaction to Markovitz's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors are to vote on Lemieux's plan Thursday, June 24.  
</P>
<P>
	The judge found that SMG had paid $24 million to Penguins owner  
Howard Baldwin for the rights to manage the arena and sublease it 
to the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin used that money to buy the team from Edward DeBartolo.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a financing device masquerading as a lease, so as to  
allow Howard Baldwin to purchase the team while providing a stream 
of money to SMG to reimburse it for the cash infusion and for its 
efforts in running the facility,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the deal a ``subterfuge'' and suggested that the  
complicated loan was a way to make the 1991 deal acceptable to the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record does not indicate whether the NHL was aware of this  
subterfuge,'' Markovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys in the case said that if the Penguins repay the  
balance of the loan -- a figure not specified in Markovitz's ruling 
-- SMG will have to return control of the arena to the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've liberated the Civic Arena,'' said Doug Campbell,  
attorney for Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired Penguins center is leading a group that is trying to  
buy the team and has the endorsement of Pittsburgh and Allegheny 
County officials and the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Westley, the president of SMG, said he wasn't sure about the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to figure out what it means,'' he said. ``We're  
studying it. We'll have more of an opinion on Monday.''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds DC's Teen Curfew Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen-agers do not have the right to wander the  
streets late at night, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in 
upholding the District of Columbia's youth curfew law. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the  
1995 law governing district children younger than 17 does not 
violate their rights or interfere with the rights of parents to 
raise their children as they see fit, The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the 11-judge court said the law gives parents  
almost total discretion over their children's late-night activities 
and, in fact, helps parents control their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the law, led by the American Civil Liberties Union,  
say they oppose the ruling but have not decided whether to appeal 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear a similar case in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagree because I think there is a right of free  
movement,'' said lawyer Robert S. Plotkin, who argued the case 
against the law. ``We're also concerned that the court made short 
shrift of the role of the parents and the parents' rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D.C. Council Member Harold Brazil said he was ``delighted''  
with the ruling. He said the law will reduce youth violence and 
gang activity.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Singer Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A warrant has been issued for  
singer Bobby Brown after he allegedly violated probation in a 
drunken-driving case. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband of superstar Whitney Houston has three fresh strikes  
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine showed up in a urine test in April, he refused to take  
another urine test in May, and he didn't return from a trip to 
Beverly Hills, Calif., on time, his probation officer reported to 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown previously told Broward Circuit Judge Leonard Feiner that  
the judge saved his life by putting him on probation and sending 
him to rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 32, won't face arrest on the misdemeanor warrant unless  
he returns to Florida because prosecutors won't seek his 
extradition. He could face up to 90 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The original case developed after Brown smashed his wife's car  
into a condominium sign.

today and NATO said the soldiers may be gone well ahead of their 
midnight tomorrow deadline. Peacekeepers met with ethnic Albanian 
rebels in an attempt to prevent a new reign of terror to fill the 
vacuum left by the retreating Serbs. The first group of

<HEADLINE> Accused SLA Fugitive Denied Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Bail was denied for the woman captured this  
week who authorities say is fugitive Symbionese Liberation Army 
member Kathleen Ann Soliah. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Kathleen Gearin refused to set bail on Friday,  
partly because one of the charges against Ms. Soliah carries a 
penalty of life in prison. Ms. Soliah is accused of planting two 
pipe bombs under police cars in 1975; the bombs did not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, 52, assumed a new life in St. Paul under the alias  
Sara Jane Olson, authorities said. The suspect has refused to waive 
extradition to face the California bomb charges. Her next hearing 
was scheduled for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Howard Bass, did not return phone calls seeking  
comment. He has not acknowledged whether Mrs. Olson and Ms. Soliah 
are the same person, but the FBI says fingerprint analysis shows a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old woman captured Wednesday has been quietly living  
as a doctor's wife, sometime actress and mother of three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gov. Jesse Ventura said he would sign extradition  
papers for Ms. Soliah if they are presented to him. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the anti-government SLA kidnapped newspaper heiress  
Patty Hearst. The case took a bizarre twist when Ms. Hearst sent 
word that she had joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Hearst was arrested in San Francisco in October 1975,  
she was living with Ms. Soliah and her brother. Ms. Hearst was 
convicted of an SLA bank robbery and sent to prison, serving for 
two years before President Carter commuted her sentence.

<HEADLINE> Glass Pioneers Honored at Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNING, N.Y. (AP) -- From window panes to optical fiber and  
magnifying glasses to casserole dishes, glass has been molded in 
magical ways to transform 20th-century life. 
</P>
<P>
	Some glass inventions had whimsical origins, others sprung to  
life after years of laboratory experiments. Only when something 
works do ``you realize that it's not so complicated after all,'' 
said Frank Hyde, 96, who unlocked a practical method for making 
ultra-pure glass back in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, whose discoveries set in motion today's fiber-optic  
revolution in telecommunications, is among a host of glass pioneers 
memorialized at a Glass Innovation Center that opens today in the 
Corning Museum of Glass, about 75 miles southeast of Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	What quickly becomes clear from a stroll through the revamped  
museum is that this rigid liquid forged by fire -- a tool of 
civilization for 3,500 years entwined in the 20th century's most 
potent technological advances -- is only beginning to surrender its 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glass does many more things for us than we realize,'' said Roy  
G. Gordon, a professor of chemistry at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s energy crisis, Gordon invented a low-emissivity  
glass now in widespread use in skyscrapers and homes that doubled 
the insulation capacity of windows. ``It allowed architects to 
build large areas of glass without penalty of an energy loss or a 
real loss of comfort,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum itself, built in 1951 but refashioned since 1996 at a  
cost of $62 million, is a multidimensional showcase of how glass of 
all shapes, colors and compositions is used in architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look through glass instead of looking at it,'' said Rob  
Casetti, the museum's creative director. ``We want visitors to ... 
awaken to the wonder of this material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The museum tells the stories of the great glass inventors using  
video, text, artifacts and hands-on exhibits such as a Navy 
periscope that can be swiveled to view Corning and its sylvan 
setting in western New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Unmistakable in the vista is the headquarters of Corning Inc.,  
the company famous for its glass-science breakthroughs and 
mass-production of light bulbs, liquid crystal displays, optical 
fiber and telescope mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum runs a ``hot glass show'' illustrating how a crystal  
vase is made using a furnace heated to 2,350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The exquisite sculpture is then tossed back into the fire for 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
	In another wing, however, is the world's most comprehensive  
collection of glass objects, 30,000-plus items ranging from giant 
ornamental vases to mass-produced soda bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	Three innovation galleries trace the evolution of flat glass,  
glass vessels such as cathode-ray tubes and Pyrex flasks, and glass 
as a material that conducts light. One illuminating example: 4 
ounces of optical fiber can deliver more telephone calls or 
Internet data than 33 tons of copper wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Optical communications caught people's imagination somehow --  
it had a life of its own from the beginning,'' said Robert Maurer, 
74, who along with Donald Keck and Peter Schultz developed optical 
fiber at Corning in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Optical fiber is rapidly replacing copper as the backbone of  
America's telephone, cable television and computer networks. It 
also has found myriad uses in other fields, such as medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was most important to me was to do something that had  
practical value for people in society,'' Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of this nice,'' he said with a chuckle, after seeing  
his image flickering in a documentary film in a corner of the 
museum. ``But I'm not the kind of person who had that as my primary 
goal.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Stanley Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Ken Hitchcock doesn't look it, but he's  
extremely nervous before games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaches are like ducks,'' the colorful Dallas Stars coach  
said. ``Calm on top, but paddling underneath. Believe me, there's a 
lot of leg movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, patient and introspective with the media, said he  
would relax before Saturday night's Game 6 of the Stanley Cup 
finals by watching a sports event on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God the U.S. Open is on,'' he said, ``I'd be a nut  
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A REAL CUT-UP:* The media has grabbed hold of all the talk  
about ``dirty'' play between the teams in the Stanley Cup finals 
and given it a good ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, who has accused the Stars of  
using their sticks like hatchets, among other things, was ready to 
parry with the media again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he thought about all the fuss, including a photo  
of Sabres captain Mike Peca ``grimacing,'' Ruff responded: ``I 
think they're trying to motivate us again. They took 48 pictures 
and caught him with a grimace, and used that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGNING ON:* Sign in the Dallas Stars' locker room before  
Saturday night's Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals: 
</P>
<P>
	``We will either find a way, or make a way.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STARTLING STAT:* The defenses have been great in the finals,  
starting with goaltender Dominik Hasek of Buffalo and Ed Belfour of 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the goalie with the best save percentage in the playoffs  
isn't in the finals. He's Philadelphia's John Vanbiesbrouck, with a 
.938 percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was at .937 and Belfour at .925 prior to Saturday night's  
game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF THE TIMES:* The Buffalo Sabres are in the prayers of  
their fans, and it's visible. A sign on a road near the Marine 
Midland Arena: 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, Lord Stanley, hear our prayer. For too many years, our  
CUPboard's been bare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are seeking their first Stanley Cup. They reached the  
finals only once in their history, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW DEPTHS:* The Dallas Stars would break new ground by winning  
the Stanley Cup. Not only will they bring a championship to the 
franchise for the first time, but they would become the 
southernmost team in the league to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche have that distinction now.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUFF'S OPTION:* Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said his team had a  
``modified'' optional skate Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Modified?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he said, ``some guys had an option and some guys  
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KEANE OBSERVATION:* Dallas' Mike Keane on the lack of scoring  
in the finals, the lowest goal total since 1947: 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fan would like to see a 20-19 game, but you're not going  
to see that. If we won 1-0, I'd be happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TWO SCREAMERS:* Coaches Lindy Ruff of Buffalo and Ken Hitchcock  
of Dallas have become favorites of the media at the Stanley Cup 
finals with their quick and ready wit. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one moment between them, though, where neither felt  
like being humorous. That happened at the end of Game 5 in Dallas 
Thursday night when a lot of animosity surfaced between the teams 
after a bitterly-fought contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what it was all about,'' Ruff said. ``Hitch came  
off the bench screaming. I decided to scream back. Then he screamed 
back at me and I screamed back at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him if he wanted some water, and he said, `No.' ``  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WARMING UP:* Even though Dallas isn't what is considered a  
hockey hotbed, Stars forward Mike Modano says fans ``have come 
around'' since the team moved from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it was only a matter of time,'' Modano said of selling  
the sport in a warm-weather site. ``A lot of northerners have moved 
down (and) we have a lot of fans who have grown to love the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love the Cowboys there, and they love winners.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have sold out 49 straight games.

<HEADLINE> China 2, Sweden 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Tight play, sharp passing and superb  
goalkeeping led China to a 2-1 victory over Sweden on Saturday, the 
opening day of the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish midfielder Kristen Bengtsson, the oldest player on the  
team at 29, scored the first goal just two minutes into the game -- 
cracking a hard, high ball into the upper left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	China's goalie, Gao Hong, got her hand on it but the ball slid  
in. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-fastest goal in Women's World Cup history -- Sweden  
scored in the first minute in 1991 against Japan -- was also 
Sweden's only goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen minutes later, China came back when Liu Ying knocked a  
sweeping corner kick across the front of Sweden's goal and Jin Yan 
headed it down into the corner, just past the fingertips of diving 
goalie Ulrika Karlsson. 
</P>
<P>
	China's decisive goal came in 68th minute when Liu Ailing kicked  
a low, fast shot into the middle of the net. Her goal, assisted by 
Liu Ying, came at the end of a string of seven passes all the way 
down the field by China. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinated, neat play distinguished China, contrasting with  
Sweden's faster, more aggressive style. Gao, one of the top goalies 
in women's soccer, recovered after her initial miss to stop several 
tough shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden beat China 1-0 in the 1991 World Cup quarterfinals. In  
the 1995 World Cup, China won 4-3 on penalty kicks in the 
quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies After Fox Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) -- A 79-year-old woman who fought off a  
rabid fox in April by holding onto the animal for 12 hours until 
help arrived has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucy Dover lived at a Zephyrhills nursing home following her  
release from a hospital two weeks after the April 5 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, David Dover, 57, said it was unclear how much the  
injuries from the fox attack contributed to her death on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never really got totally better,'' he said. ``It's tough  
when you're that age to come back from that much trauma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dover had stepped outside her mobile home in Hernando  
County, some 45 miles north of Tampa, to smoke a cigarette when a 
red fox attacked, repeatedly biting and clawing her. 
</P>
<P>
	She fell to the ground, breaking her hip. The fox kept  
attacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her injuries, the 5-foot-2 woman grabbed and subdued the  
15-pound animal in what turned out to be an all-night struggle, 
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA President Becomes IOC Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Sepp Blatter, president of soccer's  
world governing body FIFA, was appointed Sunday as a member of the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch nominated Blatter, and the  
appointment was ratified by the general assembly on the final day 
of its session in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must have very close relations with his organization,''  
Samaranch said. ``We need to have more (professional) soccer 
players during the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, who becomes the fourth Swiss delegate on the IOC, was  
co-opted as an ex-officio member based on his presidency of the 
soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and FIFA have been at odds for years over soccer's role  
in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA, determined to guard the supremacy of its World Cup,  
imposes strict eligibility rules for Olympic soccer. Teams are 
allowed to field only three players over the age of 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC would like FIFA to ease, or lift, the restriction.  
</P>
<P>
	FIFA has also opposed the IOC's attempts to get all sports  
federations to apply minimum two-year bans for serious drug 
offenses. FIFA maintains certain prohibited drugs are not 
performance-enhancing in soccer, and that two-year suspensions will 
not stand up in court.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 2, United 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mauricio Cienfuegos scored on a free kick with  
six seconds remaining in regulation, lifting Los Angeles over D.C. 
United 2-1 Saturday night and extending the Galaxy's winning streak 
to a season-high three games. 
</P>
<P>
	United defender Geoff Aunger pulled down the Galaxy's Simon  
Elliott outside the top left corner of the penalty area, setting up 
the decisive kick from 19 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the restart could be attempted, a D.C. player kicked the  
ball in an attempt to run out the clock. Referee Baojie Sun, a 
Chinese official working the game as part of an exchange program, 
stopped the clock with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Cienfuegos, who earlier assisted on Carlos Hermosillo's goal,  
curled the game's final shot inside the near post beyond the reach 
of goalie Tom Presthus' outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy (8-6) snapped a three-game losing streak to the  
United. Los Angeles, which was 13-3 on the road last year, improved 
to 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The United (10-5) lost its second in a row.  
</P>
<P>
	D.C. had erased a 1-0 deficit in the 83rd minute, when Ben  
Kamler leaped and headed Ben Olsen's corner kick past goalie Kevin 
Hartman, ruining his bid for a league-leading seventh shutout and 
ending a United goal-free streak of 197 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermosillo, who has tallied in each of his two starts, scored  
his second goal of the year for a 1-0 Los Angeles lead in the 25th 
minute. He cut through the right side of the penalty area to 
convert Cienfuegos' rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cienfuegos started the chance by working a give-and-go with Rod  
Myers at the top of the box. Cienfuegos' shot from 10 feet on the 
left side was blocked by Presthus, but the rebound bounced right to 
Hermosillo.

<HEADLINE> Exhausted Seminoles Come Up Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Aching, wounded and exhausted, Florida State  
put a pitcher who is awaiting surgery for a torn knee ligament on 
the mound and hoped for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	They almost got it.  
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat the Seminoles 6-5 in the championship game of the  
College World Series as Florida State's Kevin Cash struck out 
swinging in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in their fourth game in 64 hours -- and one day after a  
13-inning, 14-11 victory over Stanford -- the Seminoles (57-14) 
limped into the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we'd win it,'' Florida State coach Mike Martin said.  
``We're obviously disappointed, but thank God the sun is going to 
come up tomorrow. I'm going to cry sometime today and then I'm 
going golfing, and then I'm going to go to church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Blair Varnes (11-2), wearing a brace on his left knee  
that was visible under his uniform, started for Florida State and 
went into the seventh. He allowed eight hits, six runs, four walks 
and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I could have torn cartilage or something,'' Varnes  
said afterward. ``But I'm having surgery next week anyway and I 
didn't want to be old and gray and regret that I didn't pitch for 
the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he made the decision to start Varnes late Friday.  
Varnes winced occasionally and hobbled a few times off the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been begging to pitch all week,'' Varnes said. ``Friday,  
they asked me if I thought I really could pitch and I said yes, and 
they trusted me and gave me the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami reliever Michael Neu got his 16th save as he retired the  
side in the ninth to preserve the victory. Cash struck out on a 
full count to end the game and the Hurricanes won their third 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	After Miami went ahead 6-2 in the fifth, the Seminoles came  
within 6-5 in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in second,'' said right fielder Matt Diaz. ``You know  
that old saying that second place is first loser. It almost feels 
as bitter as going home last year after two rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles haven't won the title in Martin's 18 trips to  
Omaha. It looked like that might change after Florida State reached 
the finals with a dramatic victory over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Seminoles used seven pitchers to beat the Cardinal, and  
Florida State faced a Miami team that had won five of six matchups 
this season between the instate rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if we would have come out here and played bad, I would  
be leaving really, really mad,'' Martin said. ``But we played for 
it. For them to beat us in the way that they did all year long is a 
credit to them.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexican government will provide aid  
directly to victims of this week's earthquake instead of relying on 
representative groups to distribute the aid, President Ernesto 
Zedillo said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attention will be direct to each person or family  
affected,'' Zedillo said in his weekly radio address. ``It is not 
acceptable that anyone profit politically from the tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6.7-magnitude quake on Tuesday killed at least 17 people and  
injured nearly 200. More than 7,700 homes were destroyed or damaged 
in the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, as well as many colonial-era 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo said aid centers would be set up in affected cities to  
distribute relief. People living in rural areas would receive money 
to help them rebuild homes and would be given sturdier building 
materials.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of residents of a northern Mexican  
neighborhood contaminated by a silver refinery blocked access to 
the company Saturday to protest a breakdown in negotiations over 
relocating them to new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 200 and 300 people stood at three entrances outside the  
Met-Mex Penoles plant in Torreon to keep out the roughly 2,000 
workers and shut down operations, community leader Maria Dolores 
Guillen said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest proceeded peacefully, with no sign of police  
intervention, Guillen said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was available to comment at Met-Mex Penoles' offices in  
Mexico City Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Children living near the plant 500 miles north of Mexico City  
have been shown to have abnormally high levels of lead in their 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the government announced a plan to order people to leave  
a 20-block area surrounding the plant, demolish 393 homes, bury 
lead-tainted soil under asphalt and establish a $6 million fund to 
help sick children. It would be the largest environmental cleanup 
in Mexico's history.

	SAN CRISTOBAL, Mexico (AP) -- A U.S. man, his daughter and  
another girl drowned when they were pulled into a strong Pacific 
Ocean current in southern Mexico, authorities said Saturday.

<P>
	A fourth American, 19-year-old John Weems, was missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Lynn Sloan, 37, and his 11-year-old daughter Carla, both of  
Lufkin, Texas, died Friday while swimming at Playa Linda in the 
Chiapas port city of Madero, port Capt. Tomas Camposeco Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The third victim, 9-year-old Joy Love Murphy, was from Alabama  
though authorities did not specify her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Army troops searched Saturday for Weems, whose hometown was not  
available. 
</P>

	State justice officials said the Americans were part of a  
Baptist missionary group that had been in Chiapas for several 
months.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico's average hotel  
occupancy rate increased 10 percent to 78.4 percent in April, up 
from 70.8 percent one year ago, the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel registrations increased to 149,000 in April, a 5 percent  
increase over April 1998, tourism director Jorge Davila announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Caribbean territory has had 1.4 million hotel  
registrations so far this year, a 4 percent increase over the first 
four months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rican government has identified tourism as a key  
industry in its push to encourage employment in the service sector, 
as jobs in the island's largest sector, manufacturing, continue to 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes the week other islanders at the Caribbean Hotel  
Association's conference in the Bahamas projected a gloomy outlook, 
saying fewer visitors were coming to the Caribbean from North 
America and Europe.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian state oil company  
announced it would modernize its decaying ships and docks within 
the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Petrobras would renovate 62 vessels used for  
offshore drilling and build 21 new ships between 2000 and 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the National Development Bank will offer a  
special credit line to pay for the reforms, the Rio daily Jornal do 
Brasil reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The naval modernization comes in the wake of the end of the  
state oil company's 46-year-old monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Brazil's National Oil Agency auctioned off  
exploration rights for 12 natural gas and oil fields to the world's 
top multinational oil companies, including Texaco, Shell, Mobil and 
Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Petrobras produces 1.2 million barrels of oil per day, or  
about 65 percent of what Brazilians consume -- mostly from offshore 
fields.

<HEADLINE> Akin Wins National Wrestling Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- On a day when national champions were winning as  
expected, perennial runner-up Eric Akin finally picked up a major 
victory, beating top seed Lou Rosselli on Saturday night at the 
U.S. World Team Freestyle Wrestling Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	A career bridesmaid, the 28-year-old Overland Park, Kan.  
resident, was the only wrestler to defeat a national champ, beating 
Rosselli 2-1 and 5-2 to win the best-of-3 match at the 119-pound 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other wrestlers won championships and will represent the  
United States at the Pan American Games in August and the World 
Championships in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin was the only winner to make it through Friday's grueling  
mini-tournament and defeat a national champion. Akin's win came 
against an opponent, Rosselli, who beat him in the finals of the 
1996 Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a real heartbreaker,'' Akin said of that loss. ``But  
it probably kept me in the sport the last four years which was a 
positive thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akin's win on Saturday was one day removed from a victory over  
Sammie Henson, who beat Akin in the finals of the 1994 NCAA 
tournament and in the finals at last year's world team trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been the `close kid' too many times,'' Akin said. ``Now  
all these guys are going to be gunning for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akin's first win against Rosselli on Saturday, came on a  
two-point move with just one second left in overtime. The referees 
had to review a videotape after the match to make sure the move 
occurred before the buzzer. Akin suffered a cut over his left 
eyebrow midway through the second period of the second match, but 
hung on to win 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin aside, there were few surprises Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cary Kolat, second at the world championships in 1997 and third  
last year at 138.75 pounds, needed all three matches to beat 
relative unknown Bill Zadick. Kolat won 3-1, 1-3, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolat won the bronze medal last year at the world championships,  
but felt cheated out of possible gold when a second-round win over 
a Bulgarian wrestler was overturned. The Bulgarian went on to win 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to come back with more fire and more heart,''  
Kolat said. ``This year I want to make sure I put enough points up 
that they can't take it away from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Americans joined Kolat as repeat winners at this  
tournament, for a U.S. team that will have a new look. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln McIlravy, third at last year's world's, beat Pat Santoro  
4-0 and 7-6 to win at 152. At 187.25 pounds, 1997 world champ Les 
Gutches won 4-2 and 2-1 over Charles Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the U.S. team were Terry Brands (127.75); Joe  
Williams (167.5); Dominic Black (213.75); and Stephen Neal (286). 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't compete at the world championships last year,  
Brands was a world champ in 1993 and 1995. Black, Williams and Neal 
are relative newcomers to international wrestling.

<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Ken Hitchcock doesn't look it, but he's  
extremely nervous before games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaches are like ducks,'' the colorful Dallas Stars coach  
said. ``Calm on top, but paddling underneath. Believe me, there's a 
lot of leg movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, patient and introspective with the media, said he  
would relax before Saturday night's Game 6 of the Stanley Cup 
finals by watching a sports event on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God the U.S. Open is on,'' he said, ``I'd be a nut  
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A REAL CUT-UP:* The media has grabbed hold of all the talk  
about ``dirty'' play between the teams in the Stanley Cup finals 
and given it a good ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, who has accused the Stars of  
using their sticks like hatchets, among other things, was ready to 
parry with the media again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he thought about all the fuss, including a photo  
of Sabres captain Mike Peca ``grimacing,'' Ruff responded: ``I 
think they're trying to motivate us again. They took 48 pictures 
and caught him with a grimace, and used that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGNING ON:* Sign in the Dallas Stars' locker room before  
Saturday night's Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals: 
</P>
<P>
	``We will either find a way, or make a way.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STARTLING STAT:* The defenses have been great in the finals,  
starting with goaltender Dominik Hasek of Buffalo and Ed Belfour of 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the goalie with the best save percentage in the playoffs  
isn't in the finals. He's Philadelphia's John Vanbiesbrouck, with a 
.938 percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was at .937 and Belfour at .925 prior to Saturday night's  
game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF THE TIMES:* The Buffalo Sabres are in the prayers of  
their fans, and it's visible. A sign on a road near the Marine 
Midland Arena: 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, Lord Stanley, hear our prayer. For too many years, our  
CUPboard's been bare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are seeking their first Stanley Cup. They reached the  
finals only once in their history, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW DEPTHS:* The Dallas Stars would break new ground by winning  
the Stanley Cup. Not only will they bring a championship to the 
franchise for the first time, but they would become the 
southernmost team in the league to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche have that distinction now.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUFF'S OPTION:* Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said his team had a  
``modified'' optional skate Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Modified?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' he said, ``some guys had an option and some guys  
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KEANE OBSERVATION:* Dallas' Mike Keane on the lack of scoring  
in the finals, the lowest goal total since 1947: 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fan would like to see a 20-19 game, but you're not going  
to see that. If we won 1-0, I'd be happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TWO SCREAMERS:* Coaches Lindy Ruff of Buffalo and Ken Hitchcock  
of Dallas have become favorites of the media at the Stanley Cup 
finals with their quick and ready wit. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one moment between them, though, where neither felt  
like being humorous. That happened at the end of Game 5 in Dallas 
Thursday night when a lot of animosity surfaced between the teams 
after a bitterly-fought contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what it was all about,'' Ruff said. ``Hitch came  
off the bench screaming. I decided to scream back. Then he screamed 
back at me and I screamed back at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him if he wanted some water, and he said, `No.' ``  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WARMING UP:* Even though Dallas isn't what is considered a  
hockey hotbed, Stars forward Mike Modano says fans ``have come 
around'' since the team moved from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it was only a matter of time,'' Modano said of selling  
the sport in a warm-weather site. ``A lot of northerners have moved 
down (and) we have a lot of fans who have grown to love the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love the Cowboys there, and they love winners.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have sold out 49 straight games.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Fans Look for Finals Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Somebody forgot to tell Spurs fans that the  
celebrating is supposed to wait until the series is officially 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	From their looks early Saturday, it appeared that the Spurs  
already had won their first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
	The euphoria over Game 2 lasted past midnight in this  
small-market city, with horn-honking fans descending on downtown 
and waving brooms out their car windows. It might have been the 
first 1 a.m. traffic jam in San Antonio's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those fans were undoubtedly among the nearly 40,000  
chanting ``Sweep, Sweep'' during the fourth quarter of San 
Antonio's 80-67 victory over the New York Knicks Friday night, and 
none of them expect the series to return here for Games 6 or 7. 
</P>
<P>
	After what they've saw in the first two games, it's hard to  
blame them. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not so much that the Spurs have dominated New York, it's  
more that the Knicks simply appear to be too small, too injured and 
too spent to put up a decent fight against an opponent that hasn't 
lost in more than five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing the Knicks is not easy,'' David Robinson said. ``They  
are very explosive. Those guys run all over the place, they get to 
the boards extremely well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it looks like, but they're making us work  
very hard. They're not quitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor should the Knicks be expected to quit when the series shifts  
to Madison Square Garden for Game 3 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two teams in NBA history have come back from 2-0 deficits  
to win the finals, and no team ever has come back after trailing 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's not enough motivation for the Knicks, perhaps coach  
Jeff Van Gundy found some nugget of overconfidence in the postgame 
quote sheets he picked up on his way out of the Alamodome Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampling of what the Spurs had to say:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Avery Johnson: ``Being up 2-0 and feeling like we are one of  
the best road teams in the NBA, we feel like we're in a good 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Steve Kerr: ``We haven't lost in the playoffs on the road yet,  
either, and this is the best team we've played in the playoffs. So, 
it's not going to be easy, but we like our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tim Duncan: ``We know what we have to do -- get two more.  
However we get it, we're not thinking sweep. We never think sweep. 
We think one game at a time, no matter how cliche that sounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One obstacle the Spurs will be facing is the Knicks' knack for  
playing some of their best basketball when their circumstances seem 
most dire. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, things looked bleak for the Knicks after  
they failed to close out the Heat in Game 4 and had to go to Miami 
for Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Eastern Conference finals, the Knicks were facing the  
prospect of a 3-2 deficit when they went to Indianapolis for Game 5 
and pulled out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, there were numerous times when New  
York turned it up a notch just when things appeared hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely are upset with ourselves,'' New York's Marcus  
Camby said. ``We feel we could have came out here and got this 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the NBA went to a 2-3-2 format for the finals in 1985, no  
home team has won all three middle games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will have to deal with the fact that San Antonio has  
played better on the road during the postseason than it has at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three rounds of the playoffs, San Antonio averaged  
96.2 points per game on the road and won by an average of 13.4 
points. At home, the Spurs average 84.4 points and a margin of 
victory of 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that we play great on the road and knowing that we  
haven't lost two in a row in however long, we still have to take it 
one game at a time,'' San Antonio's Mario Elie said. ``The Knicks, 
they have a great team and a lot of offense. They come at you hard. 
Just a couple of plays here and there and they could easily tie 
this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Knicks are to stand any chance, they'll need to get  
better offensive production. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell is shooting only 37 percent, but that's a whole  
lot better than Larry Johnson (20 percent), Chris Childs (19 
percent) and Chris Dudley (0 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all its front line injuries, New York has outrebounded  
San Antonio in both games but has been hurt by its inability to get 
to the foul line. The Spurs have attempted 66 free throws in the 
series to the Knicks' 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan has been the main force for the Spurs, scoring 33 in Game  
1 and 25 in Game 2 and combining with Robinson on defense to form a 
shot-blocking tandem that no team has solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our effort level, our mental state, is fine,'' Van Gundy said.  
``We need to be able to score the ball a little better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want them thinking about being down 2-0 and we have to  
win four of the next five games. We need to think about how we're 
going to win Monday night, that's it. We don't have to win four 
games Monday, we just have to try to win one.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors Perform Fetal Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sleeping in his mother's cradled arms,  
Neal Borkowski appears to be a typical baby, developing like most 
five-week-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	But little Neal may owe his normalcy -- and his life -- to an  
amazing procedure performed on him even before his birth. 
</P>
<P>
	In what is believed to be a surgical first, doctors opened his  
mother's uterus two months before Neal was born and performed 
surgery to relieve a buildup of water on the brain, a condition 
that leaves one in every 2,000 babies severely brain-damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons Dr. Joseph Bruner and Dr. Noel Tulipan said Friday at  
Vanderbilt University Medical Center they have used the procedure 
49 times over the past two years to repair spina bifida lesions in 
the womb. But they said the March 2 surgery was the first time the 
procedure was used on the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	They acknowledge they won't know for six months to a year --  
until they can measure Borkowski's IQ -- whether he suffered any 
serious brain damage from the condition, known as congenital 
hydrocephalus. But the fact that he was born May 12 without excess 
fluid on the brain makes the surgery a success, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have to hedge our bets as to how he'll do over the  
long run,'' Tulipan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's mother, Susan Borkowski of Knoxville, Tenn., said she  
learned during a routine ultrasound that her 20-week-old fetus had 
hydrocephalus. 
</P>
<P>
	Having lost a brother to hydrocephalus shortly after his birth,  
going ahead with the experimental surgery ``wasn't really a 
decision,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the procedure, Mrs. Borkowski's uterus was opened by Bruner  
before Tulipan made an incision in the fetus' skull and placed a 
shunt, or small tube, in the fluid space of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposite end of the shunt was hooked to a small valve  
controlling the flow of fluid. The valve was connected to another 
long, thin tube that was tunneled out through the fetus' skin 
between the shoulder blades, and the fluid drained into the 
amniotic fluid in Mrs. Borkowski's uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal was delivered by Caesarean section five weeks early,  
weighing 4 pounds, 7 ounces. A second surgery was performed to 
exchange the tube for a shunt draining the fluid into his abdominal 
cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Left untreated, the child most likely would have been born with  
a gigantic head filled with fluid and almost no brain function, 
Tulipan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Children with hydrocephalus ``remain like infants all their  
lives, and they don't live longer than 10 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, attempts were made to perform similar fetal  
surgeries through an endoscope inserted into the uterus. But the 
results were ``abysmal,'' with shunts becoming infected, blocked or 
falling out, Tulipan said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen years ago, doctors at University of California  
San Francisco placed shunts into animal fetuses with hydrocephalus, 
and studied babies with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But the researchers found the animal procedure a failure, and  
``there was a gentlemen's agreement not to do them'' on babies 
among doctors nationwide, said UCSF spokeswoman Janet Basu. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulipan said the advantage to opening the uterus gives them the  
ability to see where the shunt is placed, hopefully avoiding the 
previous complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if their baby has suffered some brain damage, the child's  
parents say they're simply thrilled he's still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dream,'' said Neal's father, John Borkowski.

<HEADLINE> New Yorker Elie Helps San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have played well away  
from the Alamodome all season. Their biggest road test will come 
when the NBA Finals move to Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs defeated the cold-shooting New York Knicks 80-67  
Friday night. San Antonio's 12th straight playoff victory the Spurs 
a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-7 series, which continues Monday in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that we play great on the road and knowing that we  
haven't lost two games in a row in however long, we still have to 
take it one game at a time,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio's six-game road winning streak in the playoffs is  
the second-longest in one postseason run in NBA history. The 
longest was seven by Houston in 1995, the year the Rockets won a 
championship by sweeping Orlando in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have beaten their opponents by an average of 13.4  
points on the road during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't lost on the road yet, but we also haven't played in  
Madison Square Garden yet, either,'' San Antonio guard Steve Kerr 
said. ``It's a tough place to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio took advantage of the nearly 40,000 screaming fans  
at the first two games in the Alamodome. As the contest came to a 
close Friday night, the rowdy crowd shouted, ``Sweep, sweep, 
sweep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about this victory,'' point guard Avery Johnson  
said. ``We're not going to take our shirts off, but we are excited 
about it. We know we can play a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell of the Knicks said New York needs to simply  
concentrate on winning the first game at the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got to get one,'' he said. ``I think we just need to  
say `Let's start with the first one at home.' We need to work on 
getting that one and then build on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, a native New Yorker, knows the feeling of playing for a  
championship against the Knicks on their home court. He was with 
the Rockets when Houston faced New York in the NBA Finals in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks won two out of three at the Garden in that series,  
but the Rockets ended up winning the title in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take these guys lightly,'' Elie said. ``That's a  
hell of ball club down there. They never give up.''

press, who reported on her deals with Iran, Central America and the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining her family's steel toolmaking company when she was  
young, Danieli rose from administration and sales to eventually 
become chairman and managing director in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Under her direction, the family business expanded to include  
bases in the United States and Italy as well as in Buttrio, near 
Udine. It also began selling completely furnished steel plants.

	PARIS (AP) -- Henri d'Orleans, the Count of Paris and pretender  
to the French throne, died Saturday at the age of 90, family 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
	The count, whose full name was Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie  
Louis-Philippe d'Orleans, was a direct descendant of 
Louis-Phillipe, the last king of France who abdicated in 1848. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jacques Chirac called him a ``man of duty'' who ``all  
his life remained loyal to the heritage of the royal family of 
France, while still respecting the institutions of the Republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He accepted as natural the obligation he had to incarnate a  
tradition that belongs to our history,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Touts Seattle's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Bringing his White House campaign to Northwest  
high-tech country, Vice President Al Gore tried a little flattery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future is being born here,'' he told 500 supporters at a  
campaign event. 
</P>
<P>
	Although workers in California's ``Silicon Valley'' or North  
Carolina's ``Research Triangle'' might take issue, Gore told the 
locals here ``Of course this area is the world center'' of the 
technological innovation that can sustain the nation's economy into 
the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used Northwest-centric issues of trade and technology to  
kick off his presidential campaign in a region he declares part of 
his formula for success in the 2000 balloting. He planned to fly on 
to Philadelphia today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore got a thunderous reception Friday at an outdoor Town  
Hall-style gathering at the Seattle Center, with the Space Needle 
and sun-dappled trees providing the early evening backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to many of the themes he's used in the opening days  
of his presidential race -- ``family and faith,'' better schools, 
safer streets, and a crusade against guns and school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But he tailored many of his comments -- and the scripted  
questions and answers at the forum -- to ways to foster the 
high-tech industries, international trade and the information 
technology that he sees as crucial to sustaining the nation's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed a five-point plan to enhance technology and trade:  
new international trade agreements, additional tax credits for 
high-tech companies and startup businesses, a doubling of federal 
investment in information technology over the next five years, 
creation of 20 university centers to integrate biomedical research 
and new information technology, and tax exemptions for 
``e-commerce'' businesses that offer goods and services in 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores had scripted conversations with a handful of high-tech  
entrepreneurs and trade leaders. Gore even used two disruptive 
events -- heckling by an anti-whaling group and a very loud small 
airplane that drowned out his remarks -- to bring the audience's 
attention back to his theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quieter airplanes! Quieter demonstrations!'' he yelled,  
quickly returning to his contention that ingenuity and new 
technology can fix just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Political scientist James Thurber, a presidential scholar at  
American University and a part-time Washington state resident, said 
Gore's appeal seems custom-made for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Washington's trade dependence, the state ``is a  
center for the high-tech industry and he has a natural constituency 
for his ideas on `livability' and the environment,'' Thurber said. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was Gore's eighth to the state since the last  
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, also has  
Washington on his calendar. Republican congresswoman Jennifer Dunn, 
Bush's state chairwoman, said her candidate will attend events on 
July 8. Another GOP contender, Elizabeth Dole, plans a fund-raising 
visit later this month.

<HEADLINE> Cops Say Fired Worker Opened Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Illness had kept Carol Kepner away from  
her job at Norristown State Hospital for weeks, and she returned 
only Monday to her work as a nurse manager. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, she was dead -- gunned down, police say, by a  
disgruntled worker after being held hostage for nearly 48 hours 
along with another employee, who was also shot but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame she wasn't out for another week,'' said Julie  
Beyers, who works at a tavern where Kepner ate lunch almost every 
day. ``She would have missed all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kepner, 54, was killed Friday at the end of a two-day standoff  
between police and fired nurse Dennis Czajkowski, who strode onto 
the grounds to take her and fellow supervisor Maria Jordan hostage 
before demanding an investigation into his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the standoff wore on and Czajkowski's demands became more  
erratic, police decided to get a view of the hostages by smashing a 
hospital window. As they did, Czajkowski opened fire on the two 
women, fatally wounding Kepner, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jordan, 37, who had also been shot twice earlier, was listed  
in fair condition at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania. Doctors said she would probably leave within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski, 40, was being treated for various head and torso  
injuries. The 11-year hospital employee was listed in fair 
condition, and is expected to be arraigned today on a range of 
charges including charges of first-, second-, and third-degree 
murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced hostage negotiators differed on the police decision  
to smash the window. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Police Department negotiator Frank A. Bolz said  
the maneuver drove Czajkowski ``into a panic situation,'' which 
authorities try to avoid. But he said the move was ``not 
inappropriate,'' given the concerns about the hostages' safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Roger Bell, a University of Louisville psychiatry professor  
who has studied hostage situations, said Czajkowski's fatigue 
indicated he would be ``more agitated and easily angered'' as the 
crisis continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what that tells you is that your actions need to be less  
obtrusive,'' he said.

<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers placed Mark Clark on  
the 15-day disabled list Saturday with soreness in his right elbow. 
</P>

	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- On this Father's Day, Ken Schrader will be  
thinking about a truck -- a tow truck! 
</P>
<P>
	And it has nothing to do with anything that might happen Sunday  
at Pocono International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle in question is his late father's 1955 Ford, which  
Schrader rediscovered a few years ago in a Midwest salvage yard. 
Schrader, originally from Fenton, Mo., had been looking for the 
truck for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daddy got rid of that tow truck a long time ago,'' Schrader  
said. ``Since I had so many great memories of the times I spent 
with my father in that tow truck, I decided to track it down and 
get it back in the Schrader family. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader's father, Bill, who died in 1994, left an impression on  
his son that old was good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, I couldn't afford to own a new car, and I was  
forced to drive all these beat up old cars, Schrader said. ``Now, I 
choose to drive old cars and tinker on them in my free time.''

	LABONTE FASTEST: Two-time Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte  
will extend the NASCAR record for consecutive starts to 617. But it

</P>
<P>
	Labonte posted the fastest speed in the second day of qualifying  
for the race, turning a lap Saturday at 167.885 mph. He will start 
33rd Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of this race in 1995, Labonte was one of nine drivers  
who attempted to qualify Saturday. Derrike Cope, Loy Allen and Hut 
Stricklin didn't make the 43-car field.

	KIMMEL WINS: Defending ARCA champion Frank Kimmel overcame a  
gearbox problem Saturday to win the Pocono 200. The victory was the 
first this year for the 37-year-old driver from Jeffersonville, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost fourth gear in his Chevrolet about a quarter of the way  
through the 80-lap event at Pocono International Raceway. But he 
kept his rpms as low as possible, and made it to the end -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It began jumping around and shaking,'' he said. ``It was quiet  
for the last 20 laps. Then, I saw the white flag, and it went bang. 
But I made it back, and I'm tickled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the 15th of Kimmel's career.  
</P>
<P>
	Second was Matt Hutter, followed by points leader Bill Baird.  
Both also were in Chevys.

	PIT STOPS: Starting at or near the front is advantageous at  
Pocono International Raceway. The winner has come from the first 
two rows in 24 of 42 Pocono races. ... Although Ken Schrader is 
winless on the circuit since 1991, he is the best qualifier ever at 
Pocono with five poles -- the most recent in 1995. ... Hendrick 
Motorsports leads all teams in victories at Pocono with eight. Jeff 
Gordon and the late Tim Richmond won three times apiece for 
Hendrick, and Geoff Bodine and Terry Labonte once each. ... No one 
has won consecutively at the track since June 1987, when Richmond 
got the last of his three straight victories. ... There will be six 
sets of siblings in the field Sunday for the Pennsylvania 500. They 
are Geoff and Brett Bodine, Ward and Jeff Burton, David and Jeff 
Green, Terry and Bobby Labonte, Rusty and Kenny Wallace, and 
Darrell and Michael Waltrip.

<HEADLINE> Hale in As BYU's Athletic Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Rondo Fehlberg abruptly stepped down  
Friday as Brigham Young's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Fehlberg was replaced by associate athletic director Val Hale,  
it was announced during an afternoon news conference. Both 
administrators were cagey about the nature of Fehlberg's departure, 
refusing to call it a firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a great deal of calm about my decision,'' Fehlberg  
said. ``I don't know if that's because of the other interests I 
will pursue, or ... the seriousness of my situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not elaborate when pressed and did not immediately  
return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fehlberg's four-year tenure as athletic director in Provo was  
undeniably rocky. The career lawyer and oil company executive was 
hired in 1995 with no prior experience in athletic administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years later, he fired men's basketball coach Roger  
Reid during the Cougars' one-victory 1996-97 season. His 
hand-picked successor, Steve Cleveland, led BYU to a 12-16 record 
last season.

	Russia Nixes Kosovo Rebuild Program  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Russia blocked an attempt by the world's  
seven richest countries to exclude Yugoslavia, while it is still 
run by President Slobodan Milosevic, from receiving aid under a 
huge reconstruction program for Kosovo and its Balkan neighbors. 
Russian Prime Minister Serge Stepashin is quoted as telling fellow 
leaders at a summit here that all Serbs should not pay for their 
leader's misdeeds. However, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger 
says he can't imagine NATO allies rebuilding a country headed by a 
dictator and indicted war criminal.

</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb troops accelerated their  
pullout from Kosovo today and NATO said the soldiers may be gone 
ahead of tomorrow's midnight deadline. Peacekeepers met with ethnic 
Albanian rebels in an attempt to prevent a new reign of terror. On 
the streets of Pristina, the Kosovo capital, the number of NATO 
security checkpoints grew noticeably. Mehmet Hajrizi, a top Kosovo 
Liberation Army leader, said today that the rebel group intends to 
``transform itself into a security force for Kosovo,'' an 
unpalatable prospect to the province's remaining Serbs.

	Clinton Pushes for Strong Gun Laws

<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton challenged lawmakers  
in Washington to ``learn from the lessons of Littleton'' and mark 
the two-month anniversary of the Colorado school shooting by 
undoing their vote against gun control. His weekly radio address 
aimed to stir public anger over what Clinton said was a 
congressional majority taking its orders from the National Rifle 
Association. To the NRA, he said, ``I wish you would help us. But 
we've overcome your scare tactics and strong-arm pressure before.'' 
The House voted 280-147 yesterday to defeat the gun-control bill.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister received a warm  
welcome today in Jordan, the first visit to the kingdom by a 
high-ranking Iranian official in three decades. Kamal Kharrazi 
immediately went into talks with his Jordanian counterpart. A 
meeting with King Abdullah II is scheduled for tomorrow. Officials 
said the talks will focus on ways to boost economic cooperation 
through increased trade and joint ventures. But political ties are 
likely to remain bumpy because the Islamic government in Tehran is 
a fiery critic of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans pressed their case  
today for a reorganization of the Energy Department in response to 
the continuing controversy over the safeguarding of America's 
nuclear secrets. Using the weekly GOP radio address, Sen. Jon Kyl, 
R-Ariz., accused the Clinton administration of taking ``half 
measures'' in dealing with security at nuclear weapons 
laboratories. Kyl is one of three GOP senators who have proposed 
putting nuclear weapons programs under a largely autonomous agency 
within the Energy Department -- an idea also urged this week by a 
panel of intelligence experts advising the president.

howling furies with QuikScat, a satellite being launched this 
weekend on a nearly $100 million mission to study the global dance 
of wind and water. Its science instrument, dubbed SeaWinds, is an 
antenna that will radiate microwave pulses and gather the return 
signals, daily collecting a continuous 1,100-mile-wide band that 
will amount to 400,000 measurements over 90 percent of Earth's

<HEADLINE> Father's Day Founder Left Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Dads getting new ties on Sunday, or just  
spending the day kicking back, owe a debt to the mother of Father's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Sonora Smart Dodd, the third Sunday of each June might  
be just another day for lawn-mowing and endless to-do lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd was just 16 when her own father, Civil War veteran William  
Jackson Smart, lost his wife in childbirth and was left to raise 
their six children alone in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1909, when she was 27, she listened to a Sunday sermon about  
Mother's Day and wondered why there was no corresponding day for 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd believed the nation didn't show enough respect to fathers,  
citing popular songs of the day such as ``Father, Dear Father, Come 
Home with Me Now'' and ``Everybody Works but Father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the sermon set her on a campaign for a Father's Day  
observance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd ``was a real promoter and had lots of charm,'' said Don  
Ball, whose family opened a funeral home with the Dodds in the 
1930s that is still in business today. ``She was so well-known 
around town as a poet, a scribe and a sculptor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She promoted Father's Day ``out of love for her father,''  
recalled Ball, 72, who knew Dodd from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about 97 million Father's Day cards are purchased  
annually in the United States, according to the Greeting Card 
Association, an industry group. It is the fifth-largest 
card-sending occasion, following Christmas, Valentine's Day, 
Mother's Day and Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd's campaign was an uphill struggle at first.  
</P>
<P>
	``One group of men conventioneers laughed and said they didn't  
want a Father's Day,'' according to a 1965 article in The 
Spokesman-Review. ``A national fishing day would be better, they 
told her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dodd persuaded the Spokane Ministerial Association and local  
YMCA to pass a resolution in support of Father's Day, and the first 
local observance was held June 19, 1910. Her effort is commemorated 
on a plaque outside the downtown Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Father's Day was community-oriented.  
</P>
<P>
	``The original Father's Day Association ... and groups of  
Spokane women prepared home dinners, gathered roses for sacred 
commemoration and made gifts for shut-in fathers,'' Dodd said in a 
1965 speech for dedication of the YMCA plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	Her idea spread to other cities, and celebrities including  
orator William Jennings Bryan joined the campaign for a national 
observance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Father's and Mother's days rest substantially upon the  
same commandment, `Honor thy father and thy mother,''' wrote Bryan, 
a three-time presidential hopeful, in a 1910 letter to Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
	President Woodrow Wilson added his support, and Congress passed  
a resolution proclaiming a Father's Day in 1914. It became a 
national holiday when President Richard Nixon signed a declaration 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother's Day first became an official holiday in West Virginia  
in 1910, though there had been unofficial observances before that. 
Congress followed in 1914 with a declaration that was signed by 
President Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd died in 1978, at the age of 96.

<HEADLINE> Jury Out on Anti-Bilingual Ed. Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Shrieking with laughter, the children  
race around the playing field, gleefully soaking classmates and 
teachers alike as the green grass beneath their feet takes on a 
slick patina of mud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mas agua!'' they yell. More water!  
</P>
<P>
	They're barely recognizable as the crisply dressed youngsters  
who filed into class last fall for their first year under 
Proposition 227, California's anti-bilingual education law. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sherman Oaks Elementary ends the year with its traditional  
water fight, the children of Sandra Villarreal's class have reason 
to celebrate: They're passing first grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict's still out on Proposition 227.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably too early to tell,'' says state schools chief  
Delaine Eastin. ``I'm sure it's safe to say those at either 
extreme, those who predicted extreme failure and disasters or those 
who predicted complete success and total transformation, may be 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 227, which passed in June 1998, junked California's  
30-year-old system of bilingual education and replaced it with a 
plan that requires one year of English immersion. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, that wasn't the last word on bilingual  
education. 
</P>
<P>
	First, some school districts interpreted instructions about  
teaching ``nearly all'' in English to mean it was OK to use Spanish 
30 percent of the time. Then, thousands of parents exercised a 
loophole allowing them to return their children to bilingual 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many bilingual classes were scrapped, leading to  
the third development -- reports by teachers that English-immersion 
students in Southern California, home to most of the state's old 
bilingual programs, were learning to read and even write. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the district of Oceanside, near San Diego, released  
test scores showing a marked improvement. Last year, second graders 
with limited English ability scored in the 12th percentile, meaning 
they scored as well or better than only 12 percent of the national 
sample. This year's second-graders were in the 24th percentile. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Unz, software millionaire and coauthor of Proposition 227,  
says Oceanside is an excellent benchmark because all bilingual 
education was eliminated for the more than 4,000 limited-English 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of any education reform anyone's ever performed  
that has produced results that quickly,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One warm morning at Sherman Oaks, 6-year-old Trana shakes with  
indignant sobs as he blurts out his tale of recess woe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pushed me. And I wasn't teasing,'' he declares, his English  
coming readily even though Vietnamese is his first language. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a spelling test, Trana is at a loss, chewing on his  
pencil and tapping a Superhero sneaker on the floor before 
scrawling ``wan'' for ``when,'' and ``bgoib'' for ``drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trana is in English immersion because the school offers  
bilingual education only in Spanish. (According to the state 
Education Department, only 30 percent of limited-English speakers 
were ever in full bilingual education.) 
</P>
<P>
	Bilingual experts say students like Trana are an example of  
what's wrong with English immersion; students pick up ``playground 
English,'' but miss what's happening in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz asserts that teaching students like Trana in their first  
language handicaps them. 
</P>
<P>
	``First-graders generally aren't that great at spelling,'' he  
says. ``I think, on the other hand, if he were only taught spelling 
in (his first language), which would be the case in the bilingual 
program, it would be even harder for him to learn English two years 
down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trana is doing much better than last year, and teacher Jolynn  
Linn thinks he'll catch up by second or third grade. Proposition 
227 says pupils should learn English in one year, but Unz says 
districts have discretion if they need longer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The carefully penciled numbers on Tanya's math test sum up her  
year in Ms. Villarreal's class, which by parental demand returned 
to a dual immersion program that aims to have children speaking and 
writing English as well as Spanish by fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanya, who spent kindergarten in an English-speaking classroom,  
couldn't add 8 plus 5 in September or manage to write more than a 
few letters when sentences were dictated. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, she got all but two of the 16 math questions right  
and a nearly perfect score when Ms. Villarreal dictated this 
passage in Spanish: ``The train's about to arrive. It's going to 
stop here. We're going to climb on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has just taken off,'' Ms. Villarreal says.  
</P>
<P>
	On the last day of school, the neat hair-dos and shiny shoes of  
autumn have been replaced by cowlicks and flip-flops; the children 
who sat wide-eyed and silent last fall, straining to follow the 
unfamiliar English, now chatter wildly. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, after a glorious water fight, in which teachers, who  
make the rules, get Super-Soakers and children get pint-sized water 
pistols, the youngsters trail out to their parents' cars and head 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Next fall, they'll be back as the struggle to teach California  
schoolchildren English continues, one classroom at a time.

<HEADLINE> Turin Wins 2006 Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The IOC delivered a massive snub to  
Switzerland -- and the Swiss official who blew the whistle on 
Olympic corruption -- when it selected Italy as the host for the 
2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A backlash associated with the Olympics' worst scandal helped  
the city of Turin upset the favored Swiss town of Sion in 
Saturday's vote by the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more surprising than the result was the margin of Turin's  
victory. The Italians won 53-36, a stunning defeat for a Swiss bid 
that was considered the front-runner all along. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote -- the first selection of an Olympic host city since the  
Salt Lake City bribery scandal -- immediately produced anger, 
bitterness and recrimination by the Swiss toward the Swiss-based 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss officials accused IOC members of basing their choice on  
political motives that had nothing to do with the quality of the 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference in votes was grotesque, ridiculous,'' the Swiss  
economic minister, Pascal Couchepin, said. ``It makes one question 
the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Swiss IOC member Denis Oswald: ``Sion wasn't the loser,  
Sion was a victim. Today, the IOC was the loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sion clearly paid the price of resentment toward Marc Hodler,  
the Swiss IOC executive board member who kick-started the scandal 
in December with allegations of endemic Olympic corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was not about sports or organizing the Olympic  
Games,'' said Jean-Loup Chappelet, Sion's technical director. ``It 
was just because they don't like Marc Hodler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler suggested he was a pawn in a backlash fomented by Sion's  
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``That argument was used with the members by our opponents,'' he  
said. ``But that was not the only thing. It was against 
Switzerland, that the Swiss have too much influence on the IOC ... 
and therefore Switzerland needs a backlash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They say that somebody must be at fault, that somebody has to  
be blamed,'' Hodler said. ``I take the blame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an odd twist, when Turin officials went up to the head table  
to accept congratulations, bid leader Evelina Christillin wound up 
sitting next to Hodler. While she waved and gave the thumbs-up sign 
to supporters, Hodler stared straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't even look at me or say a word to me,'' Christillin  
said. ``I think he was feeling guilty for the defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hodler took the podium at the close of the day to graciously  
congratulate Turin and pledge to help the Italians make the games a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know in sports there are always more losers than winners,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feelings were especially acute in Sion, where a crowd of around  
5,000 gathered around a jumbo screen in the town's main plaza to 
watch the decision, broadcast live from Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	When Turin was announced as the winner, the stunned revelers  
stood motionless, unsure of what they had heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Quickly, shock turned to anger, directed more at the IOC than  
their Italian rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many sobbed, others jeered and whistled, shaking their fists and  
booing anytime IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch's face came on 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Some turned Sion 2006 flags into pickets, with scrawled messages  
such as ``IOC-Mafia'' and ``Scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, Turin delegates acknowledged the Hodler factor had  
hurt Sion but said it was not the primary reason for their victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you win by 17 votes, it shows we would have won all the  
same without the Hodler effect,'' bid official Marco San Pietro 
said. ``The IOC has decided that the future of the Winter Games 
will be in bigger cities rather than small mountain resorts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sion is a provincial capital of 26,000 in the heart of the Swiss  
Alps. Turin is an industrial city of 2.2 million, an hour or so 
drive from the ski venues in the Piedmont Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, which also lost attempts to land the 1976 and 2002 games,  
said it would not bid again. Turin won on its first try, taking the 
Winter Games back to Italy for the first time since 1956 in Cortina 
D'Ampezzo. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members said Turin may have benefited from a sympathy vote  
to make up for Rome's stinging loss to Athens two years ago for the 
2004 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can challenge the quality of Torino,'' executive board  
member Jacques Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other candidates in the all-European race were eliminated  
earlier when a special panel reduced the field: Helsinki, Finland; 
Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new procedures adopted as a result of the Salt Lake  
scandal, IOC members were banned from visiting the bid cities, and 
the voting process was changed to allow a ``selection college'' to 
narrow the field to two. 
</P>
<P>
	The last few days and nights before Saturday's vote were rife  
with political intrigue and furious behind-the-scenes lobbying, 
particularly by Italy's four IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Pescante said he had projected earlier in the week that  
Turin would get 52 votes -- one off the actual result -- but the 
biggest fear was not making the final two. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians said Sion was pushing for Helsinki to be chosen as  
the other finalist, considering the Finnish city an easier opponent 
than Turin. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides lobbied to get their supporters onto the 16-member  
selection panel, which included eight IOC members elected by the 
assembly. When the Italians succeeded in getting six of their 
candidates elected, Pescante said Turin's victory was assured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have never accepted the change of rules midway  
through the race,'' said Chappelet, Sion's technical director. ``It 
was not a fair process. It put the two cities who were not equal on 
an equal plane.''

<HEADLINE> States Take Steps To Boost Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Recent studies show that if schools are going to attract or keep  
good teachers, they will have to pay them more, train them well and 
make them feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Some policymakers are looking at the pool of teachers and other  
retirees: 
</P>
<P>
	--Missouri's legislature just passed a measure allowing retired  
master teachers to teach in St. Louis schools for up to two years 
without losing retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress has been asked to waive retirement earnings caps for  
teachers and school officials, so Sunbelt states can attract newly 
relocated teacher retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Troops to Teachers, which pays former service members $5,000  
for education and provides five-year grants totaling $50,000 each 
to school districts that hire them, has produced about 3,000 
teachers since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law Unmourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth W. Starr may go out with a bang, but  
the law that sent him in pursuit of President Clinton is expiring 
without so much as a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel act lapses in 10 days, unmentioned and  
unmourned, the debate about extending it over, probably before it 
began. Versions of it have been in effect for two decades. There 
have been at least 21 special prosecutors under its terms, an 
approximate count because some cases were sealed and secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's five-year investigation, expanded from a failed land  
deal to the sex scandal that led to the impeachment of the 
president, is going to keep going, though. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides that he can continue past its expiration, until  
he decides his tasks are done. That applies to four other 
independent counsels as well. Another, into influence peddling in 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development back when 
Republicans ran it, shut down early this month, after nine years in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragging investigations, disputed findings, failed prosecutions,  
and politics all figured in the consensus to led the law run out 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr himself said it should. He said it was supposed to take  
the politics out of law enforcement and prosecution, but 
``sometimes has the ironic effect of further politicizing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a point of rare agreement between Starr and the Clinton  
administration. There were Senate and House hearings earlier this 
year on rewriting and extending the law, but the outcome was 
obvious then. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were burned by the system in the Iran-Contra case,  
when the independent counsel got a former secretary of defense 
indicted and issued a report damaging then-President George Bush, 
just before the 1992 election he lost to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	That led Republicans in the then-Democratic Senate to block  
renewal of the law for 18 months. After it went back onto the 
books, with Clinton's backing, the president and his administration 
became the target of seven independent counsel investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton hasn't heard the last of them. Starr says he isn't  
sure how much longer he will need to complete the investigations 
that have embroiled the White House. His last act will be a final 
report, and that could include assertions of wrongs by the 
president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, possibly as she 
campaigns for the Senate in New York. That could hurt in 2000, as 
Bush was hurt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said there have been no decisions on what will be in his  
final report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strive mightily while providing public information, public  
education, to divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever,'' 
Starr said last week in an interview on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no separating them when a prosecutor is on a case  
involving the top officials of an administration. Starr's volumes 
of evidence against Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair, and his 
recommendations for impeachment charges, were sent to the House as 
the 1998 congressional election campaign season began. Republicans 
tried to make Clinton an issue, but it didn't work. Democrats 
gained House seats despite it all. 
</P>
<P>
	When renewal of the law was being debated, Starr said that any  
independent counsel is subject to political attack, and it would be 
better to put the responsibility for investigating allegations of 
wrongdoing by people at the top of government back in the hands of 
the Justice Department, where it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, the attorney general would be in charge, with Congress  
overseeing what's done. That's the way it worked before 1978. When 
there were outside prosecutors -- and there had been only five -- 
they were chosen by attorneys general, usually because of 
congressional and political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Nixon accepted one as the price of getting his  
attorney general confirmed by the Senate. When he fired the first 
Watergate prosecutor for pressing subpoenas against the White 
House, the uproar forced him to accept a second one, and he was on 
the path toward resigning to avoid impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton yielded to political pressure when he had the first  
Whitewater prosecutor appointed by the Justice Department; the law 
was not in effect at the time. When it was revived, a panel of 
federal judges installed Starr to take over the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest, as the cliche goes, is history. So is the law.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore made a pitch to  
Hispanic voters Saturday by stressing education as a top way to 
extend prosperity enjoyed by ``Latino business owners'' to 
unskilled workers and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Spanish on occasion, Gore promised that if he is  
elected president to use the strong economic growth and educational 
gains of the past six years to increase job opportunities for 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latino business ownership is at the highest levels, and Latino  
poverty rates are at the lowest levels,'' the leading Democratic 
candidate said during the annual conference of the National 
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ``We must 
extend this prosperity to the unskilled and the underprivileged, to 
our farms, our cities and to our immigrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people, primarily Hispanic school officials, were  
especially engaged by Gore's specific proposals, such as hiring 
more teachers, reducing class size from kindergarten to 12th grade 
and providing teacher training in computers in the high-tech age. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a national priority to reduce the Hispanic dropout rate,  
and I will not rest until we succeed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NALEO has more than 5,400 members nationwide and is designed to  
encourage Latinos to participate in U.S. government and politics. 
The Hispanic population is expected to be a strong force in the 
2000 election and has grown rapidly, especially in a few large 
states, this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics have tended to register and vote as Democrats, but  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner is fluent in 
Spanish and is believed to hold wide appeal for that group.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch returned home to Utah  
this weekend to determine whether he can rally the support and 
money to join the race for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, met at  
state GOP headquarters late Friday with party leaders, including 
Gov. Mike Leavitt and Utah's three U.S. House members. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked to potential supporters and potential donors for the  
campaign for the presidency,'' state party chairman Rob Bishop said 
Saturday. ``The conversations dealt with what would be the next 
step and what would be needed to take that step,'' he said, adding 
that several people probably wrote checks on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has not said whether he will run. But he is working  
informally with Sacramento, Calif., campaign consultant Sal Russo, 
who said: ``He's in this to win. He's doing this like he conducts 
himself in the U.S. Senate, carefully and deliberately. We're 
pretty much at the end of the evaluation period and pretty much 
everything has been positive so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hatch takes the plunge, he would be entering an already  
crowded GOP race well behind the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate Sen. Bob Smith  
of New Hampshire plans to keep his Senate seat even if he leaves 
his party to run for president under another party's banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said he may abandon the GOP because it has drifted  
from its conservative roots and run under a newly formed group. 
He'll announce his decision by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A national poll taken in May showed just 1 percent of  
Republicans backing Smith for president. 
</P>
<P>
	If he loses the presidency, Smith told the Concord Monitor, he  
won't give up the Senate seat he won as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Smith can get reelected to the Senate without the GOP's  
financial support is another matter, says Steve Duprey, chairman of 
the New Hampshire Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Party kicked in $100,000 to get Smith  
elected in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some think a third party led by Smith could fragment  
Republicans, Duprey said the real danger is to Smith, who'll need 
the GOP's resources come election time.

<HEADLINE> Scuba Divers Attempt Record Dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDONDO BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Scuba divers simultaneously hopped  
into oceans and lakes around the world on Saturday, hoping to 
create a record for the largest collective dive. 
</P>
<P>
	Early reports indicated at least 1,000 divers clambered into the  
water at 11 a.m. EDT, although final tallies wouldn't be known 
until all the participating dive sites had turned in proof in the 
form of diver lists and photos, event spokeswoman Jody Wikheim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The material will be submitted to the Guinness Book of World  
Records, which will decide whether to make it an official record. 
Currently, there is no record category for collective dives. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers were expected to participate at sites ranging from  
Arkansas and Chicago to the Cayman Islands, Ms. Wikheim said. 
</P>
<P>
	At this popular Southern California dive spot, more than 70  
participated. ``They just started streaming down. Everyone was 
really excited to go for a dive,'' Ms. Wikheim said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was sponsored by the Diving Equipment and Marketing  
Association to rebuild enthusiasm for the sport.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Say Open Is About Attitude  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The U.S. Open is all about attitude,  
which explains why Payne Stewart is among the leaders once again, 
why Jose Maria Olazabal is on the disabled list and why Lee 
Westwood is on his way home. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no greater possession than par in a U.S. Open,  
particularly when the conditions become as firm, fast and 
unforgiving as expected this weekend at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no greater asset than patience.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the reasons I do well at U.S. Opens is that I  
get a mindset that par is a good score,'' said Stewart, tied for 
the lead at 3-under 137 with David Duval and Phil Mickelson. It's 
the third time in four years Stewart was in the lead after 36 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``However I go about making par -- whether it's two beautiful  
shots and two putts, or two ugly shots, a chip and nice putt -- I 
accept it, I take my par and go. Because you're never losing to 
anybody is you're making par.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A batch of players always lose even before the first round  
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus, who competed in his record 43rd straight U.S.  
Open, knows this better than anyone. He used to love hearing the 
complaints about how the USGA set up a golf course of the premier 
test in golf, because that meant fewer people to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough is too high -- check him off,'' Nicklaus said this  
week. ``The greens are too fast -- check him off. You just check 
guys off as they complain, because they complain themselves right 
out of this championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood, the brightest young star in England with 14 victories  
worldwide, talked himself right out of this major championship as 
soon as he saw the generous width of the fairways and rough trimmed 
to a mere 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	A long and accurate driver, Westwood was asked if the U.S. Open  
represented his best chance to win a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to think so, when there was 5 inches of rough,'' he  
said. ``I think it's a bit too short, a little bit too easy. Once 
you've knocked it up on the green, that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood took a double bogey on par-3 17th on Friday that put  
him at 9-over and eliminated him from weekend play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this easy enough for you?'' someone taunted him from the  
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this year Westwood has complained about a  
championship layout. He also thought the fairways at La Costa 
Resort were much too generous for the inaugural Match Play 
Championship, and he was handily beaten in the first round by 
Eduardo Romero. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have learned from Colin Montgomerie, who also gets his  
advantage with long, accurate drives. Sure, he was surprised to see 
larger landing areas off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have it 5 inches, I'd have it 5 feet,'' he quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, that's didn't change his frame of mind, or the belief he  
had an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to hit the fairways and greens, and that will  
give me enough birdie chances to hole a few of them,'' Montgomerie 
said. ``And obviously, there will be the odd mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was 4-over after a pair of 72s, but still with an outside  
chance to be there Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so for Masters champion Olazabal. He first said he didn't  
favor his chances of winning the second leg of the Grand Slam, then 
changed his mind when he saw that his incredible touch around the 
greens would be a valuable asset at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	After a first-round 75, Olazabal took out his frustrations on  
the wall of his hotel room and broke a bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Janzen, who started Saturday 10 strokes behind the lead,  
perhaps summed it up best during his second Open title last year at 
The Olympic Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect nothing to be fair,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval wanted no part of the debate on the course setup. For all  
his skills, his greatest may be his ability to take birdies and 
bogeys in stride. Earlier in the week, Duval refused to join the 
debate over the course setup with an answer that explains why he 
was in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to just try to get out and play what's in front of  
me,'' he said. ``I just don't see any use in wasting energy wishing 
about something that isn't. The golf course isn't that way, so I 
don't worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open is the supreme challenge, testing every club in  
the bag and taking inventory of what's between the ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman has played in the final pairing Sunday the past four  
years, although it will take a miracle for him to do it again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he played so well in the U.S. Open, Lehman had a  
simple explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably because I love the tournament so much,'' he said.  
``I'm always so excited to go play. I think it's the best 
tournament in the world, and I have a really good attitude going 
into the tournament. That's to my benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will serve the leaders well going over the final 36 holes.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Backs College Gambling Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The same qualities that make college  
athletes competitive also make them candidates for gambling 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not making any moral attack on gambling. I'm looking at  
who's at risk,'' Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of director of 
agent and gambling activities, said Friday. ``Our athletes are at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Problem gamblers believe they can control whatever they're  
involved in. They believe that nothing bad will ever happen to 
them, and they tend to be somewhat aggressive,'' Saum said. ``Those 
are good characteristics for athletes, but they're also 
characteristics that can lead you to make bad decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's statements came in response to a report issued by the  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission following a two-year 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes a proposed ban on betting on college games.  
</P>
<P>
	Saun said the NCAA supports that ban, even though it  
acknowledges legal bookmakers' help in catching point shavers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the game should be watched for the spontaneous  
action and reaction on the field, not for the point spread,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also calls on the NCAA to organize research on the  
effects of gambling on young people. That proposal will be 
presented to the NCAA Research Committee in July, Saum said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Saum also renewed the NCAA's call for media to stop  
publishing point spreads on college games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the media publishes point spreads in any state other than  
Nevada, it encourages illegal sports betting,'' he said. ``We at 
the national office are not going to give in on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada gambling officials have said that a ban on college sports  
betting would be a severe financial blow to the state's 142 
licensed sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only that, it would have a tremendous impact -- on the  
positive side -- for the illegal bookmaking industry,'' Joe Lupo, 
sports book director at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, said on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saum acknowledged that legal Las Vegas bookmakers helped the  
NCAA and law-enforcement officials investigate a 1994 point-shaving 
scandal involving Arizona State basketball players. He also 
acknowledged that nothing would stop all gambling on college 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One way we keep our sanity around here is that we admit we're  
not going to solve the problem. It's not going to go away,'' he 
said. ``But we're trying to have a dramatic effect on those who 
wish to wager, and a dramatic effect on any individual who may even 
think about point shaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also supports three other recommendations in the  
gambling report, Saum said. They include a national minimum 
gambling age of 21, a continued ban on Internet gambling and harsh 
penalties for underage gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA athletes and college athletic officials are already  
prohibited from betting on college or pro sports.

	Turin, Italy Lands 2006 Winter Games  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Italian city of Turin was awarded  
the 2006 Winter Games on Saturday in the first selection of an 
Olympic host since the Salt Lake City scandal. Turin upset the 
Swiss favorite, Sion, in the final vote by the International 
Olympic Committee. Turin apparently benefited from an anti-Swiss 
backlash stemming from the Olympics' worst scandal, which plunged 
the IOC into the biggest crisis of its 105-year history, leading to 
the ouster of 10 members and prompting changes in the bid and 
selection process for 2006.

capitalism. About 46 people were taken to hospital, including four 
police officers and two demonstrators knocked down by police vans, 
a spokesman for the City of London police said. Fifteen people were 
arrested as 4,000 protesters rampaged through London's financial 
district as part of the ``Carnival Against Capitalism.'' The 
protest was timed to coincide with the meeting of the Group of

	House Sacks Gun Control Bill

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two months after a shooting rampage at a  
Colorado high school, gun control legislation collapsed in a House 
crossfire on Friday. The 280-147 rejection came as many Democrats 
rebelled against National Rifle Association-backed provisions in 
the bill to loosen some existing gun controls, while dozens of 
conservative Republicans objected to the imposition of new ones. 
The Senate had passed a gun control bill earlier, and despite the 
defeat of the House bill, negotiations between the two houses are 
expected this summer on the issue.

baby was born two months later showing no signs of congenital 
hydrocephalus -- also called water on the brain, Dr. Joseph Bruner

Center. Although the doctors won't know for six months to a year

Friday of trying to unleash a new war on the Korean peninsula by 
deploying advanced weapons and provoking South Korea to fire on 
North Korean naval ships this week. The only reason this week's 
clash in the Yellow Sea did not escalate into all-out war is ``our 
great patience and self-control,'' North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Li 
Hyong Chol said in a letter to the U.N. Security Council, a copy of 
which the ambassador gave to The Associated Press. The high-seas 
shootout is believed to have killed 30 North Korean sailors,

allowed at least five runs in four of his previous five starts. In

won their 12th straight postseason game, overcoming their own 
offensive ineptitude and defeating the cold-shooting Knicks for a 
2-0 lead in the best of-7 series. The Spurs broke a tie with the 
1988 Los Angeles Lakers for the streak, and they did it without the 
same kind of dominant performance out of Tim Duncan that they got

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Strong Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the death of the House's gun-control  
bill, Congress' response to a rash of school shootings now rests 
with a small panel of lawmakers whose talks will start with the 
stricter Senate measure that had been opposed by the National Rifle 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they left behind the marathon proceedings Friday,  
lawmakers of both parties were girding for battle. 
</P>
<P>
	They immediately began blaming each other for the 280-147 defeat  
of a gun-control bill only two months after bloody school shootings 
in Colorado and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his weekly radio address today, called the  
situation in Congress unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't allow the gun lobby to rewrite our laws and undermine  
our values,'' the president said in the broadcast, taped at the 
summit of world leaders in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	To House members, Clinton said, ``You've still got an  
opportunity, and you've still got an obligation, to do the right 
thing and pass real legislation that will strengthen our gun laws, 
not weaken them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials noted that Democrats comprised most of the no  
votes. Democrats accused Republicans of weakening the bill at the 
behest of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, both sides huddled on strategy for looming  
negotiations between a small committee of House and Senate 
lawmakers that will be controlled by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., said House Democrats are  
counting on Clinton to lead the charge for the Senate's proposed 
new gun controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democratic leaders will dispatch pro-gun-control  
women lawmakers to make the same pitch. They will be led by Rep. 
Carolyn McCarthy of New York, whose husband was shot and killed on 
a Long Island commuter train, Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're frankly more effective than we (male lawmakers) are,''  
Gephardt told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why, he replied: ``Because they're mothers'' with an  
``earnestness and passion'' that makes an impression with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he voted for the Senate bill, Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said he hoped the final product ``will be something 
close to what the House has done. They've done good work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the staunchest proponents of both sides of the issue agreed  
the outcome was uncertain at best. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to handicap,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can forecast'' the outcome, Gephardt said.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue went off the political charts after the April 20  
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., that left 
15 people dead, including the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	With Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking vote, the Senate last  
month passed a measure that would extend required background checks 
to all sales at gun shows, including those conducted by 
non-licensed firearms dealers. In addition, it would require 
dealers to provide safety devices with all handguns; ban the 
importation of certain high-capacity firearms clips and impose a 
lifetime prohibition of gun ownership on any juvenile convicted of 
a serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
	The defeated House bill included the safety device provision.  
And while it would have required non-licensed dealers to conduct 
background checks on their customers at gun shows, an amendment by 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., would have reduced the amount of time 
allowed for the check from three days to 24 hours in all cases. In 
addition, it would have defined gun shows in a way to exclude some 
events that are now covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The waiting period is crucial to the gun debate because if  
federal officials do not respond to the background request in the 
time period allotted, the purchaser may take possession of the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate conferees must meet now to try to work out some  
compromise. Given the House's solid rejection of the gun bills, 
there is some doubt about whether the Congress will approve any 
expanded gun measures this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt decided Democrats stood more of a chance of increasing  
the waiting period if they defeated Dingell's amendment and tried 
to frame talks with the Senate as a choice between current law's 
72-hour requirement and the Senate-passed waiting period of three 
business days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided we were better going into conference with current  
law,'' Gephardt told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He had lobbied his caucus hard to vote no, and on final passage,  
only 45 of the House's 211 Democrats voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	By the same logic, meanwhile, Republican leaders and the NRA  
launched a furious last-minute lobbying effort to pass the bill 
with the Dingell amendment attached. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., told leaders in a private meeting early Friday that passing 
the bill would give the GOP a better chance at coming out of 
conference with some gun control, but not so much as to turn off 
conservative campaign donors next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't beat something with nothing,'' Majority Leader Dick  
Armey, R-Texas, explained. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the House rejected the overall bill, and lawmakers  
fled town for the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Justice Still Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three constants have marked Supreme Court  
Justice John Paul Stevens' 24-year tenure: his bow ties, an agile 
and independent mind, and a seemingly studied disinterest in 
asserting a leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
	Reluctant or not, Stevens was at the helm at key times in the  
soon-to-end 1998-99 term. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the lead and wrote for the court when the justices  
struck down a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance, limiting how far 
cities can go to combat street gang crime. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court banned California and all other states from  
paying lower welfare benefits to newcomers than to longtime 
residents, Stevens wrote the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	A lucid, if not inspiring, writer, Stevens wrote a line in the  
welfare case sure to be among the most memorable of the term that 
may end this week: ``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or 
poor, have the right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein 
they reside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the street-gang case, the Chicago native said the invalidated  
law could be invoked against a gang member and his father found 
loitering near Wrigley Field ``whether the reason ... is to rob an 
unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the 
ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was among the dissenters in  
both cases, leaving it to the senior justice in the majority to 
choose who would speak for the court. In both, Stevens tapped 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's pleased to have the opportunity to exercise some  
influence, but that's really secondary for him,'' said Daniel 
Farber, a University of Minnesota law professor who worked as a 
Stevens law clerk in 1976-77. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them the way he sees them. He's fundamentally not  
ideological. As a pleasant, easygoing person, he would not have 
found it difficult to play a political role on the court. He just 
chose not to,'' Farber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, who cast only 10 dissenting votes in each of the past  
two court terms, already has dissented a dozen times since the 
current court's term began in October. All 12 times, Stevens sided 
with the majority and inherited the assignment-making authority. It 
is not a trivial power, often determining a decision's sweep and 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court ruled that school districts can be sued if  
officials ignore serious sexual harassment by students against 
other students, Stevens might have had no choice but to assign 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to write for the 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	While joining four generally more liberal colleagues -- Stevens,  
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- 
O'Connor seemed determined to erect a hard-to-satisfy standard for 
liability, one that would not panic school officials nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens often is the court's most prolific dissenter, but so far  
this term he has cast 10 dissenting votes, fewer than Rehnquist and 
the court's two most conservatives justices, Antonin Scalia -- 11 -- 
and Clarence Thomas -- 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who with O'Connor has for years  
staked out the court's ideological center, has dissented eight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics aside, Stevens has not adopted a new strategy. At  
age 79, the court's oldest member shows no sign of sacrificing his 
intellectual creativity for more clout. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Stevens was appointed to the nation's highest court in  
1975 by President Gerald R. Ford, he marched to his own drummer and 
appeared not to care whether anyone followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That which makes a leader on the court is not necessarily  
intellectual acumen or integrity but an ability to engage in 
politics with a small 'p' -- a willingness to compromise and build a 
consensus,'' Northwestern University law professor Lawrence 
Marshall, a Stevens law clerk in 1986-87, once said of his old 
boss. ``Justice Stevens has always considered his role to be 
judicial, not political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of Stevens' retirement, which swept through Washington  
after doctors cleared a coronary artery in 1997, still persist. But 
the justice is giving no hint of stepping down. After all, he's at 
the top of his game. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mattel Stifles Tarzan's Hand Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. is changing the packaging  
of its Tarzan action figure after some people said the doll's 
movements were sexually suggestive. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the right arm of the 12-inch-high ``Rad Repeatin'  
Tarzan'' switches on a recording of his jungle yell. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that the spring-loaded arm can be pumped rapidly  
up and down from Tarzan's chest to below his loin cloth, a motion 
that some people call suggestive. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody has complained to the company, Tarzan's  
performance has been noted in messages on some Internet chat rooms 
since the doll reached stores about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That right arm is the topic of controversy,'' Mattel  
spokeswoman Sara Rosales acknowledged Saturday. ``I think this is 
where adults look at things through a different set of eyes. Kids 
have a much more innocent concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $19.95 doll, a tie-in to Walt Disney Co.'s new animated film  
``Tarzan,'' is shipped in an open-front package so kids can try out 
the toy before they buy. 
</P>
<P>
	No changes will be made to the doll itself.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Mattel's retail service group is making sure the arm  
will be secured in the package so it cannot drop below Tarzan's 
waist while the toy is still in the store, Ms. Rosales said.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was no game in the NBA Finals on Saturday.  
There is always a game, however, at the West 4th Street playground 
in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court where Mario Elie, Jayson Williams, Anthony Mason  
and others once scuffed their soles, a game between the Flatbush 
Suns and Chaz Hoop attracted a large crowd on a sunny afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of onlookers gazed through a fence surrounding the court  
as the teams played in one of the oldest and best summer basketball 
tournaments in the country. The West 4th Street Pro League is in 
its 22nd year, with a history some would argue is as rich as the 
NBA's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team that wins out here sometimes gets by just on  
athleticism,'' said Ken Graham, the league's founder. ``But when 
they get into a game with a team that can match their athleticism 
and can use their heads, that's the team that wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, the steady guard who has helped the San Antonio Spurs take  
a 2-0 lead over the New York Knicks in the finals, already has two 
NBA championship rings earned with the Houston Rockets. But he also 
played for a team that arguably was the greatest New York 
playground dynasty ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie was a three-time MVP of the West 4th Street league during  
Harlem USA's run of five straight championships from 1978-82. 
Graham said Mason's team, Prime Time, was the playground power of 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mario first came out here, he was a skinny little kid,''  
Graham said. ``He got pushed around, because it was so physical. He 
couldn't even get on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time he finished playing here, he was doing that move  
where he swoops to the basket like he did last night against the 
Knicks. I saw him do that 100 times out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The summer tournament is much more sophisticated than plain old  
pickup games. There are referees, uniforms that feature -- of course 
-- Nike swooshes, and a public address announcer. The announcer and 
fans, including girlfriends or wives who sit on chairs in the first 
row behind the basket, seem to know the players by their nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy Boogie to the hole ... NO GOOD!'' the announcer  
shouts through a megaphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is asking Nike to help him organize a search for the 50  
greatest players in the history of West 4th Street basketball, 
similar to the list the NBA came up with for its 50th anniversary 
two years ago. He hasn't had much success yet. For every NBA player 
groomed on the playground, there were thousands who never made it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are still playing,'' Graham said. ``Some of them  
just rode off into the sunset.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YOU TALKIN' TO ME?:* Sometimes, a cab ride is the best way to  
take a quick reading of the pulse of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Riding from LaGuardia Airport to Midtown Manhattan, all it took  
to get this driver going was the statement: ``Boy, the Knicks are 
in trouble, huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This rambling soliloquy, spoken in that gritty New York tongue,  
followed: 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, the Knicks get to the playoffs and wipe,'' the  
driver said. ``Every year, they're the shooting star of basketball. 
If they had a couple more big names, they might have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO BULLS:* San Antonio's David Robinson said the Spurs don't  
pretend to rival Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls, but he sees some 
similarities in how the teams were built. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most obvious thing is that Michael Jordan did it because  
he was the best player ever,'' Robinson said. ``The second most 
obvious thing is that they had a team. I see a guy like Steve Kerr, 
and I mean there's a lot of things you can say about Steve Kerr 
that he can't do. But here's a guy who's committed to the team. 
They had a team full of guys like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody can't have a Michael Jordan. It just doesn't happen.  
But Tim Duncan and David Robinson, that's enough if you have a team 
around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BACK EAST:* The Spurs face a task that has hounded many Western  
Conference teams -- beating the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 
without being intimidated by the historic arena or caught up in the 
nightlife, shopping and distractions of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't lost in the playoffs on the road yet, but we  
haven't played in Madison Square Garden yet, either,'' Spurs 
reserve guard Steve Kerr said. ``And this is the best team that 
we've played in the playoffs. So it's not going to be easy, but we 
like our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Sean Elliott: ``We're still a long way away. We have to  
beat them twice in New York. That's the way we're looking at it. 
It's not something that's been easy to do for a lot of teams.''

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Permanente Leaving Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATHAM, N.Y. (AP) -- After losing $90 million in the Northeast in  
1998, the big HMO Kaiser Permanente has decided to pull out of the 
region by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The California-based health maintenance organization has been  
discontinuing operations in other places around the country as the 
entire HMO industry struggles with rising health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement means the company will abandon 35 offices  
serving 575,000 patients in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
and Vermont . The HMO employs 600 doctors and health providers and 
about 3,600 administrative employees in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	An extremely competitive market is to blame, according to  
Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to have rates actually cover the costs when  
you're locked in with other organizations of the same size,'' said 
spokesman Tim Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs all over the country have been shedding Kaiser's  
clinic-based model around which the industry was originally formed. 
California-based Kaiser is one of the last HMOs to still maintain 
clinics that directly employ doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Most HMOs in the Northeast operate under a more loosely drawn  
network of independent doctors who contract with the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade organization New York Health Plan Association said  
that costly mandates in New York took their toll on Kaiser and said 
the decision ``should not raise any concern about the health of the 
managed care industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kaiser is losing money overall and raising its rates to  
try and restore its financial health. Kaiser is a non-profit 
corporation, but competes with many for-profit companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut last year, the company lost more money than any  
other HMO in the state. In February, the company announced it would 
lay off 109 workers in New York as four offices were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the company said it intended to sell all its  
North Carolina operations, with 120,000 patients. It is also sold 
its Dallas-Fort Worth operation with 130,000 members 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that now contract with the HMO include General  
Electric and grocery chain Price Chopper.

<HEADLINE> IOC Warns of Possible FBI Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
warned its members Sunday they could face FBI questioning -- and 
possible subpoenas -- in connection with the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard told the general assembly  
that the organization will offer legal assistance to members 
traveling to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard noted that several members have already been  
``interviewed'' by the FBI as it investigates the vote-buying 
allegations surrounding Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that the FBI investigators want to contact  
other members who are going to the United States,'' Carrard said. 
``It is technically and legally possible the investigators can 
subpoena the people they want to interview.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the FBI questioning so far had been carried out  
``in a respectful and discreet way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC would provide each member with a one-page  
document outlining their legal rights and advising them how to 
contact the IOC's lawyers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was our duty and responsibility to inform you of  
your legal rights,'' Carrard said. ``It is the duty of the IOC to 
protect you, defend you and assist you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard told reporters earlier this week that three IOC members  
were recently questioned by the FBI, and that another would be 
soon. He declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told Salt Lake organizing  
chief Mitt Romney this week that he hoped members would not be 
hindered in entering the United States. He noted that the IOC 
executive board is scheduled to meet next year in Salt Lake City 
and Colorado Springs, Colo.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Launched To Measure Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A satellite was  
launched Saturday night on a $98 million mission to improve weather 
forecasting and detect the onset of conditions like El Nino by 
measuring winds blowing over Earth's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	A Titan II rocket carrying NASA's QuikScat satellite roared off  
a central coast launch pad at 7:15 p.m., headed for a polar orbit 
500 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch sequence was expected to take about an hour.  
QuikScat's first signal was not expected to be heard until 76 
minutes after liftoff when it passes over Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of recent failures raised concerns about Titan rockets,  
but QuikScat mission officials were confident their booster would 
operate properly.

<HEADLINE> Patience Is Tested at U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods was disgusted already, and  
his day had barely begun. A bladed chip led to an opening double 
bogey and he was cursing loudly to himself as he walked to the 
second tee. 
</P>
<P>
	Patience usually wins U.S. Opens, and Woods seemed ready to  
unravel early on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out there would be plenty of unraveling to go around  
on the crowned greens of Pinehurst No. 2. But it was those who 
managed to put themselves back together who ended up still having a 
chance on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of that list was Woods, who came back from a  
disastrous double bogey-bogey start to finish the day just where he 
began -- two shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to keep patient and grind it out and make  
pars,'' Woods said. ``Even though I got off to a rough start, I was 
very proud of the way I hung in there today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day that began so badly for Woods wasn't getting much better  
after he hit his tee shot into the rough on the third hole. But he 
got it on the green and made par, then calmly went on to play the 
final 15 holes 1 under. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, playing partner Phil Mickelson and co-leader Payne  
Stewart had also had meltdowns of their own, each making three 
bogeys in a row at one point. And David Duval, of all people, had 
played a front nine stretch of four holes at 4 over. 
</P>
<P>
	As rain began to fall in the late afternoon on the back nine,  
Woods was suddenly back in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the leaders were going to make some bogeys,'' Woods  
said. ``My goal after the first two holes was just to make pars the 
rest of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this were anywhere else, or any other tournament, making pars  
might not be such a difficult thing to do for the world's No. 
2-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
	But with balls bounding over greens after one hop and running  
off the edges if they weren't expertly placed, it was the kind of 
day that Woods hadn't handled well before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very hard to be patient in those conditions,'' Woods  
said. ``It was rainy, cold, windy. We had everything today. It was 
very reminiscent of a British Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With players struggling to make pars, the huge crowds lining the  
fairways and greens at Pinehurst didn't get a chance to cheer on 
anyone making a great run to the top of the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player, Steve Stricker, managed to break par for the  
day, yet his modest 69 put him only three shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lack of birdies out there,'' Stricker said.  
``You've got to remain patient and try to make pars, and sneak in a 
few birdies to put some pressure on the leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh was doing just that, moving to 1 under with a birdie  
at 13 that put him just a shot out of the lead. But Singh, like 
Mickelson and Stewart, had a three-bogey string of his own starting 
on the 15th hole that moved him three shots back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied with Singh was Duval, who started off the day in a  
three-way tie for the lead, only to double bogey No. 5 and bogey 
Nos. 6 and 8 for a front nine 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Woods, though, Duval rebounded with a patient string of  
nine straight pars on the back nine to stay in contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing that happened today was bad,'' Duval said. ``I'm going  
into tomorrow three behind the leader and not too many people 
between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the conditions as treacherous as they are -- and only  
Stewart clinging to an under-par score -- even the world's best 
golfer didn't hold up much hope for anything better than a 69 or 70 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In most tournaments, that wouldn't get you a top 10. In the U.S.  
Open, it can be a winning final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm pretty close to sitting on the winning score  
tomorrow right now,'' Duval said.

<HEADLINE> Underdog Turin Wins 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Italian city of Turin won the 2006  
Winter Games on Saturday, beating favored Sion in an anti-Swiss 
backlash brought on by the Olympics' worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin won 53-36 in a secret ballot by the International Olympic  
Committee, the first selection of a host city since the Salt Lake 
City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The lopsided result reflected the deep resentment toward Marc  
Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who blew the whistle on Olympic 
corruption in December, 
</P>
<P>
	``This played a big role,'' Sion bid official Raymond Loretan  
said. ``It was a main strategy used by our opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss delegation said it would demand an explanation from  
the IOC. ``We had the best file, and we had the best 
presentation,'' Loretan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian delegation broke into cheers as the decision was  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it was only a dream. Now it's a reality,'' Turin Mayor  
Valentino Castellani told the assembly. ``It's hard to be 
convinced, to be completely awake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin bid chief Evelina Cristillin beamed and made a thumbs-up  
sign to supporters in the hall as she took a seat at the top table 
to sign the host city contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristillin sat next to Hodler, who stonily looked ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	The vote was announced about 7:30 a.m. in Turin, where the  
streets were deserted on a rainy Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turin did it,'' the RAI state TV network crowed on its hourly  
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other candidates in the all-European race were eliminated  
earlier Saturday when a special panel reduced the field: Helsinki, 
Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2006 race was dominated by the fallout from the six-month  
vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake's winning bid for the 
2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal plunged the IOC into the biggest crisis of its  
105-year history, leading to the ouster of 10 members and prompting 
changes in the bid and selection process for 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The race came down to a contest between two sharply different  
candidates -- Sion, a provincial capital of 26,000 in the heart of 
the Swiss Alps, and Turin, the northern Italian industrial city of 
2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin, making its first bid, will bring the Winter Olympics to  
Italy for the first time since the 1956 Games in Cortina D'Ampezzo. 
</P>
<P>
	The result marked the third defeat for Sion, which failed in  
previous bids for the 1976 and 2002 Winter Games. The last time 
Switzerland staged the games was in 1948 in St. Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the Salt Lake scandal, IOC members were banned  
from visiting the 2006 bid cities, and the voting process was 
changed to allow a ``selection college'' to narrow the field to 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the new rules were designed to make the  
system ``fireproof'' against any form of corruption or improper 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sion had been the front-runner from the start, delegates  
said Turin made a strong impression in Friday's presentation to the 
IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head final between Sion and Turin, the Swiss feared  
the vote could be swung by the strong Italian lobby in the IOC and 
possible bloc support from other Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on member visits has been seen as an advantage for Sion,  
which played host to more than 60 IOC members during the 2002 bid. 
The Swiss said they had a vastly improved bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection college that chose the two finalists was composed  
of eight members elected by the IOC, including former Olympic 
champions Jean-Claude Killy of France and Valery Borzov of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler did not speak during Sion's presentation, which revolved  
around a film featuring a ``modern Heidi'' searching for five 
golden rings in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We changed our tactic from the last time,'' Sion bid president  
Adolf Ogi said. ``We underlined not the technical side but the 
emotional side of our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin made a businesslike presentation, emphasizing it is the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. Bid leaders said Turin could 
provide all the amenities of a big city, while offering easy access 
to world class mountain venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, whose bid included Alpine ski events in Lillehammer,  
Norway, had hoped to get the Winter Games for Finland after five 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt proposed a ``games without borders'' concept that  
included sites in Austria, Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovak and Polish bids were never given a chance, with  
delegates saying they needed more time to develop their economies 
and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Angered by Loss of 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SION, Switzerland (AP) -- After losing the 2006 Olympic Games to  
Turin on Saturday, angry and unruly Sion supporters turned against 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After widespread rage broke out among the crowd watching the  
announcement live on a jumbo screen in Place de la Planta in the 
morning dawn, it was soon clear the Swiss were not prepared to 
accept the IOC's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the announcement that was televised live in the  
square, following all-night celebrations, stunned spectators stood 
in disbelief, before raising their fists in anger, crying, 
whistling and jeering IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch anytime 
the Spaniard's face came onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged, some turned SION 2006 flags into pickets, with hastily  
scribbled slogans such as ``CIO-Mafia'' and ``IOC go to Palermo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the incensed Swiss host broadcasters from TSR ranted over  
the loudspeakers in the square, calling the choice ``unfair,'' 
``scandalous,'' and insisting the IOC had ``lost all credibility in 
making a choice like that,'' their bitter voices carrying across 
the downtown area of the medieval city. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after, police reported that angry protesters had defaced  
a statue in the Olympic museum's gardens in Lausanne, home of the 
IOC, about 62 miles west of Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandals sprayed ``Mafia'' on the statue, with a letter written  
in each of the five Olympic rings on the sculpture, while ``Torino 
2006'' was inscribed underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Lausanne police had no suspects, but they increased surveillance  
at the museum and IOC headquarters down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-IOC banners already had been found posted randomly around  
the museum's garden earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters were expected to unite in front of IOC headquarters  
Sunday to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
	While their anger was directed more at the IOC than their  
Italian rivals, many Sion supporters nevertheless believed shady 
dealings were at the origin of Turin's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were deals made. I'm not saying bribery, but some deals  
were made,'' said one Sion resident, who preferred to remain 
anonymous. ``There is no way we could have lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you lose out in the last minute like that? There was  
something shady that happened. This is an obvious sign that their 
so-called reforms have changed nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're angry with the IOC. We thought that kind of stuff was  
being eradicated,'' said Paul Vergers, an elderly man born and 
raised in Sion. ``We went into the vote with a 99 percent chance of 
winning and the one percent happened. Something had to have 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing to first-time candidate Turin by a large margin is what  
baffled most Swiss. Bidding for the third time, Sion lost to Turin 
by 17 votes -- 53 to 36 -- despite receiving top marks in the IOC's 
evaluation report. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that circle, decisions aren't made according to objective  
criteria,'' Switzerland's Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the quality of our dossiers, the difference in  
votes was grotesque. Ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes one question the IOC.''  
</P>
<P>
	His comments reflected the feelings of the Swiss people.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why bother having an evaluation committee if the members of  
the IOC are going to discount it?'' said Karin Kunz, a Zurich 
native who traveled to Sion for the decision. ``Don't they care if 
the games go to the best place possible? 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the people in Turin don't even know the city is bidding.  
They still have a ton of work left to perfect their bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clear favorites coming into the final vote, Sion had been  
confident, kicking off celebrations the night before with marching 
bands, street entertainers, food courts and drink stands merrily 
lining the medieval city's narrow cobbled streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectacular fireworks lit up the skies at midnight as showers of  
sparks speckled the vineyards lining the Valasian valley's 
mountainsides. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelers, garbed in Sion 2006 T-shirts, hats and pins plowed  
through the downtown area, singing, drinking, waving flags and 
clanging cowbells. 
</P>
<P>
	Canons were fired in five directions at 4 a.m., calling for the  
public to gather at Place de la Planta -- where the medal ceremonies 
would have been held -- for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension and excitement mounted at dawn when the decision was  
narrowed to the two finalists, Turin and Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hour following the decision, thousands remained in the  
square in disbelief, unsure how to handle the disappointment, 
confetti drifting around their feet.

<HEADLINE> IOC Condemns Swiss Reaction to Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee on  
Sunday condemned the ``excessive reaction'' in Switzerland to 
Sion's defeat in the vote for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC was harshly attacked by Swiss government officials,  
media and the general public after it awarded the games to Turin, 
Italy, on Saturday by a vote of 53-36. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion had been considered the favorite, and the stunning lopsided  
defeat caused angry recriminations among the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC understands the disappointment of the people of Sion,  
the Valais and Switzerland,'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
said in a statement read at the close of the committee's four-day 
meeting in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it points out that the 109th session chose freely and  
democratically between the two finalists, both of whose bids were 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC regrets the excessive reactions of certain people but  
is sure the traditional Swiss sense of calm will soon prevail once 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Switzerland, police reported that protesters had defaced a  
statue in the Olympic museum's gardens in Lausanne, home of the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandals sprayed ``Mafia'' on the statue, with a letter written  
in each of the five Olympic rings on the sculpture, while ``Torino 
2006'' was inscribed underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-IOC banners were posted randomly around the museum's garden  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests were expected outside IOC headquarters Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the assembly after Samaranch, Italian IOC member  
Mario Pescante said the Turin and Italian delegations received a 
letter Sunday from Swiss IOC member Rene Fasel expressing ``fair 
play and friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can be at peace, we can rest assured we will move  
on,'' Pescante said. ``I believe that jointly we will very quickly 
restore the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly, Samaranch told delegates that the venue for the  
next IOC session in December was still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting has long been planned for Lausanne. Samaranch's  
comments made clear the IOC, concerned about possible protests, may 
move the session to another country. 
</P>
<P>
	There has even been speculation here that the IOC may consider  
moving its headquarters out of Switzerland as a result of the 
strong anti-IOC sentiment in the country.

<HEADLINE> Marlin Readies for Pocono 500 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa, (AP) -- Less than 24 hours after a surprising pole  
run, Sterling Marlin was dealing with the reality of raceday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big difference between winning the pole and winning  
the race, but there are plenty of people who would trade starting 
spots with us right now,'' he said as he prepared for the Pocono 
500. ``We know we have to have that perfect lap 200 times Sunday, 
and not just once like we did Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A qualifying run of 170.506 mph -- the fastest in the 26 seasons  
of Pocono International Raceway -- gave Marlin his first pole in 
four years. Now, the two-time Daytona 500 champion would like to 
end a 94-race drought with his first victory since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we win the race? Yeah. Will we win the race? I don't  
know,'' he said. ``There's so many factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primary among them is Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett.  
</P>
<P>
	After obliterating the competition a week ago at Michigan  
Speedway, Jarrett must be considered the favorite in this $2.4 
million race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford he will drive is the same one with which he dominated  
the Kmart 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the two tracks are totally different, the reason  
the car won the race last week was because it handled well, and 
this is definitely a handling race track,'' said Jarrett, who 
starts on the outside of the front row. ``It should be a good race 
car. I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Marlin, but he isn't foolish enough to believe his  
first-row starting position will be very advantageous once the 
field gets to racing. He figures the best cars will be near the 
front after five or 10 trips around the 2 1/2-mile triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin arrived at the track Saturday saying he was in the same  
position as the other 42 starters would didn't go as fast in 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's just about anybody's race to win,'' he explained.  
``We're back to ground zero. The guys who do the best work today in 
practice and adjust the quickest Sunday are the ones who are going 
to be up front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who leads Jeff Burton by 66 points, has finished in the  
top five in 11 of the last 12 races and been out of the top 10 only 
twice in 14 starts this season. And he's won twice in his last 
seven outings on the mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to race at this place,'' Jarrett said. ``Hopefully, we  
can get some laps led early and get our bonus points there and kind 
of settle in.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's affection for the track is understandable. He had won  
just three times in his first 8 1/2 seasons on the circuit when he 
prevailed at Pocono in 1995. There have been 16 victories since. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite 11 top-10s in 24 Pocono starts, Jarrett takes nothing  
for granted. Three years ago, he broke a kneecap while warming up 
for a qualifying lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very difficult race track,'' Jarrett said. ``Every  
corner is a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unique layout features three straightaways or varying  
lengths and three tight corners with different degrees of banking. 
</P>
<P>
	Most drivers have problems getting around Pocono.  
</P>
<P>
	Three-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who also has a  
victory in each of the last three seasons at Pocono, knows that 
better than most. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those tracks where you're never going to be the  
same in every corner,'' said Gordon, who qualified a season-worst 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
	But his troubles extend beyond Pocono. A record-tying third  
straight series title now appears a long shot because of accidents 
and breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just play the cards that you've been dealt,'' Gordon said.  
``That's what we've go right now.''

<HEADLINE> Arraignment in Fatal Hostage Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A former nurse arrested after a deadly  
two-day hostage standoff at the state mental hospital was arraigned 
Saturday, appearing disoriented and badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Czajkowski, 40, is accused of bursting into Norristown  
State Hospital on Wednesday, firing several shots, and taking 
nursing supervisors Carol Sue Kepner, 54, and Maria G. Jordan, 37, 
captive. The women had played a role in his dismissal in April, 
state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 46-hour standoff, police broke a window to a room where  
Czajkowski was holed up Friday morning, and he opened fire, killing 
Ms. Kepner and hitting Ms. Jordan in the chest and abdomen. She was 
hospitalized in fair condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At his arraignment, Czajkowski said he didn't remember what  
happened and refused to sign documents indicating the charges had 
been read to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski was taken to the Montgomery County prison, where he  
was being held without bail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled 
for June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski was covered with cuts and bruises when he emerged  
from an unmarked police car before the court proceedings. His left 
eye was swollen shut and his left ear bloodied and torn. 
</P>
<P>
	State police have said that Czajkowski, who is charged with  
first-degree murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping and 
related charges, likely was injured while being subdued.

<HEADLINE> Sterling Marlin Breaks Pole Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Car owner Felix Sabates will have to  
cancel his fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabates, who likes to spend weekends on his boat, promised his  
drivers that any time they win a pole, he'll be there to watch the 
race. Sterling Marlin assured him of an unscheduled trip Sunday 
with the fastest lap Friday in qualifying for the Pocono 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't ever come up here,'' Marlin said after touring  
Pocono International Raceway at a record 170.506 mph. ``But he's 
coming now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin said the colorful car owner wanted an explanation for his  
first pole in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him the accelerator hung,'' Marlin said with a laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	But he wasn't laughing much as he circled the 2 1/2-mile triangle  
to win his first pole in 28 attempts on the mountaintop. It was the 
10th prime starting spot of his career, but first in his last 123 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was holding my breath,'' Marlin said, noting that he nearly  
crashed his Chevrolet on a mock qualifying run during practice. 
``Before qualifying, I nearly spun in my banzai lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Marlin took care of the car until his  
qualifying effort. Then he learned that his assessment of the 
equipment was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came off the truck fast,'' he said. ``We needed to get  
things turned around, and this pole is a big step in that 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big enough even to hold off Winston Cup points leader Dale  
Jarrett. Coming off a dominant victory last Sunday at Michigan 
Speedway, Jarrett took the outside of the front row by driving his 
Ford around the track at 169.952. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin and Jarrett were among six drivers to eclipse the 1996  
track record of 169.725 by Jeff Gordon. But the three-time series 
champion wasn't among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I has my hands full out there,'' said Gordon, who qualified a  
season-worst 17th, going just 168.757. ``I'm not real happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Marlin was.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was a perfect lap,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Jarrett was satisfied, his car took a little work to  
reach the point where it could contend for the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was comfortable, but it was fast,'' Jarrett  
said of his lap, giving most of the credit to crew chief Todd 
Parrott. ``We weren't that happy about what we had when we 
unloaded, but Todd and the guys gave me something I could really be 
aggressive with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who leads Jeff Burton by 66 points, is using the same  
car he won with in the Kmart 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys just cleaned it up and got it ready to go again,'' he  
said. ``When you get a good car, you want to race it as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Jarrett and Bobby Labonte, third in the Winston Cup title  
chase, managed serious runs at Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to take it a little too easy through turn 3,'' Labonte  
said after a lap of 169.821 in his Pontiac. ``I don't think I 
carried enough steam through there, but we're awfully happy with 
what we did today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly spinning his car in practice, Marlin realized that  
instability in the tight turns could be his undoing. So adjustments 
were made, and Marlin said team manager Tony Glover and the crew 
made the right call on the setup. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his call on the radio to Marlin that made the  
driver's day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off turn 3 he said, `You've got the pole by a long  
shot,' '' Marlin explained. ``It felt good. We used up all the race 
track in that lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Labonte, came the Ford of Bill Elliott, a four-time Pocono  
pole sitter, at 169.757. Rick Mast was next in a Ford at 169.747. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Schrader, whose five poles are the track standard, qualified  
sixth. He was followed by brothers Ward and Jeff Burton, Wally 
Dallenbach and Mark Martin.

<HEADLINE> Some B-2 Flaws Revealed in Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The B-2 ``stealth'' bomber touted by the  
Pentagon as a star performer in Kosovo is tricky to maintain and 
hobbled by technical flaws, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 billion plane has passed most operational tests, but  
deficiencies were identified ``that will limit, or under some 
circumstances slow, its pace in flight operations,'' says a report 
released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	General Accounting Office auditors questioned the durability of  
the special materials that make the B-2 nearly invisible to enemy 
radar and said cockpit equipment does not perform as advertised, 
preventing the air crew from determining the enemy's exact 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found the planning system for missions  
insufficient and said the aircraft's use is limited by the fact 
that all the planes are housed and maintained at one Air Force base 
in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth GAO report in five years on the B-2 was completed  
before the 11-week Balkan air war ended June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton praised the success rate in Kosovo, calling it  
a marvel and its crews a testament to American military prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	Six B-2s flew 30-hour nonstop missions from Whiteman Air Force  
Base to Yugoslavia and back. Although the planes flew only about 50 
of the more than 30,000 sorties by NATO pilots, its payloads 
accounted for 11 percent of the bombs dropped -- 1.4 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane scored near-perfect accuracy in its first combat,  
Pentagon officials say. Although a B-2 mistakenly dropped bombs on 
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last month, officials said the 
fault lay with bad maps and other errors by NATO rather than with 
the plane or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof is in the pudding,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,  
whose district includes the B-2 base. ``The fact that it did so 
well should cause everybody who is critical to own up to the fact 
that they were wrong. It was dependable, and it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said the Air Force had made progress in correcting  
planning problems, but little progress had been made in other 
areas. For example, GAO said, the 10-plane B-2 fleet suffers long 
down times for repair of its delicate stealth parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These factors diminish the ability of the Air Force to fly the  
aircraft as frequently as operational requirements stipulated,'' 
the auditors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force spent more than $740 million to develop a network  
of systems to help B-2 crews detect enemy planes, missiles or other 
threats in flight, but the equipment ``either incorrectly 
identified threats or did not provide an accurate location of 
threats,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schneiter, the Pentagon's director of strategic and  
tactical systems, acknowledged problems in technology that warns 
crews about threats, but said the trouble is less severe than GAO 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneiter said the Air Force is improving the plane's  
radar-deflecting skin, and is trying to acquire maintenance 
shelters where the planes can make pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat-wing-shaped plane drew heavy criticism even before its  
introduction in 1989. Critics often focused on its mechanical 
reliability and whether its stealth abilities are worth the price. 
The Pentagon eventually plans to buy 21 B-2s.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Struck by Car in Maine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Horror author Stephen King was seriously  
injured when he was struck by a van while walking Saturday, police 
said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colorado's Helton Hits For Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton became the third player in Colorado  
Rockies history to hit for the cycle, getting it in his first four 
at-bats against the Florida Marlins on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, who is 13-for-26 in his last seven games, doubled in the  
second, singled in the fourth, hit a solo homer in the fifth and 
tripled to lead off the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	He never hesitated rounding second on the triple into the  
right-field gap and easily beat the relay throw from shortstop Alex 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton is the second player to hit for the cycle this season,  
joining San Francisco's Jeff Kent, who did it May 3 at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Bichette and Neifi Perez are the only other Colorado  
players to hit for the cycle. All three have come at Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	John Mabry has the only other cycle in Colorado, accomplishing  
the feat in 1996 while with the St. Louis Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Paper Knocks Concert Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell's newspaper, which  
previously claimed that a popular ``Teletubbies'' character is a 
gay role model, now asserts that the all-female Lilith Fair concert 
tour is named for a demon. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800,000 people attended the summer concert series last  
year. The third and final tour begins July 8 and features artists 
including Sheryl Crow, The Dixie Chicks and Queen Latifah. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many young people no doubt attend the Lilith Fair concerts not  
knowing the demonic legend of the mystical woman whose name the 
series manifests,'' says the Parents Alert column in the June issue 
of National Liberty Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ancient Jewish literature, Lilith was created by  
God as Adam's first wife, but left Eden after refusing to be 
submissive to Adam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lilith Fair got its name from the character's original  
aspect, a woman seeking equality and independence, tour publicist 
Ambrosia Healy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the column in Falwell's conservative Christian newspaper  
says there are many conflicting accounts of the Lilith character. 
</P>
<P>
	According to pagan legend, it said, Lilith dwelled with demons  
after leaving Eden and went mad after witnessing the execution of 
her children. ``As a result, she went on a killing spree, seducing 
and murdering her own demonic male offspring and then slaying their 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell was ridiculed after the same column in February asserted  
that the creators of the ``Teletubbies'' TV series for toddlers 
intended the character Tinky Winky as a gay role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Lilith Fair alert is certain to draw more fire, but we  
are willing to take the heat in order to document the truth behind 
the benign appearance of this music festival,'' said the article by 
senior editor J.M. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Falwell, Beth Bragg, said Friday that the  
Lynchburg minister had not read the column in the newspaper, in 
which he is listed as editor and publisher, and wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he has the highest regard and confidence in his editor,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lilith character also became the namesake of the Independent  
Jewish Women's Magazine. Editor Susan Weidman said Jewish scholars 
demonized Lilith hundreds of years ago because they were threatened 
by the idea of a strong woman who insisted on equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, some of that is going on now with people like Jerry  
Falwell,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Breaks Hand, Out of US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Jose Maria Olazabal has a pretty good  
punch. Too bad he's a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters champion, irate over poor play in the U.S. Open,  
took a swing at a hotel wall and wound up breaking his right hand, 
forcing him to withdraw before Friday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset with myself,'' said Olazabal, who was injured  
Thursday night after shooting a 5-over 75 in the first round. ``I 
wanted to do well this week. After the way I played ... I did 
something I should not have. Now I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a splint, Olazabal arrived at Pinehurst No. 2 to try a  
few practice swings with a club in his hands. But as soon as the 
Spaniard realized he couldn't play the second round, he walked to 
the parking lot and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman and Nick Price teed off without the other member of  
their threesome. A ``WD'' on the scoreboard served as golf's 
version of the white towel. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was rated among the favorites at Pinehurst, where the  
spacious fairways, short rough and treacherous greens seemed a 
perfect fit for a player with an imaginative short game. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his withdrawal left Jack Nicklaus as the last man to  
win both the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year. That happened 
27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Told of Olazabal's misfortune, defending Open champion Lee  
Janzen said nonchalantly, ``I guess that takes him out of the Grand 
Slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman and Corey Pavin didn't provide a lot of sympathy,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have kicked the wall,'' quipped Norman, who failed to  
make the cut after dueling with Olazabal at the Masters. ``I 
wouldn't have punched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's under the stupid-things-I-did-in-my-life category,''  
Pavin added. ``I'm sure he feels pretty dumb about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two players at opposite end of golf's mental spectrum said they  
could relate to the Olazabal's frustration after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's understandable,'' said Tiger Woods, who was among the  
leaders at the midway point of the tournament. ``We do get angry 
out here. We do get frustrated and sometimes we take it home with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Daly should know. He's had several drunken rampages during  
his continuing battle with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is crazy,'' he said. ``I've done a lot of crazy  
things with my fists. I never hit anybody, but I tore up a few 
houses and a few cars. It's not the total glamorous life that 
everybody thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Daly seemed taken aback that a player known for his calm  
temperament let his emotions get the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'd have won the Masters, I don't think I'd have been  
punching the walls,'' Daly said. ``I'm the only one right now who 
has a reason to punch anything. I haven't done crap all year. At 
least he's got the green jacket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal broke the fifth metacarpal on his right hand and will  
be out 3-4 weeks, possibly jeopardizing his spot in the British 
Open at Carnoustie July 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it is a clean fracture,'' Olazabal said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, a broken hand is not nearly as serious as the ailment that  
threatened the Spaniard's career after his first Masters victory in 
1994. Olazabal was out of golf for 18 months because of foot 
problems that were mistakenly diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	He feared he wouldn't be able to walk again, much less play  
golf. Now he's simply got to work on his temper.

<HEADLINE> Az. Sen. Calls for Energy Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans pressed their case  
Saturday for a reorganization of the Energy Department in response 
to the continuing controversy over the safeguarding of America's 
nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the weekly GOP radio address, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,  
accused the Clinton administration of taking ``half measures'' in 
dealing with security at nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl is one of three GOP senators who have proposed putting  
nuclear weapons programs under a largely autonomous agency within 
the Energy Department -- an idea also urged this week by a panel of 
intelligence experts advising the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, such a reorganization is being staunchly resisted  
by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who said he would recommend 
that the president veto any legislation creating such an agency. 
It's ``not good logic'' to insulate the nuclear weapons programs 
within a new ``fiefdom'' in the department, Richardson told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kyl noted that a special panel of the president's own  
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board this week, after a 90-day 
review of security at the Energy Department, recommended just such 
an agency, expressing doubt that without it, long-lasting security 
reforms would be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Republican Sen. Warren Rudman of New  
Hampshire, said the department has had a ``cavalier attitude'' 
about security for decades. It said while Richardson's moves to 
improve security were in the right direction, the department's 
``bureaucracy is quite capable of undoing (these) reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We call upon the administration to cooperate with us, not to  
be satisfied with half measures,'' said Kyl in the Republican 
Party's weekly radio broadcast. ``Since our proposal is exactly 
what the president' own panel now has recommended, we hope that he 
and his secretary of energy will work with us to get our bill 
passed quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson argues that creation of a ``new fiefdom'' within the  
department would hinder the beefed up, more centralized security 
and counterintelligence programs he has put in place. Earlier in 
the week he announced appointment of a four-star Air Force general 
as the department's first ``security czar'' who will reported 
directly to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about security at nuclear weapons facilities erupted  
in March as details from a congressional investigation began to 
surface, describing the loss of nuclear secrets to China in the 
1980s and into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy intensified after Richardson directed the firing  
of a scientists at the Los Alamos weapons lab in early March after 
he had been under investigation for possible espionage since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired for security violations,  
but has not been charged with any crime. Through his lawyer he has 
vehemently denied giving nuclear secrets to anyone. The FBI 
investigation on the Lee case continues. 
</P>
<P>
	And the issue is not likely to go away soon. On Tuesday, four  
Senate committees will meet in joint session to hear Rudman 
describe his proposal for Energy Department reorganization. 
Richardson also is scheduled to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee also has planned a hearing on the  
Rudman report this week.

	Climate of Violence Persists in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The climate of violence persisted in  
Kosovo, even as Serb troops accelerated their pullout from the 
region Saturday. Three Serbs were killed and a fourth badly wounded 
-- each with a shot to the forehead -- in the village of Belo Polje 
near Pec. Near Gnjilane, where U.S. peacekeepers have their 
headquarters, Marines arrested a Serb for allegedly killing one man 
and wounding two others in a sniper attack. There were about 40,000 
Yugoslav troops in Kosovo before an international peace deal 
reached June 9 ended NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against 
Yugoslavia. Only 3,000 to 5,000 remain.

injured when he was struck by a van while walking near his home 
Saturday, police said. King was walking south on the shoulder of 
Route 5 in North Lovell, where he owns a home, at about 4:30 p.m. 
when a motorist approaching from behind lost control of his car, 
Oxford County Sheriff's deputy Matt Baker said. Officials at 
Central Maine Medical Center said King suffered ``significant'' 
injuries including broken bones but was conscious and alert. King 
was flown to Central Maine Medical for treatment at the hospital's

	Iranian Foreign Minister in Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister received a warm  
welcome Saturday in Jordan, the first visit to the kingdom by a 
high-ranking Iranian official in three decades. Kamal Kharrazi 
immediately went into talks with his Jordanian counterpart, 
Abdul-Ilah Khatib. A meeting with King Abdullah II was scheduled 
for tomorrow. Government officials said the talks will focus on 
ways to consolidate political relations and boost economic 
cooperation through increased trade and joint ventures. But 
political ties are likely to remain bumpy because the Islamic 
government in Tehran is critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with 
Israel and its quest for normal ties with the Jewish state.

	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton challenged lawmakers

the two-month anniversary of the Colorado school shooting by 
undoing their vote against gun control. His weekly radio address 
aimed to stir public anger over what Clinton said was a 
congressional majority taking its orders from the National Rifle 
Association. To the NRA, he said, ``I wish you would help us. But 
we've overcome your scare tactics and strong-arm pressure before.'' 
The House voted 280-147 on Friday to defeat the gun-control bill.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Hispanic and black children are apparently more  
prone to developing an adult form of diabetes that can lead to 
heart attacks, strokes, blindness and amputations if it's not 
diagnosed and treated early, researchers said today. But more 
research needs to be done to target specific risk factors among 
different ethnic groups, said the scientists, who released their 
findings at the annual conference of the American Diabetes 
Association. Almost 16 million people in the United States have 
diabetes, the sixth-leading cause of death in the country.

2006 Winter Games. A backlash associated with the Olympics' worst 
scandal helped the city of Turin upset the favored Swiss town of 
Sion in Saturday's vote by the International Olympic Committee. The 
vote -- the first selection of an Olympic host city since the Salt 
Lake City bribery scandal -- immediately produced anger, bitterness

<HEADLINE> Therapy for Aggressive Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So you're driving 10 mph over the speed limit but you slow down  
when a tailgater starts honking. Very passive-aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, you speed up when someone tries to pass you. Classic  
competitive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Or you scream and pound your steering wheel when construction  
limits traffic to one lane. Narcissistic personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Einreinhofer has been diagnosing the personality types  
behind raging drivers' worst habits for a year, listening -- for $70 
an hour -- as motorists vent their frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old high school teacher -- a certified hypnotherapist  
but not trained as a psychologist -- began advertising road rage 
counseling after he couldn't find anyone to help with his own 
traffic-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of made me a one-man specialty,'' said Einreinhofer,  
who offers hourly sessions out of his home in rural Stockholm, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 people have paid for one-on-one sessions, and he  
counsels many others at seminars and one-day classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Einreinhofer says passive-aggressive motorists don't start out  
antagonizing other drivers, but won't tolerate anyone else they 
feel is a dangerous driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of people who come in with a real law-and-order  
mentality,'' Einreinhofer said. ``Somehow they feel a compulsion to 
punish that person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Einreinhofer says he used to be a passive aggressor, and his pet  
peeve was tailgating. Now, he uses hypnosis and muscle relaxation 
exercises to calm down. He focuses on the good drivers on the road 
and pulls an imaginary shade over his rear window so he can't see 
the tailgaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Rodriguez, director of the Institute of Stress Medicine in  
Norwalk, Conn., offers some other advice: Treat other drivers as if 
they were guests in your home. Focus on the interior of the car, 
not the exterior. Listen to soft music. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who has co-written two books on road rage with  
psychiatrist John Larson, holds six-hour, one-day seminars to calm 
angry drivers at companies and American Automobile Association 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Turrin, 22, of Clifton, N.J., dropped in on a one-day  
seminar Einreinhofer held at a bookstore to deal with his rage at 
being cut off. He used to swear and stress out when he saw those 
``stupid drivers. ... They think they're cool when they drive 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Turrin meditates four times a week and does breathing  
exercises during his 20-minute commute to curb his temper. 
</P>
<P>
	He says other motorists could use similar road rage counseling.  
``There are so many people out there that are a lot worse than 
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said a competitive culture and focus on violence in  
the mass media is making road rage worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture is advocating violence as a solution to  
problems,'' she said. ``If you look at movies, if you look at 
television ... the angry person becomes the hero.''

<HEADLINE> Jews Embrace Muslim Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A mixed audience of Jews and Muslims warmly  
received the son of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad during 
a rare appearance by a Muslim leader inside a Jewish temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the two faiths came together for Erev Shabbat  
services on Friday at the Temple Israel of Greater Miami, where 
Imam W. Deen Muhammad -- who rejected his father's black separatist 
beliefs years ago -- gave brief remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sacred day,'' Muhammad said. ``I feel very much at  
home in soul with you. I feel your purity and your peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Jeffrey Kahn hoped the event would start ``a very special  
relationship between Jews and Muslims in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a magical evening,'' Kahn said. ``I think it's great  
having them all here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah Muhammad led the Nation of Islam to prominence by  
preaching militant black nationalism. After his death in 1975, his 
son took over and soon disbanded the group upon rejecting racial 
separatism. The Nation of Islam was revived in 1978 by Louis 
Farrakhan, who still preaches Elijah Muhammad's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the Chicago-based Society of Muslim Americans, W.  
Deen Muhammad, 65, has worked to support interfaith dialogue 
between Muslims, Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Friday's appearance was the second time -- and the first  
in more than a decade -- that he has participated in Jewish Sabbath 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 Muslims and Jews gathered together after services in  
small groups to share refreshments and small talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imam Muhammad is our leader. When he comes this close, we like  
to show our support,'' said Yacub Bilal, a Muslim who drove four 
hours to attend the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Datko, a Temple Israel member who brought her 13-year-old  
son, Joseph, said the event was a needed cultural exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a good opportunity to learn and not just take it out  
of a textbook,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for Wimbledon Is Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Weather aside, the outlook at  
Wimbledon is unusually bright. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, there's always the threat of rain. And Wimbledon remains  
susceptible to criticism that lawn tennis is duller than watching 
grass courts grow, especially on the men's side. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year the tournament coincides with a sudden upswing in  
the sport's popularity, the result of two dramatic, emotional 
finals at the French Open earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon opens Monday with the focus on five-time champion Pete  
Sampras, who seeks a record-tying 12th Grand Slam title. And thanks 
to Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, who staged career comebacks in 
Paris, there will be plenty of subplots: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Can a rejuvenated Agassi become the first man since Bjorn Borg  
in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Now that Graf has her first Grand Slam title since 1996, can  
she win Wimbledon for the eighth time? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Or will youth be served? Will Venus Williams bounce back from  
disappointment in Paris to claim the family's first Grand Slam 
title? 
</P>
<P>
	-- How will Martina Hingis perform following a French Open that  
ended in jeers and tears? Will she continue to serve underhand? 
Will British fans boo if she does? 
</P>
<P>
	-- Can Boris Becker, in his last Wimbledon, draw inspiration from  
Agassi's showing in Paris? 
</P>
<P>
	-- And finally, what in the world is John McEnroe doing out there  
with a racket? 
</P>
<P>
	To answer the last question first: The 40-year-old McEnroe, who  
often leads complaints that grass-court tennis has become boring, 
plans to interject his own excitement by playing mixed doubles with 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a sideshow, and the Sampras story line will dominate  
Centre Court. He won Wimbledon in 1998 for the fifth time in six 
years but hasn't reached the last three Grand Slam finals, skipping 
the Australian Open entirely. He still needs one major title to 
match Roy Emerson's record of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras' slump this spring, capped by a second-round exit at  
Paris, prompted speculation that he's in decline at age 27. But 
Sampras also struggled early in 1998 before winning Wimbledon, and 
a return to grass rejuvenated his game again last week, when he 
beat Tim Henman in the final at Queen's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to mentally put the first four or five months  
behind me,'' Sampras said. ``It's been an up-and-down year, and I 
haven't played very many matches. I haven't felt like I've been in 
a great rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the same boat I was last year at this time. Wimbledon  
turned my year around, and I hope that's the case this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's resurgence creates the tantalizing prospect of a  
showdown with Sampras in the final. Their rivalry was once the most 
touted in tennis, but they haven't met in a Grand Slam tournament 
since the 1995 U.S. Open final, which Sampras won. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi's first major title came at Wimbledon in 1992, and two  
weeks ago he became only the fifth man to win all four Grand Slams. 
Now he'll try to become the first man to win the French Open and 
Wimbledon in the same year since Borg did it three times in a row, 
1978-1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be something,'' Agassi said. ``I certainly know I  
have a lot more tennis in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after winning the French, Agassi withdrew from a  
tournament in Halle, Germany, complaining of a sore thigh. But he 
practiced at Wimbledon several days this week and pronounced 
himself ready to challenge for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen for me,'' Agassi said following a two-hour  
workout Saturday. ``I wouldn't have believed what happened two 
weeks ago. Two weeks from now, who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less convincing is the optimism expressed by Becker, who  
announced his retirement from Grand Slam competition in 1997, then 
decided this year to make one final appearance at Wimbledon. He has 
won the tournament three times but not since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three years ago I considered myself one of the few who  
had a chance at Wimbledon,'' Becker said. ``I know I can play well 
on grass. I'm going to give a difficult match to anybody who is 
going to play me on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side, the sentimental favorite is Graf, who will  
try to build on her stunning performance in Paris. The Grand Slam 
title was Graf's 22nd, capping her comeback from a series of 
injuries that threatened her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``She surprised everybody and herself with the way she played,''  
defending Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna said. ``She played some 
of her best tennis in years. Her chances of playing well at 
Wimbledon and possibly winning it are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count out Novotna, though. She sprained her right ankle  
playing doubles at the French but expects to be ready for 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna and Graf are among at least seven women capable of  
winning the title. The others: Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and 
those brash teen-agers -- Hingis, Williams and Anna Kournikova. 
Williams' sister, Serena, withdrew because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Hingis won Wimbledon in 1997. But she must  
regroup after unraveling in the French final, when she drew boos 
for complaining about calls and resorting to underhanded serves at 
the end of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the other teen queens, they've fallen shy of expectations  
in major tournaments so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if they're ready to do it over here at  
Wimbledon,'' Novotna said. ``I think it will come down to 
experience -- being in the semifinals and finals before and using 
everything you know to your advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you never know. Anything can happen at Wimbledon.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the next fortnight, there are sure to be some surprises.  
Perhaps even the sun will shine.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- NCAA employee Sean Straziscar was excited  
about moving to Indianapolis until he tried to sell his house in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when your personal feelings come into play, rather than  
your professional feelings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Straziscar is among 91 NCAA employees who agreed to go along  
when the NCAA announced it was moving its headquarters to 
Indianapolis. That was two years ago, and now it's almost time for 
the organization to leave Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 240 other employees will stay behind.  
</P>
<P>
	Straziscar is a statistician who handles Division II and III  
sports and serves as media coordinator for the Division II 
basketball championship. Like many NCAA employees, he was in Omaha 
to help at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's excited about living in Indiana, but with the  
tournament ending, Straziscar will return to Wellsville, Kan., to 
leave the dream home he and his wife bought six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	They've found another place in Greencastle, Ind., but the  
purchase is tied to the sale of their Kansas house. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot going on right now,'' he said. ``Sometimes, it's  
hard to concentrate at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are all the goodbyes. About a month ago, the NCAA  
held a farewell party for more than 300 employees. Many departments 
have held smaller gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real hard to say goodbye when you see someone three or  
four times a day for five years or more,'' said Dianna Lanz, a 
receptionist for seven years. ``You know their families. You know 
everything about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lanz is staying behind. She has a son in Kansas City and another  
enrolled at Kansas State, and her husband, Gus, has the job with 
the bigger salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to think of our priorities,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA opens its office in Indianapolis Aug. 3.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GRITTY EFFORT:* Much of the talk after the game focused on  
Florida State right-hander Blair Varnes, who hadn't pitched in the 
College World Series until taking the mound against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Varnes injured a knee ligament during the postgame pileup when  
the Seminoles beat Auburn on June 5, winning their super regional 
to advance to Omaha. He is scheduled for surgery after returning to 
Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair made good pitches,'' Florida State coach Mike Martin  
said. ``Gosh, did Blair Varnes pitch with such tremendous heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Varnes didn't use a full extension when he came down to plant  
his left foot. Otherwise, the bulky brace he wore on his left knee 
didn't seem to affect his throwing motion. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury was most apparent when he limped around the mound  
after an infield popup or hobbled to back up catcher Jeremiah 
Klosterman when a throw was coming from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have torn cartilage or something, but I'm having  
surgery next week anyway,'' Varnes said. ``I didn't want to be old 
and gray and regret that I didn't pitch for the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Varnes left to a standing ovation after walking leadoff hitter  
Bobby Hill in the seventh. He allowed eight hits, six earned runs, 
four walks and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very, very surprised they decided to use him,'' Miami  
coach Jim Morris said. ``I had no idea who they were going to 
start. Varnes had a great season, and for him to be put in that 
position, he responded with a great effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD WATCH:* The crowd of 23,563 for the championship game  
increased total attendance for this year's CWS to a record 206,639. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record of 204,361 was established last year. It's  
the third straight year total attendance has surpassed 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The average attendance for individual sessions was 20,664,  
another record. The crowd of 24,859 for the late session on June 
13, a game between Oklahoma State and Rice, was also a 
single-session record. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was set in the June 12 game between Stanford and  
Cal State-Fullerton when the pitchers combined to hit five batters. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREAT THROW:* Florida State right fielder Matt Diaz made a  
great play to prevent a run in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	With runners on second and third, Miami's Lale Esquivel hit a  
fly ball to deep right. Bobby Hill tagged and ran for the plate, 
but Diaz's throw couldn't have been any better. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Jeremiah Klosterman had the plate blocked. Hill tried to  
slide around Klosterman's leg, but the ball arrived at the same 
time and Klosterman put down the tag for the last out of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ABSENT GOVERNOR:* Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had planned to attend  
the national title game involving two teams from his state. 
</P>
<P>
	According to publicists from both schools, Bush canceled after  
his wife was fined for failing to declare $19,000 in goods after an 
overseas trip. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEADS UP:* In the second inning, a foul ball came off the bat  
of Miami's Greg Lovelady and arched into the broadcast booth behind 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Arizona coach Jerry Kindall, analyzing the game for CBS,  
was cheered when he held up the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Omaha fans surely remembered Kindall. He and Southern  
California coach Mike Gillespie are the only men to win national 
titles as a player and a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie played on the USC team that won in 1961, then won last  
year's championship as the Trojans coach. Kindall was a member of 
Minnesota's title team in 1956 and coached Arizona to championships 
in 1980 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IN-STATE SHOWDOWNS:* It was the third time in the College World  
Series that schools from the same state played for the title. 
Previously, both teams were from California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine beat Cal State-Fullerton 3-2 in 1992 and Fullerton  
beat Southern California 11-5 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Looks for Holyfield Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis was in New York on Saturday night  
to scout a possible opponent, although he said his real mission was 
to push for a rematch with Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	And that rematch appeared closer following negotiating sessions  
Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner, operator of HBO and pay-per-view TVKO, had wanted  
Don King to sign an agreement that would allow them to order him to 
step aside as fight promoter should he be indicted in connection 
with the controversial first fight that ended in a draw March 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou DiBella, senior vice president of HBO Sports, said Saturday  
night that HBO was no longer insisting on King signing such an 
agreement and that if any action was taken to prevent King from 
promoting it, it would have to be taken by a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner sports, said a fight  
could happen if King agrees to pay Holyfield's purse and all the 
undercard purses while Time Warner will pay Lewis. Each fighter 
would be guaranteed $15 million for the Nov. 13 fight in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a lot more optimistic today than we were Thursday or  
Friday.'' Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still stumbling blocks, however. Panos Eliades, Lewis'  
British promoter, said he still has a matter to work out with King 
that involves money. Eliades also said, ``We need it (an agreement) 
done in the next four weeks because Lewis wants to fight this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, the WBC champion, could fight the winner of Saturday  
night's Michael Grant-Lou Savarese fight in The Theater at Madison 
Square Garden should the Holyfield rematch fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, however, said he was not thinking much about Grant or  
Savarese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I'm here to push for the rematch, it's time we made  
the fight,'' he said. ``Everybody knows what happened March 13. 
Everybody knows I won. That's in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers thought Lewis clearly outpointed Holyfield, the  
WBA and IBF champion, in the first fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, also was at The Theater on  
Saturday night and said, ``I think these two fighters want to 
fight. I think it would be a shame if it didn't take place.''

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign Former Jet O'Dwyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals, whose offensive line  
has been a weakness for years, have agreed to terms with Matt 
O'Dwyer, a starting guard for the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer received a two-year, $2.7 million contract.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Bengals signed Brian DeMarco of Jacksonville in an  
effort to shore up the team's weakest unit. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer had turned down a two-year, $4 million deal with Jets  
earlier in the spring. He had been seeking $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He started at right guard for the Jets' team that lost to Denver  
in January's AFC championship game. He played left guard in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals gave O'Dwyer $700,000 to sign, with $1 million  
salaries for this season and next, which counts $1.35 million 
against this year's salary cap. Brown still has about $2 million to 
spend on veterans.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Tom Lehman was attempting to set a U.S.  
Open record with his fifth straight year in the final twosome. That 
won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman's 3-over-par 73 Saturday left him with a three-round  
total of 10-over 220 and back in the pack heading into the final 18 
holes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really not hitting it that well,'' Lehman said after his  
round. ``My biggest problem has been my putting. I've made three 
birdies in three days and one was a chip-in. I have hit it good 
enough to where I should have been in the hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman was a good pick to be up front again this week  
considering he finished second last week at Memphis. However, he 
has thought too much about his mechanics this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are playing well, it's second nature; you don't  
really think about your swing, you step up and rip it,'' Lehman 
said. ``Right now, I am a little more conscious of what I'm trying 
to do because my swing feels so lousy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman said he won't feel any different not teeing off last in  
the Open on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a demanding course I'm still nervous on the first  
tee, even though I'm so far back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRICKER STRIKE:* The round of the day also included the best  
shot of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Stricker, the only player to break par Saturday in the  
Open with a 1-under 69, got an eagle on the par-4 third hole when 
he holed an 8-iron approach from a fairway bunker 138 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricker's shot hit just left and above the cup, bounced once  
and sucked back into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just heard the people going crazy,'' said Stricker, who  
didn't see the ball roll in. ``I had a good lie in the bunker and I 
could tell it was getting closer (to the hole) because of the way 
the people were reacting. To have that go in, you don't expect 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONGEST HOLES:* Pinehurst No. 2 has three of the five longest  
par-4s in Open history -- and they've played like it. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest par-4 hole in Open history, the 489-yard 16th, has  
played to an average of 4.5 strokes through three rounds. The 
482-yard fifth has been even more difficult, with a 4.6-stroke 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 8, which along with No. 16 were converted par-5s, has played  
to a 4.45 average. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16th hole has yielded just eight birdies, while No. 5 has  
given up 11 and No. 8 20. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BURNS BURNED:* Bob Burns would just as soon forget the front  
nine at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Nike Tour player of the year bogeyed the first six  
holes in Friday's second round. It got worse Saturday as Burns 
carded eight straight bogeys to start his round of 14-over-par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I set a couple of personal bests this week,'' Burns said,  
joking about his bogey binge on the front. ``I would have much 
rather made a triple (bogey) in there. This is something I've never 
done before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was 0-for-9 hitting greens on the front nine. That  
followed his 0-for-9 effort on the back nine in Friday's second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went 18 straight holes without hitting a green,'' Burns  
said. ``I mean, I hit some, but they didn't stay on. It was 
amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fun golf course but most golf courses lose their fun  
when the USGA gets hold of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DALY DASH:* John Daly entertained the media with wit and humor  
Thursday after his opening-round 68 left him one shot off the U.S. 
Open lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The charm wore off Saturday after Daly carded an 11-over 81 for  
his second straight Open collapse. Last year at The Olympic Club, 
Daly began with a 69, only to shoot 75, 75 and 78 to finish in a 
tie for 53rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly declined to talk to the media after his third-round  
disaster at Pinehurst, making a quick stop in the locker room and 
speeding off in his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly is sitting in a tie for 61st place at 16-over.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AMATEUR CHAMP:* Hank Kuehne, the only amateur to make the cut  
in the Open, continued to lose ground Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending U.S. Amateur champ got off to a rocky start when  
he hit his first drive out of bounds en route to an 81. That leaves 
the long hitter at 18-over-par 228 through three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, the first drive I got to tee it up again,'' said Kuehne,  
who hooked his first shot out of bounds left onto a road. ``That's 
the way it goes. If you make a bad swing, it doesn't matter where 
you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne, showing his youth and inconsistency, is second in the  
Open in driving distance at 287 yards, but last in fairways hit at 
38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the second major I've played in and I thought  
Augusta was extremely difficult, but this is beyond extremely 
difficult,'' he said. ``I have never played anything this hard. 
Even if you go up and drop the ball on the green there is no 
telling where it's going to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUKE FAN:* Former Open champion Tom Watson was wearing a Duke  
Golf Club hat during his third round. He said he wasn't worried 
about offending any North Carolina or N.C. State fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, but I'm getting a lot of cheers from the Duke fans,''  
Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson's daughter, Meg, is a sophomore at the private college in  
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to make enough here to pay her tuition there. A 77 is  
not going to do it,'' Watson said.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Have Their Backs to the Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- When the Dallas Stars played the Colorado  
Avalanche in the Western Conference finals, it was hard to imagine 
a playoff series with more intensity and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the Stanley Cup finals.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a series from an intensity standpoint that is much  
higher than the Colorado series even,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the Stars seven hard-fought games to beat the Avalanche,  
and they had to win the last two to do it. Now it's the Buffalo 
Sabres who are down 3-2, and the Stars have a chance to close out 
the series with a victory in Game 6 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a feel for anything right now, because the swings  
and momentum happen so quickly with these two teams and because 
both teams are fired up,'' Hitchcock said. ``I mean, you are seeing 
(long) shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had players last five minutes, never sat down on the  
bench, and they have had players doing the same thing. The 
emotional swings in these games are so dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' 2-0 victory in Dallas on Thursday night was typical --  
low scoring and high tension. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended in a fight between Buffalo's Rhett Warrener and Dallas'  
Derian Hatcher. Warrener, who suffered a broken ankle and underwent 
surgery on Friday, will be replaced by Darryl Shannon in a 
defensive pairing alongside Jay McKee. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's game featured a screaming match at the end  
between Hitchcock and Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff. On Friday, the 
Sabres accused the Stars of dirty tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch Pat Verbeek play, he turns his stick over every  
time, and it's a two-hand swing,'' Ruff said. ``Is that an intent 
to hurt one of our guys? It's darn close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said Ruff's comments were deliberately aimed at  
influencing the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can show you the video where some cheap shots were taken at  
us,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's the type of game it is. ... What he 
is hoping for is the referees read the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Guy Carbonneau said the Stars are not aiming to hurt any  
of the Sabres, but added, ``We will do anything to try to win the 
game. If they don't like it, that is too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the series has been a playoff classic -- if you like  
low-scoring, tight-checking games. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have combined for just 18 goals -- the lowest total  
after five games of the finals since 1947 when Montreal and Toronto 
had 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams emotionally really gave it all they had,'' Ruff  
said of Game 5 in Dallas. ``It was tight as tight can be. Not a lot 
of ice for either team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars finished with the best record in the NHL during the  
season, 23 points ahead of the Sabres, who were seeded No. 7 in the 
Eastern Conference. So far, regular-season records haven't meant a 
thing between these teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won the opener 3-2 in overtime, Dallas won 4-2, with  
the final goal an empty-netter, and then 2-1 before the Sabres tied 
the series with a 2-1 victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every shift is just so intense,'' said the Stars' Darryl  
Sydor, who scored the winning goal Thursday night. ``This is the 
time of year that everyone wants to play. You know, it builds and 
builds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the defensive style of play, there's another reason  
why the scores have been so low: goalies Ed Belfour of the Stars 
and Dominik Hasek of the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has faced 148 shots in the five games and given up nine  
goals; Belfour has faced 98 and given up eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that both goalies are under siege right now,''  
Hitchcock said. ``The shot totals are not indicative of the 
tenacity around each team's net. I think both guys are holding up 
pretty well because it is a very emotional scene in front of both 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Stars have a chance to win their first Stanley Cup in  
franchise history, and the Sabres have a chance to extend the 
series to seven games and send it back to Dallas for a Game 7 on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sabres were longshots before the series began, they are  
certainly even more so now. Only three of 15 teams who won Game 5 
with the series tied 2-2 have come back to win the Cup, the last 
Montreal in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to win,'' Buffalo's Dixon Ward said. ``I'm not going  
to guarantee anything, but we are going to go out there with full 
intention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is counting out the Sabres, especially considering the  
way the series has gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know,'' Hitchcock said. ``Us being up 3-2 in the  
series really is the only thing that any team should feel 
comfortable about right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no read on momentum, like there is no dominant  
player, there is no dominant area. It is just an absolute 
shift-by-shift battle.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs 80, Knicks 67 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs didn't need a great  
game to set the record for the longest single-season playoff 
winning streak and go up 2-0 in the NBA Finals. Tim Duncan and the 
cold-shooting New York Knicks made sure of that. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was nearly the lowest scoring game in finals history,  
the Spurs overcame their own offensive ineptitude to defeat the 
Knicks 80-67 on Friday night. Once again, Duncan led the way for 
San Antonio, scoring 25 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and adding 
four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Duncan wasn't as dominant as he was in Game 1, when he  
had 33 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very ugly win. No way to hide that,'' he said. ``But  
we win best when it's ugly. We can pull those types of games out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs broke a tie with the 1988 Los Angeles Lakers for the  
playoff streak, winning their 12th straight game in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were also close to shattering the old record of 145  
combined points set by Syracuse and Fort Wayne in 1955. But a 
3-pointer by Jaren Jackson with 10 seconds left and a meaningless 
bucket by the Knicks at the buzzer kept the teams from that dubious 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Duncan and David Robinson, who had 16 points, 11  
rebounds and five blocks, no other player had an outstanding night 
for the Spurs. Nonetheless they have produced the greatest run of 
playoff success in the NBA's 52-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio shot just 2-for-12 on 3-pointers, missed 11 of 35  
free throws and let the Knicks stick around much longer than they 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to New York with an advantage, but I don't think  
we've outplayed them,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``We've 
just knocked down some shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no secret formula to this victory. All the Spurs had  
to do was watch the Knicks shoot -- or try to. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it was layups, dunks, wide-open jumpers from behind  
screens or drives into the lane, New York missed plenty of each. 
</P>
<P>
	Never was it worse than in the fourth quarter when the Knicks  
went nearly seven minutes without a field goal, a drought that was 
epitomized by a shot from Allan Houston hitting the shot clock 
right as it expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell finally broke the field-goal drought on a  
jumper with 1:32 left, but Duncan answered right away with an 
alley-oop dunk that made it 71-61 and led to chants of ``Sweep, 
Sweep'' from the Alamodome crowd of 39,554 -- the second-largest in 
finals history. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 is Monday night at Madison Square Garden, where the  
Knicks will be faced with the daunting task of trying to become 
just the eighth team ever to come back from a 2-0 deficit in a 
best-of-7 series. It has happened only twice in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never think sweep,'' Duncan said. ``We think one game at a  
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell led the Knicks with 26 points but shot just 8-for-22  
from the field. Larry Johnson pitched in a 2-for-12 effort, Chris 
Childs was 2-for-8 and Kurt Thomas was 1-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's total was the second lowest in finals history since  
the advent of the 24-second shot clock in the 1954-55 season. The 
Utah Jazz scored just 54 against the Chicago Bulls last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Elie had 15 and Sean Elliott 10 for the Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio didn't paint the prettiest picture with its play,  
either. The Spurs failed to grab an offensive rebound in the first 
half and finished with just five -- all by Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense really kept us in there tonight,'' Robinson said.  
``To a certain extent, they're thinking about coming to the hole. 
They understand it's not going to be easy to get to the rim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York was within striking distance early in the fourth before  
their long drought. After Thomas made a jumper to make it 58-53, 
San Antonio responded with an 11-4 run including five straight 
points by Robinson -- a dunk, a jumper and a free throw -- for a 
69-57 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell ended a 5 1/2 minute scoreless streak by making two free  
throws with 2:21 left, but by then it was too late for a Knicks 
team that missed 18 of 19 shots in one stretch and didn't reach 50 
points until the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York managed only four fast-break points and committed  
nearly twice as many fouls as San Antonio -- 25-13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main focus is settling down and getting that first  
one,'' New York's Marcus Camby said. ``Guys on this team have a lot 
of pride. We definitely don't want to get swept, and I don't think 
that's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs didn't grab their first offensive rebound until 4 1/2  
minutes into the third quarter, and Duncan, who had 33 points and 
16 rebounds in Game 1, turned it into a three-point play for a 
49-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks got within three late in the period but were stymied  
on their next three trips downcourt. Duncan grabbed the Spurs' 
third offensive rebound and converted a put-back with seven-tenths 
of a second left in the quarter to give San Antonio a 56-49 lead 
entering the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the second quarter, Duncan had five points in a 10-2 run  
that helped San Antonio open a 39-30 lead, but New York closed 
within five at the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and Sprewell led all scorers with 12 points apiece at  
intermission, and the most interesting stats were the Spurs' 
offensive rebounds (none) and fouls (five) and the Knicks' shooting 
percentage (29.8). 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs led 20-15 after a first quarter in which the Knicks  
missed two layups and a dunk and generally blurred the line between 
playing recklessly and with intensity, just as coach Jeff Van Gundy 
had feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson hit a running right-handed hook shot just before  
the first-quarter buzzer, ending a 12-minute period in which the 
Knicks took 27 shots to San Antonio's 20 and outrebounded the Spurs 
17-11 yet never led. The Spurs were not called for any fouls in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Spurs coach Gregg Popovich screamed at a member of the  
arena staff after acrid-smelling smoke from a pyrotechnic display 
drifted into his players' faces during a timeout. The smoke was set 
off as part of a dunking skit involving a mascot. ... Bruce 
Hornsby, former keyboard player for the Grateful Dead, played the 
national anthem on the piano. ... Spike Lee and his entourage were 
booed as they arrived.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Struck by Car in Maine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Horror author Stephen King was seriously  
injured when he was struck by a van while walking near his home 
Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	King was walking south on the shoulder of Route 5 in North  
Lovell, where he owns a home, at about 4:30 p.m. when a motorist 
approaching from behind lost control of his Dodge Caravan because 
of a dog that was loose inside, Oxford County Sheriff's deputy Matt 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston said the  
51-year-old King was in serious but stable condition. King suffered 
``significant'' injuries including broken bones but was conscious 
and alert, hospital spokesman Laird Covey said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the driver, Bryan Smith, 41, did not  
appear to be speeding, Baker said. He said charges will not be 
filed against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who responded to the accident, said King was lying in a  
depression about 14 feet off the road and appeared to have been 
thrown by the collision. The van's windshield was broken and the 
right front corner of the car was crunched in from the impact of 
striking him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hurting, but he was able to communicate,'' Baker said.  
``He was talking to me. He gave me phone numbers of where to call 
his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in a lot of pain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he could tell King's leg was broken and he was  
bleeding from a laceration on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he didn't know where King was going.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see him all the time, walking,'' he said. ``It's just like  
anybody going out for a walk in the evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King has written more than two dozen novels, including ``The  
Shining,'' ``Carrie'' and ``Pet Sematary.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Democrats Defy National Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina Democrats have defied the  
national party by advancing the date of their primary election. If 
that angers the potentates in Washington, then that's just too bad. 
</P>
<P>
	State Democrats this week voted to join South Carolina  
Republicans in holding primary elections on February 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this primary, if held on the same day as the  
Republicans', will allow people to do some comparison shopping,'' 
state party Chairman Dick Harpootlian said. ``That allows us to 
build a party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats here aren't very bashful about poking a finger in the  
eye of the national party leadership, and the reason, experts say, 
is practical necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The national Democratic Party basically is viewed by South  
Carolinians as -- how should I say this -- a little too liberal?'' 
said Clemson University political scientist Bruce Ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hodges was thought to have little chance of defeating  
incumbent Republican David Beasley last year. With a Democrat at 
the helm for the first time in 12 years, the state party must shed 
the old leftist guard to rebuild, and the national party and the 
Clinton-Gore administration are a liability, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more Hodges can position himself as an independent thinker  
standing up to the national party, the better off he is,'' said 
University of South Carolina political scientist John Cavanaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	National Democratic party rules allow only Iowa and New  
Hampshire to hold presidential contests before the first Tuesday in 
March, and Democrats here have been warned they could face 
sanctions at the national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges didn't sound too concerned: ``If we get bad hotel rooms,  
so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina will seek a waiver from the national committee  
for the early primary. If that's denied, the state could simply 
ignore the national party or hold a nonbinding primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Annoyance with the national party started during last year's  
elections when Vice President Al Gore and other leaders snubbed 
Hodges' campaign. Calls to the national party for financial support 
yielded about $50,000 for a $9.1 million governor's race, the most 
expensive in state history, Harpootlian said. Hodges spent almost 
$4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me explain to you the national Democratic Party's  
involvement in our victory last year,'' said Harpootlian. ``None. 
Zero. Nada. Zilch. Minus. Didn't help. Weren't here. Didn't call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee downplayed any  
friction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like any family, there are disagreements every once in a  
while,'' said Peter Kauffmann, spokesman for the Democratic 
National Committee. ``But we are still a family. We are still 
dedicated to the same issues and values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the message South Carolina Democrats want to  
send. One in five Republicans helped Hodges win office, and the 
governor wants to hold moderate votes in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats here tend to align themselves to the right of the  
national party on such issues as values, national defense and 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	They've succeeded in the South ``to the degree that they've been  
able to unshackle themselves'' from the national party, said Tucker 
Eskew, a Republican strategist who worked on Beasley's failed 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Market Shrugs at Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As far as the stock market is concerned, the  
Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	So if the nation's central bankers do indeed implement a  
quarter-point increase in short-term rates later this month, 
analysts expect little if any damage -- or benefit -- on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	With only 10 days to go before the Fed's policy-making Open  
Market Committee meeting, the stock market is remarkably 
angst-free. The reason is that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually 
a master of suspense and verbal obfuscation, for once stated his 
position on interest rates clearly and unmistakably. In testimony 
before Congress Thursday, Greenspan said of a rate increase: 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest  
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at 
a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had already been counting on a rate hike for the last  
few weeks, but, nervous about the size of an increase, were selling 
stocks off. They were greatly relieved by Greenspan's use of the 
word ``modest'' and considered a 0.25 percentage point rise a done 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when the increase actually takes effect, there should be  
little reaction in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all intents and purposes, they might as well have raised  
interest rates today,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment 
strategist at Lehman Brothers after Greenspan's Capitol Hill 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Even financial services stocks such as banks and brokerage firms  
are expected to do well when the rate hike happens. These companies 
are most vulnerable to rate increases; they have to pay higher 
interest to depositors and they also suffer a drop in interest 
income the demand for loans falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial stocks were pummeled in recent weeks, but the day  
Greenspan spoke, most did rather nicely. Citigroup was up 13/16 to 
46 15/16, while First Union gained 1 9/16 to 44 5/16 and Merrill 
Lynch picked up 1 15/16, rising to 74 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate also noted that high-tech stocks, another group that  
tumbled in recent weeks as traders expected a rate hike, also did 
well after Greenspan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts were calling the market's gains this past week a  
relief rally. But another reason for the market's response to 
Greenspan is that while higher interest rates are usually bad for 
profits, Wall Street trusts the Fed chairman to be doing the right 
thing for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are comfortable that the (economic) expansion is  
being managed quite well by the Fed,'' said Robert Freedman, chief 
investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. 
``Greenspan has built up an awful lot of confidence in the 
investment community over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, you can never be too sure. What if the Fed surprises  
everyone and takes a bigger step up than the market expects? Or, 
faced with evidence over the next few months that inflation really 
is picking up momentum, it embarks on a series of increases? 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at  
Josepthal &AMP; Co., the financial stocks would slide. So would home 
builders, as rising mortgage rates drive up the cost of buying a 
house. If consumers grow nervous and cut back their spending, 
General Motors and Ford Motor could see their sales and stocks 
falling. So might retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Who might win? The companies whose businesses fare well in a  
weak economy because people need their products anyway. Candidates 
include consumer products companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, 
Procter and Gamble and Kimberly Clark. Even Philip Morris could 
benefit because its large food and beverage business makes 
everything from Miller Beer to Kraft cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	But as far as the impending rate hike goes, ``the stock market  
is not going to be affected short-term,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose every day this past week,  
gaining 365.05 over the five days and more than wiping out a 
309-point drop the previous week. On Friday, the blue chips rose 
13.93, closing at 10,855.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index also had a great week, achieving its  
biggest one-day point gain, 103.16, on Wednesday. The 
technology-dominated index had a 115.56 gain for the week after 
rising 19.29 to 2,563.44 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 49.20 for the week, closing  
up 2.94 Friday at 1,342.84. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange composite was up 17.05 for the week,  
rising 0.48 Friday to 636.55. The American Stock Exchange composite 
picked up 2.75 on the week and closed at 768.57 despite a drop of 
0.12 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of  
small-company stocks, rose 7.04 for the week to 445.05, having 
risen 1.67 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- 
ended the week at $12.269 trillion, up $286.56 billion from the 
previous week. A year ago the index was $10.363 trillion.

	Today is Sunday, June 20, the 171st day of 1999. There are 194  
days left in the year. This is Father's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On June 20, 1756, in India, a group of British soldiers was

<HEADLINE> Genetically Altered Food Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of consumer advocates wants labels  
required for genetically altered foods, continuing a biotechnology 
debate that has already swept across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Natural Law Party, with consumer groups, scientists and  
farmers, announced last week it had gathered 500,000 signatures of 
Americans in support of government labeling of genetically 
engineered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	They plan to submit the signatures to the White House, members  
of Congress and several federal agencies in hopes of forcing 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say why rush it onto the market before we know it's safe,''  
said Bob Ross, a spokesman for the Natural Law Party. ``Why not 
give consumers a choice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sheldon Krimsky, a professor of urban and environmental  
policy at Tufts University, ``Until we are satisfied that we know 
what questions to ask and that we are fully empowered to test the 
products of biotechnology, industry and regulators will be 
operating by seat-of-the-pants assessment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also were behind the campaign last year in which the  
Agriculture Department received more than 250,000 letters urging 
that national standards for organic products bar genetic 
engineering. The agency agreed to the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	While critics say labels on biotech foods will give consumers a  
choice, the food and biotechnology industries say the proposal is 
expensive and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The products of ag biotechnology have been subjected to more  
scrutiny than any other products in humanity,'' said Val Giddings, 
vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, adding 
that the products have been tested extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no scientific basis for putting that on. If you put  
that on a label, the implication will unavoidably be that this has 
some health significance, and it does not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal task force of representatives from the Agriculture  
Department, Food and Drug Administration, State Department, 
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Trade Representative's 
office is reviewing the labeling issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has stressed there has been  
no change in the government's policy that food should be labeled 
only if ingredients change the nutritional content or could cause 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence in biotechnology and the industry's confidence  
in biotechnology are ultimately irrelevant if the consumers aren't 
buying,'' Glickman said last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't force-feed GMOs (genetically modified organisms) to  
reluctant consumers. We have to bring them along. The public 
opinion poll is as important as the test tube.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the largest producer of bioengineered  
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops that are often genetically altered and used in products  
include corn for chips and cereals, tomatoes for spaghetti sauce, 
cotton for blue jeans, and corn syrup for sodas. 
</P>
<P>
	By breeding genes in crops, U.S. scientists say they have  
managed to improve taste and make plants more resistant to disease 
and insects. Advocates contend that insect-resistant crops reduce 
the need for heavy doses of pesticides and other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. enthusiasm for genetically engineered crops is far from  
matched overseas, particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Several European and Asian nations are implementing or proposing  
labeling laws that would distinguish foods containing genetically 
modified ingredients. Some food companies overseas, especially in 
Great Britain, say they will not sell food with bioengineered 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the United States managed to avert labeling demands  
by several countries as part of a U.N.-initiated Biosafety 
Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, American scientists revealed they had discovered  
that pollen from a widely planted laboratory-designed strain of 
corn can kill monarch butterflies -- a finding noted by opponents of 
genetic engineering though refuted by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another piece of news that has eroded the consumers  
confidence in the whole process of genetic engineering,'' Ross 
said. ``The American people ... are not going to sit back anymore 
and take food being forced on them by the biotech industry.''

<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored twice and assisted on  
New England's third goal as the Revolution beat the Tampa Bay 
Mutiny 3-2 Saturday night in Majoe League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore broke a 2-2 tie with a low shot from 16 yards that banked  
in off the left post in the 81st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time World Cup performer opened the scoring four minutes  
into the game and set up a goal by Jair in the 62nd minute that put 
New England ahead 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution won its fourth in five games despite the loss of  
midfielder John Harkes, who left with an injured left hamstring 
midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Marino, a second-half substitute, tied the match 2-2 in the  
75th minute for Tampa Bay. Musa Shannon scored the Mutiny's other 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore put New England ahead 1-0 when he intercepted Chad  
McCarty's pass and scored from 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny tied it in the 34th minute when Shannon went around  
defender Brian Dunseth to score from point-blank range. Steve 
Trittschuh, acquired from Colorado on Tuesday, assisted.

<HEADLINE> Cops, Crowd Clash at Car Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Police fired rubber bullets into a  
crowd of about 2,000 people after a disturbance broke out during a 
classic car show. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began around 11 p.m. Friday when a multi-agency  
police force attempted to close businesses and block traffic from 
entering the downtown area after the crowd attending the Car d'Lane 
Classic Car Cruise became unruly. 
</P>
<P>
	A wall of officers marched forward chanting ``Back, back, back''  
in an attempt to push the crowd out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Several individuals then hurled beer bottles, rocks and other  
debris at officers. In response, one officer fired a riot gun into 
the crowd in the area from which the bottles were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers proceeded to club, spray mace, drag and arrest crowd  
members, rioters and onlookers who would not disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer was heard yelling into his radio, ``I've got about  
3,000 people down here starting a riot! I need help now!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not release information on the number of arrests. A  
supervisor at Kootenai Medical Center said five people were 
evaluated this morning for minor scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said festivities turned sour when a man on a  
motorcycle sped out on the street in front of a bar. After the man 
was ticketed by an officer patrolling on foot, patrons of the bar 
came out and joined the crowd already on the street and began 
booing, throwing debris and screaming profanities at officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The already-heavily patrolled downtown area swelled with law  
enforcement as additional local, county and state police officers 
were called to the scene. Several streets were blocked off. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were calm by early morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, in Eugene, Ore., police arrested 15 people after a  
parade featuring 300 anarchists became unruly. The disturbance 
began when some demonstrators veered from the parade route and 
walked into traffic, confronting motorists. Police in riot gear 
used tear gas to dispel the crowd. Minor injures were reported.

</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, an often gruff  
and always imposing figure in Texas politics for more than 40 
years, died Friday. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released. Bullock, who had suffered  
various health problems over the years, most recently was 
hospitalized for congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Bullock, a Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor --  
a powerful job in a state that sharply limits the governor's 
authority. Bullock presided over the Texas Senate, made committee 
appointments, sat on key government boards and controlled the flow 
of legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, the state ended a court-ordered school  
funding crisis, saw a once shaky budget balloon to a $6 billion 
surplus, and overhauled the civil justice system to impose limits 
on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he served four terms as state comptroller, the state's  
chief tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
	After deciding in 1997 not to seek a third term as lieutenant  
governor, Bullock announced plans to give away his 
multimillion-dollar campaign bank account, donating much of it to 
Texas colleges and universities.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Francisco Diaz Roncero, a longtime Associated Press  
correspondent who devoted more than 70 years of his life to 
journalism and never retired, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Roncero began his AP career in 1926 in Madrid, Spain and  
returned to the agency in 1969 in Paris, where he worked nearly 
every day until just weeks before his death, covering France for 
the Spanish-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he covered the Cannes Film Festival for the 51st time.  
</P>
<P>
	He covered nearly every major sports and political event,  
including more than 20 Tour de France cycling races. 
</P>
<P>
	Roncero took a job with the Havas news agency in 1939 and began  
flooding Spain with radio reports broadcast from Paris, his 
countrymen's only source of uncensored news. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Germans invaded France in June 1940, he went  
underground, working with a Resistance group made up of 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he rejoined Havas, which later became  
Agence-France-Presse. He returned to AP in Paris in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	He received numerous awards during his career, including  
France's Legion of Honor and the Order of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Diaz Roncero was nearly finished  
working on a book about his life, titled: ``My First 70 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his daughter.

	James Terrance ``Terry'' Gill most recently worked for KNBC-TV  
in Los Angeles. Gill worked for the station from 1968 until his 
retirement in 1993, and produced broadcasts for Tom Brokaw, Tom 
Snyder, Jess Marlow, Paul Moyer and Kelly Lange. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to moving to California, Gill wrote sports and news copy  
at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis. He moved to KSTP from the Tribune, where 
he was a copy editor in the late 1950s.

	MENDOTA HEIGHTS, Minn. (AP) -- Bill McGivern, a longtime  
journalist for KSTP-TV in St. Paul, died Wednesday of liver cancer. 
He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	McGivern joined KSTP-TV and Radio in 1951. He helped the  
television station popularize regularly scheduled daily news shows, 
which at the time were an innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	McGivern also did field reporting. In 1957, with KSTP  
photographer Dick Hance, he recorded the fatal confrontation 
between two bank robbers and police in an Anoka County game 
reserve. He also covered the state Legislature in the late 1960s 
and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	McGivern was news director of the station when he left in 1973  
to become public relations director for the St. Paul Port 
Authority. He retired from the agency in 1991.

	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Stone, a social historian and  
founding director of a historical studies center at Princeton 
University, died Wednesday of Parkinson's disease. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's research interests spanned a broad period of England  
history, or, in his words, ``from the War of the Roses through the 
Tudor regime to the Cromwellian Revolution and beyond into the 18th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from Oxford,  
Stone remained there until 1962 as a lecturer and a fellow. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Princeton faculty in 1963 and was chairman of the  
history department between 1967 and 1970. In 1968, he was named 
founding director of the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical

<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver's police chief on Saturday said security  
might have to supersede students' rights in the wake of the 
Columbine massacre, and others called for school prayer, gun 
control and stronger families to prevent another killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we have to close off the campuses, so kids cannot leave  
the school grounds for lunch,'' the police chief, Tom Sanchez, said 
at a summit on school safety attended by teen-agers, public 
officials and national experts. ``Maybe kids will have to give up 
some of their individual rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens said he hoped the shootings at Columbine High  
School would raise public awareness of growing violence in schools. 
On April 20, two students opened fire, killing a teacher and 12 
classmates, before turning the guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more children are murdering children ... there is  
something profoundly wrong with our state and our nation,'' he 
said, adding that he hoped ``Colorado can help lead the nation on 
the road to recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 25 Colorado high school students at the summit said  
they had seen guns in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gang members, drug dealers, so many people have guns,'' said  
recent high school graduate Ben Gelt. Like others, he said he never 
``snitched'' on students who were armed because he feared 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Ken Salazar called for an anonymous tip  
system, whereby students could inform police about weapons without 
fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students said there needed to be more trust between  
students and teachers; some wanted to see a return to prayer in the 
classroom; some called for tougher gun laws; and almost all wanted 
parents to spend more quality time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gotta start at home,'' said Estee Blatter, 17, who will  
be a senior at Columbine High School next year. ``Moms and dads 
need to teach their children right from wrong. I don't think it's 
the school's responsibility to pick up what's gone amiss in the 
homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of religious leaders, law enforcement officials, youth  
counselors, school board members, teachers, and state 
representatives also attended the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some black leaders were angered the event was scheduled during  
Juneteenth, a festival celebrating the emancipation of slaves 
during the Civil War. The Urban League and six other 
African-American groups will hold a second conference on youth 
violence later this year.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Mull E-Commerce Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCCALL, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho's industry and government leaders  
worry that the state's growing e-commerce trade could impact 
Idaho's tax revenue and cause unfair competition for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt told about 100 industry and state  
government leaders that sales over the Internet are taxed 
haphazardly or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system will not work in the 21st century,'' Leavitt said  
Friday. ``It's fundamentally unfair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne and U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
President Tom Donohue addressed the annual convention of the Idaho 
Association of Commerce and Industry, the state's most influential 
business organization. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's 25th anniversary meeting focused on business in  
transition. The threat posed by e-commerce was a common thread 
running throughout Friday's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned about how traditional business will cope,''  
Donohue said. ``You can't set up a system that bypasses state tax 
systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to have an impact on the revenue stream in this  
state,'' Idaho House Republican Floor Leader Frank Bruneel of 
Lewiston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt cited as an example a recent purchase he made over the  
Internet. While traveling in California, he ordered groceries from 
a New York company to be delivered to his Utah home.

	``How do you determine who ought to get that (tax) money?'' he  
asked. ``We have to sort this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those on hand said they could not imagine Internet  
shopping becoming a huge force because people like to try on and 
handle merchandise. But Amy Kleiner, governmental affairs manager 
for Micron Technology Inc., said there may be an generational 
difference between traditional and Internet shoppers. 
</P>

	As a busy working mother, Kleiner said she often finds herself  
ordering merchandise off the Internet at 1 a.m.

<HEADLINE> NASA Satellite Studies Ocean Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Winds blowing across whitecaps far out on  
Earth's blue oceans are bringing your future weather, and, maybe, a 
portent of the next El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists trying to improve forecasting and storm warning will  
soon begin measuring those breezes, gusts and howling furies with 
QuikScat, a satellite being launched this weekend on a nearly $100 
million mission to study the global dance of wind and water. 
</P>
<P>
	QuikScat was scheduled for launch on a Titan II rocket tonight  
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Its science instrument, dubbed SeaWinds, is an antenna that will  
radiate microwave pulses and gather the return signals, daily 
collecting a continuous 1,100-mile-wide band that will amount to 
400,000 measurements over 90 percent of Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The measurements of wind speeds and directions at the surface of  
the oceans will be put into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's weather forecasting models. The data will also be 
studied by scientists looking for long-term trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially for people along the coast, this is very important  
because it will give us much more accurate weather forecasting,'' 
said James Graf, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to track what's happening with a phenomenon like  
El Nino you have to be out over the surface of the ocean measuring 
what's happening out there because that's what's affecting, 
essentially, precipitation over land thousands of miles away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Atlantic already having produced its first tropical  
storm of the season, hurricane meteorologists are eager to see what 
the new satellite can show them. Graf said those forecasters will 
begin getting data for testing within 60 days of launch. 
</P>
<P>
	QuikScat is short for Quick Scatterometer. The satellite is a  
``quick'' replacement for a NASA instrument mounted on a Japanese 
spacecraft that failed in 1997. Scatterometer refers to measurement 
of the reflected signals -- the scatter. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino, the ocean-warming phenomenon involved in destructive  
weather changes, is linked to wind reversal in the western Pacific. 
In its short life, the lost instrument, Nscat, did detect such a 
reversal heralding the 1996-97 El Nino, Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, brightly colored images of El Nino and its cool  
counterpart, La Nina, have been produced from data from another 
spacecraft, the U.S.-French Topex/Poseidon satellite, which 
measures sea surface height as an indicator of temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think of Topex as our sister measurement,'' Graf  
said. ``I like to think of it as the yin and the yang that's 
happening out there on the surface of the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	QuikScat, its launch and a two-year mission were funded at $93  
million, but a launch delay has added another $5 million in costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was ready to go up in November but was pushed back  
because of a series of failures involving Titans, the powerful 
launch vehicle built by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent Titan launch, from Vandenberg, was a success.

	Leaders Mull Kosovo Reconstruction  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- World leaders today haggled over a  
promised huge reconstruction program for Kosovo as Russia sought to 
get Yugoslavia included in the deal even though President Slobodan 
Milosevic remains in power. On the second day of their annual 
summit, leaders of the United States, five other NATO nations and 
Japan attempted to block diplomatically the latest bid by Russia, 
German officials said. ``The leaders of the countries that are 
going to be providing the money are not prepared to provide 
assistance to an unreformed Serbia,'' a senior U.S. official said.

	Bono Leads Protest for Debt Relief  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Led by Irish rocker Bono, at least  
20,000 people held hands to form a human chain today around the 
Group of Eight summit city protesting a deal for Third World debt 
relief they say doesn't go far enough. Bono, of the band U2, and 
other musicians joined the effort organized by the Jubilee 2000 
Coalition, an international church-led movement that wants Western 
nations to scrap the debts to mark the new millennium. ``We 
appreciate the absurdity of how it looks, spoiled rock stars on 
this serious issue,'' said Bono. But celebrity pressure is 
necessary, he said, to generate the public pressure necessary for 
world leaders to take action.

	Gore Jabs Bush Over Gun Lawsuit Law

<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took a thinly veiled  
jab at Gov. George W. Bush after the Republican signed legislation 
limiting Texas cities' ability to sue gun sellers and 
manufacturers. ``The stakes are too high for any presidential 
candidate to stand on the sidelines'' of the gun control debate, 
Gore said at a Los Angeles campaign speech yesterday. Nearly two 
dozen cities and counties around the nation have sued gun makers in 
efforts to recover damages for crimes involving firearms.

	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Filipino businessman accused of  
making illegal contributions to President Clinton's campaign said 
in an interview published here today that he will fight the 
charges. The U.S. Embassy asked Manila this week to extradite Mark 
Jimenez on a variety of charges, including the illegal 
contributions and tax evasion. In an interview with the Philippine

persecuted by the U.S. government.

	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The International Red Cross wants  
security guarantees from the Taliban Islamic militia after masked 
men badly beat several of the organization's workers, the aid group 
said today. It was the first time Red Cross staff have been 
assaulted since the Taliban religious army took control of the 
capital, Kabul, and much of the country in 1996. The workers were 
beaten Wednesday after six masked men stopped their vehicle.

	WINDSOR, England (AP) -- Well-wishers gathered today in the  
streets of Windsor to see Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones on 
their wedding day. Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son and his bride 
are holding what has been billed as a family service at St. 
George's Chapel inside Windsor Castle. The congregation of 550 
people will be studded with royalty -- including cousins from Europe 
-- but they will be there as family, not as state visitors. The 
prince, a 35-year-old television producer, and his 34-year-old 
bride, a middle-class public relations executive, have known each 
other for six years.

on by the Olympics' worst scandal. Turin won 53-36 in a secret 
ballot by the International Olympic Committee, the first selection 
of a host city since the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. The 
lopsided result reflected the deep resentment toward Marc Hodler, 
the Swiss IOC member who blew the whistle on Olympic corruption in

their 12th straight postseason game, overcoming their own offensive 
ineptitude and defeating the cold-shooting Knicks for a 2-0 lead in 
the best of-7 series. Tim Duncan had 25 points and 15 rebounds for 
the winners. Game 3 is Monday night in New York.

<HEADLINE> Time Capsules a Rage As 2000 Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- When the call went out for the stuff of  
life, Irene Mundy answered with a new toothbrush, eye drops and a 
sheet of Barney the purple dinosaur stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 92-year-old former teacher had scoured her shelves for the  
minutiae of daily life that might someday have historical 
significance and, so, ought to be preserved in a time capsule 
buried in front of her retirement high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the world, people are commemorating the new millennium by  
stuffing photos, toys and newspaper clippings into time capsules of 
all stripes, with visions of their discovery 25, 50 or even 1,000 
years hence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just non-stop,'' says Janet Reinhold, director of Future  
Packaging &AMP; Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Covina, Calif., company that sells high-end time capsules  
for professional preservation has seen business double in each of 
the last three years. Ms. Reinhold has sold about 1,000 capsules 
this year and expects to sell at least 50,000 before millennium 
madness subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is going time-capsule crazy,'' says Paul Hudson, a  
history professor who co-founded the International Time Capsule 
Society and says 1,400 groups have registered capsules with the 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern craze for time capsules began 60 years ago at the  
1939 New York World's Fair. The Westinghouse Corp. pavilion 
displayed a torpedo-shaped capsule containing Depression-era items: 
slide rule, Sears &AMP; Roebuck catalog, alarm clock and Mickey Mouse 
cup. Westinghouse buried the capsule inside a tunnel on the site 
and said it intended the items to stay undisturbed for 5,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion capsule went in nearby at the 1964 World's Fair. It  
contained more modern items, including a Polaroid camera, plastic 
heart valve, freeze-dried food and a Beatles record. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world's first and probably most scholarly time capsule  
resides at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta. The ``Crypt of 
Civilization,'' built atop a former indoor swimming pool, is 20 
feet long, 10 feet high and 10 feet deep. It holds thousands of 
items -- from Lincoln Logs, dental floss and newsreels of Adolf 
Hitler to a toaster, the works of Shakespeare and more than 640,000 
pages on microfilm. 
</P>
<P>
	The crypt received its first items in 1938 and was sealed in  
1940. Its massive steel door remains sealed -- with any luck until 
the year 8113. The crypt's creator estimated that 1940 fell midway 
between the start of the first Egyptian time-keeping and 8113. 
</P>
<P>
	As the year 2000 draws near, groups in Canada, England, Cyprus,  
New Zealand and Fiji are pushing plans for large-scale capsule 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Zealand, a huge ``Millennium Vault'' stuffed with the  
paraphernalia of 20th century life will be buried beneath a pyramid 
covered by a bronze relief depicting 1,000 years of New Zealand 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most quixotic project is taking shape in the hills  
of western Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Lane Baumgardner, a Winslow, Ark., machinist, dreamed  
up a massive complex of four pyramids with flattened points that 
would hold important items of the late 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's invested about $20,000 toward building the  
so-called U.S. Time Capsule between Fayetteville and Fort Smith. He 
says he has received almost 1,000 inquiries from people willing to 
pay $210 for a 1-foot-by-2-foot spot. He is hoping for 500 
applicants from each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to die and be forgotten,'' says Baumgardner, 43.  
``I don't want to die and just fade away. Here's my chance, in a 
thousand years, to let people know, `I was here. Here's what I 
did.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The do-it-yourself archivist can find everything for the task  
from the whimsical to the deadly serious -- from a lightweight, 
colorful ``My Millennium'' canister that arrives in the mail filled 
with popcorn to custom-made, airtight steel, brass or titanium 
canisters welded shut in the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	A few firms will even pump out the oxygen and fill time capsules  
with Silica gel to soak up moisture or argon or nitrogen gas to 
preserve fragile contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Such meticulous preservation is expensive. Future Packaging &AMP;  
Preservation charges $5,200 for a 30-inch long, 14-inch wide time 
capsule dubbed ``The QE II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For $95, Steamer Trunk Merchants, an Internet gift company in  
New York, will mail an English-made, 8 1/2-inch brass cylinder with 
rubber seals. It comes with five blank scrolls, a calligraphy pen 
and bottle of blue ink, gold sealing wax and a seal bearing the 
millennium year in Roman numerals, MM. 
</P>
<P>
	The Time Capsule Society has one tip for people wanting to bury  
artifacts for posterity: Mark the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 10,000 time capsules already out there have been  
forgotten, Hudson says. Perhaps only one in 1,000 are unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Stawberry's Fate With Yanks Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Darryl Strawberry will be eligible to  
return to baseball for the final 7 1/2 weeks of the season, the New 
York Yankees must figure out if they have a place for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we come together again remains to be seen,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said Friday after commissioner Bud Selig decided 
the suspension will run through Aug. 11. ``We're not going to know 
anything until he's ready and we see what our situation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's suspension will total 120 days, retroactive to his  
April 14 arrest in Tampa, Fla. Selig suspended Strawberry 
indefinitely on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy there may be a light at the end of the tunnel  
for Darryl,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Strawberry, who has repeatedly found himself in  
alcohol, drug and tax trouble since 1987, could return slightly 
sooner, with Selig saying he will review the situation July 22 
because of ``mitigating health factors.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people had second, third chances. Why not him?''  
Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis said. ``Steve Howe had 29,000 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his ailing left knee, Strawberry will need several  
weeks in the minor leagues to rehabilitate, meaning the best-case 
scenario is probably a return to the majors sometime around Sept. 
1, when active rosters expand from 25 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who served a 90-day suspension in 1995 after testing  
positive for cocaine, was slated to be a left-field candidate 
before his arrest. He hit .247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs last 
year, his best season since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees broke camp before the start of the season, he  
remained at their Tampa training complex because he had not yet 
recovered from colon cancer surgery last fall, an illness that 
caused him to miss the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argued that chemotherapy might have caused a depression  
that led to a drug relapse. Others in baseball wanted Strawberry 
suspended for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good decision,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone,  
Strawberry's closest friend on the team, said in the clubhouse 
after the decision was announced. ``If he walks through that door, 
I'll be the first one to shake his hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who last spoke with Strawberry 3-4 weeks ago, said it was  
too early to assess Strawberry's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's been doing,'' Torre said. ``A lot of it  
has to do with how much he's been working out. ... He's still going 
to need (minor league) games before he's ready for games. He's 
going to need a few weeks of games because he's not going to be 
able to play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry pleaded no contest to cocaine possession and  
solicitation charges and was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 
100 hours' community service. 
</P>
<P>
	He also must undergo more drug treatment, be tested twice a week  
and pay $456 in court fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who had gone through cancer and chemotherapy,  
and who also had done a lot of good the last three years,'' Cone 
said. ``I think that given this decision, that was taken into 
account.''

<HEADLINE> Sayarshan Takes Golden Gate Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- French-bred Sayarshan, racing for the  
first time on American soil, rallied from last with a powerful 
stretch run to win the $200,000 Golden Gate Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is starting to get fun -- buy 'em, ship 'em over and win a  
graded stakes race,'' Sayarshan's co-owner, Jeffrey DeHaven of 
Folsom, said to his partner, Jack Preston of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The two declined to say how much they paid for Sayarshan, who  
arrived in the United States from France just six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot,'' DeHaven said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems less now,'' Preston said with a laugh. ``He was a  
Group 2 (stakes) winner and was running against top competition 
over there at this distance. There's always a little nervousness 
when you buy one. Sometimes they come over here and they don't do 
it, but he looks pretty nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two had success last year with another French import, Sicy  
d'Alsace, who won two stakes races at Del Mar, including the Grade 
I Del Mar Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayarshan covered 1 3/8 miles on the turf in 2:15.56. The colt  
returned $13.20, $5.60 and $3.20 and earned $120,000 for his 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Favored Alvo Certo finished second, 1 1/2 lengths back, and paid  
$2.80 and $2.20. Plicck was third and returned $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Brice Blanc, Sayarshan broke slowly and galloped  
behind the eight-horse field until the turn for home. Blanc swung 
him outside for running room and Sayarshan drove past the field, 
pulling away at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't very worried about his position because he was  
comfortable in his stride, very relaxed,'' Blanc said. ``That's how 
they run over in Europe. They're galloping for much of the race and 
then they're sprinting at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I asked him to pick it up, he really responded. He really  
had a kick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Solis, who rode Plicck, said he felt like he was on the  
winner until Sayarshan loomed into view and overtook him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No excuses. I had a dream trip,'' Solis said. ``I thought I  
was home free. I guess I was wrong. Sayarshan was very impressive. 
We were really running down the stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sayarshan's trainer, Nick Canani, said the horse would next run  
in the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse is really bred to run a long ways,'' Canani said.  
``He only gets stronger the further he goes. There's not a lot of 
horses that can run these marathon distances and he does. I think 
that's what is going to make him stand out.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Strong Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton challenged lawmakers  
in Washington to ``learn from the lessons of Littleton'' and mark 
the two-month anniversary of the Colorado school shooting by 
undoing their vote against gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	His weekly radio address, taped here and broadcast back home,  
aimed to stir public anger over what Clinton said was a 
congressional majority taking its orders from the National Rifle 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't allow the gun lobby to rewrite our laws and undermine  
our values,'' Clinton said. To the NRA, he said, ``I wish you would 
help us. But we've overcome your scare tactics and strong-arm 
pressure before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 280-147 on Friday to defeat the gun-control  
bill, which was drafted in response to a rash of school shootings. 
The deadliest, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Col., left 15 
people dead on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who voted against the bill said it would not solve  
problems of youth violence that led to the shootings in Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``No new gun control law, background check, or trigger lock  
would have stopped the young assassins at Columbine High School,'' 
said Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., who voted against the House bill. 
``Adding more gun control is like putting burned toast back in the 
toaster. It's been done. It's been overdone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, another Oklahoma Republican, said cultural  
influences such as television shows and movies that glorify death 
and violence -- and not just guns -- contribute to youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding new laws to crack down on law-abiding citizens by  
limiting their right to bear arms is counter-intuitive and wrong,'' 
he said. ``Washington cannot pass any gun law that will actually 
deter lawbreakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said the  
administration does not aggressively enforce existing guns law. He 
also said the bill's own flaws -- not pressure from the NRA -- led to 
its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were elements of this bill that were far too extreme,  
and Democrats and Republicans knew that most of their districts 
couldn't stomach what was in the package,'' LaPierre said in an 
interview Saturday with The Associated Press in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called the House vote unacceptable in light of the  
Columbine incident and implored lawmakers to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've still got an opportunity, and you've still got an  
obligation, to do the right thing and pass real legislation that 
will strengthen our gun laws, not weaken them,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us learn from the lessons of Littleton. Let us remember  
the children of Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation now rests with a conference committee of House  
and Senate lawmakers that will be controlled by Republicans. The 
committee will try to work out a compromise between the House, 
which killed its gun-control bill, and the Senate, which narrowly 
approved Clinton's legislation last month. 
</P>
<P>
	That process has preoccupied Clinton as he traveled through  
Paris and now Germany meeting with world leaders. At every stop, he 
has blasted House votes that he said would weaken gun laws and 
endanger the nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill requires background checks for all sales at gun  
shows; requires dealers to provide safety devices with all 
handguns; bans the importation of certain high-capacity firearms 
clips and imposes a lifetime prohibition of gun ownership on any 
juvenile convicted of a serious felony.

	Given the House's solid rejection, there is some doubt about  
whether the Congress will approve any expanded gun measures this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in particular, said the answer to youth violence  
lay in measures other than gun control. The House and Senate, which 
are controlled by a Republican majority, approved bills in recent 
weeks to toughen enforcement of juvenile crime.

<HEADLINE> Splinter Supports Shoeless Joe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If Shoeless Joe Jackson conspired to fix the 1919 World Series,  
he certainly went about it in a strange way. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson batted .375 with a record 12 hits and had the only home  
run of the Series. He drove in six runs and threw out five runners 
trying to score. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could have had three others, if bad cutoffs hadn't been  
made,'' he once said. But then, with a couple of pitchers and 
infielders implicated in the Black Sox scandal, it's understandable 
that some of Jackson's throws weren't handled cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoeless Joe was surrounded by sad-sack statistics accumulated  
by others involved in the affair. Lefty Williams lost three games 
and had a 6.61 ERA. Swede Risberg batted .080. Hap Felsch hit .192. 
Chick Gandil batted .233. All very suspicious numbers. Jackson's, 
however, were not. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ignored the  
acquittal of the eight players by a grand jury, and Shoeless Joe 
and the others were suspended for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball failed to keep faith with me,'' Jackson once said of  
his suspension notice. ``It read if found innocent of any 
wrongdoing, I would be reinstated. If found guilty, I would be 
banned for life. I was found innocent and still banned for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That upsets people like Ted Williams, who is campaigning for  
Jackson to be reinstated by baseball so that he can be eligible for 
the Hall of Fame. That, Williams believes, is where the man with a 
.356 career average, third highest in baseball history, belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams first learned about Jackson from Eddie Collins, who  
played in the era of Cobb, Ruth and other baseball greats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Collins, all he wanted to do was talk about those guys,''  
Williams said. ``Walter Johnson, Moses (Lefty) Grove, Lou Gehrig. 
I'd heard of Shoeless Joe and I asked Collins to tell me about 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They had been teammates on the 1919 White Sox: Collins, a slick  
second baseman out of Columbia University who wasn't involved in 
the scandal; Jackson, one of the game's best hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``His head dropped and there was quite a pause,'' Williams said,  
recalling the conversation. ``Then he looked to the ceiling and 
said, `Boy, what a player he was.' 
</P>
<P>
	``His expression and that pause. That's something I've always  
remembered. It was said from the heart. I was impressed by the 
reverence he had for Joe Jackson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reverence is shared by Williams, who will meet with  
commissioner Bud Selig at the All-Star Game in Boston next month to 
push for Jackson's reinstatement. Hall of Famers Bob Feller, Yogi 
Berra and Tom Lasorda have joined the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal review of the case is already under way, spurred by  
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who became intrigued with the Shoeless 
Joe story after the movie ``Field of Dreams'' was filmed in his 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoeless Joe may have been nothing more than a victim of  
circumstances. He said he was approached by the gamblers and 
rejected two offers, the first for $10,000, the second for twice 
that amount. When teammate Lefty Williams arrived at his room after 
the Series carrying a bag filled with $5,000, Jackson wanted no 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating the case was that Jackson had questionable legal  
counsel and no apparent help from White Sox owner Charles Comiskey, 
who, by all accounts of the affair, was more interested in 
protecting himself than anything or anybody else. There was no 
players association, no army of attorneys to take up the cause for 
the banned players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a severe penalty,'' Williams said. ``Jackson was never  
once found guilty. Baseball never proved it was right. He never had 
a chance to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The saddest part of it is that for 80 years, nothing has been  
done. He served his sentence. He died under it. If he was innocent, 
that was a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who got his nickname after playing a minor league game  
without shoes, died in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some evidence that Landis, the newly installed  
commissioner, saw the Black Sox as an opportunity to make a strong 
statement. One of the banned players, Buck Weaver, batted .324 in 
the Series. He was painted with the broad brush of the scandal 
because he knew of the plot and failed to report it. 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, apparently would describe most of Chicago. When  
Shoeless Joe tried to report it, even asking to be benched for the 
Series, he was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jackson was never convicted of a felony,'' Williams said. ``He  
was convicted by the laws of baseball by a commissioner with more 
power than had ever been given to anybody. I'm sure Landis made up 
his mind that whatever it took to restore the integrity of 
baseball, he was going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one more wrinkle to this sorry saga.  
</P>
<P>
	According to baseball lore, as he left the courthouse where the  
Black Sox were on trial, Jackson was approached by a towheaded 
youngster who uttered the phrase, ``Say it ain't so, Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Jackson, that never happened. He claimed the  
anecdote was made up by a Chicago newsman with a vivid imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoeless Joe's involvement in the whole affair may have been  
just as fanciful

<HEADLINE> Knicks Lose Game 2 Because of No 3s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the opening minute of Game 2 of the NBA  
Finals, Larry Johnson hit a 3-point basket for the New York Knicks. 
Encouraged by his success, Johnson tried six more and didn't 
connect again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' 2-for-14 performance on 3's in Friday night's 80-67  
loss to San Antonio followed a 2-for-8 showing in Game 1 of the 
series and punctuated a disturbing but simple fact for the 
struggling Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't have a legitimate long-range shooter.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson assumed that role during the postseason, launching a  
flurry of 3's including the one -- that with an added free throw -- 
became a 4-point game-winner in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference 
finals against Indiana. He also hit consecutive 3's down the 
stretch to help clinch New York's win in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	But right now, Johnson is concentrating just on getting up and  
down the court on his sprained right knee. And at 6-foot-7, his 
size is needed for the heavy work under the basket, something the 
Knicks desperately require against the Spurs' twin towers of 
7-footers Tim Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	John Starks was New York's designated 3-point specialist until  
he was traded for Latrell Sprewell, returning from last season's 
suspension. But Sprewell has not supplied the outside threat for 
New York, saying that he has so far been unable to reconstruct that 
part of his game following his layoff. He made only 21 of 77 
attempts during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks sought to fill the perimeter void at the start of the  
season by signing free agent Dennis Scott, one of the best 3-point 
shooters in NBA history. But that marriage lasted only 15 games 
before Scott was cut from the team, leaving a gap in the long-range 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott made 1,106 3's -- including a league-record 267 in 1995-96  
-- from behind the 3-point arc in eight seasons prior to joining the 
Knicks. But, with New York, he managed only 2.9 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's best 3-point shooters during the regular season were  
Allan Houston (57-for-140, 40.7 percent), Chris Childs (36-for-94, 
38.3) and Charlie Ward (53-for-149, 35.6). For the season, New York 
made 208 of 589, a 35.3 percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Patrick Ewing injured and Johnson hobbling, Houston has  
had to concentrate less on bombs-away basketball and more on simply 
providing points with conventional shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward and Childs were a combined 2-for-7 on 3-point tries in the  
first two games of the Finals. By comparison, San Antonio's Jaren 
Jackson buried New York with five 3's in the opening game alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' problem is complicated because points have come so  
hard for coach Jeff Van Gundy's team, which has depended for so 
long on Ewing to carry the bulk of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Without their franchise center, New York's roster is crowded  
with players who have not been consistent scoring threats and 
aren't changing right now. In that situation, even the occasional 
3-point shot can provide an instant offense, sometimes a dagger in 
the heart of the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, though, the weapon is missing for New York, posing  
one more problem for the gang that can't seem to shoot straight.

<HEADLINE>  Women's World Cup Soccer Opens Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Shannon MacMillan sheepishly  
admitted she often imagined what the atmosphere would be like for 
the World Cup opener. Players usually prefer not to look ahead too 
far, but she couldn't help it. 
</P>
<P>
	So when MacMillan and her teammates on the U.S. women's soccer  
team took the field today at Giants Stadium, whatever they 
envisioned couldn't have matched the scene of 78,000 people waving 
flags, chanting ``U-S-A'' and showing their game unprecedented 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to imagine what it would be like, but I know what  
I hoped it would be like,'' she said of the tournament opener with 
Denmark. ``The Olympics gave us a taste of the support we can get. 
With a packed house and everyone pro-U.S. and shouting `U-S-A,' it 
will be awesome. We'll get that extra edge and little push from the 
home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they asked us if we thought the World Cup should be in  
big stadiums or smaller ones, we said, `We'll pack the large 
ones.''' 
</P>
<P>
	They did for the first game of the third Women's World Cup, in  
which the Americans are favored -- along with China -- to win the 
title. The sellout marked the biggest crowd for a women's game in 
the United States, and the fans weren't there to see Brazil and 
Mexico in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sellout for the opener is a great testimony to women's  
soccer,'' U.S. veteran Brandi Chastain said. ``I don't think 
anybody thought from the beginning that this could be a 
breakthrough event. I think we were really sticking our necks out 
on the line and putting ourselves out to be chopped down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the tournament already has sold more than 480,000  
tickets for the 32-game event. Organizers expected 20,000 at San 
Jose for tonight's doubleheader, featuring China vs. Sweden and 
Japan against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider how many seats might be sold down the road if the  
Americans get on a roll. It would be something of an upset if they 
don't sell out subsequent games. 
</P>
<P>
	For Denmark to stage an upset today, it needed to ignore the  
atmosphere, a very difficult chore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us have played in front of 75,000,'' said  
Mikka Hansen, an American native playing for Denmark -- her father 
is Danish. ``Maybe it will be to the U.S. advantage, but there also 
is a lot of pressure attached for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the way this team has played in the last decade -- the  
1991 world title, the 1996 Olympic gold medal -- and with all of its 
experience, it's hard to picture the U.S. squad faltering in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the Americans are on a mission, which not only could  
lead to a World Cup crown, perhaps another Olympic championship, 
but the establishment of a professional league in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand there's a lot at stake in this tournament,''  
U.S. star Mia Hamm said. ``But we welcome the challenge. We've 
always accepted those challenges.''

<HEADLINE> Nature Strikes Back at U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- ``Augusta on steroids'' Brandel Chamblee  
called Pinehurst No. 2. And he had one of the easier trips on the 
day, shooting 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asked many times what's the hardest golf course I  
ever played,'' defending champion and two-time Open winner Lee 
Janzen recalled. ``Now I have the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Channel surfers looking for golf could have clicked onto one of  
those specials titled something like, ``When Nature Strikes Back!'' 
and seen pretty much the same thing. That's how much carnage took 
place Saturday at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	We'll get to the numbers backing that up momentarily. But  
suffice it to say only one golfer, former Open champion Payne 
Stewart, is on the right side of par after three rounds, and only 
one, Phil Mickelson, is straddling it. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly everybody else, the best way to screw up the courage  
to come back Sunday is to take John Cook's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played this,'' he said, ``as a par 88.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cook is not kidding -- much. He and his playing partner, Swede  
Gabriel Hjerstedt, began Saturday at 7-over-par. Five hours later, 
walking off 18, Hjerstedt offered a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks for the game,'' said Hjerstedt, who shot 79. ``I  
enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, who shot 77, extended his hand, a crooked smile creasing  
his lips. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're lying,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who called it an enjoyable afternoon had to be a liar.  
The best thing that can be said about the 68 golfers contesting the 
national championship is that all of them found their way back to 
the clubhouse without the U.S. Golf Association having to leave a 
trail of bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say those markers wouldn't have come in handy out  
on the course. Week in and week out, PGA Tour pros hit an average 
63 percent of the greens in regulation. They might have landed the 
ball on Pinehurst's humpbacked versions just as often. It's just 
that far fewer of those approach shots -- 42 percent on Saturday -- 
stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to scene after scene of golfers grimly marching into a  
swale on one side of the green and sending a shot skidding across 
the green and into a swale on the other side. It happened so often 
that on some holes, fans in the bleachers might have thought they 
were watching a tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hardly the only incongruous snapshot the day yielded.  
</P>
<P>
	At No. 17, Esteban Toledo holed a shot out of a greenside bunker  
for birdie and celebrated as though he'd taken the lead. His real 
accomplishment? Getting back to 8-over for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The only guy who broke par on the day did it by holing a  
136-yard shot. From a fairway bunker. That was Steve Stricker, who 
shot 69 and looked like a deer caught in the headlights for all the 
praise his fellow pros heaped on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like I shot the round of the year,'' Stricker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers suggest otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
	Ted Tryba won last week's PGA Tour event, shooting 19-under-par  
at the St. Jude Classic. But after shooting 82 in his third round 
here, he was 19-over. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he didn't really play that badly,'' said Tom Lehman, who  
shot 73 and was paired with Tryba. ``He just got it tripping over 
the wrong side of the hole on a couple places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that was hard to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``The pin placements,'' Scott Verplank said, ``were borderline  
sadistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that the golfers can thank the USGA, which has decided to  
defend par at Pinehurst like it was the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGA says Open courses are set up to identify the best  
golfers, not intimidate or embarrass them. Considering some of the 
names at or near the top of the leaderboard -- Stewart, Mickelson, 
Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and David Duval -- there isn't much room 
for argument about whether this Open will accomplish the first. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the greens get any tougher, intimidation and  
embarrassment might be the price paid by everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``My 75 today was five shots better than my 76 yesterday,'' Sven  
Struver said. ``And in a way, it's nice to see others 
struggling.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colo. Teen Convicted in 5 Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A teen-ager who put a bandana over his  
face and gunned down five people in two homes has been convicted of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Pogosyan, 18, faces possible life in prison. He was  
convicted Friday of five counts of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least he will be punished for what he did,'' said Maria  
Isabel Avalos, mother of 16-year-old Marissa Avalos, who died in 
the killings. ``He showed no emotion for the families and no 
remorse for what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe Pogosyan and a friend, Michael Martinez, armed  
themselves with shotguns, put bandanas over their faces and went on 
a murderous rampage at two Aurora homes Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 18, was found shot to death in an office park several  
hours after the other shootings. No one has been charged in his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed the defendant and Martinez went on a rampage  
out of revenge. Witnesses have said Martinez was bent on getting 
back at those he felt were ``snitching'' on him.

<HEADLINE> Robinson Doesn't Mind Secondary Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Playing a secondary role to a second-year pro  
wouldn't appeal to many veteran stars. 
</P>
<P>
	David Robinson doesn't seem to mind, especially if teaming with  
Tim Duncan helps the San Antonio Spurs win an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came to San Antonio, when we first drafted him, I  
didn't know the extent of what his talents were,'' Robinson said. 
He found out quickly what the top draft pick could do. 
</P>
<P>
	The two 7-footers worked out together during the summer of 1997  
before Duncan's rookie season in what Robinson describes as ``a 
good, positive competitiveness.'' They've built on that foundation 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Spurs' first trip to the NBA Finals, San Antonio rode the  
Duncan-Robinson duo to consecutive victories over the New York 
Knicks. The best-of-7 series shifts to Madison Square Garden for 
Game 3 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Robinson has found the finals a blast.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think winning makes a big difference in the fun factor,'' he  
said. ``Everybody works hard. This is when it all pays off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan scored 33 points and had 16 rebounds in Game 1, and  
Robinson backed him with 13 points, nine rebounds, three blocks and 
seven assists. Robinson's precision passes to Duncan under the 
basket accounted for several easy points. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2 Friday, Duncan led the Spurs with 25 points and had 15  
rebounds and four blocks, while Robinson scored 16 points, grabbed 
11 rebounds and had five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said Robinson and Duncan make each  
shot in the paint difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a great defensive team,'' Van Gundy said. ``At the  
basket, they're terrific. Nothing comes easy with those two guys in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive leadership has been Robinson's main job this season,  
while the Spurs have made Duncan their chief offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim is the guy we go to, and we go to him down the stretch  
quite a bit,'' Robinson said. ``A lot of that pressure is off me 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive aggressiveness is still part of Robinson's game,  
especially in the fourth quarter when the game is at a pivotal 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Knicks closed within 63-57 with 7:55 left Friday  
night, Robinson responded with a slam dunk, then hit a 17-foot 
jumper less than 30 seconds later, giving San Antonio a 10-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the end for New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very ugly win,'' Duncan said. ``There's no way to  
hide that. But we win best when it's ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's somewhat reduced role runs counter to what he'd  
become used to most of his 10 years in the league. Robinson was the 
top draft pick in 1987 and joined the Spurs two years later 
following a Navy commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson essentially became the Spurs franchise. He was Rookie  
of the Year in the 1989-90 season. He won the NBA rebounding title 
in 1991, the blocked shots title in 1992, the scoring title in 1994 
and was chosen Most Valuable Player in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The rub on Robinson was that he was ``soft,'' that he couldn't  
follow through on his regular-season success with a strong 
postseason performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson contended he needed a little help, that he couldn't do  
it alone. This season he's gotten the assistance he's craved from 
Duncan, plus a healthy Sean Elliott, an improved Avery Johnson and 
the addition of playoff veteran Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Robinson is two victories away from a championship.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't prove it until you actually win,'' he said, ``but  
finally it's coming together.''

<HEADLINE> Tumors Plague Squirrels in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Squirrels riddled with crusty brown  
tumors -- some covering 90 percent of their body -- have been 
reported in eight Florida counties in a pox outbreak experts said 
is the worst since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 300 and 500 of the squirrels have popped up in the  
backyards of residential neighborhoods, said pathologists studying 
the epidemic at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists believe thousands more are infected with the  
disease, which is specific to squirrels and cannot be contracted by 
other wildlife, pets or humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Transmitted by mosquitoes, the disease almost always attacks the  
eyes, leaving its little victims blind and unable to plunder bird 
feeders. 
</P>
<P>
	The pox leaves the squirrels' eyes swollen ``as big as  
marbles,'' Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission biologist 
Timothy Regan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals eventually starve to death or die from  
bacteria-infecting tumors. There is no treatment or preventive 
vaccine.

<HEADLINE> All-Florida Championship in Omaha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Miami beat Florida State five out of six  
times this season. The Seminoles can make up for it with one 
victory at the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Jernigan's three-run homer in the bottom of the 13th inning  
gave Florida State a 14-11 victory over Stanford on Friday, sending 
the Seminoles to the national title game for the first time since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	With runners on first and third and no outs, Jernigan said he  
wasn't trying for dramatics when he sent a 1-0 pitch into the 
left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I was trying to do was get a ball to the outfield and  
bring in a run. The last thing on my mind was a home run,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by the Seminoles made it an all-Florida final today  
when second-seeded Florida State (57-13) played top-seeded Miami 
(48-13). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be on time and we're going to fight for 27  
outs,'' Florida State coach Mike Martin said. ``It's an uphill 
battle, but thank the good Lord, we're going to play for it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup revolves around rest. The Hurricanes have it and the  
Seminoles don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State used seven pitchers to beat Stanford in a game  
sure to leave some emotional wear on the Seminoles. The teams 
combined for eight home runs, 35 hits and countless momentum 
swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ho-hum. Just another day at the yard,'' Martin joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jim Morris planned to give the ball to right-hander  
Alex Santos (12-3, 3.00 ERA), who has a 1.35 ERA in the series. 
Morris also considered unbeaten right-hander David Gil (12-0, 
3.19). 
</P>
<P>
	``You can choose either of them and not be wrong,'' Morris said.  
</P>
<P>
	Santos and Gil -- and the entire Miami lineup, for that matter --  
are well rested. The Hurricanes won twice on the opening weekend of 
the series, then played again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the luxury of staying on the winner's side in the two  
brackets. Florida State, on the other hand, lost early in the 
tournament to Stanford, then came back to beat the Cardinal on 
consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, did Florida State have enough recovery time for  
the championship? 
</P>
<P>
	``They've beaten us five out of six this years,'' first baseman  
Ryan Barthelemy said. ``We're excited and ready to play. Today took 
a lot out of us, but we've proven we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Miami players watched Friday's game from the stands.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're relaxed and playing well,'' shortstop Bobby Hill said.  
``We're doing the little things right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's success against the Seminoles might stem from Morris  
being familiar with Martin. Morris served as pitching coach in 
Tallahassee from 1980-81 the start of Martin's 19-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was my first assistant back in 1980,'' Martin said.  
``You're not going to surprise him with anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he loves to coach against his old boss.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being a former assistant coach for Mike, this makes the game  
even more exciting,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Looks for Holyfield Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis was in New York on Saturday night  
to scout a possible opponent, although he said his real mission was 
to push for a rematch with Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	And that rematch appeared closer following negotiating sessions  
Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner, operator of HBO and pay-per-view TVKO, had wanted  
Don King to sign an agreement that would allow them to order him to 
step aside as fight promoter should he be indicted in connection 
with the controversial first fight that ended in a draw March 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou DiBella, senior vice president of HBO Sports, said Saturday  
night that HBO was no longer insisting on King signing such an 
agreement and that if any action was taken to prevent King from 
promoting it, it would have to be taken by a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner sports, said a fight  
could happen if King agrees to pay Holyfield's purse and all the 
undercard purses while Time Warner will pay Lewis. Each fighter 
would be guaranteed $15 million for the Nov. 13 fight in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a lot more optimistic today than we were Thursday or  
Friday.'' Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still stumbling blocks, however. Panos Eliades, Lewis'  
British promoter, said he still has a matter to work out with King 
that involves money. Eliades also said, ``We need it (an agreement) 
done in the next four weeks because Lewis wants to fight this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, the WBC champion, could fight the winner of Saturday  
night's Michael Grant-Lou Savarese fight in The Theater at Madison 
Square Garden should the Holyfield rematch fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, however, said he was not thinking much about Grant or  
Savarese. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I'm here to push for the rematch, it's time we made  
the fight,'' he said. ``Everybody knows what happened March 13. 
Everybody knows I won. That's in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers thought Lewis clearly outpointed Holyfield, the  
WBA and IBF champion, in the first fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, also was at The Theater on  
Saturday night and said, ``I think these two fighters want to 
fight. I think it would be a shame if it didn't take place.''

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Seek Secret Medical Care </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- It's already dusk, the sun casting a  
pale glow over the low-slung houses of this industrious immigrant 
enclave, when Silvia Fernandez makes her way to work. 
</P>
<P>
	With an air of authority, and giving nods of recognition, she  
bustles past a small crowd, some waiting in their cars, others 
already in line for her services. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman they know as Dr. Silvia receives them in a somber room  
tucked behind an inconspicuous storefront, furnished with a few 
chairs and a desk. The room's dull lighting casts a pallor on the 
skin of her patient, a Mexican immigrant. The pungent smell of 
alcohol is the sole suggestion that medicine, underground medicine, 
is practiced here. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez doesn't wear a white coat or use a stethoscope, and  
she has no examination table. But her hands move like a veteran's. 
She delivers her diagnosis in soft-toned Spanish and prescribes an 
ointment 
</P>
<P>
	Then she leads her patient to the front room. From a black  
plastic bag under the counter she pulls out two plastic-and-foil 
strips of Mexican-produced ``ampicilina,'' labeled as antibiotics 
to treat an infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's $15,'' she says with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
	Word among her patients is that Fernandez was trained to  
practice medicine in Mexico. But she has no certificate to show for 
it. And her clinic is actually a back room in a tiny store called 
``Adriana's Gift Shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a reporter who witnessed the consultation, she insists: ``We  
sell gifts, we wrap gifts, we have gifts.'' She acknowledges that 
the shop offers cough syrups, ``but not injections and not 
antibiotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez is one of dozens of underground health providers who  
have come to fill a growing need for immigrants in a foreign 
country: Medical care that is familiar, discreet and cheap. The 
growing network has little supervision and no official recognition. 
It thrives on word-of-mouth referrals: clerks inside five-and-dime 
stores peddling pharmaceuticals in backroom offices, reputed 
doctors making house calls to inject patients with antibiotics, and 
licensed doctors cutting corners by hiring untrained office workers 
to diagnose ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviews with practitioners, patients, law enforcement and  
health-care advocates show that as California's immigrant 
population grows, so does unlicensed health care. Emergency-room 
workers, doctors and school nurses increasingly report dangerous 
reactions from faulty diagnoses made in the secretive clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlicensed practitioners have been linked to at least four  
deaths since 1997 in California, which is home to almost 10 million 
Hispanics, nearly half of them born abroad. All four of the dead 
were Hispanic, including a 12-month-old boy and an 18-month-old 
girl, and authorities say the toll from unlicensed medicine may be 
much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	California has struggled to respond, passing laws to increase  
penalties and, at a local level, forming a task force to crack down 
on illegal pharmaceuticals. But for the more than one-third of 
working-age Hispanics who lack health insurance, the clinics are 
often the only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	From the outside, the mini-mall store fronting Fernandez' clinic  
looks like dozens of other low-priced novelty shops in this 
neighborhood reminiscent of Mexico. Vendors hawk bright-colored 
pinatas and tamales, bridal shops advertise in Spanish, and 
botanicas sell Virgin Mary statues and a potpourri of medicinal 
herbs. 
</P>
<P>
	And like many storefront farmacias in Mexico, no prescription is  
needed at stores like ``Adriana's Gift Shop,'' cluttered 
wall-to-wall with clocks, teddy bears, toiletries and costume 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	But immigrants like Teodora Ortiz know where to go and what is  
offered behind the rows of trinkets, beyond the door marked 
``Employees Only'' where Dr. Silvia discreetly gives shots, pills 
and medical advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I will feel better soon,'' Ortiz says minutes after  
being prescribed a shot of penicillin for her cold. ``I trust 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, 42, earns minimum wage as a cashier at a family-owned  
market. Like many immigrants, she doesn't have insurance, making 
any illness a potential catastrophe. Her employee benefits tend 
toward survival: occasional handouts of expired food. The oldest of 
her three children, 14-year-old Bryana, stocks food shelves at the 
market a few times a month to help pay the $650 monthly rent for 
their one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she came from Mexico five years ago, Ortiz has relied on  
backroom medicine. As she sees it, the visits are quick, Spanish is 
spoken and ``our people'' get treated with a respect not always 
forthcoming in California's anti-immigrant climate. 
</P>
<P>
	That faith persists despite her own personal trials.  
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter once had an allergic reaction after getting a  
penicillin injection. A friend drove them to a hospital, where she 
told emergency-room workers that her daughter had received the 
injection in Tijuana, Mexico. In fact, she got it at another 
backroom clinic in Santa Ana, two-thirds of whose 300,000 residents 
are Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor told her Bryana nearly died. Recalling her daughter's  
close call, Ortiz shakes her head and smiles wanly. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just an isolated incident. It won't happen again,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants and health experts say the unlicensed practitioners  
are sought out because the conventional U.S. health system is too 
complex, because the newcomers prefer the services they were 
accustomed to in their homeland, and because, if they are illegal 
immigrants, they don't want anyone checking their papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities concede they don't know how many unlicensed  
practitioners are at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's widespread. The problem is they are illegal and don't  
register. They don't license. There is no way of going in and 
finding how many there are,'' says Allen Davidson, chief of the 
California Department of Health Services' drug safety unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the unlicensed businesses sell medicine at heftier  
prices, making $1,000 a day more than a legitimate doctor or 
pharmacist does, says Marc Gonzalez, a state Medical Board 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials say black-market health care persists  
for a simple reason: The penalties are weak. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience of the King family is telling.  
</P>
<P>
	Adriana's Gift Shop where Silvia Fernandez works is owned by her  
mother, Rosa Maria King. The King family are veterans of the trade: 
They have dispensed Mexican-made pharmaceuticals for nearly a 
decade -- out of their home, at swap meets or at family-owned gift 
shops, say police in Santa Ana and nearby Tustin and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have arrested Manuel Javier King, the family  
patriarch, three times -- once when authorities raided a makeshift 
clinic in his garage in Santa Ana as he was about to give an 
injection to a 6-month-old baby, says Santa Ana police Sgt. Steve 
Despenas. One of the arrests led to a conviction for violation of 
state pharmacy regulations and three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other King family members have been convicted on  
charges connected with illegal pharmaceuticals. Their stiffest 
penalties have been fines and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four deaths since 1997 occurred after treatment or  
drugs were dispensed at Orange County shops owned by the family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings are not facing charges in the deaths, but local  
officials are scrutinizing their business practices. The family is 
already under federal investigation for allegedly smuggling illegal 
pharmaceuticals across the U.S.-Mexico border, says Jud Bohrer, a 
special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been investigating us, but we don't know anything,''  
Fernandez says. ``We're all worried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency legislation was enacted in California in September to  
increase penalties to up to $10,000 in fines and a year in jail for 
selling pharmaceuticals without a license. The law gave added 
authority to a Los Angeles County task force to shut down illegal 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has advertised its campaign with highly visible  
crackdowns in Los Angeles and surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
	One such raid this spring targeted a two-story house in a  
working-class neighborhood of Los Angeles where a woman was 
suspected of dispensing smuggled pharmaceuticals and dangerous 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Police knocked, entered and emerged 15 minutes later with clear  
plastic garbage bags filled with open syringes, birth control 
pills, penicillin and intravenous tubing. Medicine and supplies 
worth $500,000 were stocked in the kitchen, bedrooms and closets, 
and police found an envelope with $10,000 in cash, says Todd 
Sample, a task force member. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say that on some days, people were lined up outside  
the house bordered by rose bushes waiting for an appointment. 
Police say they discovered notebooks recording patient visits to 
the home since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Task force members stuffed three bags crammed with drugs into  
the trunk of a car and declared the raid a success. The woman was 
charged with dispensing medicine without a license, but no 
penalties have been imposed. Despite the raid's high profile, the 
woman probably will only be fined, the typical sentence for a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last May, the task force has arrested 75 people and raided  
173 places suspected of illegally dispensing medicine. Offenders, 
worried about their competition, are actually helping enforcement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They start ratting people out,'' says Donald Ashton, a health  
specialist and chief of the task force's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But eradicating the problem is difficult because only a handful  
of deaths are actually reported, says Sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones that make the headlines are the baby deaths, not how  
many times have people been admitted to the emergency room for 
adverse reactions,'' says pharmacologist Gregory Thompson, director 
of Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center's drug information center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet today that if an adult rolled into the county hospital  
and died no one would ever report it. It would just be a death,'' 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case with Pedro Cruz-Sanchez, whose death didn't  
appear unusual to the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old trucker had recently come back from a trip to  
Oklahoma. On Aug. 17, 1997, he was coughing blood and couldn't 
breathe. The father of three was so weak, his brother and 
sister-in-law had to carry his 281-pound, 5-foot-6-inch body in 
their arms to Dr. Miguel Castillo-Inzunza's clinic in Escondido, 
north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two hours after leaving the clinic, Cruz collapsed and  
died at his brother's house. Paramedics found him slumped back on 
the sofa, blood trickling from his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner determined that Cruz, who had evidence of heart  
disease, was dangerously obese and died from bilateral pneumonia -- 
a natural death. He wrote in his autopsy that Castillo told him he 
had treated Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	State Medical Board investigators suspected otherwise. Already  
before Cruz died they were investigating the licensed doctor for 
allegedly allowing the unlicensed practice of medicine. Nearly two 
years later, on April 12, the Medical Board filed a complaint 
against Castillo, questioning the care he provided and alleging 
that he employed unlicensed people who treated patients and forged 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also claimed an unlicensed practitioner injected  
Cruz with the wrong dosage of the antibiotic Rocephin and two other 
Mexican drugs illegal for use in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview at his Santa Ana office in a run-down strip  
mall, Castillo said his two clinics and employees operate ``with 
licenses and within the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was morbidly obese and really, who knows?'' Castillo said.  
``We did all we could to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz's family has filed a wrongful death suit. State authorities  
are reviewing Castillo's medical license, and he and three 
employees have pleaded innocent to more than a dozen felony 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo was ordered to close his two clinics and not to  
practice medicine until the case is resolved. If convicted, he 
could spend 11 years in prison, according to prosecutor David 
Stultz. 
</P>
<P>
	Some public health advocates say law enforcement isn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``Too often in the desperation to do some type of police action,  
we lose sight of what is the root cause of this,'' says Martha 
Jimenez, executive director for Latino Coalition for a Healthy 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest factor, she says, is insurance: An estimated 7  
million in California are uninsured, the largest proportion 
Hispanic. Across the country, 43 million people lack coverage, 
according to the Center for Health Policy Research at the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The uninsured are going to go onto the black market and  
continue to do what they are doing because people are that 
desperate,'' Jimenez says. 
</P>
<P>
	As an uninsured immigrant, Teodora Ortiz continues to go to  
underground clinics. Even after hearing about the deaths. Even 
after her own daughter nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
	For her, it has become routine.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't know where else to go,'' she says.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- How uptight was the American team  
heading into Saturday's Women's World Cup opener against Denmark?

<P>
	Let Brandi Chastain answer that.

``It was like a camp mentality. We were painting our nails, 
singing, and we even had a dance party in the hall (at the 
hotel).''

like a bunch of kids,'' Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each player also received a long-stem rose from the equipment  
manager.

	 *MESSING'S REACTION:* Marla Messing, the CEO of the Women's  
World Cup organizing committee, might have been wearing the widest 
smile at Giants Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge tribute to them,'' she said of the U.S. team  
that was the main attraction in drawing a crowd of 78,972, the 
largest audience for a women's sporting event in American history. 
``I'm impressed and I couldn't be happier professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's all about the World Cup and that really what we're  
striving to achieve is to create that World Cup atmosphere. I think 
we succeeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messing estimated the doubleheader -- Brazil played Mexico in the  
nightcap -- had a gate of about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very positive for the Women's World Cup and for the  
sport in the future,'' she said. ``There are a lot more families 
and a lot more children (than at the 1994 men's World Cup). The 
crowd was mainly soccer families, the grass roots soccer community. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hope for women's sports.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YEAH, BABY:* After Julie Foudy scored the second American goal  
in the 3-0 victory over Denmark, she threw up her hand, giving the 
crowd her best Austin Powers imitation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to team captain Carla Overbeck, ``Austin Powers: The  
Spy Who Shagged Me'' is getting rave reviews from the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all seen it a couple of times,'' Overbeck said. ``It's a  
big hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Shannon MacMillan: ``We're always saying lines from the  
movie -- at practice, in the locker room, at the hotel. 
Everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILY CHEERS:* Carla Overbeck has one very special fan in the  
stands: her little boy. Jackson Overbeck is not quite 2, but he 
knows when to cheer for his mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire time when we were traveling, we would would pull up  
to the stadium, and he would start chanting: `U-S-A All The Way!''' 
Overbeck said. ``Whenever he sees a stadium, that's free reign for 
him to cheer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American team captain hadn't seen her No. 1 fan for a week  
leading up to the opening match. She was looking forward to a 
post-game hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he'll run up to me,'' she said. ``Hopefully he'll  
recognize me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOCCER VS. THE POPE:* The opening match of the Women's World  
Cup was the best-attended sporting event in Giants Stadium history. 
The match between the host Americans and Germany drew 78,972. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance beat the stadium record of 78,817 for an NFL  
playoff game between the New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest attendance ever at Giants Stadium wasn't beaten,  
though. The Mass held by Pope John Paul II in 1995 drew 82,948.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Agree on Top Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A few months ago, Jason Stumm was just excited at  
the chance to play baseball next year at the University of 
Washington. Now he's a member of the Chicago White Sox 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Stumm, the 15th overall pick in this month's amateur draft, and  
the White Sox agreed Saturday to terms on a minor league contract. 
The right-handed pitcher will go to the team's minor league 
facility in Tucson for about 10 days and then head to Bristol of 
the rookie Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dream of mine. I didn't think it would happen,''  
Stumm said, wearing a White Sox jersey and cap. ``I was excited to 
be going to the University of Washington. I thought I was fortunate 
to be getting that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stumm finished his senior season at Centralia (Wash.) High  
School with an 11-0 record and an 0.83 ERA. He struck out 105 and 
allowed 38 hits in 68 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``God gave him a great arm,'' White Sox general manager Ron  
Schueler said. ``He's got great arm strength, he's able to maintain 
it. Most high school kids, you see just a touch of 92 (mph) or 93, 
occasionally a little harder. Jason kept it for five or six 
innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stumm, 18, was told originally he'd probably be drafted  
somewhere between the fifth and 10th rounds. As it got closer to 
draft day, though, his stock rose and the White Sox made him their 
first pick. 
</P>
<P>
	While going so high adds some pressure, Stumm said that's fine.  
He's always operated better under pressure, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just look at it as an honor,'' he said. ``I'm lucky to be  
here and I'm going to make the best out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Southern Party Seeks Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Six score and 18 years ago, their  
forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, 
conceived in secession and dedicated to the proposition that states 
are sovereign and not beholden to a central government. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the philosophical heirs to the Confederate States of  
America are making another go at it. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Southern Party have registered with the  
Federal Election Commission and with the secretaries of state in 
Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia. By August, the party hopes to 
be established in all 11 states of the old Confederacy and 
Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The short-term goal is to get candidates elected to state and  
local offices. The long-term objective, which troubles independent 
political observers even though they doubt it will ever happen: 
Send enough party members to Congress to push for a separate 
Southern nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wasn't that settled in the Civil War? Not in the view of the  
Southern Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shotgun wedding forced upon the South at Appomattox has  
reached a dead end, and it is time to initiate a political divorce 
for the good of all parties concerned,'' declares the group's Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who believe that such talk is the very heart of sedition  
are the victims of 130 years of Yankee propaganda -- and of a poor 
understanding of the U.S. Constitution, says national committee 
chairman George Kalas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lincoln once said that a house divided would not stand,''  
Kalas says. ``Lincoln was wrong. A house divided will stand. It's 
called a duplex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalas, a Houstonian who filed the party's Texas papers in March,  
says there's popular support for the idea of a new Confederacy. But 
is he just whistling ``Dixie''? 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, the Southern Focus Polls from the University of  
North Carolina at Chapel Hill have asked whether the South would be 
better off as a separate nation, if that could be achieved without 
bloodshed. Between 8 percent and 16 percent of Southerners have 
agreed at any given time, and up to 9 percent of non-Southerners 
have accepted the premise. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years ago, John Shelton Reed, the author, historian and  
sociologist whose department oversees the polling, predicted the 
time was coming when Southerners would again seek autonomy. His 
reasoning: Those who actually fought the Civil War were all dead; 
America's role in the world was becoming less clear following 
Vietnam, and the South was ``finally ridding itself of the incubus 
of white supremacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I'm pleased to have my prophecy validated, I'm  
personally ambivalent about this development,'' Reed says. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he adds, ``I certainly believe that any group that's  
telling the 'federales' to mind their constitutional business is 
doing a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separatist movements are nothing new. Groups of native Hawaiians  
have been pushing for a return to sovereignty in recent years, and 
the Alaskan Independence Party, founded on a platform of secession 
from the lower 48, helped elect a governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Southern nation?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, says the Southern Party, rejecting Lincoln's ``flawed  
notion'' that the United States is bound together only by ``some 
abstract notion of liberty and equality.'' The group's Web site 
goes on: 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather, we believe the United States in general and the South  
in particular are defined by their historically European and 
Christian ethnic, linguistic and cultural core. ... This cultural 
majority represents the true fusion of blood and soil that defines 
what the Southern nation is. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``(W)e intend to promote policies that will ensure that Dixie  
remains a predominantly, but certainly not exclusively, 
Anglo-Celtic nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Steven Lawson says minorities should feel ``very  
uneasy'' about this. ``They're defining this culture of the South 
in very limited ways -- in a monolithic way of whiteness,'' says 
Lawson, a professor at Rutgers University and author of books on 
black political history. ``They are equating whiteness with 
Southern culture, and that's just a distortion of Southern 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalas says that's not the point at all.  
</P>
<P>
	Party supporters envision a country with a weak, decentralized  
government, like Switzerland; where schools and courts would 
proudly display the Ten Commandments; where most citizens would be 
required to serve in the military but would only wage defensive 
wars against foreign nations; and where immigration would be 
vigilantly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	Party supporter Mike Crane of Hollywood, Fla., sees secession as  
the only escape from a political system that is irretrievably 
broken and thoroughly corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of working for these Republicrats and Demagods that  
represent things I do not believe in,'' says Crane, a software 
designer who has gotten in trouble for displaying a set of 
miniature Confederate flags in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of a government where those of no faith have more  
rights than those of faith. I'm tried of a government that's 
obsessed with race and focused on special privileges -- affirmative 
action, in other words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But party organizers insist their aims are not white  
supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sir, the blacks have been an integral part of the Southern  
heritage for years,'' says Jerry Baxley, an auctioneer and gun 
dealer from Richmond, Va. ``We're not anything but Southerners, and 
that's how we view our people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalas says that when he talks of Anglo culture, he's thinking  
more about language, literature and legal traditions than about 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The culture that we have today has benefitted everybody,  
regardless of their racial background,'' says Kalas, a former CIA 
investigator whose father is a Greek immigrant and whose mother is 
of Cajun and American Indian descent. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he could foresee minorities playing a role in the  
party, Kalas immediately named one -- columnist Walter Williams, an 
economics professor at George Mason University and author of the 
book ``More Liberty Means Less Government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who is black, doesn't see himself joining the party.  
But it's not because of the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make any difference whether they're inclusive or  
not, at least to me. That's one of the issues of liberty,'' says 
Williams, who believes in the right of secession. ``You have to be 
a brave person to take liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party is a project of the League of the South, a  
12,000-member Southern heritage organization. Kalas is the league's 
``Rebmaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party members say the Southern independence movement is part of  
an international trend toward smaller, more homogenous states. They 
cite recent moves toward self-determination in Scotland and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Naylor, professor emeritus of economics at Duke  
University in Durham, thinks the Southern Party is right on. In 
fact, he thinks his adopted state of Vermont should band with New 
Hampshire and Maine and join Canada's Maritime provinces, which he 
believes have more in common with each other than with, say, 
California or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is too big because the whole damn country is  
too big,'' says Naylor, co-author of the 1997 book ``Downsizing the 
U.S.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalas says the party will not likely field its first candidates  
until after the 2000 elections. And he predicts it will succeed 
where other third parties have failed because its key plank, 
secession, is something the two major parties won't be able to 
co-opt. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for the party, the region is a politically tough  
row to hoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The South is easily the worst place in the country for ballot  
access for minor parties,'' says Richard Winger of San Francisco, 
publisher of the newsletter ``Ballot Access News.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, for instance, in 1995 tripled the number of signatures  
needed to get a party on the ballot to 3 percent of the votes cast 
in the last gubernatorial election. To stay on the ballot, a party 
would have to get 20 percent of the vote, Winger says. 
</P>
<P>
	That the movement even exists is disheartening to some.  
</P>
<P>
	As a history professor, John Hope Franklin believes that  
peaceful secession is a closed issue. But as a black man who daily 
experiences ``disdain of me and lack of interest in my 
well-being,'' he is worried. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin, a professor emeritus at Duke, says the Southern Party  
leaders are articulate, and they express views that many Americans 
share while at the same time ``they are against much of what this 
country stands for -- tolerance and diversity and, we believe, 
equality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He adds: ``They're a bunch of nuts, but they're to be taken  
seriously.''

$5.60 and $4.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal Tango, ridden by Marlon St. Julien, charged down the  
stretch on the far outside to narrowly miss and paid $3.80 and $3. 
Uanme had the lead inside the final furlong before being nosed out 
for second and paid $6.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Shires Ende won for the second time in four starts this year and

<HEADLINE> Gov. Jeb Bush's Wife Fined $4,100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush's wife apologized for  
using ``bad judgment'' after customs officials fined her for not 
declaring $19,000 in clothing and jewelry bought on a Paris trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Columba Bush paid Customs a $4,100 fine with a personal check  
for failing to declare the merchandise Thursday after arriving in 
Atlanta from Europe, the Bushes said in a statement released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he and his wife ``deeply regret this  
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sorry for exercising bad judgment and can assure everyone  
this will never happen again,'' Mrs. Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush spent five days in Paris, arriving in Atlanta on  
Thursday afternoon. When customs officials randomly searched her 
baggage they found the merchandise. The fine represents three times 
the amount of duty that would have been assessed on the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	No criminal penalty is pending or applicable, they said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't declare it and she didn't realize it was a problem  
until they asked her about the clothing and the jewelry in question 
and she told them it was new and she bought it on the trip,'' the 
governor's spokesman Cory Tilley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first $400 worth of merchandise bought overseas is the  
standard amount that does not have to be declared by a U.S. 
resident returning home.

<HEADLINE> Aide: First Lady Seeks Own Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton became serious about  
running for the Senate from New York partly because of doubts about 
life as a former first lady, her top political adviser says. 
</P>
<P>
	``She understands how short the half-life of a 'former' is,''  
Harold Ickes said. ``Many of her friends were saying to her, 'Oh, 
the world is your oyster, Hillary, there are so many options, why 
would you even consider being the United State senator?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering the question, Ickes said, ``One, she thinks being a  
United States senator is a big deal and it's a very attractive 
alternative given what she thinks are her other alternatives. Two, 
she not interested in making money for the sake of making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, there have been suggestions that Mrs. Clinton, who  
plans to form a Senate exploratory committee in early July, could 
have hit the speaking circuit and written books after leaving the 
White House or headed a foundation or university. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ickes, in a recent interview, said Mrs. Clinton is dedicated  
to public service. ``She knows that in order to be effective in 
public service, you need a platform,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Ickes said the first lady did not take talk of a Senate  
race seriously at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember what she was going through,'' he said. ``It was the  
year of Monica (Lewinsky). Impeachment had just moved from the 
House over to the Senate. They were in full trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton announced earlier this month that she would create  
an exploratory committee in July. ``And then I'll spend some time -- 
a lot of time -- in New York listening to people, and I'm looking 
forward to that,'' she said during an appearance on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers say Mrs. Clinton will likely spend about three weeks of  
July visiting much of the state.

<HEADLINE> Japan 1, Canada 1, tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Nami Otake headed toward the goal as  
soon as she saw the shot. The rebound landed at her feet, and a 
moment later she tapped the ball into an open net to give Japan a 
tie in its Women's World Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Otake's goal midway through the second half gave Japan a 1-1 tie  
against Canada on Saturday night. Silvana Burtini scored in the 
first half for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan came out of its defensive shell in the second half,  
scoring the tying goal minutes after Burtini left the field with a 
reaggravated left hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamaki Uchiyama took a long shot with her left foot that slammed  
off the crossbar and ricocheted in front of the net. Canadian 
goalie Nicci Wright had no time to recover before Otake slid the 
ball into the net in the 64th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Otake, who scored seven goals in qualifying matches for the  
World Cup, had two other excellent scoring chances. In the first 
half, her long shot deflected off the crossbar. In the second half, 
just seven minutes before her goal, she had a shot smothered by 
Wright at the side of the Canadian net. 
</P>
<P>
	Burtini scored midway through the first half, forcing her way  
past a Japanese defender and flicking the ball with her right foot 
past goalie Nozomi Yamago. 
</P>
<P>
	Burtini scored 14 goals in five games during the qualifying  
tournament, including eight goals in Canada's 21-0 win over Puerto 
Rico, to more than double her career international scoring total to 
27 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	By becoming so adept at scoring, she gave Canada an offensive  
threat to complement leading goal scorer Charmaine Hooper -- who got 
an assist on Burtini's goal but otherwise had a quiet night after 
getting an early yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooper headed the ball near midfield and it bounced high down  
the field. Burtini sped toward the ball and pushed her way past 
defender Tomoe Sakai to get free for the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 23,289 -- about 3,000 under capacity -- attended the  
game at San Jose State's Spartan Stadium. Some of those fans 
unfurled a huge Japanese flag that covered several rows of the 
stands in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Girls Supporting Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Laura Gubitosa has heard it a  
thousand times from some of the boys she knows: There's no future 
for girls in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 14-year-old knew better, as did all the girls waiting in  
the parking lots at Giants Stadium Saturday. They saw what the 
future could hold for female soccer players -- a chance to play in 
the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that women can do anything,'' Gubitosa said as she  
waited for the tournament to start. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team, considered a favorite, opened Saturday  
against Denmark. Brazil and Mexico played the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was heavily female, with a lot of young girls who said  
seeing women play in a World Cup was an inspiration for their own 
soccer-playing hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows us that when we grow up, there's something we can  
do,'' said Cortney Gavin, 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no women's Super Bowl, there's no women's Stanley  
Cup,'' said Claire Coleman, 13. ``It's good to see women are 
getting something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 7 million girls and women playing the game,  
according to the Women's Soccer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Avines said seeing the Women's World Cup could encourage  
more girls to try the sport, as well as provide role models. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're setting a real nice precedent for little girls,'' she  
said of the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's inspirational to have an example of something to strive  
for,'' said Drew Caprio, who had come with his two daughters. 
``It's great for them to see this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for them as young women to know it's not  
just a man's world,'' said Joe Coleman, who coaches his daughter 
Claire's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Shannon, executive director of the Women's Soccer  
Foundation, said the women's team has done more to improve the 
reputation of soccer in America than the men's team, which hasn't 
had nearly the same success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. team is the benchmark for all other women's soccer in  
the world,'' Shannon said. ``All other countries measure themselves 
against the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening on Saturday was expected to set a world record for  
attendance at a women's athletic event. A women's soccer game at 
the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta drew a crowd of about 76,000; 
Giants Stadium holds more than 78,000.

<HEADLINE> Hearn Leads Provisional CART Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It was kind of like winning a lottery and  
being told you'd probably have to give the check back tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Hearn couldn't figure out whether to smile or grimace  
Friday after tearing off a quick lap in the final moments of 
qualifying to take the provisional pole for the Budweiser-G.I. 
Joe's 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain -- hardly an unusual weather condition in the Northwest --  
was the problem on the first of two days of time trials for 
Sunday's race at Portland International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Hearn, whose best start in the first six races this  
season has been 18th, was just ahead of Patrick Carpentier and 
Robby Gordon, two other drivers not usually at the front of the 
grid in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Way down the tentative 28-car field were the names everybody  
expects to be on top -- Juan Montoya, Dario Franchitti, Greg Moore 
and Michael Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, you can't control the weather,'' said Andretti, who was  
among the drivers caught by a heavy downpour in the first session. 
</P>
<P>
	CART rules played a big part in Friday's results.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of qualifying, the fastest drivers from the  
last road race on the schedule go out first, followed by the slower 
drivers from the previous event and any newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, it worked to the advantage of the also-rans as the  
1.969-mile, nine-turn circuit became considerably drier late in 
their session, allowing most of the drivers to switch from grooved 
rain tires to slicks for at least a few laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the guy that got the last full, clean lap without  
getting caught up in traffic was going to be on the pole,'' Gordon 
said. ``Everybody was really going for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hearn's fast lap was 117.369 mph, followed by Carpentier at  
117.017 and Gordon at 115.941. In contrast, Franchitti, the fastest 
driver in the wet opening session, had a fast lap of 99.641. 
</P>
<P>
	The top spot changed at least 10 times in the last 15 minutes of  
the 30-minute session, with Hearn's Reynard-Toyota winding up on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous boost for our team,'' said Hearn, who  
drives for John Della-Penna. ``Our qualifying has really stunk. No 
matter what happens the rest of the weekend, this feels real good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be praying for rain tomorrow.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Hearn and the rest of the drivers at the top  
of the provisional grid, the forecast for today's final round of 
qualifying called for sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that a Toyota-powered car has won a  
provisional pole, and both of them came on rainy days when the 
slower drivers got the benefit of the faster session. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Papis, then driving for Arciero-Wells Racing, was the  
provisional pole winner last June in Detroit. He slipped back to 
19th on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who slid into a tire barrier early in his session,  
shrugged off the virtually lost opening qualifying, which was 
red-flagged to a halt twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team fixed the car right away, but we had to sit on pit  
lane and serve an eight-minute penalty for causing a red flag,'' 
the Scotsman said. ``We didn't get back out onto the track until 4 1/2 
minutes left in the session. Then it was really just a matter of 
hanging on, seeing where the puddles were and trying to go as fast 
as we could. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty tricky, especially with the spray. You couldn't  
really see that much. But we're ready for whatever tomorrow 
brings.''

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore made a pitch to  
Hispanic voters Saturday by stressing education as a top way to 
extend prosperity enjoyed by ``Latino business owners'' to 
unskilled workers and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Spanish on occasion, Gore promised that if he is  
elected president to use the strong economic growth and educational 
gains of the past six years to increase job opportunities for 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Latino business ownership is at the highest levels, and Latino  
poverty rates are at the lowest levels,'' the leading Democratic 
candidate said during the annual conference of the National 
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ``We must 
extend this prosperity to the unskilled and the underprivileged, to 
our farms, our cities and to our immigrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people, primarily Hispanic school officials, were  
especially engaged by Gore's specific proposals, such as hiring 
more teachers, reducing class size from kindergarten to 12th grade 
and providing teacher training in computers in the high-tech age. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a national priority to reduce the Hispanic dropout rate,  
and I will not rest until we succeed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NALEO has more than 5,400 members nationwide and is designed to  
encourage Latinos to participate in U.S. government and politics. 
The Hispanic population is expected to be a strong force in the 
2000 election and has grown rapidly, especially in a few large 
states, this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics have tended to register and vote as Democrats, but  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner is fluent in 
Spanish and is believed to hold wide appeal for that group. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Va., Gore  
told new graduates of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and 
Technology to use their special knowledge to ``change the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology for simple economic gain is not all there is. It  
can unite us or divide us depending on our use of it,'' he said.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch returned home to Utah  
this weekend to determine whether he can rally the support and 
money to join the race for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, met at  
state GOP headquarters late Friday with party leaders, including 
Gov. Mike Leavitt and Utah's three U.S. House members. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked to potential supporters and potential donors for the  
campaign for the presidency,'' state party chairman Rob Bishop said 
Saturday. ``The conversations dealt with what would be the next 
step and what would be needed to take that step,'' he said, adding 
that several people probably wrote checks on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has not said whether he will run. But he is working  
informally with Sacramento, Calif., campaign consultant Sal Russo, 
who said: ``He's in this to win. He's doing this like he conducts 
himself in the U.S. Senate, carefully and deliberately. We're 
pretty much at the end of the evaluation period and pretty much 
everything has been positive so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hatch takes the plunge, he would be entering an already  
crowded GOP race well behind the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate Sen. Bob Smith  
of New Hampshire plans to keep his Senate seat even if he leaves 
his party to run for president under another party's banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said he may abandon the GOP because it has drifted  
from its conservative roots and run under a newly formed group. 
He'll announce his decision by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A national poll taken in May showed just 1 percent of  
Republicans backing Smith for president. 
</P>
<P>
	If he loses the presidency, Smith told the Concord Monitor, he  
won't give up the Senate seat he won as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Smith can get reelected to the Senate without the GOP's  
financial support is another matter, says Steve Duprey, chairman of 
the New Hampshire Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Party kicked in $100,000 to get Smith  
elected in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some think a third party led by Smith could fragment  
Republicans, Duprey said the real danger is to Smith, who'll need 
the GOP's resources come election time.

<HEADLINE> Search On for Synagogue Arsonists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENT0, Calif. (AP) -- Federal agents from across the West on  
Saturday hunted for the arsonists who torched three synagogues and 
caused about $1 million in damages that included the loss of a 
5,000-volume library. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no arrests or suspects, but investigators said they  
were examining anti-Jewish fliers found at two of the crime scenes. 
They said leads were developing from calls coming into a federal 
hotline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide variety. People who may have heard things, or seen  
things, or just have tips concerning people they think are 
involved. So, it's a wide range,'' said FBI spokesman Nick Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Adamcik of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, said more than 100 federal agents were involved in the 
investigation. Adamcik, who is based in Dallas, said agents were 
called in from several western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to discuss specifics of the investigation.  
Adamcik said the first firefighters at the scene of two of the 
burned synagogues found containers that the arsonists may have used 
to hold fuel or chemicals, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal agents had been divided into three teams and  
were collecting physical and photographic evidence at the 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Friday, arsonists torched the 150-year-old Congregation  
B'nai Israel near downtown, the oldest synagogue west of the 
Mississippi River, and two suburban synagogues, the Congregation 
Beth Sholem and the Kenesset Israel Torah Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires happened within minutes of each other shortly after 3  
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest damage was reported at B'nai Israel, a Reform  
synagogue in the affluent Land Park district, where thousands of 
books, some of them hundreds of years old, and hundreds of 
videotapes were lost in the flames. Damages were estimated at 
$800,000, but Rossi said that figure could rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A flier blaming the ``International Jewsmedia'' for the war in  
Kosovo was found at the Kenesset Israel Torah Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are Slavs, we will never allow the International Jew World  
Order to take our Land,'' the flier read. ``We fight to keep Serbia 
free forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A clergyman for Sacramento's only Serbian church denied any link  
to the fires and denounced the arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our church and our people have nothing to do with this act of  
terror, this act of hate,'' said the Rev. Dobrivoje Milunovic of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Assumption. ``Our prayers and 
thoughts are with the members of the Jewish congregations whose 
temples have been burned.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Hooker Ring Broken Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- A couple that seemed to fit in just fine  
in this quiet north Fulton County neighborhood, is charged with 
operating a metro-wide prostitution ring from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Williams, 38, and Lamon Williams, 48, were charged with  
racketeering and pimping after authorities say they confiscated 
records detailing a prostitution ring, pornography and a home 
computer police allege was used to recruit and solicit prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've certainly updated the oldest profession for the next  
millennium,'' said DeKalb County Police Capt. Doug Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were held on bonds exceeding $50,000 following their arrest  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the couple operated the prostitution ring under  
the umbrella of Diamond's Escort agency, which serviced businessmen 
who could afford $200-an-hour fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton says nearly 30,000 visited the World Wide Web site, which  
advertises: ``Black beauties. The Most Glamorous Women Of ... To Be 
Your Escort ... Sweet Treats For You Today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, which faced similar charges last year that were  
later dropped in Gwinnett County, also ran ads in local newspapers, 
adult magazines and strip clubs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams' two school-age sons, who regularly played  
basketball in the driveway with other neighbors, are in the custody 
of their 19-year-old son.

<HEADLINE> Lemke Pitches in Minor League Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE FALLS, N.J. (AP) -- Former Atlanta Braves infielder Mark  
Lemke made his minor-league pitching debut Friday night with the 
New Jersey Jackals, uncorking three wild pitches but striking out 
two with an erratic knuckleball. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting a pitch he developed several years ago while the  
Braves' starting second baseman, Lemke pitched the ninth inning of 
the Jackals' 14-4 victory over the Adirondack Lumberjacks of the 
independent Northern League. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke gave up one hit and one run in his professional pitching  
debut. He would have made it through the inning unscathed but for 
three wild pitches, the first allowing a batter he had struck out 
to reach first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lemmer just had nasty stuff out there tonight,'' Jackals  
catcher D.C. Olsen said. ``He has worked so hard to get to this 
point. I was really proud of him, the way he handled himself out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has come such a long way in getting his knuckleball over,  
spotting his fastball, and in all aspects of knowing what a pitcher 
needs to do out there,'' Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke began the inning by fanning Ruben Santana, who reached  
first when the pitch got away from Olsen. Santana went to second on 
another wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemke got Eric Yelding to fly to center and struck out Bryan  
Britt swinging. Santana went to third on yet another wild pitch and 
scored on Kevin Ham's double to left. Lemke got Kasuaki Miyazaki to 
ground out to third to end the inning.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Phenom Kerry Wood Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As the Chicago Cubs took batting practice, a  
tall, lean guy in shorts and a T-shirt roamed around the infield 
shagging balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that Kerry Wood out there?  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the right-hander couldn't step on the field without  
causing a stir. With his 20 strikeouts in his fifth major league 
start and NL Rookie of the Year honors, he was the next Nolan Ryan 
and Roger Clemens, right down to his Texas roots. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kerrymania is on hold for at least the rest of this season.  
In the meantime, Wood has more pressing matters to deal with, like 
rehabilitating his surgically repaired elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last year I was excited, I was ready to come back and  
have a great season,'' he said. ``It's unfortunate, but it's 
happened and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to 
dwell on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he's focused on the business of getting healthy. Nearly  
three months after having ``Tommy John'' surgery, there's no pain, 
he has his complete range of motion back and the arm feels like it 
did before the problems started. 
</P>
<P>
	It will still be a few weeks before he can play catch, and  
months before he can test that 95-mph fastball that burned some of 
the best. But so far, the prognosis looks good for baseball's 
brightest young pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing quite well,'' said Dave Tumbas, the Cubs' trainer.  
``His strength is improved, not only in the elbow but also in the 
shoulder. He's doing his conditioning, working his lower body and 
back. We're doing total body conditioning on him and strength. But 
our main emphasis, obviously, is on the elbow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's had elbow pain ever since high school, when he threw so  
hard his catcher had to soak his hand in ice after games. Horrified 
when he saw Dave Dravecky break his arm, he knew there was a 
serious injury somewhere in his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman had that same awful premonition.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Montreal, the first game he was going to pitch, I remember  
him walking out on the field with a sleeve on his elbow and I was 
thinking, `This kid knows there's something there in that elbow,' 
'' Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager tried to limit Wood's innings, drawing boos whenever  
he went to the mound. Wood averaged less than 6 2-3 innings an 
outing, and his only complete game was when he blew the Houston 
Astros away with 20 strikeouts in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still missed the last month of the regular season with a  
sprained elbow ligament. He came back for the playoffs, pitching 
well against Atlanta, and thought additional work during the 
offseason would take care of any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when he felt a pinch in his arm in spring training, he  
didn't say anything. He wasn't in pain, he hadn't heard any pops 
and his velocity was still up, way up. Just some winter rust, he 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he woke up the morning after his first start in spring  
training, he couldn't straighten his arm. By the time he had tests, 
he already knew what he'd hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was expecting to go in and have them tell me it was torn,''  
Wood said. ``And that's what they told me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some blamed his across-the-body delivery for the injury. Others  
accused the Cubs of rushing his development. But for a hard thrower 
like Wood -- he struck out 233 last season and his average of 12.6 
strikeouts per nine innings led the league -- Riggleman said it's 
just a risk of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you throw hard and you've got good arm speed and you get  
tremendous torque on your breaking ball, it's extremely tough on 
hitters. But it's also extremely tough on your own body,'' 
Riggleman said. ``It's a double-edged sword. It's what makes you a 
good pitcher, but it's also what gets you hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for Wood, this is not a career-ending injury. In the  
25 years since Tommy John had the first ligament replacement 
surgery, dozens of pitchers have had it. 
</P>
<P>
	John Snyder had the surgery, and he's tied for most wins on the  
Chicago White Sox this season. Kurt Ainsworth, the San Francisco 
Giants top pick in the draft earlier this month, won seven straight 
on his way to a 13-6 record this spring, his first full season 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to come back with the same stuff. I haven't had any  
discomfort since surgery. I haven't had a bad day yet, knock on 
wood,'' Wood said, knocking on his locker. ``If something happens 
where I don't, then we'll make adjustments at that point. But I'm 
not going to start thinking about coming back with less stuff until 
I have to think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That practical attitude is typical Wood. He shied away from much  
of last year's publicity, taking more delight in the rookie razzing 
he got from teammates than invites from Letterman and Leno. 
</P>
<P>
	He's no different now, pitcher Terry Mulholland said. A regular  
at Wrigley Field, Wood is in uniform and on the bench for most 
games. He even occasionally takes a turn chasing down balls in the 
infield during batting practice, although he can't throw the ball 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	But when his teammates go through their pregame warmups, Wood  
heads for the training room. For about 3 1/2 hours each day, he lift 
weights, rides the exercise bike, runs and does exercises to 
strengthen his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been great,'' Mulholland said. ``I'm sure it gets to the  
point where there's a certain amount of frustration involved and 
probably a whole lot of envy, too. Seeing guys go out there, 
playing ball, having fun, winning games, losing tough games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to be in the clubhouse and be in the dugout,  
and it's another thing to be out on the field and be a part of it. 
I'm sure that's probably the part that hurts the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It does.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been his entire life. The 22-year-old Wood grew up  
idolizing Ryan, and he can't remember a time when he didn't play. 
He's never had to sit out this long, and there are times when it's 
too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens, he heads to Texas for a few days to see his  
family. Or goes to the Cubs' minor league facility in Arizona to 
work out. What he refuses to do is sit around dreaming about next 
year and how good it's going to feel to climb back on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would drive me crazy if I sat here every day and said, `I  
wish I could be out there,' '' he said. ``This year, my job is to 
come here and work out and do my arm exercises and get the arm back 
to where it should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I wish I could be out there. But I know I can't, so  
I'm not going to torture myself.''

	EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) -- Pretinha and Sissi each  
scored three tiems and Brazil lived up to its reputation as the 
best non-seeded team at the Women's World Cup on Saturday with a 
7-1 rout of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Katia added a penalty kick goal as Mexico couldn't stay with  
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha took only 130 seconds to score and put her side ahead  
2-0 after only 12 minutes. Sissi added two first-half goals in the 
final 22 minutes as Brazil put Mexico on the defensive almost from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Played as the second game of the opening-day doubleheader after  
the United States beat Denmark 3-0, many in the record crowd of 
78,792 at Giants Stadium had left by the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, considered by many the fifth best team in the world  
behind the United States, Norway, China and Germany, moved forward 
from the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha sent a left-footed blast past Linnea Quinones in the  
third minute. Maribel Dominguez tied it seven minutes later, 
sending a shot from 30 yards just past the outstretched arms of 
goalkeeper Maravilha and barely inside the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the only shot on goal Mexico would get all half.  
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha restored the lead two minutes later and Sissi signaled  
the start of the rout by bending a free kick from just outside the 
penalty area in the 29th. She scored on another free kick in the 
50th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha matched Sissi's hat trick by getting her head onto a  
cross from Marisa in the 90th minute.

<HEADLINE> California Changes GOP Primary Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONTARIO, Calif. (AP) -- California Republican party leaders voted  
Saturday to change their presidential primary from a 
``winner-take-all'' system to one that would allow multiple 
candidates to split the state's many delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's executive committee voted 52-12 to change the system  
for California's March 7, 2000 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the change said it would make the candidates focus  
their campaigns earlier and thus help produce stronger party 
support for the eventual presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was also seen as a signal to the perceived front-runner,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, that some state conservatives want their 
votes to go to the more conservative candidates they favor. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill implementing the change must pass through the state  
legislature and be signed by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis by July 1, 
the national GOP's deadline. The prospect of the bill hurtling 
through both houses and then getting the governor's signature, all 
in 12 days, was uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure's chief proponent, state Sen. Ray Haynes, who  
supports Bush, placed the odds at less than 50 percent, and he 
ruled out any subsequent appeals to courts or election officials to 
change existing state law. 
</P>
<P>
	While the party is dominated by conservatives -- many of whom  
support presidential candidates more conservative than Bush -- 
Haynes insisted the change would be healthy for the party. 
</P>
<P>
	It would force candidates to begin building campaign  
organizations soon, boosting the chances that the primary winner 
has a strong network in place after the primary, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Party spokesman Stuart DeVeaux said, ``We have to make sure not  
only that we have the best candidate, but that we are active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jim Brulte, one of five members who opposed the  
measure, said allowing candidates to target their campaigns to 
certain congressional districts, rather than statewide, heightened 
the possibility they would write the state off and thus drag the 
entire ticket down. Brulte is a California co-chairman for Bush but 
said he was speaking for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed change, candidates would fight for the 156  
California party delegates, district by district. A victory in one 
district would be worth three delegates, with up to two dozen 
at-large delegates probably going to candidates based on their 
proportion of the statewide vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, the Republican candidate who draws the  
largest number of votes statewide takes all party delegates to the 
national convention, where the nominee is chosen. California has 
the biggest delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill Haynes is promoting would allow party rules to  
supersede state law. The Democrats already have a proportional 
primary system. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Hammon, from the Steve Forbes campaign, said that if the  
new system becomes law, ``We'll be looking at every single 
congressional district.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Virginia's Republican party voted to move up its  
presidential primary to next February, instead of May or June, an 
attempt to give that state's GOP more national clout.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Face Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- When the Dallas Stars played the Colorado  
Avalanche in the Western Conference finals, it was hard to imagine 
a playoff series with more intensity and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the Stanley Cup finals.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a series from an intensity standpoint that is much  
higher than the Colorado series even,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the Stars seven hard-fought games to beat the Avalanche,  
and they had to win the last two to do it. Now it's the Buffalo 
Sabres who are down 3-2, and the Stars have a chance to close out 
the series with a victory in Game 6 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a feel for anything right now, because the swings  
and momentum happen so quickly with these two teams and because 
both teams are fired up,'' Hitchcock said. ``I mean, you are seeing 
(long) shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had players last five minutes, never sat down on the  
bench, and they have had players doing the same thing. The 
emotional swings in these games are so dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' 2-0 victory in Dallas on Thursday night was typical --  
low scoring and high tension. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended in a fight between Buffalo's Rhett Warrener and Dallas'  
Derian Hatcher. Warrener, who suffered a broken ankle and underwent 
surgery on Friday, will be replaced by Darryl Shannon in a 
defensive pairing alongside Jay McKee. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's game featured a screaming match at the end  
between Hitchcock and Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff. On Friday, the 
Sabres accused the Stars of dirty tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch Pat Verbeek play, he turns his stick over every  
time, and it's a two-hand swing,'' Ruff said. ``Is that an intent 
to hurt one of our guys? It's darn close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said Ruff's comments were deliberately aimed at  
influencing the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can show you the video where some cheap shots were taken at  
us,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's the type of game it is. ... What he 
is hoping for is the referees read the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Guy Carbonneau said the Stars are not aiming to hurt any  
of the Sabres, but added, ``We will do anything to try to win the 
game. If they don't like it, that is too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the series has been a playoff classic -- if you like  
low-scoring, tight-checking games. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have combined for just 18 goals -- the lowest total  
after five games of the finals since 1947 when Montreal and Toronto 
had 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams emotionally really gave it all they had,'' Ruff  
said of Game 5 in Dallas. ``It was tight as tight can be. Not a lot 
of ice for either team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars finished with the best record in the NHL during the  
season, 23 points ahead of the Sabres, who were seeded No. 7 in the 
Eastern Conference. So far, regular-season records haven't meant a 
thing between these teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won the opener 3-2 in overtime, Dallas won 4-2, with  
the final goal an empty-netter, and then 2-1 before the Sabres tied 
the series with a 2-1 victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every shift is just so intense,'' said the Stars' Darryl  
Sydor, who scored the winning goal Thursday night. ``This is the 
time of year that everyone wants to play. You know, it builds and 
builds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the defensive style of play, there's another reason  
why the scores have been so low: goalies Ed Belfour of the Stars 
and Dominik Hasek of the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has faced 148 shots in the five games and given up nine  
goals; Belfour has faced 98 and given up eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that both goalies are under siege right now,''  
Hitchcock said. ``The shot totals are not indicative of the 
tenacity around each team's net. I think both guys are holding up 
pretty well because it is a very emotional scene in front of both 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Stars have a chance to win their first Stanley Cup in  
franchise history, and the Sabres have a chance to extend the 
series to seven games and send it back to Dallas for a Game 7 on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sabres were longshots before the series began, they are  
certainly even more so now. Only three of 15 teams who won Game 5 
with the series tied 2-2 have come back to win the Cup, the last 
Montreal in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to win,'' Buffalo's Dixon Ward said. ``I'm not going  
to guarantee anything, but we are going to go out there with full 
intention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is counting out the Sabres, especially considering the  
way the series has gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know,'' Hitchcock said. ``Us being up 3-2 in the  
series really is the only thing that any team should feel 
comfortable about right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no read on momentum, like there is no dominant  
player, there is no dominant area. It is just an absolute 
shift-by-shift battle.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Predator Sting Nets Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A 36-year-old Flint man was arrested Friday after  
he went to Livonia hoping to have sex with a 14-year-old girl he 
met on the Internet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Glenn Newcombe, of Davison, was arraigned in District  
Court Saturday on a charge of attempted solicitation of a minor for 
immoral purposes. It is the seventh felony arrest Wayne County's 
``cyber-sheriff's unit'' has made since its inception in December, 
Sheriff Robert Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ficano said Newcombe began an online conversation Wednesday with  
a deputy posing as a 14-year-old in an Internet chat room. The man 
then planned a rendezvous at a Livonia restaurant for the purpose 
of having sex with the girl, Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe, who is separated from his wife and has two daughters,  
could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ficano said the arrest illustrates how important it is for  
parents to keep tabs on their children's Internet use. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all sorts of blockers and filters that parents think  
are protecting their children when they're on the (information) 
superhighway,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking that parents step in and know who their kids are  
talking to,'' he said. ``Some parents are using (the Internet) as a 
baby-sitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the sheriff's three-person cyber unit say eight out  
of 10 Internet chat room conversations turn to the topic of sex. 
That's not illegal unless the talk becomes an invitation to have 
sex with a minor, or child pornography is involved, Ficano said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once you click in, you find it often leads to these types  
of actions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne County's unit has also helped authorities in Florida and  
Canada make similar arrests, Ficano said.

	NATO Says Serb Withdrawal on Schedule  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO said Serb troops may pull out  
of Kosovo well ahead of their Sunday midnight deadline. 
Peacekeepers met with ethnic Albanian rebels in an attempt to 
prevent them from embarking on a new reign of terror to fill the 
vacuum left by the retreating Serbs. On the streets of Pristina, 
the Kosovo capital, the number of NATO security checkpoints grew 
noticeably, especially in the neighborhood of the rebels' offices. 
There were about 40,000 Yugoslav troops in Kosovo before an 
international peace deal reached June 9 ended NATO's 78-day bombing 
campaign against Yugoslavia. Only 3,000 to 5,000 remain. 

</P>

	Russia Nixes Kosovo Rebuild Program  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Russia blocked world leaders today from  
adopting a Kosovo rebuilding program that excludes Slobodan 
Milosevic's regime. The leaders held out the possibility of fixing 
Belgrade's bombed-out power plants and roads for humanitarian 
reasons. ``One cannot make the Serbian people suffer for their 
president,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said. Sandy 
Berger, the U.S. national security adviser, said the summit's final 
communique would be silent about banning help for Milosevic because 
Russia refused to go along. 

</P>
<P>
	Bono Leads Protest for Debt Relief  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Led by Irish rocker Bono, at least  
20,000 people grasped hands today and formed a human chain around 
downtown Cologne to urge more debt relief for impoverished 
countries. Bono, of the band U2, presented petitions to German 
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the host of the Group of Eight 
Summit, and met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Police said 
there were 20,000 people at the protest. Bono joined an effort 
organized by the Jubilee 2000 Coalition, a church-led movement that 
wants Western nations to mark the new millennium by erasing the 
debts of poorer countries.

	Coloradans Seek Violence Protection  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- At a summit on school safety today, Denver's  
police chief said security might have to supersede students' rights 
in the wake of the Columbine massacre, and others called for school 
prayer, gun control and stronger families to prevent another 
killing spree. Gov. Bill Owens said he hoped the shootings at 
Columbine High School would raise public awareness of growing 
violence in schools. On April 20, two students opened fire, killing 
a teacher and 12 classmates, before turning the guns on themselves. 
Teen-agers, public officials and national experts attended the 
summit.

	Clinton Pushes for Strong Gun Laws  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton in his weekly radio  
address today aimed to stir public anger over what he said was a 
congressional majority taking its orders from the National Rifle 
Association. ``We can't allow the gun lobby to rewrite our laws and 
undermine our values,'' Clinton said. To the NRA, he said, ``I wish 
you would help us. But we've overcome your scare tactics and 
strong-arm pressure before.'' The House voted 280-147 yesterday to 
defeat the gun-control bill, which was drafted in response to a 
rash of school shootings.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans pressed their case  
today for a reorganization of the Energy Department in response to 
the continuing controversy over the safeguarding of America's 
nuclear secrets. In the weekly GOP radio address, Sen. Jon Kyl, 
R-Ariz., accused the Clinton administration of taking ``half 
measures'' in dealing with security at nuclear weapons 
laboratories. Kyl is one of three GOP senators who have proposed 
putting nuclear weapons programs under a largely autonomous agency 
within the Energy Department.

	Turin Wins 2006 Winter Games

<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The IOC delivered a massive snub to  
Switzerland -- and the Swiss official who blew the whistle on 
Olympic corruption -- when it selected Italy as the host for the 
2006 Winter Games. A backlash associated with the Olympics' worst 
scandal helped the city of Turin upset the favored Swiss town of 
Sion in Saturday's vote by the International Olympic Committee. 
Even more surprising than the result was the margin of Turin's 
victory. The Italians won 53-36, a stunning defeat for a Swiss bid 
that was considered the front-runner all along.

	United States 3, Denmark 0  
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mia Hamm, the career goal-scoring  
leader with 110, demonstrated all of her skills with a goal and an 
assist today in the United States' 3-0 victory over Denmark to open 
the Women's World Cup. Before a turnout of 78,972 -- the most ever 
for a U.S. women's sporting event -- the Americans took control in 
the second half. Hamm was at the forefront. Her passes either 
sprung teammates for open shots or found them in threatening 
positions. Kristine Lilly scored from 18 yards in the 89th minute 
as the U.S. veterans led the victory.

<HEADLINE> Gay Priest Bypassed for Bishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, N.Y. (AP) -- An Episcopal Church of America diocese elected  
a Newark, N.J., priest as its next bishop Saturday, narrowly 
bypassing a New Hampshire candidate hoping to become the church's 
first openly gay bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	After five ballots, the Diocese of Rochester in western New York  
chose the Rev. Jack McKelvey ahead of the Rev. V. Gene Robinson and 
three other nominees to succeed retiring Bishop William G. Burrill 
at year-end. 
</P>
<P>
	McKelvey, 57, a bishop suffragan or assisting bishop of the  
Newark Diocese for nine years and a priest since 1967, supports 
same-sex marriages and ordination of openly gay ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the church is going to have to be ready for it  
eventually,'' he said. ``When that is I don't know, but gay and 
lesbian people to be sure are human beings under God's care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his opponent, he said, ``We would not differ  
theologically and perhaps in anything that I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 52, assistant to Bishop Douglas Theuner of the Diocese  
of New Hampshire and a priest for 25 years, was married with two 
children when he acknowledged he was gay in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it was an issue in this election,'' he said, ``and I  
applaud the people of the diocese in being quite open in asking me 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he expects to try again to become a bishop in  
another diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	The election still must be approved by a majority of the  
dioceses and bishops in the 2.5 million-member church, which is 
based in New York.

<HEADLINE> Belfour Outdoing the Dominator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- He has stayed calm amid the turmoil that  
thunders down the ice every 30 seconds or so, oblivious to 
everything but stopping the puck. Words don't rattle him. Sticks to 
the midsection don't, either. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the rink, the opposing goaltender seems  
ready to implode at any moment, ranging far from the crease to 
tangle, dropping his stick at every minor provocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as predicted, the goaltenders in the lowest-scoring Stanley  
Cup finals in more than 40 years have been true to form. 
</P>
<P>
	Just not their form.  
</P>
<P>
	It is almost as if Ed Belfour of Dallas and Dominik Hasek of  
Buffalo, who didn't get along as Chicago Blackhawks teammates and 
certainly don't mingle in the same social circles now, exchanged 
uniforms and personalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour, once seen as the loose cannon, a player wound so tight  
that he might uncoil at any moment, has played with a hardened 
resolve and a refusal to let anything deter him from winning the 
cup. His shutout in Game 5 on Thursday was only the fourth in the 
Stanley Cup finals this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie has been playing unbelievable,'' teammate Darryl Sydor  
said. ``He has been in the shadow of a lot of goaltenders and I 
think he has really taken that as motivation to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it is Hasek, seen as the best goaltender in the game  
and the one best equipped to win the big game, who has displayed 
emotion and a hair trigger. Even some of his teammates thought he 
was ready to blow after the Sabres gave away home ice advantage by 
losing Game 3 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Curiously, Belfour has long played in Hasek's shadow, even  
though Belfour was the No. 1 goaltender in Chicago in 1991 and 1992 
and Hasek was his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek developed into hockey's most prized goaltender only after  
the Blackhawks essentially gave him away in a trade with Buffalo, 
and Chicago fans have long blamed them for dealing the wrong 
goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while playing on consecutive Presidents' Trophy-winning  
teams in Dallas the last two seasons, Belfour was combative and 
uncooperative at times with teammates and coach Ken Hitchcock. The 
two took some time to find common ground, doing so only after 
Hitchcock essentially gave Belfour the space he seems to covet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at 34, the two-time Vezina Trophy winner has outplayed  
three star goaltenders -- Grant Fuhr, Patrick Roy and Hasek. 
Finally, the whispers are subsiding that he lacks the discipline 
and composure needed to win the NHL's ultimate prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what people think,'' Belfour said. ``I  
work hard and do my best, and that's what I've always done. I don't 
really care what people think or say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, those people wore the same uniform colors that he  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when he would get frustrated and he would let  
his emotions out,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``You would get 
to a point late in the game and you would say, `Uh, oh. Here goes 
Eddie. He's going to snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only snapping done by a goaltender in this series was by  
Hasek, who suggested before Game 4 that the Sabres play with more 
aggressiveness and passion and take more risks on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour could only roll his eyes when he heard those words. In  
his mind, a goaltender is supposed to stop pucks, not give pep 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about my job,'' he said. ``Anytime a goaltender starts  
telling a forward how to play his game, it seems pretty ridiculous. 
It would be like them telling me how to handle the puck. It doesn't 
make any sense.''

<HEADLINE> Turin Residents Stunned by Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- No chanting crowds, no flags, no celebration  
in downtown squares and streets. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sleepy and rainy Saturday, most residents of Turin were  
unaware -- some were stunned -- that their city had been picked as 
the site of the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza San Carlo, the traditional gathering spot for thousands  
of people during labor rallies or after triumphs by the Juventus 
soccer team, was empty of people and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who learned the news from a special edition of the local  
sports daily and from early morning reports on Italian radio and 
television began pondering the pros and cons of organizing Italy's 
first Winter Olympics in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortina D'Ampezzo was the last Italian venue to have won a  
Winter Olympics in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin, a city of 2.2 million residents in northern Italy,  
defeated favorite Sion, Switzerland, for the organization of the 
games in a 53-36 secret ballot by the International Olympic 
Committee at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of Turin's victory hit an almost deserted and tranquil  
city at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Winter Olympics are going to bring to the city and nearby  
areas economic benefits and new jobs,'' Renato Ceste, a taxi 
driver, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy has a 12.4 percent nationwide unemployment rate, and  
industrial areas like Turin -- home to Fiat, the automaker which is 
Italy's largest private employer -- are always particularly 
sensitive to economic ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not expect that Turin could beat Sion,'' Ceste said.  
``Being the host city of the games means more tourists and good 
business for the hotels and shops. Turin can host without problems 
up to 300,000 additional visitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gianni Agnelli, the automobile tycoon and financier whose family  
staunchly supported Turin as a candidate, said the IOC's decision 
``is a reason for pride, especially for me as a Turin native, as a 
sportsman and as a passionate supporter of the mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity ... a `bravo' to the promoters of the  
bid,'' Agnelli added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agnelli family, owner of the giant Fiat auto group and of  
the winter resort of Sestriere, is expected to play a leading role 
in the organization of the Winter Games because it also holds large 
interests in the real estate and construction sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian organizers will have to build ice stadiums in Turin for  
speed skating, ice hockey, figure skating and curling, a huge 
Olympic and media village, bobsled and luge tracks in Beulard and a 
ski jumping hill in Pragelato, in the western Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	A local environmental group immediately criticized the IOC's  
decision, claiming that the games will do environmental damage to 
the city and Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Olympic Committee also criticized the huge investment  
for the public finance, estimated at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cesare Gallo, a white-collar worker, said he was afraid of the  
possible environmental impact, especially in the Susa valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will build new roads and cut woods to make room for new  
tracks and hills .... but this a cost we must be prepared to pay 
for the economic development of the city and of the region,'' Gallo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizio Crosetti, a Turin-based commentator for the nationwide  
daily La Repubblica, said the successful bid ``will help Turin, a 
city rich in art, to emerge from the shadows and come into 
international limelight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The world and tourists will learn that Italy is not only Rome,  
Florence and Venice,'' Crosetti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsstand owner Luca Paolucci said he possibly was one of the  
few persons in Turin who expected a success of the city's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy will benefit .... Let's hope they do not spoil our  
valleys,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin's bid gained momentum in the final few days, after the  
Italian delegation made its presentation in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Sion seemed to have the edge in its third Olympic  
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Aletti, cashier of a downtown cafe, said she was proud  
for the city but worried about possible terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sometimes strike during major sports events,'' she said.  
``I'm somewhat frightened.''

<HEADLINE> Two Sentenced in Kid Porn Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The only Louisiana target of a  
nationwide FBI online pornography sting got two years and nine 
months after admitting that he sent child pornography over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, a former mental health director for a Baton  
Rouge hospital will get psychiatric evaluation at a federal prison 
before he is sentenced for receiving child pornography over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	John M. Stern, who pleaded guilty to eight counts of  
transporting child pornography via a computer network, was among 
more than a dozen people arrested when the FBI raided 120 homes in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents posing as people interested in dirty pictures  
conversed with Stern by computer in April 1995, and Stern sent them 
pictures of minors engaged in sexual activity via America Online, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, both he and Gerald Hooper, once director of  
mental and behavioral health at Our Lady of the Lake Regional 
Medical Center, had sentence hearings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooper pleaded guilty in March to receiving child pornography  
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A routine software upgrade turned up pornographic files on his  
office computer in March 1998, but pornography had been found on 
the computer twice before, prosecutors told U.S. District Judge 
Frank Polozola. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was arrested, the computer held more than 150  
pornographic files, including pictures of minors engaged in 
sexually explicit conduct, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baum said Hooper was in therapy before he pleaded guilty.  
</P>
<P>
	Polozola said he needs psychiatric and psychological evaluations  
to decide what treatment will be part of Hooper's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not set a sentencing date, but said Hooper must surrender  
for assignment to a hospital by July 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum sentence is 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine,  
but attorney Rodney Baum said he expects Hooper to get less as a 
first offender. 
</P>
<P>
	Time spent being evaluated in federal custody also will be  
credited to the sentence, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooper was fired from OLOL and has worked since then in  
Arkansas, but resigned that job in anticipation of the sentence, 
his attorney said.

<HEADLINE> Retirement To Strain Teachers' Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEABROOK, Md. (AP) -- Sixth-grade teacher Judith Davis is not  
wasting any time in the hours before the class promotion ceremony 
at Gaywood Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	In Room 26, she is giving one struggling student another chance:  
pass this late test to advance to the seventh grade -- and join 
classmates soon celebrating in front of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get your pencil; have a seat and let's get started,'' Davis  
says. ``You won't get your certificate today, but you'll get to 
walk across the stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the last acts of kindness in Davis' 35-year  
teaching career. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two decades, she dispensed lessons from the same  
classroom, with pale green cinderblock walls and without air 
conditioning, in this Prince George's County community just east of 
the Washington, D.C., line. 
</P>
<P>
	She retired last week -- one of some 70,000 public school  
teachers nationwide this year expected not to return after summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	While that comes to about 2 percent of the country's 2.7 million  
teachers, one-third of those instructors have been on the job at 
least 20 years and are close to qualifying for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 10 years, nearly a million teachers will retire,  
the U.S. Education Department predicts, and an estimated 2.2 
million teachers will have to replace those departing ``Baby Boom'' 
hires to meet record enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
	The retirement of experienced teachers like Davis and the needs  
of an expanding and diverse student body threaten to strain, even 
overwhelm school districts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know something has got to change,'' Davis said. ``The whole  
profession is not attracting people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On her final full day, Tuesday, she was faced with 25 restless  
students. For the problem of two students arguing in class, she 
dragged a desk closer to the front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Davis is just being herself,'' said Angelica Rowe, 11.  
``She's always known how to handle us kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average U.S. teacher has 16 years of experience, five years  
more than in 1978. New hires now are not staying as long, leaving 
schools like Gaywood short on such experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states have always required advanced degrees or competency  
tests for teachers. But some states, during emergency shortages, do 
employ instructors who lack such credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	This Maryland county -- which has the state's highest number of  
uncertified teachers, 18 percent -- plans to hire 1,400 teachers by 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis started her teaching career in her home state of  
Pennsylvania. When her marriage brought her to Washington in 1969, 
there was no teacher shortage in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Times have changed. Last year, President Clinton pushed through  
federal funding to hire 30,000 new teachers nationally. He wants 
more dollars for a new round of hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet needs vary by region.  
</P>
<P>
	School districts in California, Florida, Nevada, Texas and other  
fast-growing states in the West and South have a critical shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in less desirable areas and with lower pay scales have  
openings they may never fill. New York state licensed almost 22,000 
teachers in the 1996-97 school year, but hired 9,000 unlicensed 
emergency teachers, most in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Even districts with enough classroom teachers struggle to hire  
teachers for special and bilingual education, mathematics, and 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers are leaving for different reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	The majority -- 30 percent -- like Davis, are retiring. Federal  
education figures also show teachers also leave when they get 
pregnant or want to rear children (14.3 percent in 1997) or want 
another career (12.1 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	More and more teachers simply are unhappy; nearly 7 percent of  
the 1997 departures were attributed to low salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``For new teachers, it's sink or swim. A lot of them sink,''  
says Davis. ``Some never go on to become longtime teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her school district provides more in-house training than when  
she started, but ``they expect you to be at a much-higher level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State tests and performance standards are designed to hold  
somebody accountable for low test scores and student failure. In 
the past, Davis said, many of these tests were stuck in a child's 
folder and forgotten. That was before they were linked to whether 
teachers kept their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot face one more year of being told we're doing a  
rotten job,'' Davis said. ``You work so hard to get scores up and 
for whatever reason it doesn't happen and then you're told to go do 
another workshop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	About 15 years ago, Davis was teaching when a tall young man in  
a full naval dress uniform walked in -- a student she had taught 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids had their mouths opened,'' Davis said. ``He turned to  
them and said, `Whatever she says for you to do, do it. It's 
important.' I never would have gotten through the academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, high school student Brenda Mueller returned to see  
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got on my case, but she was the most dedicated teacher I  
had in elementary,'' said Mueller, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching students is not as easy as it used to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of teachers come out of college, then they run smack  
into the reality that they don't have the kinds of kids and classes 
you talked about in college,'' Davis said. ``Part of it is the 
students, they are dealing with very severe things in their lives 
... drugs, AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parental support also is not what it was, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier in the year, children watched an angry parent bring  
three acquaintances to school to beat up a gym teacher. It was 
terrible, we had to call the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Davis, it was just another sign the culture has changed. Her  
best friends have retired or left. Gone are the 
bulletin-board-making parties where gossip was traded as freely as 
construction paper. 
</P>
<P>
	To most current teachers at Gaywood, she said, she was ``just an  
old teacher down the hall.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Soccer Match Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Riot troops were called in to quell clashes among  
fans at a Russian soccer match Saturday, and the violence only 
subsided when the coach of the national team appealed for calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 500 people were involved in the fighting at the game  
between Moscow's Spartak and Saturn, Russian news reports said. The 
teams are among those vying for the Russian national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, held in Saturn's home stadium in Ramenskoye near  
Moscow, was suspended for a half an hour and riot troops were 
brought in. Then former Spartak star Oleg Romantsev, who was 
reappointed as coach of the national team last year, appeared on 
the field and appealed for the fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	Spartak won the match 3-0.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Law Unmourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth W. Starr may go out with a bang, but  
the law that sent him in pursuit of President Clinton is expiring 
without so much as a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel act lapses in 10 days, unmentioned and  
unmourned, the debate about extending it over, probably before it 
began. Versions of it have been in effect for two decades. There 
have been at least 21 special prosecutors under its terms, an 
approximate count because some cases were sealed and secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's five-year investigation, expanded from a failed land  
deal to the sex scandal that led to the impeachment of the 
president, is going to keep going, though. 
</P>
<P>
	The law provides that he can continue past its expiration, until  
he decides his tasks are done. That applies to four other 
independent counsels as well. Another, into influence peddling in 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development back when 
Republicans ran it, shut down early this month, after nine years in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragging investigations, disputed findings, failed prosecutions,  
and politics all figured in the consensus to led the law run out 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr himself said it should. He said it was supposed to take  
the politics out of law enforcement and prosecution, but 
``sometimes has the ironic effect of further politicizing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was a point of rare agreement between Starr and the Clinton  
administration. There were Senate and House hearings earlier this 
year on rewriting and extending the law, but the outcome was 
obvious then. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were burned by the system in the Iran-Contra case,  
when the independent counsel got a former secretary of defense 
indicted and issued a report damaging then-President George Bush, 
just before the 1992 election he lost to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	That led Republicans in the then-Democratic Senate to block  
renewal of the law for 18 months. After it went back onto the 
books, with Clinton's backing, the president and his administration 
became the target of seven independent counsel investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton hasn't heard the last of them. Starr says he isn't  
sure how much longer he will need to complete the investigations 
that have embroiled the White House. His last act will be a final 
report, and that could include assertions of wrongs by the 
president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, possibly as she 
campaigns for the Senate in New York. That could hurt in 2000, as 
Bush was hurt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said there have been no decisions on what will be in his  
final report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strive mightily while providing public information, public  
education, to divorce our decisions from politics whatsoever,'' 
Starr said last week in an interview on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no separating them when a prosecutor is on a case  
involving the top officials of an administration. Starr's volumes 
of evidence against Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair, and his 
recommendations for impeachment charges, were sent to the House as 
the 1998 congressional election campaign season began. Republicans 
tried to make Clinton an issue, but it didn't work. Democrats 
gained House seats despite it all. 
</P>
<P>
	When renewal of the law was being debated, Starr said that any  
independent counsel is subject to political attack, and it would be 
better to put the responsibility for investigating allegations of 
wrongdoing by people at the top of government back in the hands of 
the Justice Department, where it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, the attorney general would be in charge, with Congress  
overseeing what's done. That's the way it worked before 1978. When 
there were outside prosecutors -- and there had been only five -- 
they were chosen by attorneys general, usually because of 
congressional and political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Nixon accepted one as the price of getting his  
attorney general confirmed by the Senate. When he fired the first 
Watergate prosecutor for pressing subpoenas against the White 
House, the uproar forced him to accept a second one, and he was on 
the path toward resigning to avoid impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton yielded to political pressure when he had the first  
Whitewater prosecutor appointed by the Justice Department; the law 
was not in effect at the time. When it was revived, a panel of 
federal judges installed Starr to take over the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest, as the cliche goes, is history. So is the law.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Denmark 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- As soon as they walked onto the  
field, they knew Saturday would be something special. Something 
historic. Something unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. team beat Denmark 3-0 in the opener of the  
Women's World Cup, the players didn't want to leave. They wanted to 
soak in the atmosphere created by the biggest crowd ever to watch a 
women's sporting event in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was awesome, the noise was unbelievable,'' Mia Hamm  
said of the 78,972 fans who came to celebrate women's soccer and 
their own team. ``I think we all had goose bumps when we stepped 
onto the field. How could you not have goose bumps when you see the 
stadium filled and people chanting `U-S-A, U-S-A?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful way to start the tournament. This is what we  
always dreamed the World Cup should be. To see the crowd and the 
atmosphere is phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm certainly thrilled the fans. The career goal-scoring leader  
with 110, she demonstrated all of her skills with a goal and an 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mia was awesome,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. ``Just awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
	She scored a masterful goal in the 17th minute. Her passes  
either sprung teammates for open shots or found them in threatening 
positions. She created space for herself, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But not until Julie Foudy converted a long cross from Hamm with  
17 minutes left could the home team feel secure. Kristine Lilly 
scored from 18 yards in the 89th minute as the U.S. veterans led 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``A team can only shut us down for so long,'' said goalkeeper  
Briana Scurry, who rarely was tested in getting her 50th career 
shutout. ``They might slow us for a half, but they won't stop us 
for a full game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, with American flags waving everywhere, the players  
hugged, then trotted around the field, clapping and saluting the 
fans. Most of them looked like they didn't want to leave, and no 
one could blame them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People outside soccer know this stadium, the name Giants  
Stadium, and that what happens here is great events,'' Brandi 
Chastain said. ``And women's soccer now can be put right up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team that favors the quick strike was more methodical in  
wearing down the Danes. Led by Hamm's brilliant playmaking, the 
Americans had numerous scoring chances in the second half, as 
Denmark seemed to tire. 
</P>
<P>
	But the marksmanship wasn't there nearly all day. Cindy Parlow  
hit the crossbar. So did Lilly. Then Lilly missed by inches while 
wide open in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish goalkeeper Dorthe Larsen made a brilliant punch save on  
Tiffeny Milbrett as the Americans -- who won the first World Cup in 
1991 and took the 1996 Olympic gold medal -- continued their charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hamm's cross soared over Lilly's head, but right to  
Foudy, who put a left-footed kick into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly finished it off with a bending left-footer.  
</P>
<P>
	``We dominated the game,'' Lilly said. ``I'm glad we got those  
two at the end. I think it gave us a big boost going into our next 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will be Thursday against Nigeria in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
	In the second game of Saturday's doubleheader, Brazil routed  
Mexico 7-1 as Sissi and Pretinha each scored three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, in San Jose, Calif., China beat Sweden 2-1 and Japan  
and Canada tied at 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge crowd, which included United Nations secretary-general  
Kofi Annan, New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and Pele, 
soccer's biggest star, was entertained by the pop group 'N Sync 
before the game. Other than Hamm's goal, the singers drew the 
loudest cheers through the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes won most of Scurry's goal kicks, which helped them  
form some quick attacks. But those forays generally fizzled as the 
American defense, led by captain Carla Overbeck, kept the goal area 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett took a beating early, twice colliding with Danish  
players, sending her to the ground. Each time, she got up slowly 
and rarely was she able to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	But the other forwards, Hamm and Parlow, made several dangerous  
moves. Parlow's lack of speed and the close marking on Hamm 
prevented the Americans from getting more than the early goal -- 
until their fitness and flair took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all remember this day,'' Hamm said. ``With this kind of  
support, it's a wonderful feeling playing in front of this group.''

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Small Alpine town vs. big industrial  
city. Swiss reliability vs. Italian flair. Pirmin Zurbriggen vs. 
Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
	That shaped up as the most likely choice facing the IOC on  
Saturday in the first selection of an Olympic host city since the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, a provincial capital of 26,000 in the heart of the Swiss  
Alps, and Turin, the northern Italian industrial city of 2.2 
million, appeared to be the top contenders in an unpredictable 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other candidates in the all-European field are  
Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and 
Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee appointed a 16-member panel  
Saturday morning (Friday night EDT) that will pick two finalists. 
Then, 89 IOC members will choose the winner by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``selection college'' was composed of eight members elected  
by the IOC, including former Olympic champions Jean-Claude Killy of 
France and Valery Borzov of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The international federations appointed Joseph Fendt of luge,  
while Spain's Feliciano Mayoral represented the national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three athletes' representatives were named to the panel: Prince  
Albert of Monaco, who competed in bobsled and is now an IOC member; 
Thomas Gustaffson of Sweden, a speedskater; and cross-country skier 
Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, former FIFA president Joao  
Havelange of Brazil and Japanese IOC member Chiharu Igaya filled 
out the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the IOC voted on a Winter Olympic site, in 1995,  
Salt Lake City won the 2002 games in a landslide. As it turned out, 
the victory was aided by more than $1 million in inducements to IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, which broke six months ago, plunged the IOC into  
the biggest crisis of its 105-year history. Ten members have 
resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the scandal, IOC members were banned from  
visiting the 2006 bid cities, and the voting process was changed to 
allow a ``selection college'' to narrow the field to two. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the new rules were designed to make the  
system ``fireproof'' against any form of corruption or improper 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sion has been the front-runner from the start, delegates  
said Turin made a strong impression in Friday's presentation to the 
IOC assembly and could have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head final between Sion and Turin, the Swiss fear  
the vote could be swung by the strong Italian lobby in the IOC and 
possible bloc support from other Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion is bidding for the third time, following failed attempts  
for the 1972 and 2002 Games. Switzerland hasn't staged the Winter 
Games since 1948 in St. Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first bid from Turin, seeking to bring the Winter  
Olympics back to Italy for the first time since 1956 (Cortina 
D'Ampezzo). 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, whose bid includes Alpine ski events in Lillehammer,  
Norway, is hoping to get the Winter Games for Finland after five 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt is proposing a ``games without borders'' concept that  
includes sites in Austria, Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovak and Polish bids were given virtually no chance, with  
delegates saying they need more time to develop their economies and 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on member visits has been seen as an advantage for Sion,  
which played host to more than 60 IOC members during the 2002 bid. 
The Swiss say they have a vastly improved bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion was worried about possible resentment by some IOC members  
over the role of Switzerland's Marc Hodler in blowing the whistle 
on Olympic corruption in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly, Hodler did not speak during Sion's presentation  
Friday, which revolved around a film featuring a ``modern Heidi'' 
searching for five golden rings in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We changed our tactic from the last time,'' Sion bid president  
Adolf Ogi said. ``We underlined not the technical side but the 
emotional side of our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sion delegation included Zurbriggen, the former Olympic and  
World Cup ski champion. Tennis star Martina Hingis offered her 
support in a videotaped message. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin made a businesslike presentation, emphasizing it is the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. Bid leaders said Turin can 
provide all the amenities of a big city, while offering easy access 
to world class mountain venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomba, the three-time Olympic ski champion, sat with the Turin  
delegation but did not speak to the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke enough in the past,'' he said later.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Turin, Valentino Castellani, said of Tomba: ``He's  
so great he has no reason to speak. Just viewing him is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC delegates got to view another ski great, Austria's Franz  
Klammer, who spoke on behalf of Klagenfurt's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The presentation included footage of Klammer's spectacular run,  
which earned him the downhill gold medal at the 1976 Innsbruck 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those 1 minutes and 45 seconds changed my life forever,''  
Klammer said. ``For me, this bid is the best thing since my gold 
medal.''

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes' Players To Become In-Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- First they were teammates, then roommates  
at Ohio State. Now Gary Berry and Na'il Diggs are about to become 
in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's father, Gary Sr., and Diggs' sister, Roslyn Simpson,  
will be married in Phoenix on June 26, ending a courtship that 
began in New Orleans during preparations for the 1999 Sugar Bowl, 
in which the Buckeyes beat Texas A&AMP;M 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the end of their first year as roommates and the  
Sugar Bowl week was the first time our families had gotten 
together,'' Simpson said by telephone Friday from her home in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary's dad and I realized that we had a lot in common and the  
relationship grew pretty quickly, first through e-mail and regular 
mail, then visits back and forth between Columbus (the Berry 
family's home) and the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we told the boys, they were pretty shocked,'' she said.  
``I think we had to tell Na'il two or three times before he 
realized what was happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the players have gotten used to the idea, they've been  
joking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Gary will be my nephew, does this mean I can make him  
come over and wash my car?'' Diggs asked. Berry responded, ``Na'il 
is going to be my uncle now, so I can go get money from him all the 
time, right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson will be moving to Columbus from Los Angeles, where she  
is development director for regional programs at the University of 
Southern California. She said she has been in touch with Ohio State 
officials about the possibility of working there once she settles 
into her new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born in Los Angeles and raised in Phoenix, so I'm not  
used to anything below 70 degrees,'' she said. ``I'm sure that's 
going to be my biggest adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage will be the second for the elder Berry, 45, who  
will have his son serve as best man, and the first for Simpson, 35. 
Diggs will be a groomsman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very humorous and down to earth and that's what attracted  
me to him,'' Simpson said of her future husband. ``That's something 
hard to find here in California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, a senior, will start at free safety for the Buckeyes this  
season and holds the team record for yardage on interception 
returns with 166 yards in 1997. Diggs, a junior linebacker, was 
selected to the all-Big Ten team last season.

<HEADLINE> Texas Gun Law a Campaign Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Almost as soon as it was signed into law, a  
state measure blocking Texas cities from suing gun and ammunition 
makers and dealers has become an issue between presidential 
hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere around the nation, nearly two dozen cities and  
counties -- including Miami, Chicago, New Orleans and Detroit -- have 
sued gun makers in efforts to recover damages for crimes involving 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun manufacturers say they should not be held responsible for  
accidents or criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading GOP candidate for president, Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, signed a bill Friday prohibiting the state's municipalities 
from suing for damages related to lawful manufacturing or sales to 
the public. Exemptions would have to be approved by the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor ``does not believe the manufacturer of a legal  
product should be held responsible for the criminal misuse of that 
product,'' said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law was quickly denounced during a campaign speech by  
the leading Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are too high for any presidential candidate to  
stand on the sidelines'' of the gun control debate, Gore said in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would fight ``to get guns off the streets, out of the  
schools, and away from criminals and away from the hands of 
children.''
