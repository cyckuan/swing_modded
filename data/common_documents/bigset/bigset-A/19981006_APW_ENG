Prosecutors arrest four more in defense procurement scandal:

reports

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a widening scandal involving corruption in
Japanese military purchases, Tokyo prosecutors raided a subsidiary
of electronics giant NEC Corp. on Tuesday and arrested four men
from both companies, news reports said.
	   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office arrested four
employees from Nico Electronics Co. and NEC, including Nico's
former President Hiroji Takahashi, 63, on suspicion of the breach
of trust, the reports said.
	   Nico is the second NEC subsidiary involved in the scandal that
has led to the arrests of two former senior Defense Agency
officials as well as nine executives and senior officials at
Tokyo-based NEC and another affiliate, Toyo Communication Equipment
Co.
	   Takahashi and other three, including Hideo Arai, a former
defense project promotion chief at NEC, are suspected of
overcharging the military in procurement contracts.
	   The two arrested Defense Agency officials are suspected of
winking at the inflated billings in exchange for the companies'
providing jobs to retiring agency employees.
	   An official from the Tokyo prosecutors' office said his office
could not comment on the ongoing investigation. Spokeswomen from
NEC and Nico Electronics refused to comments on the reported raid
and questioning.
	   Television footage showed prosecutors in blue suits entering the
Yokohama headquarters of Nico, an electronics equipment maker
wholly owned by NEC.
	   Also Tuesday, prosecutors raided the central Tokyo headquarters
of the Defense Agency to gather more evidence for the
investigation.
	   It was the third such raid conducted at the Defense Agency since
early last month, when NEC's Arai and others were arrested.
	   Nico Electronics, capitalized at 50 million yen (dlrs 373,000)
and set up in 1953, sells about 3 billion yen (dlrs 22.4 million)
worth of military and other commercial products annually, according
to news reports.

Blair opens China visit, human rights on the agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Putting his promised ethical foreign policy to
the test, British Prime Minister Tony Blair received a welcome in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square and met with China's premier Tuesday.
	   Trying to brighten the atmosphere for Blair's visit, the first
by a British prime minister in seven years, China signed the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the United
Nations on Monday, more than six months after promising to do so.
	   In line with the foreign policy his Labor Party has vowed to put
in place, Blair has promised to raise human rights and
Chinese-ruled Tibet with China's leaders. But he has said he will
do so quietly _ an approach now favored by most European Union
governments and the United States.
	   The British prime minister is also expected to discuss the
global financial crisis, efforts to fight international terrorism
and Hong Kong's smooth progress 15 months after China resumed
control over Britain's last major colony.
	   With a group of business leaders in tow, Blair arrived in
Beijing on Tuesday morning. Greeted by Premier Zhu Rongji, the pair
reviewed an honor guard on Tiananmen Square before retreating for
discussions inside the Great Hall of the People.
	   Building on a rapport developed in a London meeting in April,
the two chatted privately for 45 minutes before beginning their
formal discussions.
	   Zhu announced that President Jiang Zemin has agreed to visit
Britain next summer, the first Chinese head of state to do so in
the 49-year history of the People's Republic.
	   Blair's visit caps efforts to repair the damage to relations
over Hong Kong, especially moves to grant the colony more democracy
in the twilight of British rule. Blair and President Jiang agreed
to make ``a new beginning'' hours before the handover on July 1,
1997.
	   Blair will check on Hong Kong, the last stop on his five-day
visit. He will also spend a day in Shanghai boosting British
business by opening a factory and an insurance office and stopping
off at a trade exhibition.
	   While in Beijing, Blair will also meet with President Jiang on
Wednesday, look at British efforts to aid urban renewal and give a
speech to British business executives.
	   Later Tuesday, he was due to tour the Forbidden City and be
guest of honor at a state banquet hosted by Premier Zhu.

New Zealand broadcast watchdog: OK to call Japan ``the enemy''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's broadcasting
watchdog agency said Tuesday a conservative talk radio host may
call Japanese `the enemy'' but that he pushed the limits by calling
them `the meanest spirited people in the world.''
	   The Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected a complaint from a
listener to John Banks' Radio Pacific show, who objected to the
radio host and National Party member of Parliament's remarks on
July 31 about Japan.
	   In a discussion about New Zealand's stance on visits by
nuclear-powered warships, Banks said it did not make sense to turn
away American warships but to allow Japanese warships to visit.
	   He recalled World War II when the United States had been New
Zealand's ally and Japan the enemy. He referred to Japan several
times as ``the enemy'' during the three-hour show.
	   Listener Taeko Knight complained his remarks were `ignorant and
irresponsible'' and that his intention was to show his dislike for
the Japanese and to provoke negative feelings towards them in New
Zealand.
	   Radio Pacific said Banks was expressing his own opinion and that
talk radio was a ``robust medium'' and listeners could respond
immediately if they did not agree.
	   The authority said that while Banks' comments revealed his
prejudices, they appeared to have little support from listeners who
failed to respond to his calls for comment.
	   His references to Japan as the ``enemy'' did not encourage
denigration or discrimination of the Japanese, the authority said.
	   And even though his description of them as ``the meanest
spirited people in the world'' was borderline, it was still only a
personal opinion so did not breach standards, it said.

`Pornographic' Chinese opera dropped from arts festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A classic Chinese opera branded as pornographic
in China has been dropped from a Hong Kong art festival after
Chinese officials suddenly said the troupe was unavailable to take
part.
	   The change came months after Shanghai city officials seized
sets, props and costumes and barred the troupe presenting the opera
from leaving the country for its premiere in New York City's
Lincoln Center.
	   Lau Chun-keung, associate program director of the annual Hong
Kong Arts Festival, to be held early next year, told the South
China Morning Post he didn't know why scheduled performances of
``The Peony Pavilion'' were canceled.
	   Organizers were ``just told by the Shanghai Cultural Exchange
Agency that the Shanghai Kunju company would not take part,'' the
Post quoted Lau as saying.
	   Chinese officials said the 16th-century piece, which was long
censored in China, was ``feudal, superstitious and pornographic.''
	   The sexual content of this revival of the 1598 work by Tang
Xianxu centers on the erotic tale of a young woman who meets her
lover in a dream.
	   The young woman dies longing for ideal love, and her ghost finds
the man of her dreams. She is brought back to life and they marry.
Reports say there is one scene of lovemaking, behind a screen, and
no nudity on stage.

Industry in Australia's Victoria state to get more gas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mitsubishi planning to reopen next week in
9th-10th grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Victoria's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion 10
days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation. Two
workers were killed and eight injured.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down from work.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon, while domestic
users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors Australia expects to fully reopen
its two Adelaide plants next week as planned after the gas shortage
forced the company to shut down production.
	   Mitsubishi public relations manager Kevin Taylor said about
2,000 employees would return to work this week, with the remaining
3,000 workers to return next Tuesday.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Lubos Kubik scored on a penalty kick to give the
Chicago Fire a 1-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Monday night
and take their Western Conference best-of-3 semifinal series 2-0.
	   Kubik tallied his penalty kick in the 42nd minute after Fire
midfielder Peter Nowak dribbled through a pack of Rapids and drew a
foul from Steve Trittschuh inside the box.
	   Fire goalie Zach Thornton held off the Rapids in the final 30
minutes to post the shutout, making three saves and disrupting 12
Rapids crosses.
	   Thornton parried a shot by Colorado's Paul Bravo off the
crossbar in the 78th minute. Rapids midfielder Chris Henderson
missed on several opportunities inside the box.
	   Fire forward Ante Razov hit the crossbar in the 35th minute and
had a chance to give the Fire a 2-0 lead on a breakaway in the 69th
minute, but Rapids goalie Marcus Hanemann blocked it with a kick
save.
	   Chicago advances to the Western Conference finals against the
Los Angeles Galaxy beginning Saturday at the Rose Bowl.

Sales of imported autos in Japan down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by Japan's recession, sales of imported cars,
trucks and buses in Japan plunged 15.3 percent in September
compared with a year ago to 27,134 units, importers said Tuesday.
	   It was the 18th straight month of declines and followed a 23.0
percent fall in August, a 19.8 percent drop in July and a 25.5
percent decrease in June, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said.
	   U.S. imports were hard-hit, dropping nearly 30 percent, with
General Motors the only one of the Big Three automakers posting an
increase. Sales of autos from Germany and Britain also fell.
	   A spokesman for the association said sales of imported autos
were squeezed as consumers continued to tighten their purse strings
because of the bleak economic outlook.
	   Passenger car import sales declined 13.2 percent to 26,413 and
trucks sales tumbled 54.8 percent to 716. Bus sales, however, rose
66.7 percent to 5.
	   Some automakers managed to post higher sales because of the
introduction of new models, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. But because personal consumption remains very sluggish
it is unlikely that sales will improve within the year, he said.
	   Overall imports were also hurt by a fall in reverse imports by
Japanese makers. Such imports tumbled 52.6 percent to 1,785 with
Honda's U.S. passenger car imports tumbling 98.9 percent to 26 and
Toyota's U.S. imports falling 18.7 percent to 300.
	   Sales of imports from the United States fell 28.4 percent to
4,653. Ford sales sank 50.4 percent to 355, and Chrysler sales
tumbled 46.3 percent to 525, but GM sales advanced 17 percent to
1,918. GM's sales were boosted by sales of Chevrolet, which rose
34.4 percent, and Buick, which grew 9.1 percent.
	   Sales of passenger car imports from Germany fell 9.3 percent to
16,054. Volkswagen sales rose 3.8 percent to 4,098, and BMW sales
advanced 21.6 percent to 3,318, but Mercedes-Benz sales fell 18.1
percent to 4,232.
	   British sales fell 9.5 percent to 1,815 as sales of the Rover
fell 3.2 percent to 1,560.

Dissidents urge China to follow through on rights pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents and human rights campaigners on
Tuesday welcomed China's signing of a treaty intended to safeguard
human rights and urged Beijing to quickly implement the accord.
	   ``Since China is currently in violation of almost every article
of the covenant, we hope its decision to sign indicates a change in
human rights practices,'' said Sidney Jones, executive director of
the Asian division of Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group.
	   ``The test will be in the implementation.''
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed
Monday by China at the United Nations, backs the right of
self-determination, prohibits torture and provides for freedom of
movement, religion, expression and association.
	   By signing, Beijing demonstrated a commitment to refrain from
actions that violate rights enshrined in the accord, the New
York-based group Human Rights in China said in a statement.
	   ``We hope that this will be followed quickly by concrete steps
to ratify and implement the covenant,'' the group said.
	   It urged the Chinese government to demonstrate its intention to
comply with the pact by releasing political prisoners and opening a
``public dialogue'' with all Chinese citizens on the issue of human
rights.
	   The covenant is one of two accords seen as fundamental to
protecting human rights. China signed the other one _ the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ a
year ago but hasn't ratified it.
	   Neither treaty will take effect until ratified by the
legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying
some provisions.
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the Chinese government
was deliberating on ratifying the accords.
	   ``All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights,'' Qin said.
	   Hours before the treaty was signed, Beijing police hauled a
prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin
Yongmin had tried for the second time in a week to legally register
a human rights monitoring group.
	   ``The Chinese authorities continue to impose systematic
restrictions on the exercise of the rights and freedoms contained
in the covenant, despite rhetoric about their commitment to human
rights,'' the statement from Human Rights in China said.
	   Dissidents accused China of promising to sign the human rights
covenant to maximize its diplomatic advantage and silence critics
of its civil rights record.
	   ``Signing could still be the right move for the wrong reasons
but only if we see tangible human rights improvements,'' said Jones
of Human Rights Watch.

Goddess gets her head back after 3,000 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ This is the story of a beautiful
Egyptian goddess who lost her head and got it back 3,000 years
later.
	   The big moment took place in Sydney on Tuesday, when the torso
of a goddess statue dating back to the reign of Tutankhamen --
1,330 B.C. -- was reunited with a cast of her head.
	   The torso has been at Sydney University's Nicholson Museum since
1860 and very little was known about it until two years ago, when a
scholar, using measurements and photographs, made a match with the
head at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
	   Cairo Museum director-general Mohamed Saleh brought a cast of
the head to the Nicholson Museum and will take back a cast of the
torso, so both museums can display their pieces in a complete form.
	   Saleh said although archaeology was the business of unearthing
the past, the swap demonstrated that many great discoveries were
made in museums.
	   ``This statue is particularly lovely,'' he said.
	   ``It was made during a period when Egyptian sculpture reached a
high point in quality and artistic achievement.''
	   The head was originally discovered in the Temple of Karnak in
modern Luxor late last century and has been on display in the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo ever since.
	   The torso arrived in Australia in 1860 and was donated to the
university by Sir Charles Nicholson, the university's first provost
chancellor.
	   Nicholson Museum curator Karin Sowada said hopefully one day the
base of the statue would be discovered.
	   Saleh joked that it was quite possible it was in the basement of
the Cairo Museum, where other missing pieces of antiquities had
been found in the past.

Fighter jet refit in New Zealand draws protest from Timor activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A New Zealand contract to
refurbish two old Indonesian Air Force Skyhawk training aircraft
has angered the East Timor Independence Committee which opposes
military links with Indonesia.
	   The two-seater aircraft are being refitted by Blenheim-based Air
New Zealand subsidiary Safe Air at a cost of several million
dollars each, Safe Air general manager Des Ashton said Tuesday.
	   East Timor Independence Committee spokeswoman Maire Leadbeater
has protested to the New Zealand government, saying: ``New Zealand
now compounds the evil of its ongoing military training role with
the Indonesian armed forces by becoming an arms exporter.''
	   Ashton said the two planes were unarmed training aircraft and
were not fitted with armaments. Their export had been approved by
the United States government and the work had been approved by the
New Zealand government.
	   He said it was the first aircraft refit for the Indonesian
military, though it had done a lot of work previously for
Indonesian civilian airlines.

to recovery as early as 1999, a top economic planner said Tuesday.
	   ``The foreign exchange reserves have gone up, there are signs
that confidence has returned,'' said Daim Zainuddin, the special
minister in charge of recovery programs.
	   ``Banks have started to lend, the private sector is now
borrowing, and economic activity is picking up,'' he said in a
speech in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Southeast Asian nation's gross domestic product shrank by
2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998 and by 6.8 percent in the
second.
	   Two months ago, Malaysia jettisoned the orthodox economic wisdom
of imposing austerity measures to fight recession.
	   Instead, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Daim promoted
greater bank lending and revived many expensive government projects
which, some economists believed, were the cause of Malaysia's
economic ailments.
	   Last month, the government imposed capital controls, which
effectively pegged the Malaysian ringgit at 3.80 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   The government said the move was designed as a cushion to allow
a loosening of monetary policy to promote growth.
	   As a result, Daim said, the third quarter's GDP figures won't be
as a bad as the second quarter's.
	   Daim said capital controls will be removed once the economy
recovers and there is no need to insulate it from currency
speculators. Mahathir has blamed currency traders for ruining
Malaysia's economy by repeated attacks to weaken the ringgit.
	   ``We are committed to ending capital controls, but only if the
world's financial community instills greater discipline into the
international currency market,'' Daim said.

U.N. chief: Kosovo fighting continues despite demands for
</HEADLINE>
cease-fire &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite a U.N. resolution demanding a
cease-fire in Kosovo and the withdrawal of Yugoslav police units
from the province, Serb forces intensified attacks on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians in the last few weeks, the U.N. chief says.
	   In his widely anticipated report to the Security Council,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept.
23 resolution but said he couldn't give an independent assessment
of whether Serb forces had complied with the council's demands.
	   That responsibility, he said, falls to the council's 15 members,
who will take up the report Tuesday.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States said
there was sufficient evidence in the report that the Serb special
police units were still active and an estimated 275,000 Albanian
refugees hadn't been allowed to return to their homes.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
end to the fighting that has left hundreds of people _ mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted tens of thousands
since a Serb crackdown began in February. Most ethnic Albanians
want independence for the province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic stripped Kosovo's autonomy
in 1989.
	   In its resolution, the council demanded Milosevic withdraw his
special forces from the province and allow for the safe return of
refugees and for humanitarian access to them. It demanded both
sides work toward finding a political solution and threatened
unspecified action if both sides failed to comply with the entire
resolution.
	   In Monday's report, Annan reported that in the week following
the resolution, government security forces ``intensified their
operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica region,''
and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, Annan said.
	   As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly displaced, he
said.
	   While fighting began to wind down in the last days of September,
with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number of
police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received
information ``that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that the operations of the special police
continue,'' Annan wrote.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Moscow agreed with most of
Annan's observations but said Moscow wanted updated information
about an apparent easing of the military offensive over the
weekend. ``We understand things have been moving and in the right
direction,'' he said.
	   In his report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in
Kosovo'' and said it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt'' that
Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has been fighting the Serbs, he
said, adding that there was reason to believe that they were
responsible for atrocities as well.
	   The U.N. chief said he couldn't give the council a clear-cut,
independent assessment of compliance with the Sept. 23 resolution
because the United Nations doesn't have the people on the ground in
Kosovo to determine that.
	   He noted his report was based on information provided by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European
Union, NATO and individual states _ though U.N. staff did provide
independent information on the humanitarian situation.
	   ``Therefore, the council may wish to make its own judgment in
this respect on the basis of the present report,'' he said,
referring to Serb compliance.
	   Annan said he was outraged by recent reports of mass killings of
civilians in Kosovo _ reports that galvanized international threats
to intervene with military force.

New rule opens Taiwan's borders to more mainland Chinese
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a goodwill gesture to China, Taiwan
announced Tuesday a new quota system that will allow more Chinese
citizens to move to the island to live with Taiwanese they marry.
	   The new rule will allow 2,400 of the Chinese spouses to
immigrate to Taiwan each year, an increase from the current quota
of 1,800.
	   But with nearly 20,000 in line to receive residency permits,
officials said those who begin to apply now will have to wait at
least eight years before they can obtain the rights.
	   The Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament, is expected to
approve the new quota this year, officials said.
	   The new rule was approved by the government Mainland Affairs
Council last week as Taiwan was seeking to resume semi-official
talks which Beijing broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese
campaign to gain international recognition.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, will visit the
mainland next week for discussions with his Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan, about resuming the talks.
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949 following a civil
war, but China still considers Taiwan a renegade province.
	   Marriages between people on the two sides have become common
since Taiwanese began visiting and investing in China in the late
1980s.
	   The trend of closer person-to-person contacts continued despite
frosty relations between the two governments in the past three
years. Taiwanese with Chinese spouses have lobbied hard for a
relaxation of the immigration rules.
	   ``We are doing our utmost to accommodate the Chinese as Taiwan
is already densely populated,'' a Mainland Affairs Council official
said, on condition of anonymity. ``Many of them have given birth to
children and keeping the families apart may be inhuman.''
	   As an expediency, the Council proposed early this year granting
the Chinese spouses virtually uninterrupted residency rights after
children are born. Under the current system, they could visit
Taiwan only once a year, for no more than six months.
	   The proposal has yet to be approved by the Legislature.

Gas reconnected to more industry; Holden automakers go back to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with 500 to 700 big businesses getting gas; toddler
seriously scalded, the 20th burn victim of crisis. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the gas
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down.
	   Gas is flowing to 500 of Victoria's biggest industries, with a
further 200 to be connected later Tuesday, and 35,000 small
businesses and industries are waiting to find out when they get
supplies, gas distributor VENCorp said.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon.
	   Domestic users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday,
Kennett said.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   A toddler in Melbourne was extensively scalded Tuesday on the
face, neck, chest and right arm by tipping a bucket of hot water
onto himself in a bath, Metropolitan Ambulance spokesman John
Fasham said.
	   The accident was one of more than 20 such scalding injuries,
mainly to children, that the service has attended during
Melbourne's gas crisis, he said.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi expects to fully reopen its two Adelaide
plants next week as planned after the gas shortage forced the
company to shut down production here.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Australia public relations manager Kevin
Taylor said about 2,000 employees would return to work this week,
with the remaining 3,000 workers to return next Tuesday.
	   The state's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion
10 days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation.
Two workers were killed and eight injured.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen meets with king
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen met with
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday in an apparent effort to seek the
monarch's help in breaking deadlocked negotiations to form the
country's next government.
	   Hun Sen and ruling party president Chea Sim met for one hour
with Sihanouk at the Royal Palace after talks with the two-party
opposition on Monday yielded no progress.
	   An aide to Hun Sen said the stalled talks would almost certainly
be discussed with Sihanouk, and that the ruling Cambodian People's
Party hoped the 75-year-old monarch shared its desire to push the
negotiations forward.
	   ``It is the intention of the CPP, and I think the king as well,
to speed up the formation of the new government,'' Hun Sen's
spokesman Prak Sokhonn said.
	   Sihanouk, whose mediating efforts helped bring the three parties
to the bargaining table last month, delayed a planned trip to
Beijing for medical treatment at the request of Hun Sen and arrived
in Phnom Penh on Monday.
	   The junior opposition party led by former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy complained in a Monday statement that the king's role in
forming the government ended Sept. 24 when he presided over the
ceremonial convening of parliament.
	   In a veiled accusation against Hun Sen and the CPP, the Sam
Rainsy Party said unnamed people were threatening the king to
intervene in the talks.
	   ``No one should coerce the king to involve himself in the
process of forming a government more deeply than he freely desires
or the constitution specifies,'' the opposition party stated.
	   Talks stalled Monday as the three parties maintained the same
positions they have held since Hun Sen's party won the July 26
national election.
	   The ruling party won a majority in parliament but not the
two-thirds necessary to form a government alone.
	   But the two-party opposition alleges that Hun Sen's electoral
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The opposition
insists that its charges must be thoroughly investigated before
parliament holds its first meeting.
	   A major stumbling block is the presidency of the new parliament,
a position coveted by both Hun Sen's party and the senior
opposition party FUNCINPEC.
	   The president of parliament controls legislative sessions and
becomes acting head of state when the king is outside the country.
	   Hun Sen's side made an apparent concession to the opposition in
talks last week when it agreed that all three parties should
request the National Election Committee to make a public accounting
of all the used and unused ballots from the election.
	   However, the opposition complained Monday that the NEC has not
responded to the request. NEC member Tip Jahnvibol said Monday that
no decision has been made on the ballot reconciliation, but that
the election commission planned to discuss the issue later in the
week.

Report: Robbers raid Chinese graves in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Grave robbers looking for jewelry have
raided about 100 tombs containing the remains of ethnic Chinese, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Last week's desecration of two graveyards in Bogor, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) south of Jakarta, follows a series of riots
this year in which Chinese people were targeted by mobs.
	   Chinese cemeteries in at least two other places on the main
island of Java have also been raided in recent months.
	   Looting and rioting has flared in Indonesia as it endures its
worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only four percent of Indonesia's 202
million population. But because of their success in business, they
have been made into scapegoats for an 82 percent inflation rate,
rising poverty and mass unemployment.
	   Police said they are investigating the grave robbing even though
they had not received any formal complaints from relatives.
	   Kompas said the robbers dug up and opened coffins in two
cemeteries. About 100 graves were dug up, but it was not
immediately clear how many caskets had been opened.
	   Police said the robbers reburied some but others were left out
in the open.
	   ``They hoped that they could find jewelry inside the coffins,''
Kompas quoted one man, who said his relative's grave had been
violated, as saying.
	   Another man, who identified himself as Djoko Irwanto, said
robbers had dug up the grave of his mother-in-law.
	   ``They wanted jewelry, but there is nothing inside,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police are protecting more than 200
people who fear they might become the targets of a mysterious
killing spree of Muslim clerics and others suspected of practicing
black magic, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Police have questioned dozens of suspects, but say they have yet
to establish a clear motive for about 100 bizarre slayings in East
Java.
	   The murders started two months ago in and around the town of
Banyuwangi, about 830 kilometers (518 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Witnesses have said the killers wear ninja-like black clothes
and attack at night with knives. Many victims were found mutilated.
	   Some theorize political and religious rivalries might be behind
the killings.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted East Java police chief
Maj. Gen. Moech Dayat as saying the carnage might be the work of
organized crime or was the result of personal feuds or disputes
over money.
	   ``Those having feuds have paid others to kill (their rivals),''
Dayat said. ``That is what we know so far.''
	   Earlier media reports claimed that some killers were paid up to
dlrs 100 per victim.
	   Antara said the police and military are currently sheltering 227
people who fear for their lives. However, The Jakarta Post
newspaper said 277 were under protection.
	   Lt. Col. Sutrisno, a Banyuwangi police spokesman, confirmed that
some people were being protected. But he refused to say how many.
	   Others had sought refuge in nearby villages.
	   Many of the dead had belonged to the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, which recently set
up its own political party.
	   Other victims were allegedly sorcerers who dabbled in black
magic that predates the arrival of Islam to Indonesia hundreds of
years ago.
	   Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights said it is
investigating the killings.

Report: Corruption weakening party and state, eroding confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Corruption has weakened the Communist
Party and state apparatus while eroding public confidence and the
country's material and spiritual strength, a party publication
complained Tuesday.
	   The Communist Review said corruption, with increasing amounts of
money and more sophisticated methods, has spread to different
fields of the economy, particularly land and housing management,
construction, foreign investment and import-export enterprises.
	   Before 1990, corruption was more about simply making money on
the side, but using money to buy positions is becoming more common
today, it said.
	   Law enforcement officials have been bribed to tamper with
evidence to avoid prosecution and, in some cases, have been paid to
present a case so the culprit will look like the victim and vice
versa, the Review said.
	   The party and government have introduced measures to fight
corruption, it said, but the results have been limited. And while
there have been some stiff penalties, there's a tendency for junior
officials to be hit harder than their senior compatriots.
	   ``In some cases, the corrupt officials have been promoted
because they have authority, money and connections,'' it said.
	   The Review cited loopholes in the legal system as fertile soil
for corruption.
	   In February, the National Assembly Standing Committee issued an
anti-corruption decree, effective Sept. 1, that requires party and
government officials to disclose assets worth more than 50 million
dong (dlrs 3,600).

Industry in Australia's Victoria state to get more gas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 500 to 700 big businesses receiving gas in 4th

8th-9th grafs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Victoria's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion 10
days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation. Two
workers were killed and eight injured.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down from work.
	   Gas is flowing to 500 of Victoria's biggest industries, with a
further 200 to be connected later Tuesday, and 35,000 small
businesses and industries are waiting to find out when they get
supplies, gas distributor VENCorp said.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon, while domestic
users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   A toddler in Melbourne was scalded Tuesday on the face, neck,
chest and right arm by tipping a bucket of hot water onto himself
in a bath, Metropolitan Ambulance spokesman John Fasham said.
	   The accident was one of more than 20 such scalding injuries,
mainly to children, that the service has attended to during
Melbourne's gas crisis, he said.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors Australia expects to fully reopen
its two Adelaide plants next week as planned after the gas shortage
forced the company to shut down production.
	   Mitsubishi public relations manager Kevin Taylor said about
2,000 employees would return to work this week, with the remaining
3,000 workers to return next Tuesday.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Goddess gets her head back after 3,000 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ This is the story of a beautiful
Egyptian goddess who lost her head and got it back 3,000 years
later.
	   The big moment took place in Sydney on Tuesday, when the torso
of a goddess statue dating back to the reign of Tutankhamen _ 1,330
B.C. _ was reunited with a cast of her head.
	   The torso has been at Sydney University's Nicholson Museum since
1860 and very little was known about it until two years ago, when a
scholar, using measurements and photographs, made a match with the
head at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
	   Cairo Museum director-general Mohamed Saleh brought a cast of
the head to the Nicholson Museum and will take back a cast of the
torso, so both museums can display their pieces in a complete form.
	   Saleh said although archaeology was the business of unearthing
the past, the swap demonstrated that many great discoveries were
made in museums.
	   ``This statue is particularly lovely,'' he said.
	   ``It was made during a period when Egyptian sculpture reached a
high point in quality and artistic achievement.''
	   The head was originally discovered in the Temple of Karnak in
modern Luxor late last century and has been on display in the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo ever since.
	   The torso arrived in Australia in 1860 and was donated to the
university by Sir Charles Nicholson, the university's first provost
chancellor.
	   Nicholson Museum curator Karin Sowada said hopefully one day the
base of the statue would be discovered.
	   Saleh joked that it was quite possible it was in the basement of
the Cairo Museum, where other missing pieces of antiquities had
been found in the past.

Report: Chinese president to visit Australia in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ China's President Jiang Zemin will make
a landmark visit to Australia in 1999, in a further sign of thawing
in the relations between the two countries, Australian Associated
Press reported Tuesday.
	   The decision to accept a long-standing invitation will make
President Jiang the most senior member of the Chinese Communist
leadership to ever journey to Australia.
	   Confirmation of next year's visit by China's most senior leader
came Tuesday as the country congratulated Prime Minister John
Howard on his victory in Saturday's election, the Australian
domestic news agency reported from Beijing.
	   It followed speculation that a visit could be organized as early
as next month to follow the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) leaders' forum in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``He (Jiang) is not going this year. He has accepted an
invitation to visit next year. We don't have any dates yet, they
are still to be confirmed,'' AAP quoted an Australian embassy
spokesman as saying.
	   A November visit had been discussed but Chinese officials felt
that the president would be busy with major domestic commitments in
the aftermath of this year's floods, the spokesman said.
	   Howard extended an open invitation to Jiang to visit Australia
during an official visit to China in early 1997.
	   The prime ministerial tour helped ease bilateral tensions after
China was angered by early diplomatic stumbles by the Howard
government shortly after its election in 1996.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji -- now the second highest ranked Chinese
leader -- visited Australia in May 1997 but at the time was ranked
fifth in the powerful seven-member Communist party politburo
standing committee.
	   Zhu's visit was marked by small demonstrations railing against
China's human rights record.
	   During Jiang's visit to the United States last year, thousands
of demonstrators dogged his trail to protest against human rights
abuses and urging greater political freedom in China.
	   Australia has received a series of official visits since early
1997 as relations rebounded from the downturn in 1996 on the back
of the Howard government's softer approach to the human rights
issue.

14 Singapore couples marry on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Ancient traditions and state-of-the-art
technology mixed as 14 Singaporean couples exchanged vows on the
Internet on the last day of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, an
auspicious day for weddings.
	   Monday's cyber-nuptials were held to promote the use of the
Internet. Singaporeans are already being urged to use it for
everything from matchmaking and filing lawsuits to ordering taxis
and submitting tax forms.
	   For Patrick Ho, 30-year-old manager, the event was an
opportunity to show the world how much he loved his bride, The
Straits Times reported Tuesday.
	   ``I want to share this special day with friends, family and even
strangers,'' Ho was quoted as saying.
	   For his bride, Ho Sau Moi, 27, a cyber wedding was an exciting
way of sharing the ceremony with her relatives who have logged onto
to the Internet in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Each marriage was recorded on video and transmitted live through
the one-stop website. Friends, relatives and strangers could sign
electronic guest books and send congratulatory digital cards to the
newlyweds.
	   The event was a joint project between the Registry of Marriages
and the National Computer Board.
	   The Straits Times said it believed the cyber marriages were the
world's first.

U.S. business leader urges Japan to quickly fix financial system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged
Japan's leaders on Tuesday to move quickly to clean up the
country's debt-ridden banking system, cautioning that failure to do
so could cause ``significant'' harm to American businesses.
	   ``Japan must find the will to put its financial house in order
and to do so without delay,'' Thomas Donohue told a press
conference.
	   He also said the enormous bad-loan problem at Japan's banks
threatened to curtail recovery in Asia, where a year-old economic
crisis has plunged millions into poverty and ignited growing
political unrest.
	   And Asia's crisis has already hurt U.S. companies and put
Americans out of work, he said.
	   ``U.S. exports to Asia have dropped nearly 14 percent in the
first half of this year. That's serious money and many jobs,'' he
said.
	   Also, he said that that many of America's biggest companies have
cut profit forecasts because of falling demand for their products
in Asia.
	   Donohue said he came to Japan to urge its leaders to move

Leading newspaper urges arrest of foreign reporters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A leading Malaysian newspaper
urged the government Tuesday to start detaining foreign journalists
who are reporting ``untruthful'' news about the nation.
	   As the dissent against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad grows,
the government has repeatedly accused the foreign press of bias,
giving favorable coverage for Mahathir's rival, the former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar and many of his associates were arrested late last month
under the Internal Security Act. Anwar faces trial on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   ``We would urge the Malaysian government to adopt
Singapore-style hardball tactics with the press,'' said an
editorial-page commentary in the pro-government New Straits Times.
	   The commentary said the tactics would include suing reporters
and detaining them under the Internal Security Act, a Malaysian law
that allows indefinite detention without trial.
	   The newspaper's editorial office refused to comment on the
article.
	   The government has complained that foreign journalists who have
descended on Malaysia during the past month to cover the
unprecedented challenge to Mahathir's 17-year-rule appear to be
rooting for his overthrow.
	   Officials have been particularly upset by an interview given by
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to CNBC, in which she said she feared
that her husband may be injected with the HIV virus while in
custody.
	   Mahathir has also scolded CNBC Asia, a regional TV network, for
broadcasting a home video Anwar made before his arrest. Malaysian
police traveled to Singapore to interview CNBC journalists about
the interview.
	   Malaysians were ``aggrieved by CNBC's and Asian Wall Street
Journal's sensationalist reports on Malaysia,'' Tuesday's article
said.
	   Calling for a ban on ``guilty'' foreign reporters, the author,
Abdullah Tan, said: ``It is better to have no news than to have
untruthful news.''
	   Officials were furious when TV crews tried to transmit footage
of the last big Anwar rally last month, instead of devoting more
coverage to a visit by Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Since the Sept. 20 rally, foreign broadcasters have been told
they will have to find private satellite link providers for footage
that shows Malaysia in a negative light. Anwar was arrested hours
after the rally.

Report: Chinese president to visit Australia in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ China's President Jiang Zemin will make
a landmark visit to Australia in 1999, in a further sign of thawing
in the relations between the two countries, Australian Associated
Press reported Tuesday.
	   The decision to accept a long-standing invitation will make
President Jiang the most senior member of the Chinese Communist
leadership to ever journey to Australia.
	   The report about the visit came as China congratulated Prime
Minister John Howard on his victory in Saturday's election, the
Australian domestic news agency reported from Beijing.

Japanese stocks close higher, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with afternoon close, bond and dollar rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rebounded slightly in trading
Tuesday on optimism the Japanese government will come up with new
stimulus steps to boost the slumping economy. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, to 13,021.64 by the end of the
afternoon session at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT).
	   On Monday, worries about the health of Japan's economy sent the
Nikkei down a sharp 275.57 points, or 2.08 percent. It closed at
12,948.12, the lowest closing level since Jan. 30, 1986, when it
finished at 12,949.04.
	   The dollar bought 133.68 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday, down
2.08 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 134.25 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei started slightly lower but
quickly turned back into positive territory on futures-led
short-covering and bargain hunting following sharp falls in recent
sessions. There were also expectations of additional economic
stimulus measures.
	   But the upward pressure was weak.
	   ``The overall market sentiment lacked momentum to chase share
prices higher,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor
information group at Kankaku Securities. ``I'd say aggressive
selling has stopped, while there were hardly any new buy orders.''
	   The government drastically slashed its official economic growth
forecast for the current fiscal year on Tuesday, saying it expects
gross domestic product to shrink by 1.8 percent.
	   The new figure, released by the Economic Planning Agency,
represents a stark turnaround from the government's initial
forecast for 1.9 percent growth, and fueled expectations that Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi would come up with a supplementary budget
larger than originally planned.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section finished up a meager 0.26 points, or 0.03 percent, to
996.95. The TOPIX closed down 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, the
day before.
	   Tokyo's rise came on the heels of volatile trading overnight on
Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average rallied back
from an afternoon deficit of 232 points to close Monday's session
58.45 points lower at 7,726.24.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower following
overnight weakness in New York, where it fell after finance
ministers from the world's major economies failed to offer concrete
steps at their weekend meeting to relieve global financial turmoil.
	   Traders said expectations of lower U.S. interest rates and the
overnight drop on Wall Street also weighed on the dollar in
overnight trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.725 percent at midday from Monday's
finish of 0.730 percent, nudging its price up to 109.73 yen from
109.69 yen.

Australian air force in joint exercises in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Royal Australian Air Force will
take part in a bilateral training exercise in Malaysia's
mountainous terrain beginning this week.
	   A total of 10 RAAF FA-18 Hornets and five F-111s will fly to the
region for Exercise Churinga with the Royal Malaysian Air Force at
Kuantan.
	   The exercise, aimed at improving combat training through the
conduct of low-level strike training in mountainous terrain and a
tropical environment, would run from October 8-29, the air force
said in a statement.
	   The commanding officer of No 77 Squadron, Wing Cmdr. Mark
Binskin, said the exercise would also provide combat training
against Malaysia's Mig-29 fighters.
	   ``Churinga gives us an opportunity to discuss tactics and
procedures with an important regional partner,'' he said.
	   ``Ground crew will also benefit from the deployment as they will
be exposed to operations on a different base. Logistics support
requirements will also be exercised.''

Cambodian leader defends crackdown in letter to U.S. senators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen has
defended last month's crackdown on anti-government demonstrations,
claiming in a letter to two U.S. senators that foreign-backed
terrorist organizations were responsible for the protests.
	   Responding to a letter from senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
John Kerry (D-Mass.), Hun Sen wrote in his correspondence, seen
Tuesday, that he was forced to order an end to the opposition-led
protests after a grenade attack on his home in the capital.
	   Cambodia's strongman wasn't in Phnom Penh at the time of the
attack and no one was injured. The opposition claimed he staged the
it as an excuse to order the crackdown.
	   Hun Sen wrote he was surprised at the senators' description of
``peaceful demonstrators'' in their letter, arguing that protest
leaders often used racist language, called for the government to be
overthrown and urged the U.S. government to bomb his home.
	   ``I can assure you that the demonstrators had a number of agent
provocateurs who were anything but peaceful and that our security
personnel acted with great restraint, acting forceful only when
forced to do so by the mob,'' Hun Sen wrote.
	   ``It was clear that the demonstrations were well-coordinated by
terrorist groups and a handful of foreign nationals who provided
support and protection to their leaders,'' he claimed.
	   Police used batons, cattle prods and shooting to break up the
street rallies. At least four people were killed and dozens more
beaten and arrested.
	   United Nations human rights investigators discovered more than
20 corpses _ many with signs of torture _ in the aftermath,
prompting speculation that the death tally could actually be
higher.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the
crackdown and called on Cambodian authorities to publicly account
for all opposition activists who were arrested.
	   In their Sept. 30 letter to Hun Sen, the senators deplored the
police action and linked future foreign assistance to
investigations into the opposition's claims of electoral fraud and
reported human rights violations against its activists.
	   Writing in his response that the two senators were the
recipients of misleading information, Hun Sen invited them to visit
Cambodia so they could judge the political situation for
themselves.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won this year's
election, claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament, but not the
two-thirds necessary to form a government alone.
	   Cambodia's two main opposition parties, winners of 58 seats,
have resisted forming a government until their allegations of
intimidation and fraud during the election are investigated.
	   Talks between the three parties have proceeded slowly since King
Norodom Sihanouk first brought them to the negotiating table last
month.
	   Sihanouk convinced the three parties to attend a ceremonial
convening of parliament on Sept. 24, but the legislature has not
met since then.

Indonesian company strikes deal with banks on debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian heavy machinery company PT
Trakindo Utama has sealed a debt-restructuring deal with 32 banks
worth dlrs 171 million, becoming one of the first major local
companies to do so, a banker involved in the discussions said
Tuesday.
	   After three months of intensive discussions with creditors,
Trakindo, the local distributor for Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), finally
secured the clearance from banks to roll over loans that fall due
later this year.
	   Privately held Trakindo will pay off dlrs 81 million up front to
the bankers in return for subsequent rollover of the remaining dlrs
90 million in the form of a three-year loan, the banker, who asked
not to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The banker said the loan is attractively priced at the Singapore
Interbank Offered Rate plus three percentage points.
	   Chase Manhattan Bank is acting as adviser on the
debt-restructuring talks and the coordinating bank for all lenders.
	   Chase is one of the three banks which chair the steering
committee of banks that reached agreement with Indonesian creditors
earlier this year to restructure debt.
	   The so-called Frankfurt agreement has had very limited success,
however. Successful debt-restructuring is an uncommon phenomenon in
the Indonesian corporate sector, which is saddled with some dlrs 80
billion in foreign debt.
	   Trakindo Utama was a classic case of how a fundamentally sound
company got into financial trouble owing to their short-term loans,
the banker said.
	   But it also set a good example of how a debt-ridden company can
successfully convince its creditors to continue their support, the
banker added.
	   ``It shows that if Indonesian corporates cooperate with their
banks, they can achieve some form of debt-restructuring
agreement,'' the banker said.

Australians to give evidence at bribes inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor
and batsman Mark Waugh would give evidence Tuesday to Pakistan's
inquiry into a bribery and match-fixing scandal, an official said.
	   Australian Cricket Board spokesman Patrick Keane told The
Associated Press in Sydney that Taylor, Waugh and ACB chief
executive Mal Speed would face the hearing in Lahore, Pakistan,
some time after 0830 GMT.
	   Lahore High Court registrar Abdus Salam asked Taylor and Waugh
to appear.
	   The Australian team finished the first test in Rawalpindi on
Monday and were flying to Lahore on Tuesday.
	   Waugh and two other players not on the current tour _ Shane
Warne and Tim May _ alleged that Pakistan test player Salim Malik
tried to bribe them to play badly on Australia's 1994 tour of
Pakistan. Taylor was captain during the tour.
	   Salam had sent a letter last week asking the pair to appear
before the commission headed by Justice Malik Qayyam to explain the
bribery allegations.
	   Waugh, Warne and May wrote affidavits about the alleged bribery
attempt soon after the matter became public in 1995 but they had
refused to fly to Pakistan for hearings.
	   Warne, who is absent from the current tour because of injury,
said Monday that he did not expect he would go to Pakistan for
hearings.
	   ``We sent signed affidavits the last time and we got called
liars, so I'm not to rush back to testify when I've already said
that and I was called a liar by a judge,'' Warne said.

Russia will use U.N. veto to stop force against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop airstrikes against Yugoslavia, the foreign minister
said Tuesday in an interview with the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation, it'll do just
the opposite,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis in Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanian-majority province in southern Yugoslavia. He discussed the
crisis over the telephone with French President Jacques Chirac,
Interfax said.
	   ``The Russian side and the president are doing everything
possible to find a political solution to the Kosovo problem,'' said
Sergei Prikhodko, deputy head of the president's administration,
according to Interfax.
	   Russia has for months strongly opposed the use of force against
the Serbs, their traditional allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren,
but has agreed with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's violent campaigns against ethnic Albanians in the
province had to be stopped.
	   ``There is no solution by force to the Kosovo problem. Its
source lies in an ethnic conflict, and bombs cannot solve ethnic
conflicts,'' Ivanov said in an interview Monday night with the ORT
television station.
	   Ivanov told Interfax on Tuesday that if the U.N. Security
Council considers applying force in Kosovo, Russia ``without a
doubt will use its right to veto.''
	   Ivanov said that Russia would do ``everything to reach a
political regulation of the situation.
	   ``No one's playing games here,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Yeltsin made a flurry of phone calls about Kosovo on Monday
night to U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Germany's Chancellor-elect Gerhard Shroeder.
	   Yeltsin told Schroeder that Yugoslavia had accepted a Russian
proposal to invite an international delegation to investigate the
crisis in its southern province, Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Russia had proposed that a delegation from the 54-country
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe go to Kosovo to
investigate ways to end the crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke leaving for Pristina, Russian foreign
minister saying Russia will use its Security Council veto Tuesday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
denouncing NATO threats of airstrikes as a ``criminal act'' despite
a personal warning from a senior American envoy to halt his
crackdown in Kosovo province or face military attack.
	   Milosevic told special envoy Richard Holbrooke late Monday that
his government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
seven-month crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are
battling for independence.
	   But he also said that ``threats of aggression ... are a criminal
act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, not the
Albanian people,'' according to a statement broadcast by
television.
	   Holbrooke met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday,
telling the Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are
facing.'' Holbrooke left for the Kosovo capital Pristina Tuesday
morning for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders _ several of whom
have called openly for NATO intervention.
	   ``The military planning is going forward on a serious, intense
and sustained basis as we talk,'' Holbrooke told reporters Monday
after the meeting. Asked if Milosevic got the message, Holbrooke
replied, ``You'll have to ask him that.''
	   Publicly, however, Milosevic and his government appeared
defiant. State television said the Yugoslav leader told Holbrooke
that ``a political solution is the only possible solution'' and
expressed hope ``that the international community will finally
contribute to reviving the political process instead of issuing
threats.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia would use its veto in the U.N. Security
Council to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   International efforts to solve the crisis accelerated after
reports that Serb police had massacred dozens of ethnic Albanian
civilians. Serb police deny the allegation.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said they were ready to
launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack. If
that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior NATO
official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash
a ``fully fledged air campaign'' involving hundreds of planes.
	   Before arriving in Belgrade, Holbrooke conferred in Brussels
with senior NATO officials. Holbrooke said conditions in Kosovo had
not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize
plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive
against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false
promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be
verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said at the White House.
	   ``What happens next depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart
quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who has opposed
the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally.
	   As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO
military action was imminent.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters after a
special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution Sept. 23 demanded a
cease-fire.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.

Blair opens China visit, human rights on the agenda

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Opening a new chapter in relations following the
smooth handover of Hong Kong 15 months ago, China and Britain
declared a comprehensive partnership Tuesday.
	   In a statement issued after talks between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, the two governments
pledged to increase cooperation across the board _ from
environmental protection to closer ties between their militaries.
	   ``Both sides consider that the time is right for the opening of
a new chapter in relations between China and the United Kingdom,''
said the statement.
	   Blair is the first British prime minister to visit China in
seven years. His five-day trip caps efforts to repair the damage to
relations over Hong Kong, especially from British moves to increase
democracy before returning the colony to China on July 1, 1997.
	   Opening the visit with a 1 3/4-hour meeting, Blair and Zhu
discussed human rights, the global financial crisis and the
conflict in Kosovo, among other topics, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   Zhu welcomed Blair by emphasizing the friendly rapport they
established during the Chinese premier's visit to London in April.
	   ``Although we have only met a few times, it seems we have known
each other for many years,'' Zhu said.
	   Zhu told Blair he should ``make himself at home'' and feel free
to raise any issues he liked without fear of offending his hosts.
	   Blair raised human rights and Chinese-ruled Tibet with Zhu.
Before leaving Britain, Blair had pledged to discuss those
concerns, but said he would do so quietly in keeping with the
softer approach most European Union governments and the United
States have adopted.
	   Tang, the Chinese spokesman, said human rights and Tibet were
only mentioned briefly. He added that he detected ``no serious or
major differences'' between the prime ministers.
	   Trying to brighten the atmosphere for Blair's visit, China
signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at
the United Nations on Monday, more than six months after promising
to do so.
	   In a sign of improving ties, Zhu announced that President Jiang
Zemin has agreed to visit Britain next summer, the first Chinese
head of state to do so in the 49-year history of the People's
Republic.
	   The joint statement to set up a comprehensive partnership
promised increased political consultations, including discussion of
human rights, and outlined cooperation in areas from employment
training to crime fighting.
	   China has made similar arrangements with many countries,
including France, Russia and the United States.
	   With a group of business leaders in tow, Blair arrived in
Beijing Tuesday morning. He and Premier Zhu reviewed an honor guard
on Tiananmen Square before retreating for discussions inside the
Great Hall of the People.
	   Blair praised Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule,
saying, ``We are very happy about the present situation in Hong
Kong.''
	   Blair will check on Hong Kong, the last stop on his five-day
visit. He will also spend a day in Shanghai boosting British
business by opening a factory and an insurance office and stopping
off at a trade exhibition.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Grave robbers looking for jewelry have
raided about 100 tombs containing the remains of ethnic Chinese, a
cemetery warden said Tuesday.
	   Last week's desecration of two graveyards in Bogor, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) south of Jakarta, followed a series of riots
this year in which mobs targeted Chinese people.
	   Chinese cemeteries in at least two other places on the main
island of Java have also been raided in recent months.
	   Looting and rioting have flared in Indonesia as it endures its
worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only 4 percent of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But because of their success in business, they have
been made scapegoats for an 82 percent inflation rate, rising
poverty and mass unemployment.
	   Police said they were investigating the grave robbing even
though they had not received any formal complaints from relatives.
	   Aep Syaefudin, warden of Bogor's Gunung Gadung cemetery, said
robbers had dug up dozens of tombs at night.
	   Syaefudin said the robbers refilled some graves, but most were
left open. He did not know how many caskets had been raided.
	   ``We usually close up opened graves the following morning,''
Syaefudin said.
	   ``They hoped that they could find jewelry inside the coffins,''
he said of the robbers. ``But usually there is none.''
	   Syaefudin said families were distressed to find the resting
places of loved ones have been violated.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted another man, who identified himself
as Djoko Irwanto, as saying robbers had dug up the grave of his
mother-in-law.
	   ``They wanted jewelry, but there is nothing inside,'' he said.

U.S. envoy warns Yugoslav president of NATO strikes

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
denouncing NATO threats of airstrikes as a ``criminal act'' despite
a personal warning from a senior American envoy to halt his
crackdown in Kosovo province or face military attack.
	   After meeting with Milosevic, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke flew
to Kosovo's capital Pristina on Tuesday to meet with international
observers and with ethnic Albanian leaders. But chances for a
diplomatic solution to avert airstrikes appeared limited.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also said that ``threats of aggression ... are a criminal
act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, not the
Albanian people,'' according to a statement broadcast by
television.
	   Holbrooke met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday,
telling the Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are
facing.''
	   ``The military planning is going forward on a serious, intense
and sustained basis as we talk,'' Holbrooke told reporters after
the meeting. Asked if Milosevic got the message, Holbrooke replied,
``You'll have to ask him that.''
	   Publicly, however, Milosevic and his government appeared
defiant. State television said the Yugoslav leader told Holbrooke
that ``a political solution is the only possible solution'' and
expressed hope ``that the international community will finally
contribute to reviving the political process instead of issuing
threats.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia would use its veto to stop any move to
approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N. Security Council,
which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Before arriving in Belgrade, Holbrooke conferred in Brussels
with senior NATO officials. Holbrooke said conditions in Kosovo had
not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize
plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive
against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern

promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris

Philippine Supreme Court acquits Imelda Marcos on graft charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court
acquitted the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos on a corruption
charge Tuesday, overturning a prison sentence, officials said.
	   Imelda Marcos' acquittal reversed a 12-year sentence imposed by
a lower court in a 1993 graft conviction. She had been free on bail
pending her appeal.
	   An aide said Mrs. Marcos, 69, received a call informing her of
her acquittal.
	   ``She just looked up after listening to the caller and handed
the phone to a member of her staff and said, `Thank you Lord,'''
the aide said.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos has been convicted
on corruption charges, although she faces numerous other criminal
and civil cases related to the 20-year strongman rule of her
husband.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   In January of this year, a Supreme Court panel acquitted Mrs.
Marcos on one charge but upheld her conviction on a second charge,
which carried a maximum prison term of 12 years. She was also fined
189 million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   The panel, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos to appeal the ruling one
final time to the entire Supreme Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans had
been accused of entering into five unfavorable contracts involving
a government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Prosecutors said they awarded leases on property owned by the
rail line to the hospital foundation at favorable rates. Dans had
been acquitted earlier.

Fergie's debut as British TV chat show host draws approval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with views from the critics &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York drew mostly praise Tuesday for
her caring-and-sharing television talk show, with surprised critics
admitting that she showed ``real skill.''
	   ``Sarah ... Surviving Life,'' a series of 10 one-hour shows
commissioned by Sky TV, was launched Monday with a rash of
newspaper interviews. In them, the former Sarah Ferguson, the
ex-wife of Prince Andrew, discussed her current boyfriend _ a
still-married Italian count _ her financial affairs and her refusal
to move out of a wing of Andrew's house where she lives with their
two daughters.
	   On the show, Fergie, as she is popularly known, sat on a couch
dressed in a black trouser suit and discussed life's crises with
her guests. Those included a woman who was raped by a serial killer
and a hit-and-run driver who had confessed 20 years later.
	   ``You might wonder why I qualify to present a show about
surviving life,'' the 38-year-old duchess told viewers. ``After
all, I have led a very charmed life _ there have been huge ups but
there have been some huge downs.''
	   The Guardian newspaper said Fergie performed ``unimpeachably''
and The Mirror newspaper said she carried the show off well despite
some nervousness.
	   Mirror columnist Sue Carroll said Fergie ``had clearly done her
homework and there was some real skill in the way she turned the
conversation around.''
	   ``I realize it's unfashionable to praise anything the duchess
does, but considering she's a beginner in TV terms, I think she did
pretty well,'' The Express critic Tim Hulse was quoted as saying.
	   The Times columnist Joe Joseph said that ``what struck you was
just how sober and professional a performance she delivered for
someone we have grown used to seeing behave like a buffoon.''
	   ``She has either turned over a new leaf, or was showing us a
different part of the old one,'' he wrote, adding that she
delivered ``more than we ever imagined her capable of.''
	   The Sun, which like The Times is owned by Sky TV proprietor
Rupert Murdoch, also judged the debut a success.
	   Not everyone was impressed.
	   Under the headline: ``The most embarrassing 60 minutes in chat
show history,'' The Daily Mail reviewer Jaci Stephen called the
discussion laughable.
	   ``Her responses and questions reveal that she does not have what
it takes for this kind of show, quite simply because the worlds she
is encountering among 'ordinary' people are so far removed from
those she inhabits, her attempts at empathy sound like crass
incomprehension, or even disbelief,'' Stephen wrote. ``The wrong
woman in the wrong job.''
	   The duchess said she is giving her dlrs 85,000 fee for the
series to charity but would keep the money for the foreign rights.
The company gave no estimate of that sum.

Another Anwar ally released from jail, five still detained

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police released an ally of
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim from jail Tuesday, reducing to five
the number of his associates still detained without trial, the
national news agency reported.
	   Asmaon Ismail, an assemblyman in the state of Johor, was one of
17 Anwar associates and leaders of opposition parties rounded up as
national security risks after Anwar led rallies nationwide calling
for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation and political
reforms.
	   Twelve of the those held under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite imprisonment without trial, have been freed.
	   ``I'd like to clarify that the reform movement organized by
Anwar's supporters looks like it has the ultimate aim of sparking
social instability that could lead to racial tensions and affect
public order,'' Asmaon told reporters Tuesday after his release.
	   Asmaon denied involvement in the reform movement. He told
reporters police had acted professionally and he had received good
treatment during his detention.
	   On their release, several of the detainees have publicly
denounced Anwar's reform movement. While in custody, detainees are
customarily denied access to lawyers and family.
	   Two close friends of Anwar, after their release, confessed in
court to having sex with him and were sentenced to six months in
prison. Anwar says their confessions were coerced. The men recently
filed letters to appeal their convictions.
	   Anwar, arrested under the security act on Sept. 2, appeared in
court Monday with a neck brace. Last week, he showed up in court
with bruises on his face, neck and arms _ injuries he said came
from police beatings.
	   He is to go on trial Nov. 2 on four counts of corruption. A
separate date is to be announced for his trial on another count of
corruption and five charges of illegal homosexual acts. He has
denied the charges.

Ariane rocket launches satellites for Europe, Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Ariane 4 launched telecommunications satellites
for a European and a Swedish firm overnight, the 111th mission by
the European rocket, officials said Tuesday.
	   The Ariane blasted off at 7:51 p.m. (2251 GMT) Monday from
Guiana Space Center near Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeastern
end of South America.
	   Twenty-five minutes after the launch, the rocket placed in orbit
a Eutelsat W2 for television and multimedia transmission over
Europe, Africa and the Middle East over the next 12 years.
	   The Eutelsat satellite was the 12th of 14 that Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the European Space Agency, has been contracted to
launch.
	   Sweden's Sirius 3, built by Hughes Space and Communications for
Nordiska Satellitaktie Bolaget (NSAB), will relay TV transmissions
over Scandinavia for 12 years.
	   On Oct. 20, Arianespace plans the third launch of its new Ariane
5, a rocket twice as powerful as the Ariane 4, aimed at maintaining
the company's lead in the world's commercial launch market.
	   The troubled Ariane 5 program, set back by a maiden launch that
blew up and a second try in which the rocket had a spin problem,
hopes to redeem itself with what is billed as the final test
flight.
	   The test launch, carrying a mockup of a W2 satellite, is to be
followed by the first commercial shot by spring of next year.
	   The Ariane 5 has a load capacity of 7 tons, twice that of the
Ariane 4.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister ordered his Cabinet Tuesday
to speed up planned stimulus measures and consider additional steps
after forecasters warned the economy will likely shrink for a
second straight year.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will seek passage in Parliament
before the end of this year of a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 52 billion)
tax cut and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion) in new public
spending, government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said.
	   Press reports said the package could win approval as early as
mid-October.
	   Obuchi also called on his ministers to come up with more tax
cuts and spending proposals to boost the size of the stimulus
package, which he originally proposed in August just after taking
office.
	   Tokyo is under intense international pressure to do more to
resuscitate its recession-bound economy and ease the Asian
financial crisis.
	   ``The world economy is facing a crisis that can't be ignored,''
Obuchi said Tuesday in Parliament, where lawmakers were debating
bills to clean up Japan's biggest economic headache, its teetering
banking system.
	   ``Reviving the economy is our biggest task,'' he said.
	   The moves came after the Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday
it now believes the world's second-largest economy will contract by
1.8 percent this year, revising a previous forecast of 1.9 percent
growth.
	   The contraction would mark the first time the economy has
declined two years in a row since 1955, when the government started
calculating the gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and
services produced within the country.
	   The rate of contraction would also be much steeper than last
year's 0.7 percent, suggesting Japan's economic slide may only be
gathering speed.
	   The EPA's report blamed faltering domestic demand for new goods
and services and sharp declines in housing starts and business
investment in new factories and equipment.
	   The revision also showed that the slowdown in spending threatens
to push the economy into a deflationary spiral, a 1930s-style
crisis where the bottom falls out on wages and prices. The agency
said it expects wholesale prices to fall 1.7 percent this year.
	   The agency said the one bright spot was exports.
	   It said overseas demand for Japanese products is expected to
rise 0.6 percent, driving up the country's current account surplus
_ the broadest measure of trade _ to 16.6 trillion yen (dlrs 122
billion) from its earlier forecast of 12.4 trillion yen (dlrs 92
billion).

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic has
denounced NATO threats of airstrikes as a ``criminal act'' after a
senior American envoy issued a personal warning to halt his
crackdown in Kosovo province or face military attack.
	   After meeting with Milosevic, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke flew
to Kosovo's capital Pristina on Tuesday to meet with international
observers and ethnic Albanian leaders. But chances for a diplomatic
solution to avert airstrikes appeared limited.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also said that ``threats of aggression ... are a criminal
act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, not the
Albanian people,'' according to a statement broadcast by
television.
	   Holbrooke met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday,
telling the Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are
facing.''
	   ``The military planning is going forward on a serious, intense
and sustained basis as we talk,'' Holbrooke told reporters after
the meeting.
	   Milosevic and his government appeared defiant. State television
said the Yugoslav leader told Holbrooke that ``a political solution
is the only possible solution'' and expressed hope ``that the
international community will finally contribute to reviving the
political process instead of issuing threats.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks on the future of
the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia would use its veto to stop any move to
approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N. Security Council,
which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false
promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be
verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said at the White House.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO
military action was imminent.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters after a
special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.

Rockies sign Leyland to three-year pact as manager

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Colorado Rockies signed former Florida Marlins
manager Jim Leyland to a three-year contract Monday night.
	   ``Mr. Leyland has agreed to a three-year contract to manage the
Rockies through the year 2001. He will be introduced at a press
conference Wednesday morning at Coors Field,'' said Rockies public
relations director Jay Alves.
	   Rockies owner Jerry McMorris and general manager Bob Gebhard met
with Leyland in Pittsburgh on Monday where the deal was made.
	   Terms of the contract were not announced.
	   Leyland, 53, replaces Don Baylor, the only manager Colorado had
in its six-year history, who was fired a week ago.
	   Leyland led the Marlins to the World Series championship in
1997, his first year with the franchise. However, the team stumbled
to a 54-108 record this season as the roster was decimated by moves
aimed at keeping the payroll low. Leyland exercised an escape
clause and resigned from Florida last week. He told the Los Angeles
Dodgers earlier this week he wasn't interested in their manager's
post.

Olympic organizers under attack on volunteer policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers were attacked
Tuesday for an ``outrageous'' decision to force first aid
volunteers to pay for their own accommodation and transport at the
2000 Games.
	   SOCOG has rejected a request for Australian dlrs 2 million (U.S.
dlrs 1.16 million) from the St. John Ambulance service to
accommodate, feed and transport volunteers from other Australian
states.
	   New South Wales state opposition leader Peter Collins said the
SOCOG decision was mean-spirited and could wreck the organizers'
chances of attracting the total 50,000 volunteers needed for the
Olympics.
	   ``For SOCOG to tell St. John volunteers that they'll have to pay
75 dollars each for their accommodation is just outrageous,''
Collins said Tuesday.
	   ``SOCOG is happy to spend millions of dollars sending sport
bureaucrats to the (soccer) World Cup, the Winter Olympics and the
Commonwealth Games but first aid volunteers will be slugged for the
privilege of helping out at the Games. This will damage reputation
of SOCOG.''
	   A SOCOG spokesman said the organization had not budgeted to pay
transport and accommodation costs for interstate volunteers.
	   ``The majority of volunteers will come from NSW; if we start to
pay costs for one group of interstate volunteers we'll have to do
it for all of them,'' the spokesman said. ``We do not have the
funding to do that. Basically volunteering is volunteering.''
	   SOCOG will provide meals for all volunteers and St. John
Ambulance has received almost Australian dlrs 300,000 (U.S. dlrs
175,000) to cover the extra uniforms and equipment needed during
the Games.
	   St. John Ambulance is self funded through first aid courses and
provided about 1,500 volunteers to the Olympics and subsequent
Paralympics.
	   ``Unlike a paid service our people are giving their time as
volunteers,'' said St. John commissioner John Spencer. ``They have
to take leave from their jobs.''
	   SOCOG is expected to launch its volunteer campaign Friday with
registration offices to be established in all capital cities.
	   The latest attack comes less than a fortnight after Collins'
opposition Liberal Party criticized a decision to allow state
employees to volunteer for the Games and stay on full pay.
	   The New South Wales public service is expected to provide about
5,000 of the 50,000 volunteers.
	   Shadow Olympics Minister Ian Armstrong said leaving was not fair
to others who volunteer for free.
	   ``You can't call a person a volunteer who is being paid to do
the job so it's a complete antithesis of the volunteering concept
in the Olympics,'' Armstrong said.

Tough times for Italy's seemingly unstoppable motorbikes

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tired of losing time in traffic and racking up
nearly dlrs 1,000 in parking tickets, lawyer Roberto Condorelli
thought he had the game beat.
	   He ditched his car for a scooter, joining the legions of
Italians who have taken to motorbikes to tackle the gridlock of
Rome and other major cities.
	   But now the brakes are being applied to the ubiquitous
motorbikes _ and riders are fuming.
	   ``It's impossible to get around in a car,'' said Condorelli,
checking that his beagle, Teo, was perched firmly between his legs
on the scooter's footrest before darting off to do errands in
central Rome.
	   Since Audrey Hepburn hopped onto Gregory Peck's Vespa in the
1953 film ``Roman Holiday,'' gliding through the streets aboard
mopeds and scooters has had panache. Bikes are freedom, darting
sparrows nimbly bypassing cars stuck in Rome's eternal traffic
jams.
	   But tough times have arrived for the ``centaurs,'' as motorbike
riders are called in Italian, borrowing the name of the mythical
half-man, half-horse creature.
	   Insurance rates have shot up for motorbike owners nationwide and
traffic cops are cracking down. And mayors now have the option of
banning bikes as well as cars when pollution levels are too high.
	   In a nation of 57 million, there are 9 million motorbikes on the
streets. Half a million _ more than any other city in Europe _ are
in Rome.
	   Even Mayor Francesco Rutelli rode a motorbike, only reluctantly
giving it up because of security concerns.
	   ``Motorbikes have become a means of mass transit now,'' says the
city's motorbike commissioner, Daniela Monteforte.
	   Insurers, some of whom have tripled rates, insist motorbikes are
dangerous and point to a rising number of accidents.
	   Many riders routinely run red lights, scoot between two lanes of
cars, pass on the right and go the wrong way down one-way streets.
Slippery cobblestones send the two-wheelers into spins.
	   A few years ago, riders rarely got tickets for parking on
sidewalks, a widespread practice. Now fines can reach 200,000 lire
(dlrs 120) for having even part of a wheel in a crosswalk.
	   And the number of tickets issued in Rome for riding without a
helmet or with a passenger roughly quadrupled from 1996 to 1997.
	   Some riders say their growing numbers are making them a target _
and have worked together to fight common problems that range from
potholes to a scarcity of parking slots to higher insurance fees.
	   Responding to their efforts, a senator has called for a
parliamentary inquiry into the rate hikes, and a proposed law would
make it legal to take on a passenger.
	   Last year, there were 810,614 new motorbike registrations.
	   ``There are now a lot of us,'' said rider Barbara Monti, 43. ``A
lot of people in their 40s are getting on a saddle for the first
time.''

Iraqi dissidents report heavy fighting in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi forces have widened a military
offensive in southern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out bases of
Shiite rebels, two Iraqi opposition groups said Tuesday.
	   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the
Iraqi Communist Party also reported anti-government disturbances in
Baghdad and other southern Iraqi cities.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate word from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   In a statement, the Iran-based council said soldiers backed by
tanks and artillery attacked several villages in marshes near
Nasiriya, 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   The raids were part of a campaign that began last week when
troops launched an attack against rebel positions in areas between
Nasiriya and Al-Amara, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Communist Party reported intensive fighting in the region
this week between rebels and army deserters and army units
supported by the ruling Baath Party militia.
	   The party said dozens of troops were either killed or wounded in
the fighting and others were taken prisoner. It did not give
figures for opposition casualties.
	   Tens of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge in the
marshes in southern Iraq after soldiers crushed a Shiite rebellion
in the south following Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraqi troops have mounted numerous campaigns against the Shiites
hiding in the marshes.
	   Offices of the Baath Party in Baghdad, Basra, Amara, Diwanya and
Kerbala also were bombed, it said, without giving details.
	   The claims came as the U.S. House of Representative voted Monday
to allow the president to direct the Pentagon to provide assistance
to rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Iraqi regime.

Fergie's debut as British TV chat show host draws approval

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York drew mostly praise Tuesday for
her caring-and-sharing television talk show, with surprised critics
admitting that she showed ``real skill.''
	   ``Sarah ... Surviving Life,'' a series of 10 one-hour shows
commissioned by Sky TV, was launched Monday with a rash of
newspaper interviews. In them, the former Sarah Ferguson, the
ex-wife of Prince Andrew, discussed her current boyfriend _ a
still-married Italian count _ her financial affairs and her refusal
to move out of a wing of Andrew's house where she lives with their
two daughters.
	   On the show, Fergie, as she is popularly known, sat on a couch
dressed in a black trouser suit and discussed life's crises with
her guests. Those included a woman who was raped by a serial killer
and a hit-and-run driver who had confessed 20 years later.
	   ``You might wonder why I qualify to present a show about
surviving life,'' the 38-year-old duchess told viewers. ``After
all, I have led a very charmed life _ there have been huge ups but
there have been some huge downs.''
	   The Guardian newspaper said Fergie performed ``unimpeachably''
and The Mirror newspaper said she carried the show off well despite
some nervousness.
	   Mirror columnist Sue Carroll said Fergie ``had clearly done her
homework and there was some real skill in the way she turned the
conversation around.''
	   ``I realize it's unfashionable to praise anything the duchess
does, but considering she's a beginner in TV terms, I think she did
pretty well,'' The Express critic Tim Hulse was quoted as saying.
	   The Times columnist Joe Joseph said that ``what struck you was
just how sober and professional a performance she delivered for
someone we have grown used to seeing behave like a buffoon.''
	   ``She has either turned over a new leaf, or was showing us a
different part of the old one,'' he wrote, adding that she
delivered ``more than we ever imagined her capable of.''
	   The Sun, which like The Times is owned by Sky TV proprietor
Rupert Murdoch, also judged the debut a success.
	   Not everyone was impressed.
	   Under the headline: ``The most embarrassing 60 minutes in chat
show history,'' The Daily Mail reviewer Jaci Stephen called the
discussion laughable.
	   ``Her responses and questions reveal that she does not have what
it takes for this kind of show, quite simply because the worlds she
is encountering among 'ordinary' people are so far removed from
those she inhabits, her attempts at empathy sound like crass
incomprehension, or even disbelief,'' Stephen wrote. ``The wrong
woman in the wrong job.''
	   The duchess said she is giving her dlrs 85,000 fee for the
series to charity but would keep the money for the foreign rights.
The company gave no estimate of that sum.

Unemployment rate in Germany sinks, lowest in nearly two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The number of Germans out of work sank
below 4 million to 3.96 million in September, the lowest figure in
nearly two years, the Federal Labor Office said Tuesday.
	   Unemployment nationwide now stands at 10.3 percent, compared to
11.2 percent this time last year.
	   Joblessness is the hottest political issue in Germany. The
country's persistent high joblessness was a key reason for the
defeat of its incumbent chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in national
elections at the end of September.
	   The election was won by the opposition Social Democrats, who
have promised to slash joblessness.
	   Seasonally-adjusted figures for September showed 130,000 more
people with work that month, the labor office in Nuremberg said.
	   Unemployment in the six states that made up the former East
Germany stands at 16.3 percent, or about twice as high as the rate
in the states of the former West Germany, which now stands at 8.8
percent.
	   The improvement was largely expected, with labor office head
Bernhard Jagoda predicting earlier the rate would drop below 4
million in September and October, but that it may rise again in
November.
	   Germany's high unemployment is in part a result of its
reunification with east Germany in 1990, with massive economic
restructuring underway in that part of the country.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ On the eve of a nationwide labor protest, the
government warned hard-line opposition leaders Tuesday that they
could face criminal charges for inciting armed revolt.
	   Russian labor unions predict that up to 28 million people will
take part in strikes, rallies and demonstrations throughout Russia
on Wednesday, though most observers expect a much smaller turnout.
	   A similar protest last year drew an estimated 2 million people
in hundreds of demonstrations across Russia. In previous years,
such rallies have drawn just hundreds of thousands in spite of
organizers' higher turnout estimates.
	   Seeking to cool the most die-hard opposition factions, Justice
Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov warned that criminal proceedings
could be launched against retired Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist
member of parliament, and several other opposition leaders who
addressed rallies over the weekend.
	   Their calls for the government's ouster by force are punishable
by law, Krasheninnikov said in an interview in the Tuesday edition
of the business daily Kommersant.
	   Trade unions and the Communist-led opposition have pledged that
the protests they are organizing jointly will proceed peacefully.
However, officials are preparing for unrest that could be sparked
by growing popular anger over the government's inability to pay
wages and pensions that are months overdue.
	   According to media estimates, the government owes workers and
pensioners a total of 36 billion rubles (about dlrs 2.4 billion).
The economic crisis that led to the ruble's devaluation in August
has made things worse, sending prices soaring and sharply eroding
people's spending power.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Monday that he didn't
exclude ``negative developments'' and specifically ordered police
to avoid confrontation with protesters. Police and interior troops
have been put on alert throughout Russia.
	   More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry troops
will be deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior Ministry
official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   While unions are largely pursuing economic goals, the Communists
are using the protest to further weaken President Boris Yeltsin's
power.
	   Other Yeltsin opponents are also seizing the opportunity to
advance their own goals.
	   Gen. Alexander Lebed, governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province
in Central Siberia and a presidential hopeful, told reporters
Tuesday that Yeltsin's resignation is ``inevitable,'' the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``Any government must serve the people, and if it fails to
deliver it must go,'' Lebed was quoted as saying.
	   Strikes have been frequent in many industries. Earlier this
year, coal miners blockaded several key railroads, including the
Trans-Siberian, for several weeks. However, most protests have been
uncoordinated and have not caused major disruptions to the economy.

Police reinforcements in Jerusalem, clash in West Bank

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to prevent attacks by Islamic militants,
police reinforcements patrolled Jerusalem and sealed off downtown
streets Tuesday as thousands of Jews prayed at the Western Wall to
mark the Sukkot holiday.
	   The security measures came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived for talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   In the West Bank, two dozen Palestinians clashed with Israeli
soldiers at the entrance to the tense, divided city of Hebron.
Palestinian teenagers threw rocks and bottles at Israeli soldiers
at a roadblock. Israeli forces fired tear gas and rubber-coated
steel bullets at the demonstrators. No injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police intervened to restore order. A Palestinian
policeman approached an Israeli soldier and threatened, ``if you
shoot one more rubber bullet, I will shoot you.'' After the arrival
of the Palestinian police commander in Hebron, the Israelis opened
the roadblock and allowed Palestinians to enter and leave the city.
	   Hebron has been sealed off for a week, since grenades were
thrown at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlers in the middle
of the city. Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled part of
downtown Hebron are still confined to their homes by an Israeli
curfew order.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, police sealed off streets
outside the Old City. Officers were stationed every few meters
(yards). Police banned vehicles from entering the Old City, except
for public transport and cars of residents.
	   Israel police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the measures around
Jerusalem were meant to control traffic because of the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot, when Jews throng to the Old City to pray at the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
	   She said police remain on high alert because of general warnings
of attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israeli media broadcast warnings from unnamed security sources
about terror attacks being plotted by the militants, including
plans to kidnap Israeli politicians.
	   Hamas political leader Mahmoud Zahar refused to comment on the
reports. But he told the Associated Press that Hamas favors
retaliation against ``military or any other targets'' to stop
Israel from killing Palestinians. ``The Israelis do not understand
any language except violence,'' he said.
	   Israeli media have been warning people here of impending terror
attacks for three weeks, since Israeli forces shot and killed two
Hamas leaders in the West Bank.
	   The warnings drew fire from a columnist in the Israeli daily
Haaretz daily. Yoel Marcus charged that Israeli security services
were ``whistling in the dark.'' While admitting that there is
reason for concern, Marcus wrote, ``it would be better to
concentrate on scaring Hamas, not the Israeli public.''

Iraqi dissidents report heavy fighting in south
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi forces have widened a military
offensive in southern Iraq in an attempt to wipe out bases of
Shiite rebels, two Iraqi opposition groups said Tuesday.
	   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the
Iraqi Communist Party also reported anti-government disturbances in
Baghdad and other southern Iraqi cities.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate word from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   In a statement, the Iran-based council said soldiers backed by
tanks and artillery attacked several villages in marshes near
Nasiriya, 360 kilometers (225 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   The raids were part of a campaign that began last week when
troops launched an attack against rebel positions in areas between
Nasiriya and Al-Amara, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Communist Party reported intensive fighting in the region
this week between rebels and army deserters and army units
supported by the ruling Baath Party militia.
	   The party said dozens of troops were either killed or wounded in
the fighting and others were taken prisoner. It did not give
figures for opposition casualties.
	   Tens of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge in the
marshes in southern Iraq after soldiers crushed a Shiite rebellion
in the south following Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraqi troops have mounted numerous campaigns against the Shiites
hiding in the marshes.
	   Offices of the Baath Party in Baghdad, Basra, Amara, Diwanya and
Kerbala also were bombed, it said, without giving details.
	   The claims came as the U.S. House of Representative voted Monday
to allow the president to direct the Pentagon to provide assistance
to rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Iraqi regime.

Vietnam's president makes historic visit to Thailand

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong
arrived Tuesday for the first visit to Thailand by a Vietnamese
head of state since the two countries established diplomatic ties
in 1976.
	   Luong was greeted by King Bhumibol Adulyadej at Bangkok's
military airport. Later Tuesday, he was to be given the key to the
capital by Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul and witness a signing
ceremony for three agreements covering visas, legal cooperation and
economic cooperation.
	   Thailand established diplomatic ties with Vietnam in 1976, one
year after North Vietnamese troops overran South Vietnam and united
the country under the communist banner.
	   Thailand had sent troops to help the United States and its South
Vietnamese ally during the Vietnam War, which ended with the 1975
communist takeover. Thailand also provided bases for U.S. Air Force
planes that raided Vietnam during the war.
	   Even after the diplomatic ties were established in 1976,
relations were strained, mainly because of the Vietnamese invasion
of Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the barbarous Khmer Rouge regime
from power.
	   The invasion brought Vietnamese troops up to Thailand's eastern
border, and Thailand lent its support to Cambodian guerrillas
opposing Vietnam's occupation. Only in 1989 did Hanoi's troops
depart, paving the way for improved Vietnamese-Thai relations.
	   In recent years, the two countries have embarked on various
cooperation projects, including joint development of a highway to
link Thailand and Vietnam through neighboring Laos.
	   Last year, the two countries signed an agreement to conduct
joint patrols in waters of the Gulf of Thailand where territorial
claims overlap, to put an end to fishing disputes in the area.
	   On Wednesday, Luong will be awarded an honorary liberal arts
degree at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University before giving a talk
at a luncheon meeting of business people. He is expected to
encourage foreign investment in his economically undeveloped
country.
	   Vietnam is currently reforming its economy and selling off its
ailing state enterprises but the international community and the
International Monetary Fund have criticized Hanoi for moving too
slowly.

`Pornographic' Chinese opera dropped from arts festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with comments from Shanghai

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A classic Chinese opera branded as pornographic
in China has been dropped from a Hong Kong art festival after
Chinese officials barred the troupe from taking part.
	   It was the second bout of trouble for Shanghai's Kunju opera
troupe and its rendition of ``The Peony Pavilion.'' Shanghai
officials seized sets, props and costumes and barred the troupe
from leaving China in June for its premiere in New York City's
Lincoln Center.
	   Lau Chun-keung, associate program director of the annual Hong
Kong Arts Festival, which opens in February, said in Tuesday's
South China Morning Post he didn't know why scheduled performances
of the 400-year-old opera were canceled.
	   Organizers were ``just told by the Shanghai Cultural Exchange
Agency that the Shanghai Kunju company would not take part,'' the
Post quoted Lau as saying. He and other organizers could not be
reached for comment Tuesday, a public holiday in Hong Kong.
	   Shanghai officials confirmed Tuesday that the troupe was not
allowed to participate, but put the blame on the Hong Kong festival
organizers.
	   A spokesman for the Shanghai Cultural Bureau, who gave only his
surname, Cui, said the festival never signed an agreement with
Shanghai.
	   Ms. Miao of the Shanghai Cultural Exchange Agency said festival
organizers did not give the troupe enough notice so there was no
time to pick a director or an appropriate version, much less
rehearse.
	   ``The Peony Pavilion'' has long been censored in China and
branded ``feudal, superstitious and pornographic'' by the often
puritanical communist government.
	   The revival of the 1598 work by Tang Xianxu centers on the
erotic tale of a young woman who meets her lover in a dream.
	   The young woman dies longing for ideal love, and her ghost finds
the man of her dreams. She is brought back to life and they marry.
Reports say the Shanghai opera troupe's version has one scene of
lovemaking, behind a screen, and no nudity on stage.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ This year's winner of the Nobel
Literature is to be announced Thursday at 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), the
Swedish Academy said Tuesday.
	   The prestigious prize this year is worth 7.6 million kronor
(dlrs 974,000).
	   The Swedish Academy conducts its deliberations on the prize in
tight secrecy and even the names of nominees are not released. But
critics enjoy speculating on who is being considered and there
tends to be wide agreement on strong possible candidates.
	   Names that arise in the pre-prize speculation include Bei Dao of
China, Jose Saramago of Portugal, Albanian Ismail Kadare and
Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer.
	   The other Nobel prizes _ in chemistry, physics, medicine,
economics and peace _ will be announced next week.

Bus, train drivers strike over violence; gangs on rise in Paris
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Attacks on bus and train employees triggered more
transit strikes Tuesday on more than a dozen lines in and around
Paris, leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters stranded or
delayed.
	   The walkout that cut service by at least half was the latest to
hit French public transportation as a result of attacks, and it
came days after gang violence exploded during a wedding in Paris
last week.
	   Bus drivers on 12 lines in northern Paris joined the walkout
Tuesday after a driver was beaten and stabbed in the abdomen Monday
afternoon by a rider who wanted to be dropped off between two stops
near the Porte Brunet. The driver was hospitalized.
	   More than 200,000 riders on the RER D line linking the capital
with southern suburbs around Melun were stranded since Monday
afternoon by train drivers protesting an attack on an employee last
week.
	   A gang of youths attacked the employee, spraying him with a
paint can and striking him with it after he tried to stop them from
vandalizing the station at Le Ferte-Alais in the Essonne suburb
south of Paris.
	   Attacks on two drivers on the Evry-Ville-Nouvelle bus line in
Essonne set off a strike Monday afternoon.
	   Authorities have deployed some extra security guards on trains,
but unions were demanding more protection.
	   Meanwhile, a Paris daily on Tuesday reported rising gang
activity in the capital with about 30 known groups _ mainly
composed of rival youths from immigrant families _ competing for
turf and drug trafficking.
	   In the most striking incident to date, a gang of youths opened
fire Friday on a Gypsy wedding in the 14th district of southwestern
Paris, injuring four people, one seriously.
	   The newspaper Le Parisien said the attackers were from a gang of
African and Arab youths.
	   Police have stepped up patrols in the area's low-cost, high-rise
housing near the Notre Dame du Rosaire Church, the paper reported.
	   Said security during the World Cup over the summer was a respite
for the violence that is back on the rise in working-class areas
throughout Paris, Le Parisien said.
	   Most are located on the outer edges of the city, though the
paper noted Les Patriarches gang is in the 5th district that
includes the Latin Quarter.
	   Youth violence has been linked to economic hard times in France,
where the double-digit jobless rate nationwide is as high as 50
percent or more in poor immigrant neighborhoods.

Leading newspaper urges arrest of foreign reporters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with CNBC comment, grafs 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A leading Malaysian newspaper
urged the government Tuesday to start detaining foreign journalists
who are reporting ``untruthful'' news about the nation.
	   As dissent against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad grows, the
government has repeatedly accused the foreign press of bias, giving
favorable coverage to Mahathir's rival, former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar and many of his associates were arrested late last month
under the Internal Security Act. He faces trial on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   ``We would urge the Malaysian government to adopt
Singapore-style hardball tactics with the press,'' said an
editorial-page commentary in the pro-government New Straits Times.
	   The commentary said the tactics would include suing reporters
and detaining them under the Internal Security Act, a Malaysian law
that allows indefinite detention without trial.
	   The newspaper's editorial office refused to comment on the
article.
	   The government has complained that foreign journalists who have
descended on Malaysia during the past month to cover the
unprecedented challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule appear to be
rooting for his overthrow.
	   Officials have been particularly upset by an interview given by
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to CNBC, in which she said she feared
that her husband might be injected with the HIV virus while in
custody.
	   Mahathir has also scolded CNBC Asia, a regional TV network, for
broadcasting a home video Anwar made before his arrest. Malaysian
police traveled to Singapore to interview CNBC journalists about
the interview.
	   Malaysians were ``aggrieved by CNBC's and Asian Wall Street
Journal's sensationalist reports on Malaysia,'' Tuesday's article
said.
	   ``In answer to the charges that we have sensationalized the
story, I disagree completely. We have tried to cover it as we would
any other big news story, in an objective and fair manner,'' said
Chris Blackman, CNBC's vice president of news programming.
	   ``If you look back at our track record, we've made every effort
to remain objective.''
	   Calling for a ban on ``guilty'' foreign reporters, the author,
Abdullah Tan, said: ``It is better to have no news than to have
untruthful news.''
	   Officials were furious when TV crews tried to transmit footage
of the last big Anwar rally last month, instead of devoting more
coverage to a visit by Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Since the Sept. 20 rally, foreign broadcasters have been told
they will have to find private satellite link providers for footage
that shows Malaysia in a negative light. Anwar was arrested hours
after the rally.

	   The Swedish Academy conducts its deliberations on the prize in
tight secrecy and even the names of nominees are not released. But
critics enjoy speculating on who is being considered and there
tends to be wide agreement on strong possible candidates.
	   Names that arise in the pre-prize speculation include Bei Dao of
China, Jose Saramago of Portugal, Albanian Ismail Kadare and
Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer.
	   The other Nobel prizes _ in chemistry, physics, medicine,
economics and peace _ will be announced next week.

Philippine Supreme Court acquits Imelda Marcos on graft charge

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court
acquitted former first lady Imelda Marcos of corruption Tuesday,
saving her from a 12-year prison term.
	   In an 8-5 vote, with one judge abstaining, the court overturned
the only verdict so far in which the widow of former President
Ferdinand Marcos had been found guilty of graft during her late
husband's strong-arm rule.
	   An aide said Mrs. Marcos, who has been free on bail, received a
telephone call informing her of her acquittal.
	   ``She just looked up after listening to the caller and handed
the phone to a member of her staff and said, `Thank you Lord,'''
the aide said.
	   Mrs. Marcos, 69, had been in seclusion for several days, praying
for an acquittal, the aide said.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   A special anti-graft court had found Mrs. Marcos guilty on two
corruption charges in 1993.
	   In January of this year, a Supreme Court panel acquitted her on
one charge but upheld her conviction on the second charge, which
carried a maximum prison term of 12 years. She was also fined 189
million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   The panel, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos to appeal the ruling one
final time to the entire Supreme Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans had
been accused of entering into five unfavorable contracts involving
a government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Prosecutors said they awarded leases on property owned by the
rail line to the hospital foundation at excessively low rates. Dans
had been acquitted earlier.
	   It its ruling, the Supreme Court said Mrs. Marcos did not
personally sign the lease and it was not proven that the lease
price was ``grossly and manifestly disadvantageous'' to the
government as prosecutors had argued.
	   The court said the anti-graft court also violated rules of due
process in reaching its verdict, such as holding unscheduled and
informal discussions on the case outside its offices, allowing a
non-member of the court division to participate, and excluding a
member from the deliberations.
	   ``That is the last word on the matter. The Supreme Court has
spoken and that's it,'' said the chief judge of the anti-graft
court, Francis Garchitorena.
	   Mrs. Marcos still faces numerous other criminal and civil cases
related to her husband's 20-year rule.
	   She also faces a meeting Thursday with tax officials at the U.S.
Embassy to discuss charges she failed to pay more than dlrs 5
million in U.S. income taxes in 1986 and 1987, when the Marcoses
lived in exile in Hawaii.
	   In a letter to Mrs. Marcos obtained by The Associated Press, the
Internal Revenue Service said she also did not file income tax
returns from 1992 to 1997.
	   It warned that a levy could be placed on her bank accounts and
other properties might be seized if she failed to attend the
meeting.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister ordered his Cabinet Tuesday
to speed up planned stimulus measures and consider additional steps
after forecasters warned the economy will likely shrink for a
second straight year.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will seek passage in Parliament
before the end of this year of a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 52 billion)
tax cut and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion) in new public
spending, government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said.
	   The moves came after the Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday
it now believes the world's second-largest economy will contract by
1.8 percent this year, revising a previous forecast of 1.9 percent
growth.
	   The contraction would mark the first time the economy has
declined two years in a row since 1955, when the government started
calculating the gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and
services produced within the country.
	   The rate of contraction would also be much steeper than last
year's 0.7 percent, suggesting Japan's economic slide may only be
gathering speed.
	   The EPA's report blamed faltering domestic demand for new goods
and services and sharp declines in housing starts and business
investment in new factories and equipment.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ With just 15 months to go, only 23 percent
of Taiwan's small businesses are prepared to deal with the
potentially disruptive year 2000 computer glitch, the Economics
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   In a survey of 1,300 companies categorized as small or
medium-size, 77 percent said they were either not aware of the
problem or had no ability to deal with it, the ministry said.
	   But the crisis may be less serious than it seems because only
about 58 percent of such businesses are computerized, said Hsu
Ju-chin, head of the ministry's information industry department.
	   Despite being one of the world's largest producers of computer
hardware, Taiwan has only recently begun to computerize. Many
businesses still rely on traditional methods of accounting and
stock keeping.
	   Worldwide, governments have been mobilizing to deal with the
glitch, known as the Y2K problem, which results from computers and
embedded chips in other machines reading years in just two digits.
If uncorrected, those machines would read Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1,
1900, causing them to shut down or scramble data.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese households averaged 323,319 yen (dlrs
2,415) in spending in August, down 2.4 percent from a year earlier
and the 10th straight month of declines, the government said
Tuesday.
	   The string of declines is the longest since the Management and
Coordination Agency started keeping track of the data in the
current format in 1963. The figure fell 3.4 percent in July.
	   Stagnant consumption has been a major factor in Japan's
recession, the country's worst since the end of World War II. The
dark economic outlook has prompted many to save rather than spend.
	   Household spending for wage earners fell 2.2 percent in August
from a year earlier, following a 4 percent drop in July.
	   Household spending for non-wage earners, which include
self-employed and senior citizens, dropped 2.4 percent, marking the
10th straight month of declines.
	   The propensity for wage earners to consume, a ratio which
measures the amount of disposable income that went to household
spending, fell to 68.5 percent from 69.3 percent in July on a
seasonally adjusted nominal basis, the agency said.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hurt by Japan's recession, sales of imported cars,
trucks and buses in Japan plunged 15.3 percent in September
compared with a year ago to 27,134 units, importers said Tuesday.
	   It was the 18th straight month of declines and followed a 23.0
percent fall in August, a 19.8 percent drop in July and a 25.5
percent decrease in June, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said.
	   U.S. imports were hard-hit, dropping nearly 30 percent, with
General Motors the only one of the Big Three automakers posting an
increase. Sales of autos from Germany and Britain also fell.
	   A spokesman for the association said sales of imported autos
were squeezed as consumers continued to tighten their purse strings
because of the bleak economic outlook.
	   Passenger car import sales declined 13.2 percent to 26,413 and
trucks sales tumbled 54.8 percent to 716. Bus sales, however, rose
66.7 percent to 5.
	   Some automakers managed to post higher sales because of the
introduction of new models, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. But because personal consumption remains very sluggish
it is unlikely that sales will improve within the year, he said.
	   ___
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian heavy machinery company PT
Trakindo Utama has sealed a debt-restructuring deal with 32 banks
worth dlrs 171 million, becoming one of the first major local
companies to do so, a banker involved in the discussions said
Tuesday.
	   After three months of intensive discussions with creditors,
Trakindo, the local distributor for Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), finally
secured the clearance from banks to roll over loans that fall due
later this year.
	   Privately held Trakindo will pay off dlrs 81 million up front to
the bankers in return for subsequent rollover of the remaining dlrs
90 million in the form of a three-year loan, the banker, who asked
not to be named, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The banker said the loan is attractively priced at the Singapore
Interbank Offered Rate plus three percentage points.
	   Chase Manhattan Bank is acting as adviser on the
debt-restructuring talks and the coordinating bank for all lenders.
	   Chase is one of the three banks which chair the steering
committee of banks that reached agreement with Indonesian creditors
earlier this year to restructure debt.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged
Japan's leaders on Tuesday to move quickly to clean up the
country's debt-ridden banking system, cautioning that failure to do
so could cause ``significant'' harm to American businesses.
	   ``Japan must find the will to put its financial house in order
and to do so without delay,'' Thomas Donohue told a press
conference.
	   He also said the enormous bad-loan problem at Japan's banks
threatened to curtail recovery in Asia, where a year-old economic
crisis has plunged millions into poverty and ignited growing
political unrest.
	   And Asia's crisis has already hurt U.S. companies and put
Americans out of work, he said.
	   ``U.S. exports to Asia have dropped nearly 14 percent in the
first half of this year. That's serious money and many jobs,'' he
said.
	   Also, he said that that many of America's biggest companies have
cut profit forecasts because of falling demand for their products
in Asia.
	   Donohue said he came to Japan to urge its leaders to move
``quickly and decisively'' to repair the ailing financial system
and boost economic growth. He was scheduled to meet Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi later Tuesday.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan Customs officials arrested
four people, including three Italian nationals, for smuggling
fine-quality heroin powder out of the country at an airport in the
eastern Punjab province, an official statement said Tuesday.
	   The three Italian nationals, carrying more than 2 kilograms (4.4
pounds) of heroin concealed in cavities of their suit cases, were
arrested from the Lahore airport _ the capital of Punjab province.
The accused, who have not been identified, were going to India.
	   In another case, a Pakistani Gul Agha was arrested with 8.5
kilograms (18.7 pounds) of heroin. He was booked on a flight for
Tashkent and had hidden heroin powder in 44 embroidered vests.

Poland to proceed with selling shares in state phone company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Despite turbulent world markets, Poland
will proceed as scheduled in selling shares in the state telephone
monopoly, government officials say.
	   The sale of at least 15 percent of Telekomunikacja Polska SA
would be the former communist-ruled country's largest privatization
so far and could double the shares of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
	   Analysts estimate the company's value at more than dlrs 8
billion, with shares going on sale Oct. 19 and listed on the stock
exchange no later than Nov. 20, according to the planned schedule.
	   The State Treasury Ministry is offering 5 percent of TPSA stock
to domestic investors and 10 percent to foreign institutional
investors.
	   Another 15 percent of TPSA's capital will be distributed free to
workers, and 5 percent will be contributed to a fund covering
claims against the government from owners of property confiscated
by Poland's communist regime, officials said.
	   TPSA is the third major central European telecommunications
company to be privatized, after Hungary's Magyar Tavkozlesi
Vallalat Rt., or Matav, and Czech's SPT Telecom.
	   Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz said Monday the sell-off of TPSA
shares would proceed despite market turbulence that caused other
telecommunications offerings to be withdrawn.
	   ``There are no reasons for a delay,'' Wasacz said. ``There is
not the least guarantee that the price we get in half a year would
be higher.''
	   Selling off state holdings is a key component of economic
reforms in Poland, which has one of the strongest economies of
former Soviet satellite states.
	   Along with bringing in money to help pay for widespread economic
and social reforms, the privatization also brings access to new
capital and global know-how, Wasacz noted.

Reports: Police, military protect more than 200 from murder spree

orders, final grafs; single name for Sutrisno is correct, graf 12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police are protecting more than 200
people who fear they might become targets of a mysterious killing
spree against Muslim clerics and others suspected of practicing
black magic, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Police have detained 123 suspects, many of whom have been
accused of being paid by others to kill, the newspaper Suara
Pembaruan said.
	   Three of the suspects were thought to be the masterminds of the
100 bizarre slayings in East Java, it reported.
	   Despite this, police said they have yet to establish a clear
motive.
	   The murders started two months ago in and around the town of
Banyuwangi, about 830 kilometers (518 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Witnesses have said the killers wear ninja-like black clothing
and attack at night with knives. Many victims were found mutilated.
	   Some theorize political and religious rivalries might be behind
the killings.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted East Java police chief
Maj. Gen. Moech Dayat as saying the carnage might be the work of
organized crime or the result of personal feuds or disputes over
money.
	   ``Those having feuds have paid others to kill (their rivals),''
Dayat said. ``That is what we know so far.''
	   Earlier media reports claimed that some killers were paid up to
dlrs 100 per victim.
	   Antara said the police and military are currently sheltering 227
people who fear for their lives. However, The Jakarta Post
newspaper said 277 were under protection.
	   Lt. Col. Sutrisno, a Banyuwangi police spokesman, confirmed that
some people were being protected. But he refused say how many.
	   Others had sought refuge in nearby villages.
	   Many of the dead had belonged to the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, which recently set
up its own political party.
	   Other victims were allegedly sorcerers who dabbled in black
magic that predates the arrival of Islam in Indonesia hundreds of
years ago.
	   Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights said it is
investigating the killings.
	   Meanwhile, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto was reported to
have ordered police to take all possible measures to stop the
killings.
	   Suara Pembaruan quoted Wiranto as also calling on the local
people to improve their security in villages.

Russian official: economy will shrink by more than 5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gross domestic product will shrink by
more than 5 percent and the nation's trade turnover will plummet
because of the economic crisis, a top official predicted Tuesday in
a plea for international aid.
	   In another development, Russia's new tax chief Georgy Boos
announced that the tax service had collected only 9.3 billion
rubles (dlrs 620 million) in September, 2 billion rubles (dlrs 133
million) less than in the previous month, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   The government has been running a large budget deficit for years
and regularly lacks money to pay millions of state workers on time.
But with the economy in decline, and most bank accounts frozen, tax
collection has become even more difficult than usual in recent
weeks.
	   Deputy Economy Minister Nikolai Shamrayev, who announced a
series of depressing economic figures, said help from the
International Monetary Fund could soften the impact of the crisis.
	   ``The reaction of the world financial community is vital to
correct the country's course,'' he told a conference of gas company
executives and analysts in Moscow.
	   Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chief
Viktor Gerashchenko are in Washington this week trying to persuade
the IMF to resume disbursement of its loan to bail out the Russian
economy. A high-level delegation from the European Union is due in
Moscow later this week.
	   Shamrayev told a conference of gas company executives and
analysts that inflation should total 200-230 percent in 1998, but
that IMF aid could limit the rate to 100 percent.
	   Industrial production will fall 5.5 percent to 6 percent by the
end of the year, he said. Imports will fall by 20-23 percent by the
end of the year, and exports will fall 13 percent, he said.
	   Shamrayev's prediction of a 5-5.5 percent contraction in GDP is
lower than the predictions of most analysts, who have said GDP
could fall by as much as 8 percent.
	   Shamrayev said that the slide could worsen, however, if the
government is unable to restart the paralyzed banking system. Money
transfers between businesses have been frozen.
	   The head of Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom, Rem Vyakhirev, told
the conference that the government would probably sell its 5
percent stake in the gas giant within the next six weeks.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale of its stake
because of poor market conditions. But Vyakhirev said the
government needs the money because it looks unlikely to get any aid
soon from the IMF.
	   In Washington, Gerashchenko said a draft agreement on new terms
for Russia to pay its debts to private banks could come as soon as
Oct. 15 or Oct. 20, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Zadornov
said that the government would provide the same terms for both
Russian and foreign banks, ITAR-Tass said.

China attacks U.S. defense plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China warned Tuesday that recently smoother ties
with the United States could be damaged by a U.S. defense budget
that awaits President Bill Clinton's approval.
	   The U.S. dlrs 270.5 billion defense authorization bill, which
Congress sent to Clinton Thursday, ``contained some anti-China
clauses,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
	   He said the bill called for continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,
which China regards as a rebel province, and the island's inclusion
in a missile defense system. The United States and Japan agreed
last month to research a regional missile defense system, a move
China also criticized.
	   Passage of the defense bill ``will create obstacles to the
improvement and development of China-U.S. relations. This will also
be detrimental to the security and stability of Taiwan and the
Asia-Pacific region,'' Zhu said at a briefing.
	   ``The Chinese side hereby expresses its deep concern and strong
opposition to this,'' Zhu said. ``We hope the U.S. government can
take effective measures to prevent the above mentioned anti-China
clauses from becoming law.''
	   Zhu also urged Washington to refrain from selling advanced
weapons to Taiwan ``to avoid damage to China-U.S. relations.''
	   China and Taiwan have been ruled by separate governments since
the Chinese civil war in 1949. China has largely succeeded in
isolating Taiwan diplomatically and has repeatedly urged Washington
to abide by a commitment to phase out arms sales to the island.

outcome of the assault could determine the future of the two-month
Congolese war.
	   After a trek of several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense
tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19
kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to
President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad
for a counter-offensive.
	   If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235
miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the
last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for
rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
	   A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of
ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the Congolese army and
opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to
Kabila's efforts to fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2.
	   Rebel commander Richard Mondo said troops had fired artillery
rounds into Kindu Monday and early Tuesday, and advance units were
within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the town.
	   He said the large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside
town, was deserted and no one appeared to be in control.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. On
Sunday a rebel spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already
under their control.
	   In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi Monday said the
Congolese army was firmly in control of Kindu.
	   ``We are moving our men by foot through the forest and
encountering very little resistance,'' rebel battalion commander
Arthur Mulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest
of Kindu.
	   Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion walked 240 kilometers (150
miles) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake Kivu to Kalima, which
fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance.
	   The rebel fighters, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark green
uniforms, rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, said they were advancing
slowly through the lush forest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall
grass.
	   ``We've been resting a lot. It took us two weeks to get here,''
Mondo said.
	   The rebels are now using Kalima, a town with one main street,
scattered houses and mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with
rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition.
	   A small, gras airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) down a narrow,
tarmac bush road from Kalima, is just barely long enough for the
Russian-built Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft to land and take
off.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and
Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila.
	   They still control a string of towns in eastern Congo, including
Kisangani, the country's third-largest city, Congo River port and
head of the railway to copper-rich southern Katanga Province that
passes through Kindu.

Russia will use U.N. veto to stop force against Yugoslavia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is willing to use its veto in the U.N.
Security Council to stop possible NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, the foreign minister said Tuesday.
	   ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation, it'll do just
the opposite,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned in an interview
with the Interfax news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis in Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanian-majority province in southern Yugoslavia.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' Yeltsin told Russian news agencies.
	   The Russian leader has spoken with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, U.S. President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques
Chirac among others. Yeltsin and Chirac agreed that force would not
work and would entail ``serious international consequences,'' a
statement from the Kremlin press office said.
	   Russia has for months strongly opposed the use of force against
the Serbs, their traditional allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren.
But Russia has agreed with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's violent campaigns against ethnic Albanians in the
province must be stopped.
	   ``There is no solution by force to the Kosovo problem. Its
source lies in an ethnic conflict, and bombs cannot solve ethnic
conflicts,'' Ivanov said in an interview Monday night with the ORT
television station.
	   Ivanov told Interfax on Tuesday that if the U.N. Security
Council considers applying force in Kosovo, Russia ``without a
doubt will use its right to veto.''
	   Ivanov said that Russia would do ``everything to reach a
political regulation of the situation.''
	   Yeltsin told Germany's Chancellor-elect Gerhard Shroeder that
Yugoslavia had accepted a Russian proposal to invite an
international delegation to investigate the crisis, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Russia had proposed that a delegation from the 54-country
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe go to Kosovo to
investigate ways to end the crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   In Russia's parliament, which is dominated by Communists and
nationalists, deputies have said that NATO bombings would endanger
Russia's ties with the NATO alliance.
	   ``If NATO starts bombing strikes ... Russia will assume a very
tough stand and will demand that Russia's agreement with NATO be
broken off,'' Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
parliament's lower house, was quoted as saying by Interfax.

EU parliament to vote on lifting of Le Pen 's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED after vote, expected around 1100 gmt
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament was expected to
vote Tuesday to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen , so a German court can try him for calling the
Holocaust ``a detail'' of history.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity
came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right
leader told a press conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in
the history of the Second World War.''
	   The largest political groups in the European Union assembly
indicated they would vote to lift Le Pen's immunity during the
parliament's session Tuesday in Strasbourg, France.
	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
could face up to five years in prison.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting
a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs
3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.
	   Last month, the European Parliament's 20-member procedures
committee voted 16 to four to lift Le Pen 's immunity. Le Pen is
one of 12 National Front members in the European parliament.

Police tighten security ahead of South Korean president's visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Some 16,000 police officers will be mobilized in
the Tokyo area to tighten security during the visit of South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, starting Wednesday, police said.
	   Police divers searched the waters under a bridge in downtown
Tokyo Tuesday, officers said.
	   Police are guarding against possible attacks from both right-
and left-wing extremists, who oppose the visit of Kim Dae-jung for
different reasons.
	   The right wing, which worships the emperor, is opposed to plans
to have Emperor Akihito visit South Korea later this year. Japan
ruled South Korea as a colony from 1910 until 1945, and ill will
remains. Right wingers are expected to have more than 100 sound
trucks blaring slogans and militarist marches on the streets during
the four-day visit, the newspaper Nihon Keizai said.
	   The left wing also could use the visit to draw attention to its
causes, such as trying to stop the planned expansion of Tokyo's
international airport and campaigning against the upgrading of
security arrangements between the United States and Japan.

British actor Marius Goring dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Marius Goring, a British actor who built his
reputation on the London stage but made his name playing villainous
Nazis on the big screen, has died. He was 86.
	   Goring, who died Sept. 30 at his home in West Sussex, had
cancer, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   Long known for his Shakespearean stage roles, Goring achieved
his biggest popular success in the 1960s and '70s playing a
forensic scientist who hunted criminals in the BBC series ``The
Expert.'' His cinematic peak may have come in 1948 opposite Moira
Shearer in ``The Red Shoe,'' a retelling of a Hans Christian
Andersen fable still regarded as one of the best dance films ever
made.
	   Born at Newport, Isle of Wight, on May 23, 1912, Goring briefly
attended universities in Frankfort, Vienna, Paris and Munich before
studying at the Old Vic drama school from 1929-32. In 1931, he
toured France and Germany with the English Classical Players.
	   In the mid-1930s he made a formidable reputation playing foils
and second leads in London's West End theaters, earning critical
acclaim in ``Twelfth Night'' alongside Laurence Olivier and Alec
Guinness in 1937.
	   During World War II he made British propaganda broadcasts to
Germany and provided the voice of Hitler in an anti-Nazi radio
serial, ``The Shadow of the Swastika.''
	   He appeared in so many World War II movies that he claimed to
have played every rank in the German army. His films included
``U-Boat 29'' (1939) with Conrad Veidt; ``Pastor Hall'' (1940),
based on the story of the anti-Nazi minister, the Rev. Martin
Niemoeller; and ``Circle of Danger'' (1951) with Ray Milland.
	   In 1954 he was included in the all-star cast of Ava Gardner,
Humphrey Bogart, Rosanno Brazzi and Edmund O'Brien in ``The
Barefoot Contessa.''
	   From the mid-'50s, Goring concentrated on Shakespearean roles,
combining those with touring. In 1953 he led the Shakespeare
Memorial Company at Stratford-on-Avon in ``Richard III, ``Antony
and Cleopatra,'' and ``King Lear.'' He returned to lead the company
in 1962 and was a distinguished Angelo in ``Measure for Measure.''
	   Goring is survived by his third wife, the director Prudence
Fitzgerald, whom he married in 1977, and a daughter from his first
marriage.

Philippine stocks end mixed; peso strengthens on higher yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed Tuesday
in sluggish trading as investors found no fresh news to perk up
buying interest, dealers said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, rose against the dollar on the back of a
stronger Japanese yen and minimal corporate dollar demand, traders
said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 3.62 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 1,170.16, after a 2.4 percent decline Monday.
	   Decliners, however, surpassed gainers 38 to 30, with 52 issues
unchanged.
	   The main index had fallen a total of 93.10 points, or 7.4
percent, over the previous three sessions, making some issues ripe
for bargain-hunting, traders said.
	   Limiting the market's upside potential was a 1.2 percent loss
suffered by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. shares, as
speculators took profits on recent gains by the stock because of
persistent takeover rumors.
	   ``It's been very quiet trading. Interest in stocks is a bit off
in the past few days,'' said Edwin Siao, trader for Abacus
Securities Corp.
	   Siao said economic prospects remain poor, but downplayed fears
that deflation may set in.
	   Export growth slowed to 18 percent in August from the previous
month's 19 percent, while the 8.9 percent unemployment rate in the
third quarter raised the possibility of weak third-quarter economic
data, analysts said.
	   Third-quarter corporate earnings are also likely to reflect the
weak economy, Siao said.
	   ``As far as we're concerned, we've already discounted corporate
earnings this year. We're not waiting for the third-quarter reports
since they may not be much,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.778 pesos for the
day, down from Monday's 43.906 pesos. It was last traded at 43.780
pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the yen's gains allowed the
peso to appreciate in the absence of any major commercial demand
for dollars.
	   The yen was being buoyed by overnight losses on the New York
Stock Exchange and the possibility of an economic stimulus package
in Japan.
	   The Philippine central bank wasn't active in the spot market,
and held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent
and 16 percent respectively.

UN review would force inspectors to prove Iraq still holding
</HEADLINE>
weapons &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS pvs. No pick up. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council must decide whether
Kofi Annan's overtures to Baghdad will compromise efforts to disarm
Iraq.
	   In a briefing Monday to the council, Annan outlined his proposal
for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ a move intended to persuade Iraq to allow inspectors
to resume their work.
	   In the proposal, Annan suggested that U.N. arms inspectors would
have to prove that Iraq hasn't completely disarmed itself. If
accepted by the Security Council, the recommendation would
represent a major shift in the way U.N. arms experts have worked
for the past seven years.
	   Previously, the onus has been on Iraq to provide information
that it had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction. Under
the proposal, inspectors would have to prove that Iraq still had
such weapons.
	   In the past, inspectors have told the council that while they
haven't found evidence that Iraq still has banned weapons, they
can't be sure that the evidence doesn't exist.
	   That argument, boosted by charges that Iraq had developed an
advanced concealment program to keep evidence from inspectors, had
been sufficient for the council to agree to keep sanctions on Iraq,
depriving it of its most valuable commodity, oil.
	   It wasn't clear if the council would go along with Annan's
proposal. Other elements of the plan could be troubling, such as
his recommendation that the council _ not inspectors _ make a final
list of what Iraq needs to do to have sanctions lifted and stating
when that day might come.
	   In outlining its position Monday, the United States flatly
objected to any ``predetermined outcome'' of a review.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the council will
lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf War.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 it was stopping inspections because the
chief U.N. inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   In a resolution last month, the Security Council said it would
consider conducting a comprehensive review of Iraq's effort to
disarm itself if Baghdad rescinded its Aug. 5 decision.
	   The council doesn't have to accept Annan's proposal.
	   Annan has been meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz to discuss the proposal, and a decision from Baghdad on
whether to accept it was expected after Aziz returns home following
a Wednesday meeting with Annan.
	   In his report, Annan suggested the review be carried out ``a few
weeks at most'' after Iraq reverses its decision.
	   The United States, according to briefing notes read to the
council Monday by deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh, says the review
should come once inspectors have reported that they can do their
jobs _ some six to eight weeks later. ``The length of time depends
on the quality of the cooperation,'' his notes say.

Unemployment rate in Germany sinks, lowest in nearly two years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and with reaction. ADDS Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The number of Germans out of work sank
below 4 million to 3.96 million in September, the lowest figure in
nearly two years, the Federal Labor Office said Tuesday.
	   Unemployment nationwide now stands at 10.3 percent, compared to
11.2 percent this time last year.
	   Joblessness, stuck above 4 million since November 1996, was a
key reason for the defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in national
elections last week, won by the Social Democrats on promises to put
Germans back to work.
	   Contrary to voter perceptions that Kohl's government had not
done enough to combat unemployment, his conservative coalition
claimed credit for the drop.
	   Government spokesman Otto Hauser said Germany's good economic
situation and the reform course followed by the government had
contributed to the decline in joblessness. ``Companies are
investing heavily again and creating increasingly more new jobs,''
he said.
	   Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said the figures were evidence that
the labor situation had turned, although Germany still had a long
way to go.
	   ``The Kohl government's reforms are also bearing fruit on the
labor market,'' Bluem said. ``No one can deny that anymore.''
	   The head of Germany's federal labor office in Nuremberg,
Bernhard Jagoda, attributed the drop to the outgoing government's
intensified job-creation policies, particularly in eastern Germany,
and to a strengthened economy.
	   Jagoda, however, said the 10.3 percent unemployment rate is
``unacceptably high, even if it has fallen by 0.9 percent on the
year.''
	   Unemployment in the five states that made up the former
communist East Germany stands at 16.3 percent, or about twice as
high as the rate in former West Germany, which now stands at 8.8
percent.
	   The improvement was largely expected, with Jagoda predicting
earlier the rate would drop below 4 million in September and
October, but that it may rise again in November.
	   Germany's high unemployment is in part a result of its
reunification with East Germany in 1990, with massive economic
restructuring underway in that part of the country.

Germany reports more Kosovo Albanians refugees arriving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ About 22,000 Yugoslavs _ the vast majority
Kosovo Albanians _ have arrived in Germany this year seeking
asylum, and the numbers are climbing, the government said Tuesday.
	   Outgoing Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said the stream of
refugees fleeing violence in the separatist region showed the need
for tighter sanctions to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to resolve the crisis.
	   In September, 9,651 people applied for asylum, 15 percent more

MasterCard warns not to discriminate against Malaysian cardholders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ MasterCard warned retailers Tuesday to continue
accepting credit cards issued in various troubled Asian countries,
following reports that Malaysian cards have been rejected overseas
because of the country's currency controls.
	   ``MasterCard International ... supports all MasterCard cards on
issue from all member financial institutions and ... merchants must
not discriminate against cards from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia
or anywhere else,'' the company said in a statement issued from its
Singapore office.
	   Malaysian news reports last week said MasterCards held by
Malaysians have been rejected in Thailand and elsewhere because
wary retailers were concerned or confused about the recently
enacted currency controls.
	   The government shocked the region two months ago when it
jettisoned orthodox economic wisdom by fixing the exchange rate and
halting trading of its currency overseas.
	   MasterCard spokeswoman Nancy Elder told Dow Jones Newswires
Tuesday that the company has received reports of ``isolated''
incidents of credit card rejections, but stressed that there was no
widespread trend of such refusals.
	   She added that the company statement was a pre-emptive warning.
	   ``We acknowledge that under current circumstances, consumers and
merchants may be unsure about using and accepting payment cards,''
the statement quoted Donald Van Stone, MasterCard senior vice
president for Southeast Asia, as saying.
	   But he added, ``During these difficult times, merchants must be
reminded that it is their responsibility to accept MasterCard
payment cards without prejudice.''

Egyptian President pursues mediation of Turkey-Syria crisis

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak scheduled
a stop Tuesday in Ankara on the second leg of his shuttle diplomacy
to avoid a military confrontation between neighbors Turkey and
Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   Despite calls for calm from its neighbors, Turkey has kept up
its tough rhetoric, accusing Damascus of supporting the rebels who
have been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey for over a
decade.
	   ``We don't want a war with Syria, we want it to cut its support
to Kurdish rebels,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said late Monday.
``Syria has been at least 10 years late in doing that. If it
further delays it, then it will be the side which will get
harmed.''
	   He warned that Turkey would not be satisfied with empty
promises.
	   Syria said Monday that threats were not suitable in such
situations and called for dialogue.
	   The United States, along with most countries of the Middle East,
urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution.
	   Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad on Sunday.
Turkey cautioned on Mubarak's role as a go-between, stating that
there was no need for mediation between the two countries.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the bolstering military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel.
	   But the recent rise in tension appears part of Ankara's push to
end a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency that has killed 37,000 people.
	   Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops to its border with
Syria and newspapers have speculated that its forces could stage
raids on rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
Lebanon.
	   Lebanon denies rebel presence on its territory.

Philippine Supreme Court acquits Imelda Marcos on graft charge

Philippine president in graf 17; adds background &QL; 
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court
acquitted former first lady Imelda Marcos of corruption Tuesday,
saving her from a 12-year prison term.
	   In an 8-5 vote, with one judge abstaining, the court overturned
the only verdict so far in which the widow of former President
Ferdinand Marcos had been found guilty of graft during her late
husband's strong-arm rule.
	   An aide said Mrs. Marcos, who has been free on bail, received a
telephone call informing her of her acquittal.
	   ``She just looked up after listening to the caller and handed
the phone to a member of her staff and said, `Thank you Lord,'''
the aide said.
	   Mrs. Marcos, 69, had been in seclusion for several days, praying
for an acquittal, the aide said.
	   Mrs. Marcos gained notoriety for an extensive shoe collection
and lavish lifestyle at a time when most Filipinos were mired in
poverty.
	   She and her late husband were accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his 20-year presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   A special anti-graft court had found Mrs. Marcos guilty on two
corruption charges in 1993.
	   In January of this year, a Supreme Court panel acquitted her on
one charge but upheld her conviction on the second charge, which
carried a maximum prison term of 12 years. She was also fined 189
million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   The panel, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos to appeal the ruling one
final time to the entire Supreme Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans had
been accused of entering into five unfavorable contracts involving
a government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Prosecutors said they awarded leases on property owned by the
rail line to the hospital foundation at excessively low rates. Dans
had been acquitted earlier.
	   It its ruling, the Supreme Court said Mrs. Marcos did not
personally sign the leases and it was not proven that the prices
were ``grossly and manifestly disadvantageous'' to the government
as prosecutors had argued.
	   The court said the anti-graft court also violated rules of due
process in reaching its verdict, such as holding unscheduled and
informal discussions on the case outside its offices, allowing a
non-member of the court division to participate, and excluding a
member from the deliberations.
	   Mrs. Marcos' son, Ferdinand ``Bongbong'' Marcos Jr., said his
mother was elated.
	   ``People have berated her, people have ridiculed her, and in the
end this decision has proven that she was right,'' he said. ``She
is in exceedingly high spirits.''
	   President Joseph Estrada said the decision would not affect
government efforts to recover the Marcos' alleged ill-gotten
wealth.
	   Mrs. Marcos still faces numerous other criminal and civil cases
related to her husband's strongman rule.
	   She also faces a meeting Thursday with tax officials at the U.S.
Embassy to discuss charges she failed to pay more than dlrs 5
million in U.S. income taxes in 1986 and 1987, when the Marcoses
lived in exile in Hawaii.
	   In a letter to Mrs. Marcos obtained by The Associated Press, the
Internal Revenue Service said she also did not file income tax
returns from 1992 to 1997.
	   It warned that a levy could be placed on her bank accounts and
other properties might be seized if she failed to attend the
meeting.

Billionaire Ellison back for yacht classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Billionaire United States businessman
Larry Ellison will take his maxi yacht Sayonara back to Australia
for this year's Sydney to Hobart bluewater classic.
	   Sayonara won line honors in the 1995 race and media magnate
Rupert Murdoch was a crew member for Oracle chairman Ellison.
	   The race, starting on Boxing Day in Sydney Harbor, is expected
to attract about 120 of Australia's best ocean racing yachts, along
with yachts and crews from Britain, France, New Zealand, Italy, the
U.S. and Hong Kong.
	   It is not known whether Murdoch, who competed with his own yacht
Ilina back in the 1960s, will compete again this year.
	   Launched in 1995, Sayonara is still one of the most advanced IMS
maxi yachts in the world. It was designed by Farr International as
a special project for Ellison.

U.S. envoy stages shuttle diplomacy on Kosovo; Milosevic still

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior American envoy engaged in
shuttle diplomacy Tuesday against the specter of impending NATO
airstrikes, but U.S. officials were pessimistic about averting
intervention in the face of continuing defiance by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, after meeting in Kosovo's capital
with diplomatic observers, said Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to ease their crackdown on separatists.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bring us
information, and the information is not good,'' he told reporters
before heading for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. He was
expected to return to Belgrade for another meeting with Milosevic
Tuesday night.
	   Despite the shuttle talks, the likelihood of Milosevic
concessions or a diplomatic agreement that would satisfy Western
leaders set on military intervention appeared limited.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted several
hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the ``the
grave situation we are facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its
veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the
U.N. Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later
Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia. But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with
Milosevic, and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced
skepticism Milosevic would adhere to any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, one of the leaders Yeltsin
spoke with, agreed with Yeltsin that force would not work and would
entail ``serious international consequences,'' the Kremlin press
office said.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
Monday that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making
false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Yeltsin, said Milosevic's
compliance with U.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible and
irreversible,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White
House.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday
that Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution Sept. 23 demanded a
cease-fire.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.

September inflation in Ukraine hits 3.8 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's inflation reached 3.8 percent in
September, the highest monthly rate so far in 1998, the State
Statistics Committee said Tuesday.
	   Total inflation from the start of the year was 6.2 percent, it
said.
	   Officials had previously voiced fears that September inflation
could reach 7.5 percent or more. Although the actual figure was
much lower, it still represented a negative sign for Ukraine's
shaky financial system.
	   Following nearly two years of relative price stability, the
former Soviet republic has been badly hit by Russia's financial
turmoil, which has only aggravated the Ukrainian government's
failure to implement reforms needed to increase budget revenues and
boost economic growth.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency has been sliding steadily in response
to the Russian ruble's fall, causing a massive increase in prices.
	   Inflation in Ukraine has declined steadily since reaching more
than 10,000 percent in 1993, and the annual rate dropped to 10
percent in 1997 and 2.3 percent in the first eight months of 1998.
	   Inflation in August amounted to 0.2 percent.

Report: Chinese president to visit Australia in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Chinese comment in grafs 7-8, slight editing to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin will make
a landmark visit to Australia in 1999, in a further sign of thawing
relations between the two countries, Australian Associated Press
reported Tuesday.
	   In accepting a longstanding invitation, Jiang will be the most
senior member of China's Communist leadership to ever journey to
Australia.
	   Confirmation of next year's visit came Tuesday as China
congratulated Prime Minister John Howard on his victory in
Saturday's election, the Australian domestic news agency reported
from Beijing.
	   It followed speculation that a visit could be organized as early
as next month to follow the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
leaders' forum in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``He (Jiang) is not going this year. He has accepted an
invitation to visit next year. We don't have any dates yet. They
are still to be confirmed,'' AAP quoted an Australian Embassy
spokesman as saying.
	   A November visit had been discussed but Chinese officials felt
that the president would be busy with major domestic commitments in
the aftermath of this year's floods, the spokesman said.
	   Zhu Bangzao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, declined when
asked by a reporter to confirm next year's visit.
	   But he said China believes that meetings between Australian and
Chinese leaders ``play an important and irreplacable role for the
development of bilateral relations.''
	   Howard extended an open invitation to Jiang to visit Australia
during an official visit to China in early 1997.
	   The prime ministerial tour helped ease bilateral tensions after
China was angered by early diplomatic stumbles by the Howard
government shortly after its election in 1996.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji _ now the second highest ranked Chinese
leader _ visited Australia in May 1997, but at the time was ranked
fifth in the powerful seven-member Communist Party Politburo
standing committee.
	   Zhu's visit was marked by small demonstrations railing against
China's human rights record.
	   During Jiang's visit to the United States last year, thousands
of demonstrators dogged his trail to protest against human rights
abuses and urge greater political freedom in China.
	   Australia has received a series of official visits since early
1997 as relations rebounded from the downturn in 1996 on the back
of the Howard government's softer approach to the human rights
issue.

Chemicals group's eight-month profit dlrs 132 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's leading fertilizer and
chemicals company, Kemira, reported Tuesday an eight-month pretax
profit of 660 million markkaa (dlrs 132 million), up from 642
million markkaa in 1997.
	   Net sales from January through August increased to 10 billion
markkaa (dlrs 2 billion), from 9.7 billion markkaa for the same
period last year.
	   Sales in the core businesses of chemicals, pigments, fertilizers
and colorants production were up by 6 percent, Kemira Group said.
	   The company said that it had been little affected by the
financial crisis in Russia which accounts for about 2 percent of
its total sales.
	   ``Net income for the group is expected to be close to last
year's record level,'' the company said in a statement.
	   In 1997, Kemira had a pretax profit of 864 million markka (dlrs
173 million), with net sales of 14.4 billion markkaa (dlrs 2.9
billion).
	   In January, Kemira announced it had extended a major deal with
Rhone Poulenc Agro of France to manufacture corn herbicides worth 1
billion markkaa (dlrs 200 million).
	   Kemira also makes pharmaceuticals. It is 54-percent state-owned,
and employs 10,500 people in 25 countries.

Military parade marks war with Israel, Mubarak criticizes Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Tuesday marked the 25th anniversary
of its last war against Israel with a military parade reviewed by
President Hosni Mubarak, who called the war a victory for peace.
	   The parade, conducted at an army camp near the Suez Canal town
of Ismailia, was the first on the anniversary since the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Saddat by Muslim radicals during a
similar show of strength.
	   In Tuesday's ceremony, shown on national television, Mubarak was
driven past a forest of rocket launchers, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles and artillery pieces, and naval assault boats
looking incongruous on the desert sands.
	   The show included heavy US-made M1A1 tanks, better known as
Abrams, lighter Egyptian made Walid and Fahd armored vehicles and
anti-aircraft missile systems.
	   Before attending the parade Mubarak told Egyptian television
that Middle East 1973 War war was ``a lightning point in Egypt's
modern military history.''
	   ``It was a war that opened the road for peace,'' he said on the
program Good Morning Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
	   But Mubarak warned against what he called Israel's growing
arsenal, saying it constitutes ``a threat to the security of the
region.''
	   Mubarak has used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a
series of interviews, blaming the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalemate in peace talks with the
Palestinians.
	   ``From the day Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing
has been implemented. The peace process has stopped,'' Mubarak told
Israel's Channel 2 Monday night.
	   Mubarak watched Tuesday's parade through aviator-style
sunglasses, flanked by his defense minister and senior army
officers. The president, a former pilot, was air force commander in
the 1973 war.
	   Some 2,500 Israelis, 15,000 Egyptians, 7,700 Syrians and 125
Iraqis were killed in the war of 0ct. 6-24, 1973. Tens of thousands
were wounded.
	   Egypt considers the war a military victory because its soldiers
overran Israeli forces in crossing the Suez Canal, challenging the
myth of Israel's invincibility. Egyptians believe the rebuilding of
Arab pride from the war led to peace with Israel six years later.

Thai premier says new Cabinet to follow established policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Thailand-Censure Threat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A shakeup of his Cabinet will not mean
any change in policies to tackle Thailand's economic crisis, Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said Tuesday.
	   Chuan spoke at a news conference after the first Cabinet meeting
since a reshuffle in which he brought a former opposition party
into the government coalition to boost its parliamentary majority.
	   ``Policies will remain the same as we had announced,'' Chuan
said. ``The implementation methods of each Cabinet member may be
different, however.''
	   Chuan's new Cabinet includes members of the Chart Pattana Party,
formerly the second largest opposition party, which agreed to join
the coalition last week.
	   With Chart Pattana's 51 lawmakers, the seven-party coalition
controls a majority of 255 seats in the 393-seat House of
Representatives.
	   Chuan said he would not protect any Cabinet member tainted by
allegations of corruption.
	   The reshuffle was triggered in part by the resignation of one
Cabinet minister and two deputies, who left to take responsibility
for scandals over the purchase of overpriced items under programs
handled by their ministries.
	   Chuan also said his government would not keep the current
Parliament in office for its full four-year term to November 2000,
but declined to give a date for any future elections.
	   The Cabinet reshuffle should make it easier for the coalition to
push its economic reform package through Parliament, where it has
met stiff resistance from the opposition.
	   Major reform measures coming before the Parliament this month
include amendments to enable timely foreclosure on debt collateral,
to allow greater foreign participation and ownership of businesses
and small portions of land, and to allow state enterprises to be
turned into corporations ahead of partial privatizations.
	   Opposition leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said he will give
Chuan's new Cabinet a two-month grace period before lodging a
censure motion against the government, local newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   ``I expect it to be very soon. In a couple of months,'' Chavalit
was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post.
	   With only 132 lawmakers in the opposition, Chavalit does not
have the votes necessary to topple Chuan's coalition in a censure
debate, also known as a no-confidence debate.
	   Chuan's government also enjoys a greater measure of popularity
than other recent governments, despite corruption allegations that
surfaced at the education, public health and agriculture
ministries.

Albright sees Netanyahu, Arafat; says time is runnign out

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the admonition that ``time is running
out,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is holding
back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Her aim is to narrow differences on a West Bank accord before
President Bill Clinton hosts a summit with the two Mideast leaders
later in the month.
	   She went to Netanyahu's office early Tuesday for a meeting that
was expected to last about two hours and was traveling to the West
Bank town of Jericho later in the day to meet with Arafat.
	   ``There is a sense of urgency,'' Albright said on her way to
Jerusalem Monday from Washington for two days of talks.
	   ``The United States can do a great deal, but the leaders have to
be willing to make decisions,'' Albright said.
	   But Netanyahu said there would be no agreement for an Israeli
pullback unless the Palestinian Authority carried out its
commitment to clamp down on Islamic militants opposed to the peace
process.
	   And Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated
Press Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   If Albright is unable to bridge the differences, Clinton could
come up short in his bid to play peacemaker in the Middle East as
he successfully did in Northern Ireland.
	   ``I don't expect her to come back with all the issues
resolved,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday.
	   Albright's aim is to ``whittle away, clear some underbrush'' to
set the stage for intensive negotiations in Washington, he said.
	   Clinton brought Netanyahu and Arafat to the White House last
week to try to set up a timetable for forging an agreement.
	   After months of U.S. prodding, Netanyahu has agreed to
relinquish 13 percent of the West Bank, with 3 percent turned into
a nature preserve under joint Israeli-Palestinian security.
	   Arafat said he had accepted the arrangement. But Netanyahu made
it clear an accord was conditional on Palestinian territory not
being used to launch attacks against Israeli civilians.
	   The Palestinian Authority has said it is working to contain
militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts cannot
provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Another five Customs officers in Ho Chi
Minh City have been accused of complicity in Vietnam's biggest
smuggling ring, bringing the number of suspects in the case to more
than 80, the newspaper Tuoi Tre reported Tuesday.
	   The Tan Truong Sanh smuggling ring was uncovered last year when
police raided a warehouse hired from the army and found electronic
goods worth millions of dollars on which no import duty had been
paid.
	   The ring reportedly hired police cars to escort smuggled
containers of goods.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ On the eve of a nationwide labor protest, the
government warned hard-line opposition leaders Tuesday that they
could face criminal charges for inciting armed revolt.
	   Russian labor unions predict that up to 28 million people will
take part in strikes, rallies and demonstrations throughout Russia
on Wednesday. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that up
to 40 million will show, although most observers expect a much
smaller turnout.
	   A similar protest last year drew an estimated 2 million people
in hundreds of demonstrations across Russia.
	   Seeking to cool the most die-hard opposition factions, Justice
Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov warned that criminal proceedings
could be launched against retired Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist
member of parliament, and several other opposition leaders who
addressed rallies over the weekend.
	   Their calls for the government's ouster by force are punishable
by law, Krasheninnikov told a news conference Tuesday.
	   However, Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a
lawmaker, and the Communists, who dominate the parliament's lower
house, could easily block any attempt to lift his immunity.
	   Krasheninnikov said he had told opposition leaders that Justice
Ministry officials would attend all the rallies to see whether they
comply with the law.
	   ``I would like to specifically warn those trying to incite
tensions that the authorities will closely follow the events. If we
hear calls for violent overthrow of the constitutional order, we
will make our conclusions,'' he said.
	   Trade unions and the Communist-led opposition have pledged that
the protests they are organizing jointly will proceed peacefully.
However, officials are preparing for unrest that could be sparked
by growing popular anger over the government's inability to pay
wages and pensions that are months overdue.
	   Police and interior troops have been put on alert throughout
Russia. More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior Ministry
troops will be deployed in Moscow alone, according to an Interior
Ministry official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   While unions are largely pursuing economic goals, the Communists
are using the protest to further weaken President Boris Yeltsin's
power.
	   Other Yeltsin opponents are also seizing the opportunity to
advance their own goals.
	   Gen. Alexander Lebed, governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province
in Central Siberia and a presidential hopeful, told reporters
Tuesday that Yeltsin's resignation is ``inevitable,'' the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``Any government must serve the people, and if it fails to
deliver it must go,'' Lebed was quoted as saying.
	   Strikes have been frequent in many industries. Earlier this
year, coal miners blockaded several key railroads, including the
Trans-Siberian, for several weeks. However, most protests have been
uncoordinated and have not caused major disruptions to the economy.

Australian air force in joint exercises in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Royal Australian Air Force will
take part in a bilateral training exercise in Malaysia's
mountainous terrain beginning this week.
	   A total of 10 RAAF FA-18 Hornets and five F-111s will fly to the
region for Exercise Churinga with the Malaysian air force at
Kuantan.
	   The exercise in low-level strike training in mountainous terrain
and a tropical environment would run Oct. 8-29, the air force said
in a statement.
	   The commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron, Wing Cmdr. Mark
Binskin, said the exercise would also provide combat training
against Malaysia's MiG-29 fighters.
	   ``Churinga gives us an opportunity to discuss tactics and
procedures with an important regional partner,'' he said.
	   ``Ground crew will also benefit from the deployment as they will
be exposed to operations on a different base. Logistics support
requirements will also be exercised.''

Australians front bribes inquiry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with officials saying players have appeared
at hearing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor
and batsman Mark Waugh gave evidence to Pakistan's inquiry into a
bribery and match-fixing scandal Tuesday.
	   Australian team manager Steve Bernard told Australian reporters
with the team in Pakistan that the players flew to Lahore in secret
to avoid a media and public crush at the hearing.
	   Waugh and two other players not on the current tour _ Shane
Warne and Tim May _ alleged that Pakistan test player Salim Malik
tried to bribe them to play badly on Australia's 1994 tour of
Pakistan. Taylor was captain during the tour.
	   Bernard admitted that the hearing happened earlier Tuesday,
before the 0830 GMT timetable announced by Australian Cricket Board
spokesman Patrick Keane, and was kept a secret by order of ACB
chief executive Malcolm Speed.
	   ``The situation developed late yesterday afternoon and it was
decided later in the day that Malcolm and the two Marks would go to
Lahore this morning to give evidence,'' Bernard said.
	   ``Because of security and other reasons that's why he didn't
pass that on, he wanted to keep it quiet. It was a case of not
having a huge crowd there when the boys went up. They wanted to do
it quietly and in their own time.''
	   Lahore High Court registrar Abdus Salam sent a letter last week
asking the Taylor and Waugh to appear before the commission headed
by Justice Malik Qayyam to explain the bribery allegations.
	   The Australian team finished the first test in Rawalpindi on
Monday and the pair traveled to Lahore on Tuesday.
	   Waugh, Warne and May wrote affidavits about the alleged bribery
attempt soon after the matter became public in 1995 but they had
refused to fly to Pakistan for hearings.
	   Warne, who is absent from the current tour because of injury,
said Monday that he did not expect he would go to Pakistan for
hearings.
	   ``We sent signed affidavits the last time and we got called
liars, so I'm not to rush back to testify when I've already said
that and I was called a liar by a judge,'' Warne said.
	   Taylor admitted the bribery scandal had affected both him and
Waugh during the first test, although Australia won by an innings
and 99 runs for its first victory in Pakistan in 39 years.
	   ``It would be nice to clear it up but I don't think we're ever
going to clear it up fully,'' Taylor said Monday. ``We'll try and
do the best we can.''

Malaysia's ruling party begins choosing new deputy prime minister
</HEADLINE>

meeting to begin about 1200 GMT, and last many hours &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of Malaysia's ruling
party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that
will test the country's legal system.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could
``drop dead'' at any time. But because of the large number of
candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays
National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly.
	   The party leaders, who have been conducting a national campaign
to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2,
will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has
banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.
	   The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital
Saturday, aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of
reform has the most appeal.
	   Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from his
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he
was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks
of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and
Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows
police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his
family and lawyers.
	   On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked by
the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent
weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government.
Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas
and water cannons, arresting more than 100 people.
	   ``They decided that the government should be brought down
through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama news agency quoted
Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He was
expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO
meeting.
	   After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face,
neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have
raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in
Malaysia next month.
	   The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit
to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, the
Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying.
Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital
checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charges of
abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. His
trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another
corruption count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in
prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus
whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act,
which allows jail without trial.
	   Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered
Anwar associates and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12
had been released.
	   The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top
candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision.
	   The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the
favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak.
	   Other top contenders included Mahathir's confidant Daim
Zainuddin, a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet
in June as ``special functions minister'' in charge of economic
recovery.
	   Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and
Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former finance minister, were also in
the running.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior American envoy engaged in
shuttle diplomacy Tuesday against the specter of impending NATO
airstrikes, but U.S. officials were pessimistic about averting
intervention in the face of continuing defiance by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, after meeting in Kosovo's capital
with diplomatic observers, said Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to ease their crackdown on separatists.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information is not good,'' he told reporters
before heading for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. He was
expected to return to Belgrade for another meeting with Milosevic
Tuesday night.
	   Despite the shuttle talks, the likelihood of Milosevic
concessions or a diplomatic agreement that would satisfy Western
leaders set on military intervention appeared limited.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence. Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2
million-strong Kosovo population, and most favor self-rule.
	   But Milosevic called the threats of aggression against
Yugoslavia ``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the
Albanian villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a
statement issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted several
hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the ``the
grave situation we are facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its
veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the
U.N. Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later
Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism
Milosevic would adhere to any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours. No final decision is expected until Thursday, when
ambassadors of the allied countries gather for a NATO Council
meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, one of the leaders Yeltsin
spoke with, agreed with Yeltsin that force would not work and would
entail ``serious international consequences,'' the Kremlin press
office said.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
Monday that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making
false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Yeltsin, said Milosevic's
compliance with U.N. demands ``must be verifiable, tangible and
irreversible,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White
House.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday
that Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution Sept. 23 demanded a
cease-fire.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.

Philippines, United States conclude second military agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine and U.S. officials have
concluded a new military agreement to cover visits by Filipino
soldiers to the United States, a senior official said Tuesday.
	   The accord complements an earlier pact, the Visiting Forces
Agreement, that would allow the resumption of large-scale joint
military exercises in the Philippines, Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said.
	   Siazon, who referred to the second agreement as VFA-2, said it
governs the entry of Filipino defense personnel and their
dependents into the United States and includes guidelines on
jurisdiction over Filipino soldiers who commit crimes while in U.S.
territory.
	   He said the agreement will be submitted to a Cabinet committee
in charge of security this week.
	   If it is approved by President Joseph Estrada, ``we'll be able
to sign the VFA-2 by next week,'' he said.
	   He added that only Israel, Spain and Singapore have similar
agreements with the United States.
	   He did not give other details of the new accord.
	   Siazon also said that on Monday, Estrada signed the ratification
instrument of the first Visiting Forces Agreement in preparation
for its submission to the Philippine Senate later this week for
approval.
	   The United States halted all major exercises in the Philippines
and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The VFA, signed in February this year by U.S. and Philippine
officials, would provide legal protections to U.S. soldiers while
on duty in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the country. It
generally gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers who
commit crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over
crimes committed while off duty.
	   They say it also would promote prostitution.

Kohl's party chooses new leader amid calls for renewal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Amid calls for revitalizing the party by
promoting younger members and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
defeated Christian Democrats closed ranks Tuesday behind a new
leader _ Kohl's own right-hand man.
	   The party's presiding council voted unanimously Monday night to
recommend as chairman Wolfgang Schaueble, Kohl's parliamentary
faction leader and the man he handpicked as his replacement.
	   The party board was expected to confirm the choice Tuesday, with
the final vote to be made at a party convention on Nov. 7.
	   The choice of Schaeuble was made despite criticism from some
party members that a bolder break was needed from Kohl, who led the
Christian Democrats in last week's election to its worst showing in
50 years.
	   The Christian Democratic Union has dominated German postwar
politics by attracting a wide range of conservative voters. But
young members in particular worry that the party has lost touch
with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and his
16 years as chancellor.
	   ``It's incomprehensible that Kohl again says what's coming,''
Christian Wulff, party chief in Lower Saxony state, was quoted as
saying Monday.
	   ``The party must immediately and without looking back separate
itself from Kohl,'' said another of the so-called ``Wild Youth,''
Kaja Schommer from Saxony state.
	   Rita Suessmuth, a Christian Democrat who will be losing her post
as parliamentary president, criticized the paucity of female names
being mentioned in discussions about renewing the party.
	   ``Women in the CDU are ready to help renew, but are not being
included,'' she told Stern magazine in an interview published
Tuesday.
	   Among the five candidates for four deputy chair positions to be
chosen at the convention, only one is a woman _ Kohl's outgoing
Environment Minister Angela Merkel.
	   And Suessmuth noted only 18 percent of CDU lawmakers in
parliament are women _ the lowest percentage of any party.
	   She called for replacing the outgoing party secretary, Peter
Hintze, with a woman. ``That's overdue and needs no additional
reason,'' she said.

China urges talks, not force to end Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the United States and Britain threatening
air strikes against Yugoslavia, China said Tuesday it opposed the
use of force or sanctions to end Belgrade's crackdown in rebellious
Kosovo province.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang urged the international
community to settle the dispute ``through political dialogue.''
	   ``China is not in favor of military action or the threat of
force. Military action or sanctions are not conducive to the
settlement of the question,'' Tang told reporters.
	   ``The Chinese side believes the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia should be respected,'' he added.
	   Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said the
situation in Kosovo _ where Yugoslavia has been trying to quash an
ethnic Albanian separatist movement _ has been improving.
	   Their comments underscore divisions among the veto-wielding
members of the U.N. Security Council. Russia declared Tuesday it
would use its veto to stop authorization of air strikes against the
Serbs, traditional allies.
	   Tang said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji conveyed Beijing's
opposition to the use of force during talks with visiting British
Prime Minister Tony Blair. In London, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said Monday a decision by NATO on the air strikes was imminent.

Italian premier prepares to resign if loses vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes
freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign
if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week.
	   ``We must respect the will of the voters. If we win the
confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the
baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day
French-Italian summit in Florence.
	   Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since
World War II, was threatened with collapse by the defection of its
Communist ally.
	   The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps
by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether the
2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls.
	   The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by
withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not
vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
	   But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.
Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party
president Monday, saying the party's hardline stance was ``wrong
and dangerous.''
	   Prodi was hoping to profit from the break.
	   Politicians have said Prodi is now four votes short of the 316
votes needed for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower
house. The government has a majority in the Senate even without
Refoundation's support.
	   After his meetings with French leaders, Prodi warned that the
political difficulties threaten the progress the country is making
in cleaning up its public finances.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for the
1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. It qualified
earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a
reason to stay together.
	   As it is, Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served
3{ years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.

	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
could face up to five years in prison.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against would be an attack on his right to free speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliament's are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''
	   Le Pen denied his comments had denied or minimized the Holocaust
and said his comments had been distorted by the Munich prosecutors.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting
a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs
3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.

Dissidents urge China to follow through on rights pact

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents, human rights campaigners and foreign
governments on Tuesday welcomed China's signing of a treaty
intended to safeguard human rights and urged Beijing to quickly
implement the accord.
	   ``Since China is currently in violation of almost every article
of the covenant, we hope its decision to sign indicates a change in
human rights practices,'' said Sidney Jones, executive director of
the Asian division of Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group.
	   ``The test will be in the implementation.''
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed
Monday by China at the United Nations, backs the right of
self-determination, prohibits torture and provides for freedom of
movement, religion, expression and association.
	   By signing, Beijing demonstrated a commitment to refrain from
actions that violate rights enshrined in the accord, the New
York-based group Human Rights in China said in a statement.
	   ``We hope that this will be followed quickly by concrete steps
to ratify and implement the covenant,'' the group said.
	   It urged the Chinese government to demonstrate its intention to
comply with the pact by releasing political prisoners and opening a
``public dialogue'' with all Chinese citizens on the issue of human
rights.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called China's
signature ``a significant reflection of its increasing commitment
to the promotion and protection of civil and political rights.'' He
called for rapid implementation of the covenant and a sister pact.
	   The two accords are seen as fundamental to protecting human
rights. China signed the other one _ the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ a year ago but hasn't
ratified it.
	   Neither treaty will take effect until ratified by the
legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying
some provisions.
	   Asked Tuesday when legislative approval might be forthcoming, a
Chinese government spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said ratification
``takes time.''
	   China's U.N. ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the government was
deliberating on ratifying the accords.
	   ``All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights,'' Qin said.
	   Hours before the treaty was signed, Beijing police hauled a
prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin
Yongmin had tried for the second time in a week to legally register
a human rights monitoring group.
	   ``The Chinese authorities continue to impose systematic
restrictions on the exercise of the rights and freedoms contained
in the covenant, despite rhetoric about their commitment to human
rights,'' the statement from Human Rights in China said.
	   Dissidents accused China of promising to sign the human rights
covenant to maximize its diplomatic advantage and silence critics
of its civil rights record.
	   ``Signing could still be the right move for the wrong reasons
but only if we see tangible human rights improvements.'' said Jones
of Human Rights Watch.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rolan Bykov, a Russian actor who made his mark in
films ranging from tragic epics to adventures for children, died at
age 68 Tuesday after what doctors described as a difficult illness,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   He made his film debut in 1955, and played roles in 80 films,
including Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublyov. He directed several
movies, including the film ``Scarecrow,'' which focused on
children's cruelty to one another.
	   Still, he was a strong advocate for children, and worked in his
last years to keep the Russian children's film industry alive.

Asian stock markets close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Tuesday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur surging 4 percent in a
technical rebound.
	   Dealers said the Malaysian market was also boosted by remarks by
Malaysian Special Functions Minister Daim Zainuddin, who said the
country's economy was on the right track following recent
government measures.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks
100 key stocks, rose 14.35 points, closing at 374.45.
	   In Tokyo, share prices rebounded on expectations of additional
government measures to stimulate the faltering economy.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, closing at 13,021.64.
	   On Monday, worries about the health of Japan's economy sent the
Nikkei down 275.57 points, or 2.08 percent, to 12,948.12, its
lowest close since 12,949.04 on Jan. 30, 1986.
	   In Taiwan, share prices closed lower as investors took their cue
from overnight losses on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 58.45 points, closing at 7,726.24.
	   The fall on Wall Street came as a 22-nation group meeting in
Washington issued recommendations for preventing future global
crises, but produced no concrete plan for dealing with the current
financial turmoil.
	   The Taiwan market's key Weighted Stock Price Index slid 85.32
points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,534.65.
	   In Japan, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will seek passage in
Parliament before the end of this year of a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 52
billion) tax cut and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion) in new
public spending, government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said.
	   Obuchi also called on his ministers to come up with more tax
cuts and spending proposals to boost the size of the stimulus
package, which he originally proposed in August just after taking
office.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen on worries about
how the United States can absorb worldwide financial turmoil.

 &UR; Tight security surrounds Australians appearance at bribes inquiry &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos LHR101-2 &QL; 
 &UR; By MUNIR AHMED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Inside a walled compound, patrolled by
armed guards, Australian batsman Mark Waugh told a judicial inquiry
Tuesday that Pakistani test player Salim Malik offered him
''thousands of dollars'' to throw a match.
	   According to the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Control Board,
Khalid Mahmood who attended the closed-door inquiry in the Punjab
provincial capital, Waugh said the offer was made in 1994 and was
turned down.
	   Waugh and Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor appeared before
a one-judge panel along with Malik, whose lawyer later told
reporters that his client would produce evidence to clear his name.
	   However Khwaja Zafar wouldn't elaborate on the evidence.
	   At the conclusion of the hearing's Mahmood told The Associated
Press that Taylor testified he was not directly approached by
Malik.
	   He said he only had information that he received from other
players, according to Mahmood.
	   However, Waugh testified that he was approached by Malik who
offered him ''thousands of dollars to lose the match,'' Mahmood
said quoting the Australian batsman.
	   As well Mahmood told the AP that Waugh said he discussed the
offer with his teammates but he did not report the incident while
in Pakistan.
	   ''He didn't have any good reason for why he waited so long to
report the incident,'' Mahmood said.
	   Neither Australian players were available for comment.
	   The testimony was given before Justice Malik Qayuum, the man
heading the inquiry into the bribery allegations.
	   The hearing was held inside the grand white marble residence of
Punjab Chief Justice Rashid Khan amid tight security. Outside the
large black rod iron gates, security guards with automatic weapons
patrolled. Plain clothes security also roamed the lush grounds.
	   Australian team manager Steve Bernard told Australian reporters
with the team in Pakistan that the players flew to Lahore in secret
to avoid a media and public crush at the hearing.
	   Waugh and two other players not on the current tour _ Shane
Warne and Tim May _ alleged that the former Pakistan captain Salim
Malik tried to bribe them to play badly on Australia's 1994 tour of
Pakistan. Taylor was captain during the tour.
	   ``The situation developed late yesterday afternoon and it was
decided later in the day that Malcolm and the two Marks would go to
Lahore this morning to give evidence,'' Bernard said.
	   ``Because of security and other reasons that's why he didn't
pass that on, he wanted to keep it quiet. It was a case of not
having a huge crowd there when the boys went up. They wanted to do
it quietly and in their own time.''
	   Lahore High Court registrar Abdus Salam sent a letter last week
asking the Taylor and Waugh to appear before the commission to
explain the bribery allegations.
	   The Australian team finished the first test in Rawalpindi on
Monday and the pair traveled to Lahore on Tuesday.
	   Waugh, Warne and May wrote affidavits about the alleged bribery
attempt soon after the matter became public in 1995 but they had
refused to fly to Pakistan for hearings.
	   Warne, who is absent from the current tour because of injury,
said Monday that he did not expect he would go to Pakistan for
hearings.
	   ``We sent signed affidavits the last time and we got called
liars, so I'm not to rush back to testify when I've already said
that and I was called a liar by a judge,'' Warne said.
	   Taylor admitted the bribery scandal had affected both him and
Waugh during the first test, although Australia won by an innings
and 99 runs for its first victory in Pakistan in 39 years.
	   ``It would be nice to clear it up but I don't think we're ever
going to clear it up fully,'' Taylor said Monday. ``We'll try and
do the best we can.''

France Telecom to link Minitel with Internet, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France Telecom has tapped IBM to develop software
that would allow the 6 million users of the Minitel system to
access the Internet, according to a report Tuesday in the Wall
Street Journal.
	   The Minitel, a screen and keyboard console linked to the
telephone, has since the early 1980s given users access to a
variety of information services in France, but its Internet access
has been limited to E-mail messages.
	   France Telecom could announce the project Tuesday, according to
the newspaper.
	   A spokesman for the Paris-based telecom operator declined to
comment on the report.

Mine discovered on boat carrying Ukrainian lawmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An anti-personnel mine was found on a boat
that later took Ukrainian lawmakers and Kiev city council members
on a cruise along the Dnieper River, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The mine was found hidden in a sofa as security agents checked
the boat just before Saturday's cruise, Oleksandr Zarubytsky, a
spokesman for Kiev's Interior Ministry, told the daily Kievskiye
Vedomosti.
	   ``The mine had a low explosive force but still could have
seriously injured or even caused mortal wounds to any person who
sat on the sofa,'' Zarubytsky said.
	   ``Judging by its location, it's hard to say that the mine was
meant to blow up a concrete passenger or boat crew member. It's
also difficult to say whether the goal was to kill, intimidate, or
ruin the cruise,'' he added.
	   The mine was rendered harmless, the report said. Police have
launched an investigation into the case, which they qualified as
illegal weapons possession.

Capello tipped to replace Giresse as PSG coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fabio Capello could replace Alain Giresse as coach
of French soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain, according to a press
report Tuesday.
	   Capello, the former coach at AC Milan and Real Madrid, was in
Paris on Monday and met PSG officials at a hotel close to the
headquarters of Canal Plus, the TV station that owns the club,
according to daily Le Parisien.
	   Giresse, a former French international, has had a disastrous run
since taking over PSG in May.
	   Despite attracting international stars like Nigeria's Jay-Jay
Okocha and Christian Woerns of Germany in pre-season, PSG has lost
four of eight league games this season, including defeats to
newly-promoted minnows Sochaux and Lorient.
	   PSG was also dumped out of the European Cup Winners' Cup by
Maccabi Haifa after two poor performances against the modest
Israeli outfit.

EU parliament votes to lift of Le Pen's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament voted Tuesday
to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Holocaust ``a
detail'' of history.
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity
came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right
leader told a news conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in
the history of the Second World War.''
	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
could face up to five years in prison.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against him would be an attack on his right to free
speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliament's are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''
	   Le Pen said his comments had not denied or minimized the
Holocaust and had been distorted by the Munich prosecutors. ``If
these comments have been interpreted in a way that made sincere
people suffer, I'm sorry,'' he said.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting
a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs
3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.

Radio: Uganda deploys troops along Sudanese border after bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army has deployed troops to two
northwestern Uganda towns near the border with Sudan after they
were bombed by a Sudanese aircraft, a radio station said Tuesday.
	   The troops were deployed to Adjumani and Pakole, about 350
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Kampala, where the bombing
Saturday injured six people, the private Central Broadcasting
Service said.
	   ``The army has been deployed in Adjumani and is capable of
destroying Sudanese planes,'' the radio quoted regional commander,
Col. Julius Oketa, as saying. ``There should be no fear.''
	   The report could not be independently verified, and the military
spokesman could not be reached for comment. The radio did not say
how many troops had been deployed.
	   The aircraft dropped six bombs on Pakole and four on Adjumani,
workers said Monday.
	   The radio said the bombs landed near the Adjumani offices of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the U.N. World Food Program
and in the compound of a dlrs 9 million government hospital
recently opened by President Yoweri Museveni.
	   About 158,756 refugees from Sudan's 15-year civil war live in
more than two dozen settlements in the area.
	   Uganda has protested the bombing, but the Sudanese government
denies carrying out any raid there.
	   Sudan has repeatedly charged that both Uganda and Eritrea are
backing the latest offensive by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army in southern Sudan.
	   Both countries have denied the allegations.
	   The Sudanese media said that an estimated 600 Eritreans are
fighting in Sudan. It said among those killed was an Eritrean
officer, identified as Omar Tashombi, who commanded artillery
units.
	   Sudanese rebels, drawing support from Christians and followers
of tribal religions, have been waging a military campaign against
the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 1983 for more autonomy
for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The defense ministers of Argentina and
Britain inspected Tuesday soldiers of a special unit of the U.N.
force monitoring the buffer zone on war-divided Cyprus.
	   The ministers, George Robertson of Britain and Jorge Dominguez
of Argentina, observed a simulated exercise in which the force
rescued wounded soldiers from a vehicle wrecked by a land mine.
	   The wounded received first aid and were evacuated by a U.N.
helicopter during the training exercise.
	   ``They work together like this all the time,'' said Maj. Peter
Hardesty, a British officer commanding the force.
	   Britain and Argentina fought a war in 1982 for possession of the
Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.
	   The Mobile Force Reserve, part of the U.N. peacekeeping
operation in Cyprus, is made up of 39 soldiers from Argentina, 29
from Britain, 24 from the Netherlands, 10 from Austria and nine
from Hungary. It is first to respond to trouble along the
180-kilometer (110-mile) U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.
	   The island has been split into Greek and Turkish communities
since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup
by ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.
	   Since the U.N. force was deployed, 168 military and civilian
police personnel on the force have died.

ASEAN trade ministers to discuss social cost of financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian trade ministers
meeting this week are expected to discuss the social cost of Asia's
financial crisis, including the impact of unrestricted movements of
capital, an official said Tuesday.
	   ``We have to consider the effects of capital movements on the
lives of the people and do whatever it takes to alleviate the
suffering,'' said Rodolfo Severino, secretary-general of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   He said ``fundamental changes'' may be required to lessen the
social impact of the 15-month-old financial crisis in ASEAN's nine
member countries.
	   In two days of meetings, which begin Wednesday, the trade
ministers also plan to sign an agreement opening the region to
freer investment and speed up their plans for free trade.
	   The agreement will create an ASEAN Investment Area that will
remove barriers to investment from ASEAN countries by the year 2010
and for non-ASEAN countries by 2020.
	   With the exception of Singapore and Brunei, ASEAN's members are
developing economies, with Indonesia and Thailand having been
particularly hard hit by the crisis. ASEAN also includes the
Philippines, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia.
	   Malaysia's recent implementation of capital controls to
stabilize its exchange rate raised market fears that some other
Asian countries might adopt similar measures.
	   The Philippines, for one, has said it opposes any form of
controls on the convertibility of the peso.
	   ``The Philippines definitely will not do this. ... We will not
opt for that route,'' said Trade Secretary Jose Pardo.
	   Pardo noted that currency controls in the Philippines in the
past spawned corruption and were administratively unworkable.
Exchange-rate controls were lifted by former President Fidel Ramos.
	   However, Severino has said that some aspects of the movement of
capital may have to be managed because ``one cannot just invoke
market prices once people are going hungry and once children have
stopped going to school.''
	   Indonesia, meanwhile, has said it plans to push for the greater
use of regional currencies for trade within ASEAN to lessen the
group's reliance on the U.S. dollar.
	   Several of ASEAN's larger members say they support the idea,
which is not a form of capital or exchange-rate control.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Following difficult talks with Milosevic late Monday, Richard
Holbrooke met here in the Kosovo capital with ethnic Albanian
political leaders, who have refused to negotiate with Milosevic
until he halts the seven-month crackdown which has killed hundreds
and driven more than a quarter million people from their homes.
	   Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bring us
information, and the information is not good,'' he told reporters
before heading into talks with ethnic Albanian political leader
Ibrahim Rugova, who says NATO airstrikes would be welcome.
	   Holbrooke was expected to return to Belgrade for another meeting
with Milosevic Tuesday night.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic in
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted several
hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the ``the
grave situation we are facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending. On
Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its
veto to stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the
U.N. Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later
Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia. But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with
Milosevic, and Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere to
any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   The KLA said in a statement published Tuesday in the ethnic
Albanian daily Koha Ditore that it was time for a military solution
to the Kosovo crisis, not a peaceful one. It welcomed the ``new,
more serious attitude by the international community'' on Kosovo.

allegedly failed to pay taxes in 19th graf &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court
acquitted former first lady Imelda Marcos of corruption Tuesday,
saving her from a 12-year prison term.
	   In an 8-5 vote, with one judge abstaining, the court overturned
the only verdict so far in which the widow of former President
Ferdinand Marcos had been found guilty of graft during her late
husband's strong-arm rule.
	   An aide said Mrs. Marcos, who has been free on bail, received a
telephone call informing her of her acquittal.
	   ``She just looked up after listening to the caller and handed
the phone to a member of her staff and said, `Thank you Lord,'''
the aide said.
	   Mrs. Marcos, 69, had been in seclusion for several days, praying
for an acquittal, the aide said.
	   Mrs. Marcos gained notoriety for an extensive shoe collection
and lavish lifestyle at a time when most Filipinos were mired in
poverty.
	   She and her late husband were accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his 20-year presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   A special anti-graft court had found Mrs. Marcos guilty on two
corruption charges in 1993.
	   In January of this year, a Supreme Court panel acquitted her on
one charge but upheld her conviction on the second charge, which
carried a maximum prison term of 12 years. She was also fined 189
million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   The panel, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos to appeal the ruling one
final time to the entire Supreme Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans had
been accused of entering into five unfavorable contracts involving
a government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Prosecutors said they awarded leases on property owned by the
rail line to the hospital foundation at excessively low rates. Dans
had been acquitted earlier.
	   It its ruling, the Supreme Court said Mrs. Marcos did not
personally sign the leases and it was not proven that the prices
were ``grossly and manifestly disadvantageous'' to the government
as prosecutors had argued.
	   The court said the anti-graft court also violated rules of due
process in reaching its verdict, such as holding unscheduled and
informal discussions on the case outside its offices, allowing a
non-member of the court division to participate, and excluding a
member from the deliberations.
	   Mrs. Marcos' son, Ferdinand ``Bongbong'' Marcos Jr., said his
mother was elated.
	   ``People have berated her, people have ridiculed her, and in the
end this decision has proven that she was right,'' he said. ``She
is in exceedingly high spirits.''
	   President Joseph Estrada said the decision would not affect
government efforts to recover Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth. He
said talks have resumed with the Marcos family on a possible
division of the money between them and the government.
	   Mrs. Marcos still faces numerous other criminal and civil cases
related to her husband's rule.
	   She also faces a meeting Thursday with tax officials at the U.S.
Embassy to discuss charges she failed to pay more than dlrs 5
million in U.S. income taxes between 1986 and 1991, when the
Marcoses lived in exile in Hawaii.
	   In a letter to Mrs. Marcos obtained by The Associated Press, the
Internal Revenue Service said she also failed to file income tax
returns from 1992 to 1997.
	   It warned that a levy could be placed on her bank accounts and
other properties might be seized if she failed to attend the
meeting.

Afghan opium production drops thanks to bad weather
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Afghanistan's opium poppy farmers are
expected to harvest 25 percent less of the illicit crop this year
than last, thanks mostly to bad weather, the U.N. drug control
agency said Tuesday.
	   In a report, the U.N. Drug Control Program, based here,
estimated Afghanistan's 1998 production would reach about 2,100
metric tons, or about 25 percent below the 1997 yield of 2,800
metric tons.
	   ``An unusually long 1998 winter season, heavy and continuous
rains and hail storms in southern Afghanistan and unseasonal rains
in northern Afghanistan are all factors which adversely affected
the opium yield,'' the report said.
	   Despite the projected decline, the U.N. Drug Control Program
said opium poppy cultivation spread for the first time to two new
Afghan provinces -- Loghar and Laghman -- as well as several new
districts.
	   That raises concern that -- barring an effective government
crackdown -- next year's crop could increase significantly if the
weather improves.
	   ``I appeal to all parties in Afghanistan to exert their best
efforts in order to dissuade the farmers from planting opium poppy
in the coming growing season, especially in new areas,'' the head
of the drug control agency, Pino Arlacchi, said.
	   Arlacchi warned that if his appeal goes unheeded, he will ask
U.N. member states to tighten controls on Afghanistan's land
borders.
	   Afghanistan is a leading source of opium poppies, used in the
production of heroin. The United Nations estimates that heroin of
Afghan origin accounts for 80 percent of the European market and 20
percent of the American.
	   More than 90 percent of the illicit crop is grown in areas of
Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, the hardline Islamic
movement which holds the capital Kabul and most of the mountainous
Central Asian country.
	   The Taliban has agreed to work with the United Nations to curb
production and encourage farmers to grow alternate crops. But U.N.
officials say the Taliban has been dragging its heels on fulfilling
the promise to pressure the United Nations into awarding it
Afghanistan's seat in the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The seat remains in the hands of the previous government pending
a final decision. As a result, the former leadership will still be
entitled to attend U.N. conferences as the legitimate government of
Afghanistan.

U.N. refugee agency concerned about new violence in Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Renewed violence by Croats against Bosnian Muslims
returning to their homes in Bosnia is a setback for the returns
process, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.
	   UNHCR is increasingly concerned by several serious incidents in
early October in which one Muslim returnee was killed, three others
were injured and extensive damage was caused to homes, UNHCR
spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   In the first incident on October 2 in the southern Bosnian
village of Tasovcici, an unidentified attacker threw a hand grenade
out of a passing car. The grenade rolled under a car parked in
front of a Muslim-owned house and exploded.
	   A group of seven Muslims and one Croat were standing in front of
the house. One was killed and three others injured.
	   In the second incident on October 3, a house occupied by six
Bosnian Muslims in another village in the area was attacked by a
rocket propelled grenade, Janowski said. No-one was injured but the
grenade caused a lot of damage.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into
the Serb republic and the joint Muslim-Croat federation. Clashes
between the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation
since its founding.
	   Incidents have increased in the region since Muslim refugees
began returning to the homes they were forced to flee during
fighting between Muslims and Croats in 1993.
	   ``The atmosphere there is dense with hostility,'' Janowski said.
``Croats have a very bad reputation as far as welcoming returning
minorities is concerned. They have been attacking returnees on a
regular basis.
	   ``It is really sad to report that people returning to their
homes are still being killed in attacks nearly three years after
the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed.''

Church: In canonizing one Holocaust victim, all 6 million murdered
</HEADLINE>
Jews honored &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Edith Stein, the Orthodox Jew-turned-Catholic nun
whom Pope John Paul II is elevating to sainthood, once offered her
life in atonement for the sins of her ``unbelieving'' people.
	   Today, those words of Stein, who was killed in the Auschwitz
death camp, make many Catholics as uncomfortable as they make Jews
angry.
	   Church officials avoid mentioning them as they prepare for the
Oct. 11 canonization of Stein _ a woman who embodies the conflicts
and contradictions facing John Paul's papacy as it tries to come to
terms with the Holocaust, and with Jews.
	   A German-born convert, Stein appealed to Pope Pius XII in 1933
to speak out against the Nazis. Jewish groups have since condemned
Pius for not saying more as the Holocaust began.
	   But despite Stein's courage in speaking out, her spiritual last
will and testament has dominated debate over her proposed
sainthood. In the document, required of Carmelite nuns, she offered
her life in atonement to God for ``the sins of the unbelieving
people, so the Lord will be accepted by his own.''
	   In Rome, posters heralding the upcoming ceremony in St. Peter's
Basilica are posted in scattered churches. The woman in them stares
out of a sepia photo, her eyes gleaming, intelligent, unreadable.
	   ``Edith Stein,'' the lettering says of the oval image of a face
under a nun's wimple.
	   The name she chose in the church _ ``Teresa, Blessed of the
Cross'' _ appears almost as an afterthought.
	   Jewish leaders loudly protested Stein's 1987 beatification,
saying her martyrdom was not the Catholic church's to claim. Her
canonization is approaching far more quietly.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center reserved its public protests for
this month's scheduled beatification of Alojzije Stepinac, a
Croatian cardinal accused by some of collaboration with a
Nazi-backed government.
	   ``For us, these two steps taken by the Vatican should give us
cause to reflect on the damage inflicted upon us by the two major
scourges of the 20th century in Jewish terms: anti-Semitism and
assimilation,'' said Ephraim Zuroff of the Wiesenthal center's
office in Israel.
	   ``And it's unfortunate that people whose lives represented those
two phenomena are being canonized by the Catholic church,'' Zuroff
said.
	   Stein is at least the fifth Holocaust figure John Paul has
proposed for canonization, not counting Pius, also proposed for
veneration. John Paul, who has named more saints than any other
pope, believes strongly in the procedure's power to set examples.
	   ``We see her canonization as a unique opportunity for Jews and
Catholics and for reflection and reconciliation,'' said the Rev.
Remi Hoeckman, secretary of the Vatican's commission for relations
with Jews.
	   ``It in no way lessens, but in reality strengthens, our need to
honor the 6 million Jews who died in the Shoah,'' Hoeckman said.
	   Born on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Stein before her
conversion acquired a wide reputation in the phenomenology school
of philosophy that is said to be important to the current pope. Her
teacher, who also taught Martin Heidegger, said she was the best
doctoral student he ever had.
	   Stein was an atheist before her 1922 conversion. She credited
Catholicism with leading her back to an appreciation of Judaism.
	   ``Kristallnacht,'' the Nazis' three-day attack on Jews and
Jewish institutions in November 1938, made clear the danger she
faced in Germany. She fled to Holland taking along her sister,
Rosa, who also had converted.
	   When the 1942 order came sending Jewish converts in Holland to
Auschwitz, Stein took her sister by the hand.
	   ``Come, Rosa. We're going for our people.''
	   In canonizing her, the church had to waive the requirement for
relics of her body. They were all destroyed in the crematorium at
Auschwitz. Also waived was the usual testimony on whether she kept
her faith until the moment of death. Most potential witnesses met
the same fate as her.
	   But in one of the few accounts of Stein's last days, after she
was taken to the camps on Aug. 7, 1942, testimony quotes a camp
guard as putting a crucial question to Stein: What faith was she.
	   Catholic, she said.
	   The Nazi guard chose otherwise: ``You damn Jew, stand there,''
he said.

Indonesian police arrest alleged rebel leader in western New
</HEADLINE>
Guinea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police have arrested a senior leader
of a rebel group in the Indonesian-controlled western part of New
Guinea, the official Antara news agency reported Tuesday.
	   It said Theys H. Eluay was arrested Tuesday at his home in
Sentani, a town south of Irian Jaya's provincial capital, Jayapura.
	   Antara quoted Brig. Gen. Hotman Siagian, chief of the local
police, as saying Theys was ``strongly suspected'' of conducting
criminal acts against the state.
	   Police have also detained five other Irianese linked to Theys.
	   The five are accused of planning a pro-independence protest in
Jayapura, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   The arrests followed the declaration of a cease-fire between the
Indonesian military and the rebel Free Papua Movement, or OPM.
	   Under the Sept. 30 truce, the two sides agreed to stop fighting
to enable negotiations to pave the way for possible peace talks.
	   Two days later, Gen. Wiranto, commander of Indonesia's armed
forces, ordered the lifting of ``military operation status'' for
the region.
	   Indonesia took over the former Dutch colony that covers the
western portion of New Guinea Island in 1963 and named it Irian
Jaya. The annexation was formalized through the United Nations in
1969.
	   In July, a series of pro-independence protests flared up in the
remote province. At least two protesters and one policeman were
killed.

British official: Treat child prostitutes as victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain will treat child prostitutes as
victims of crimes rather than offenders under a new government
plan, an official said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) on child sexual
exploitation, Home Office Minister Alun Michael said the government
also has extended conspiracy laws to allow prosecution of people
who conspire in Britain to make, sell or possess child pornography
abroad.
	   Michael's announcements came on the first day of the meeting
attended by government officials and child welfare experts from 25
countries in Europe and Asia.
	   ``It is for governments to take the lead and set the agenda for
action,'' he said. ``That is why the United Kingdom will have a
national plan to combat this problem and will implement a new
approach to dealing with child prostitutes. We will also take a
fresh look at the links between offenses abroad and offending in
the UK as part of the major review of sexual offenses on which we
embark in July.''
	   The new guidelines on treatment of child prostitutes are being
prepared for police forces and will rely on cooperation between
numerous agencies, Michael said.
	   The three-day summit is targeting child prostitution and child
pornography, and the further development of a network among member
countries so ideas and solutions can be shared.
	   An estimated one million children worldwide are lured or forced
into the sex market every year, experts say. The problem is
especially serious in Asia, where pedophiles from Europe often
travel to take advantage of the many street children there.

U.N. refugee agency concerned about new violence in Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Renewed violence by Croats against Bosnian Muslims
returning to their homes in Bosnia has set back the returns
process, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday.
	   UNHCR has become concerned by several serious incidents in early
October in which one Muslim returnee was killed, three others were
injured and extensive damage was caused to homes, UNHCR spokesman
Kris Janowski said.
	   In the first incident Oct. 2, in the southern Bosnian village of
Tasovcici, an unidentified attacker threw a hand grenade out of a
passing car. The grenade rolled under a car parked in front of a
Muslim-owned house and exploded.
	   A group of seven Muslims and one Croat were standing in front of
the house. One was killed and three others injured.
	   In the second incident Oct. 3, a house occupied by six Bosnian
Muslims in another village was attacked by a rocket propelled
grenade, Janowski said. No-one was injured but the grenade caused a
lot of damage.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into
the Serb republic and the joint Muslim-Croat federation. Clashes
between the Muslims and the Croats have plagued the federation
since its founding.
	   Incidents have increased in the region since Muslim refugees
began returning to the homes they were forced to flee during
fighting between Muslims and Croats in 1993.
	   ``The atmosphere there is dense with hostility,'' Janowski said.
``Croats have a very bad reputation as far as welcoming returning
minorities is concerned. They have been attacking returnees on a
regular basis.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A tour bus carrying holiday travelers plunged
into a ravine in southwest China, killing 18 people and injuring
63, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday in Guizhou province, during a long
holiday weekend following China's National Day on Thursday.
	   The bus, carrying 81 people from southern Guangdong province,
collided head-on with another vehicle and fell into the 60-meter-
(200-foot-) deep gully, Xinhua said.
	   Seventeen people were killed instantly and another person died
later. All the remaining passengers were injured. The report made
no mention of casualties in the other vehicle.

Romania government to donate Ceausescu memorabilia to leper colony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's government will donate
pyjamas, fashion accessories and fine suits of former Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to a rural leper colony, a government
official said Tuesday.
	   Mihai Nica, the official, said 35 victims of leprosy will also
receive by the end of the week fur hats, purses and pullovers that
belonged to Ceausescu and his wife Elena , who were executed in
December 1989 after a bloody revolution toppled the communists from
power.
	   ``The clothes are in good condition because they were worn just
once or twice,'' Nica said.
	   The 35 lepers living permanently in Tichilesti village are
mostly over 60 years and the state gives each of them only 30,000
lei (almost dlrs 3 a day) for food.
	   ``Our lepers will be happy to receive the clothes especially as
cold winter comes,'' said by telephone Nicoleta Anghelache, an
official of Tichilesti hospital, 275 kilometers (172 miles)
southeast of Bucharest.
	   Other less valuable items will be given to old people's homes
and asylums. The government also plans to auction off the most
valuable items, including exotic furs, art objects and a silver
medallion with twin portraits of Elena Ceausescu and Imelda Marcos,
the widow of former Filippino leader Ferdinand Marcos.
	   In 1992, the value of these valuable items was estimated at 300
million lei (dlrs 1.3 million s at the time), although the
government said that, due to a lack of evaluation specialists, the
goods were undervalued.
	   Thousands of other Ceausescu memorabilia, including hunting
trophies, books and art objects are on display in Romanian museums.

Police say Bali's tourists will be safe during opposition meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Foreign tourists vacationing on the
Indonesian island of Bali will be safe when thousands of supporters
of a prominent opposition figure meet there this week, police said
Tuesday.
	   Thousands of supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, are expected to attend
the congress of her faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party,
PDI, from Thursday to Saturday.
	   Many are coming from the neighboring main island of Java, which
was badly hit by riots in May and subsequent unrest.
	   The official Antara news agency said about 3,000 police and
soldiers, along with 1,000 civilian security guards, will be
deployed on the ``Island of the Gods,'' a major source of foreign
exchange for crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   ``We will guarantee peace and security for all tourists as well
as Balinese people and congress participants,'' said police Maj.
Suyanto.
	   Earlier, some government officials said they feared that the
potential for violence might harm Bali's image as a safe tourist
destination.

Iraqi opposition leader dismisses U.S. attempts to oust Saddam

 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Iraq-Unrest. &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top Iraqi opposition leader declared
Tuesday that U.S. efforts to help Iraqi dissidents overthrow
President Saddam Hussein were not ``sufficiently serious.''
	   His remarks came a day after the U.S. House of Representatives
voted to direct the Pentagon to channel up to dlrs 97 million in
military aid to Iraqi opposition groups trying to topple Saddam.
	   Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, however, refused to commit
his group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
to any U.S.-backed plans to oust the Iraqi leader.
	   ``We have always said that the American efforts do not pay
attention seriously to the sufferings of the Iraqi people,''
al-Hakim told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
the group's headquarters in Tehran, Iran.
	   ``Therefore, we do not believe they are sufficiently serious,
and we do not participate in them,'' he said.
	   The bill passed by 360-38 seeks to ``remove the regime headed by
Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a
democratic regime'' in its place, without use of U.S. armed forces.
The bill also would give dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, which
was set up under earlier legislation.
	   The bill did not specify which groups would receive aid, but
al-Hakim's rejection could pose an obstacle to U.S. attempts to
strengthen the fractured Iraqi opposition.
	   Al-Hakim's council is an umbrella organization for several
Shiite groups which have been fighting a guerrilla war against
government troops in southern Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, al-Hakim's group and another opposition movement,
the Iraqi Communist Party, reported that Iraqi forces had widened a
campaign against Shiite rebel bases in southern Iraq.
	   In a statement, the council said soldiers backed by tanks and
artillery attacked several villages in marshes near Nasiriya, 360
kilometers (225 miles) south of Baghdad.
	   The raids were part of a campaign that began last week when
troops launched an attack against rebel positions in areas between
Nasiriya and Al-Amara, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Communist Party reported intensive fighting in the region
this week between rebels and army deserters and army units
supported by the ruling Baath Party militia.
	   It said dozens of troops were killed or wounded and others were
taken prisoner. It did not give figures for opposition casualties.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate word from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   Tens of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge in the
marshes after soldiers crushed a Shiite rebellion in southern Iraq
following Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraqi troops have mounted numerous campaigns against the Shiites
hiding in the marshes.
	   Offices of the Baath Party in Baghdad, Basra, Amara, Diwanya and
Kerbala were also bombed, the Communist Party said, without giving
details.

Carling testimonial canceled after bad press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A testimonial match for Will Carling was canceled
Tuesday when the promoter decided the former England rugby union
captain's messy love life had attracted too much bad press.
	   Promoter Mike Burton said the ``good will'' was gone and the
public wouldn't support the match despite Carling's outstanding
reputation as a rugby player.
	   The testimonial game between a Fiji and a collection of
international stars was scheduled for Wembley stadium Dec. 4.
	   The match was thrown into jeopardy in late September when
Carling, whose first marriage broke down in 1996 when he reportedly
had a romantic relationship with the late Princess Diana, dumped
his latest girlfriend for the wife of a former teammate.
	   The 32-year-old international's love life was splashed across
the front pages of British tabloids after he released a statement
saying he had split with girlfriend, Ali Cockayne. The couple have
an 11-month-old son, Henry.
	   A capacity crowd at Wembley was expected to generate more than 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.68 million), with Carling netting 500,000
pounds (dlrs 840,000).
	   Burton said he took no stance on Carling's private life but he
sensed an ``underlying feeling of hostility towards the match.''
	   ``We entered into negotiations for this match when Will's
standing was high and we intended to capitalize on that,'' Burton
said.
	   But he said his position as promoter had become untenable.
	   ``We found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to put a
team on the field,'' Burton told BBC radio Tuesday.
	   ``Calling it off was the last thing I wanted to do but I was
left no alternative,'' he said.
	   Cockayne, 30, is the sister-in-law of former England soccer
captain Gary Lineker. She was in the middle of wedding preparations
when Carling announced the split.
	   Carling has reportedly started a relationship with Lisa Cooke,
the estranged wife of former England rugby union international
David Cooke. She had been helping to organize testimonial events
for Carling.

Malaysia's ruling party begins choosing new deputy prime minister

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of Malaysia's ruling
party were to meet Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in
a case that will test the country's legal system.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could
``drop dead'' at any time. But because of the large number of
candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays
National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly.
	   The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top
candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision.
	   The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the
favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak, son of a former Malaysian prime minister,
Abdul Razak Hussein.
	   Badawi, a Mahathir loyalist, was among the first to criticize
Anwar's reform movement, calling it an effort to garner public
sympathy from the streets.
	   The party leaders, who have been conducting a national campaign
to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2,
will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has
banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.
	   The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital
Saturday, aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of
reform has the most appeal.
	   Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from his
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he
was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks
of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and
Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows
police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his
family and lawyers.
	   On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked by
the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent
weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government.
Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas
and water cannons, arresting more than 100 people.
	   ``They decided that the government should be brought down
through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama news agency quoted
Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He was
expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO
meeting.
	   After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face,
neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have
raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in
Malaysia next month.
	   The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit
to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, the
Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying.
Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital
checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charges of
abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. His
trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another
corruption count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in
prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus
whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act,
which allows jail without trial.
	   Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered
Anwar associates and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12
had been released.

Unpaid Ukrainian pensioners receive medicines instead of pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Retirees in southern Ukraine can now obtain
medicines as a substitute for their long-overdue pensions, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The program introduced in the Mykolaiv region allows pensioners
to receive medicines worth the total of their accumulated back
pensions plus two future monthly pensions, the daily Fakty
reported.
	   Pharmacies can count their contributions under the program as
part of their required payments to the state Pension Fund, the
newspaper said.
	   The plan is the latest barter scheme devised by local
authorities to combat the state's mounting debt to millions of
Ukrainian pensioners.
	   Last month, authorities in the eastern Kharkiv region organized
a fair where local pensioners could obtain food as compensation for
the pensions they had been owed.
	   The central government recently launched a crackdown against
thousands of enterprises owing payments to the Pension Fund, but it
has done little to bring down their overall debt, which stood at 3
billion hryvna (dlrs 880 million) last month.
	   That debt has been steadily increasing for years as Ukraine has
failed to implement reforms needed to increase budget revenues and
allow financing of social programs.

Army to dismantle parts of tomb of Hebron mosque massacre gunman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army has decided to dismantle parts of the
tomb of the Hebron mosque massacre gunman in an effort to
discourage Jewish extremists from making pilgrimages to the site, a
lawyer in the case said Tuesday.
	   The gunman, New York-born Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on
Muslim worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West Bank
town of Hebron in February 1994, killing 29 people before being
bludgeoned to death by survivors.
	   Over the years, Goldstein's grave in a small park in the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, adjacent to Hebron, has been turned into
a shrine that has drawn many ultranationalist Jews.
	   The army informed Goldstein's family in a letter Sunday that
parts of the shrine would be removed, said the family's lawyer,
Naftali Werzberger.
	   The engraving on the tombstone, which refers to Goldstein as
``holy'' and a ``martyr,'' is to be altered, Werzberger said. The
two words are to be removed.
	   On Tuesday, the Goldstein family petitioned the Supreme Court to
prevent any changes at the tomb, which includes elaborate lighting,
benches, a glass cabinet for prayer books, a limestone plaza and
rose bushes.
	   In the petition, the Goldsteins said the army had granted all
the necessary licenses for erecting the shrine and acted under
political pressure in reversing its position now.
	   Werzberger said tampering with the grave site would incite angry
reactions from Goldstein's supporters.

Police to make sure asylum seekers stay in the country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Police will move all asylum
seekers who entered the country illegally to refugee camps to
prevent them from proceeding further to the west, the news agency
CTK reported Tuesday.
	   It quoted police President Jiri Kolar as saying that as many as
95 percent of those who ask for political asylum when caught at the
border with Slovakia do not intend to stay in the Czech Republic.
	   He said that refugees usually ask for asylum when caught but
never show up in the refugee camps where they should await final
decision on their request.
	   ``We will drive foreigners to the camps by buses and make sure
they really mean their requests for asylum,'' Kolar told CTK. ``If
they refuse (to stay), we'll take them back to Slovakia.''
	   Kolar said that police have detained more than 26,000 illegal
immigrants this year, many of them coming from Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslav nationals need a visa to enter the Czech Republic. But
when they are caught inside the country and ask for political
asylum, they cannot be sent back because their lives there could be
in jeopardy.

British official: Treat child prostitutes as victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to include cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police in Britain will treat child prostitutes as
victims of crimes rather than offenders under a new government
plan, an official said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) on child sexual
exploitation, Home Office Minister Alun Michael said the government
also has extended conspiracy laws to allow prosecution of people
who conspire in Britain to make, sell or possess child pornography
abroad.
	   Michael's announcements came on the first day of the meeting
attended by government officials and child welfare experts from 25
countries in Europe and Asia.
	   ``It is for governments to take the lead and set the agenda for
action,'' he said. ``That is why the United Kingdom will have a
national plan to combat this problem and will implement a new
approach to dealing with child prostitutes. We will also take a
fresh look at the links between offenses abroad and offending in
the UK as part of the major review of sexual offenses on which we
embark in July.''
	   The new guidelines on treatment of child prostitutes are being
prepared for police forces and will rely on cooperation between
numerous agencies, Michael said.
	   The three-day summit is targeting child prostitution and child
pornography, and the further development of a network among member
countries so ideas and solutions can be shared.
	   An estimated one million children worldwide are lured or forced
into the sex market every year, experts say. The problem is
especially serious in Asia, where pedophiles from Europe often
travel to take advantage of the many street children there.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
Following difficult talks with Milosevic late Monday, Richard
Holbrooke met here in the Kosovo capital with ethnic Albanian
political leaders, who have refused to negotiate with Milosevic
until he halts the seven-month crackdown which has killed hundreds
and driven more than a quarter million people from their homes.
Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict. Holbrooke was
expected to meet with Milosevic again Tuesday night. At the United
Nations, the Security Council was expected Tuesday to take up
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report on Kosovo, which says Serb
forces may have ignored a U.N. resolution demanding a cease-fire in
Kosovo and the withdrawal of Yugoslav police units.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO, UN-KOSOVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ On the eve of a nationwide labor protest, Russia's
government warned hard-line opposition leaders Tuesday that they
could face criminal charges for inciting armed revolt. Russian
labor unions predict that up to 28 million people will take part in
strikes, rallies and demonstrations throughout Russia on Wednesday.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that up to 40 million
will show, although most observers expect a much smaller turnout. A
similar protest last year drew an estimated 2 million people in
hundreds of demonstrations across Russia. Seeking to cool the most
die-hard opposition factions, Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov
warned that criminal proceedings could be launched against retired
Gen. Albert Makashov, a Communist member of parliament, and other
opposition leaders. Their weekend calls for the government's ouster
by force are punishable by law, Krasheninnikov told a news
conference Tuesday. However, Makashov enjoys immunity from
prosecution as a lawmaker, and the Communists, who dominate the
parliament's lower house, could easily block any attempt to lift
his immunity. (RUSSIA-PROTEST)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Setting the stage for a historic journey into
presidential impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee voted along
hardened partisan lines to investigate whether President Bill
Clinton should be removed from office. The 21-16 vote Monday night
sent a Republican resolution for an open-ended inquiry to the full
House, which is virtually certain later this week to approve only
the third presidential impeachment investigation in the nation's
history. Democratic alternatives would have limited the time and
scope of any impeachment probe. However, as House Democrats discuss
the pending floor vote at a party caucus Tuesday, mid-term
elections less than a month away may dictate lawmakers' votes.
Republicans have predicted they'll get significant Democratic
backing in the full House, which has dozens of conservative
Democrats not found on the committee. A vote on approving the
impeachment investigation is likely Thursday or Friday.
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the admonition that ``time is running
out,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is holding
back-to-back meetings Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Her aim is to
narrow differences on a West Bank accord before President Bill
Clinton hosts a summit with the two Mideast leaders later in the
month. ``There is a sense of urgency,'' Albright said on her way to
Jerusalem Monday from Washington for two days of talks. ``The
United States can do a great deal, but the leaders have to be
willing to make decisions,'' Albright said. Netanyahu said there
would be no agreement for an Israeli pullback unless the
Palestinian Authority carried out its commitment to clamp down on
Islamic militants opposed to the peace process. And Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat accused the Clinton administration of
allowing Israel to drag its feet on living up to past accords. If
Albright is unable to bridge the differences, Clinton could come up
short in his bid to play peacemaker in the Middle East as he
successfully did in Northern Ireland. (ALBRIGHT-MIDEAST)
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were
poised to take an important government-held air base, and the
outcome of the assault could determine the future of the two-month
Congolese war. After a trek of several hundred kilometers (miles)
through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have
gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal
to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching
pad for a counter-offensive. If the rebels succeed in capturing
Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel
headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in
eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the
mineral-rich southwest. A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would
put the coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the
Congolese army and opposition politicians on the defensive and give
a boost to Kabila's efforts to fend off the rebellion launched Aug.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally higher
Tuesday, with the key index in Kuala Lumpur surging 4 percent in
part due to a government minister's confidence in measures to
stabilize the economy. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite
Index, which tracks 100 key stocks, rose 14.35 points, closing at
374.45. In Tokyo, share prices rebounded on expectations of more
tax cuts and government spending to boost the economy. The
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 73.52
points, or 0.57 percent, from Monday's 13-year record low to close
at 13,021.64. In Taiwan, however, share prices slid 85.32 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 6,534.65. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell
against the yen on worries about how the United States can absorb
worldwide financial turmoil. Markets were closed in Hong Kong and
South Korea for holidays. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Calling for more work to ward off a worsening
global economic crisis, U.S. President Bill Clinton says he wants
to build a new financial system that reduces risk so countries can
safely benefit from free capital markets. Clinton was presenting
his ideas Tuesday at the opening annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which bring together
financial officials from 182 nations. As Clinton was addressing
what he calls the gravest threat to the world economy in 50 years,
U.S. officials worked behind the scenes on a multibillion-dollar
rescue package for Brazil. It is the latest country to come under
threat from a crisis that has swept through Asia and Russia in the
past 15 months. Clinton told senior finance officials from 22
countries Monday that international financial officials must build
``a system that will lessen and manage the risks in the global
markets so countries can benefit from free flowing capital in a
safe, sustainable way,'' he said. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister ordered his Cabinet Tuesday
to speed up planned stimulus measures and consider additional steps
after forecasters warned the economy will likely shrink for a
second straight year. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will seek passage
in Parliament before the end of this year of a 7 trillion yen (dlrs
52 billion) tax cut and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion) in new
public spending, government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said. Press
reports said the package could win approval as early as
mid-October. Obuchi also called on his ministers to come up with
more tax cuts and spending proposals to boost the size of the
stimulus package, which he originally proposed in August just after
taking office. Tokyo is under intense international pressure to do
more to resuscitate its recession-bound economy and ease the Asian
financial crisis. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gross domestic product will shrink by
more than 5 percent and the nation's trade turnover will plummet
because of the economic crisis, a top official predicted Tuesday in
a plea for international aid. In another development, Russia's new
tax chief Georgy Boos announced that the tax service had collected
only 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 620 million) in September, 2 billion
rubles (dlrs 133 million) less than in the previous month, Russian
news agencies reported. The government has run a large budget
deficit for years and regularly lacked money to pay millions of
state workers on time. But with the economy in decline, and most
bank accounts frozen, tax collection has become even more difficult
than usual in recent weeks. Deputy Economy Minister Nikolai
Shamrayev, who announced a series of depressing economic figures,
said help from the International Monetary Fund could soften the
impact of the crisis. Russia's finance minister and central bank
chief are in Washington this week trying to persuade the IMF to
resume disbursement of its loan to bail out the Russian economy.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Pressuring Congress to provide dlrs 18 billion
to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. government compiled
statistics showing no American state has escaped the adverse
effects of the global economic crisis. The Treasury Department
study found that California, America's No. 1 exporter to Asia,
accounted for more than one-fourth of shipments, saw sales to the
region fall 11 percent from the first quarter of last year to the
first three months of this year. ``Clearly, events in Asia, Russia
and Latin America are having a direct impact on the prosperity of
America's farmers, workers and businesses,'' Rubin said. A
36-member panel of economists who are members of the National
Association for Business Economics forecast growth of 2.2 percent
next year, down from a projected increase in the gross domestic
product of 3.4 percent this year. (US-ASIA IMPACT)

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament voted Tuesday
to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Holocaust ``a
detail'' of history.
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity
came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right
leader told a news conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in
the history of the Second World War.''
	   Le Pen reacted angrily to the vote.
	   ``Let us not forget that I am the victim. It wasn't I who
invented the concentration camps, but the fathers, grandfathers and
uncles of my German colleagues,'' he said.
	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
could face up to five years in prison.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against would be an attack on his right to free speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliaments are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''

Cambodian leader Hun Sen meets with king
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with royal denial of pressure, grafs 9-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen met with
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday, apparently hoping the monarch
could help resolve a deadlock in negotiations to form the country's
next government.
	   Hun Sen and ruling party president Chea Sim met for one hour
with Sihanouk at the Royal Palace after talks with the two-party
opposition on Monday yielded no progress.
	   An aide to Hun Sen said the stalled talks would almost certainly
be discussed with Sihanouk, and that the ruling Cambodian People's
Party hoped the 75-year-old monarch shared its desire to push the
negotiations forward.
	   ``It is the intention of the CPP, and I think the king as well,
to speed up the formation of the new government,'' Hun Sen's
spokesman Prak Sokhonn said.
	   Sihanouk, whose mediating efforts helped bring the three parties
to the bargaining table last month, delayed a planned trip to
Beijing for medical treatment at the request of Hun Sen and arrived
in Phnom Penh on Monday.
	   The junior opposition party led by former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy complained in a statement Monday that the king's role in
forming the government ended Sept. 24 when he presided over the
ceremonial convening of parliament.
	   In a veiled accusation against Hun Sen and the CPP, the Sam
Rainsy Party said unnamed people were threatening the king to push
him to intervene in the talks.
	   ``No one should coerce the king to involve himself in the
process of forming a government more deeply than he freely desires
or the constitution specifies,'' the opposition party stated.
	   The royal palace, however, relayed a message from Sihanouk
asserting that the king was not doing Hun Sen's bidding. It
released comments by the king about a letter from U.S. Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that said in
part that ``Sihanouk requires medical treatment in China and may be
intimidated by Hun Sen to stay in Phnom Penh in order to put
pressure on the opposition.''
	   ``This is absolutely inaccurate,'' said Sihanouk's annotation to
the letter. ``I don't have any intentions to put pressure on the
opposition.''
	   Talks stalled Monday as the three parties maintained the same
positions they have held since Hun Sen's party won the July 26
national election.
	   The ruling party won a majority in parliament but not the
two-thirds necessary to form a government alone.
	   But the two-party opposition alleges that Hun Sen's electoral
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The opposition
insists that its charges must be thoroughly investigated before
parliament holds its first meeting.
	   A major stumbling block is the presidency of the new parliament,
a position coveted by both Hun Sen's party and the senior
opposition party FUNCINPEC.
	   The president of parliament controls legislative sessions and
becomes acting head of state when the king is outside the country.
	   Hun Sen's side made an apparent concession to the opposition in
talks last week when it agreed that all three parties should
request the National Election Committee to make a public accounting
of all the used and unused ballots from the election.
	   However, the opposition complained Monday that the NEC has not
responded to the request. NEC member Tip Jahnvibol said Monday that
no decision has been made on the ballot reconciliation, but that
the election commission planned to discuss the issue later in the
week.

Hague declares European feud over, but skirmishes continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Conservative Party leader William
Hague declared an end to a long, debilitating argument over
European policy Tuesday and dismissed continuing opposition from
senior members.
	   Hague spoke to the opening session of the annual, four-day party
conference, a day after winning an 84 percent ``yes'' vote from
party members for his policy of opposing British entry into a
European currency.
	   Seeking to stamp his authority on a party which suffered a
humiliating defeat in the 1997 elections, Hague said ``it is time
to move on from putting our house in order to putting our case to
the British people.''
	   He set two immediate goals: to win more seats on local councils
this year, and to gain control of more local councils next year.
	   Both appear to be achievable, with the party at a low ebb in its
strength in local government.
	   There is no sign, however, that the party has rebounded from the
national election disaster which ended 18 years of Conservative
government. Prime Minister Tony Blair enjoys high popularity
ratings in polls, though the figures have declined from the record
levels just after his Labor Party won power.
	   National newspapers on Tuesday mostly ridiculed the Tories for
continuing divisions and failure to regain support. Britain's
top-selling daily, The Sun, depicted Hague on the front-page as a
dead parrot and said ``the Conservative Party he supposedly leads
has passed away as a political force.''
	   An opinion poll published by The Guardian a month ago showed
Labor with the support of 48 percent, compared to 29 percent for
the Conservatives. The poll of 1,178 adults had a margin of error
of three percentage points.
	   That matched the results of the 1997 election, when Labor won 43
percent of the vote and 418 seats in the House of Commons to the
Tories 30 percent and 165 seats.
	   Hague said Conservatives would fight the next election, which
must be held by 2002, in favor of saving the British pound and
staying out of the currency, the euro, which 11 of the 15 European
Union nations are launching next year. His policy rules out
adopting the euro for nearly a decade, and perhaps longer.
	   Divisions over European policy have raged in the party for
years. It was a key issue in the downfall of Margaret Thatcher in
1990, and Cabinet members in John Major's government were openly at
odds.
	   ``Everybody knows that we had a problem on Europe, and at some
point we had to face up to it,'' Hague said.
	   ``... It is the settled will of the Conservative Party to fight
the next election in favor of keeping the pound.''
	   There was little doubt that his opponents would continue to
speak out. On Monday, Hague's policy was dismissed as
``irrelevant'' by former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
Also speaking up against Hague's policy were former treasury chief
Kenneth Clark and former foreign secretary Lord Howe.

Government plans sweeping amnesty, other steps to humanize prisons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's justice minister on Tuesday proposed a
broad amnesty and other steps intended to improve brutal conditions
in Russia's decrepit and overcrowded prisons.
	   The amnesty, which is subject to parliamentary approval, would
free more than 100,000 people, or every tenth inmate, this fall,
Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said at a news conference.
	   It would apply to those facing charges or convicted of minor and
unpremeditated offenses, he said.
	   Russia has the world's highest incarceration rate, and a long
history of brutal prisons and labor camps that date to czarist
times but were greatly expanded under the repressive Soviet regime.
	   Virtually all of them are rundown and overcrowded, with some
cells holding more than 100 inmates. Officials acknowledge that
malnutrition, infections, food poisonings, violence among inmates
and a tuberculosis rate five times the national average plague the
prison system.
	   Like the rest of Russia, the prison system has suffered a severe
funding shortage, which has been further exacerbated recently by
the nation's economic crisis. The government-allocated daily food
ration now stands at 67 kopecks (4.2 cents) per prisoner,
Krasheninnikov said.
	   The Justice Ministry, which oversees the courts, took
responsibility for the prison system just last month. It had
previously been controlled by the Interior Ministry, which oversees
the police and criminal investigations.
	   Human rights advocates, including the Council of Europe, had
long recommended the move, suggesting that removing the prison
system from police jurisdiction would help limit cruelty toward
prisoners.
	   Apart from the amnesty, Krasheninnikov said that his ministry
would recommend that courts replace prison sentences of less than
two years with other forms of punishment. It will also recommend
limiting the prison terms for those facing trial to one year.
	   ``Many defendants currently spend four, five and even six years
in prison, which is a violation of their rights,'' he said.
	   In another move to ease overcrowding, Krasheninnikov said that
prisoners would be settled in military garrisons that have been
vacated after recent cuts in Russia's armed forces.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Bank of Spain, the country's central
bank, cut its benchmark interest rate half a point to 3.75 percent
Tuesday.
	   Spanish banks soon began following suit. The country's biggest
bank, Banco Santander, cut its prime lending rate from 5.75 percent
to 6.25 percent.
	   Dealers said the Spanish cut demonstrated the urgency of the
global economic crisis, and could set an example for other central
banks in Europe as they look to coordinate policies to help the
world out of its spreading malaise.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Opening a new chapter in relations following the
smooth handover of Hong Kong 15 months ago, China and Britain
declared a comprehensive partnership Tuesday.
	   In a statement issued after talks between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, the two governments
pledged to increase cooperation across the board _ from
environmental protection to closer ties between their militaries.
	   ``Both sides consider that the time is right for the opening of
a new chapter in relations between China and the United Kingdom,''
said the statement.
	   Blair is the first British prime minister to visit China in
seven years. His five-day trip caps efforts to repair the damage to
relations over Hong Kong, especially from British moves to increase
democracy before returning the colony to China on July 1, 1997.
	   Opening the visit with a 1 3/4-hour meeting, Blair and Zhu
discussed human rights, the global financial crisis and the
conflict in Kosovo, among other topics, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   Zhu welcomed Blair by emphasizing the friendly rapport they
established during the Chinese premier's visit to London in April.
	   ``Although we have only met a few times, it seems we have known
each other for many years,'' Zhu said.
	   Zhu told Blair he should ``make himself at home'' and feel free
to raise any issues he liked without fear of offending his hosts.
	   Blair raised human rights and urged Zhu to open talks on
Chinese-ruled Tibet with the exiled Dalai Lama. Before leaving
Britain, Blair had pledged to discuss those concerns, but said he
would do so quietly in keeping with the softer approach most
European Union governments and the United States have adopted.
	   Tang, the Chinese spokesman, said human rights and Tibet were
only mentioned briefly and said Zhu reiterated that the Dalai Lama
must recognize China's sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan.
	   Trying to brighten the atmosphere for Blair's visit, China
signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at
the United Nations on Monday, more than six months after promising
to do so.
	   In a sign of improving ties, Zhu announced that President Jiang
Zemin has agreed to visit Britain next summer, the first Chinese
head of state to do so in the 49-year history of the People's
Republic.
	   The joint statement to set up a comprehensive partnership
promised increased political consultations, including discussion of
human rights, and outlined cooperation in areas from employment
training to crime fighting.
	   China has made similar arrangements with many countries,
including France, Russia and the United States.
	   With a group of business leaders in tow, Blair also hopes to
boost trade ties. With the ill will generated by Hong Kong behind
them, Britain has vaulted to become China's No. 1 investor and
second largest trading partner among European Union nations.
	   Trade for this year's first seven months totaled dlrs 3.48
billion, an increase of more than 18 percent from January-July
1997, China's Tang said.
	   Blair praised Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule,
saying, ``We are very happy about the present situation in Hong
Kong.''
	   Blair will check on Hong Kong, the last stop on his five-day
visit. He will also spend a day in Shanghai boosting British
business by opening a factory and an insurance office and stopping
off at a trade exhibition.

Visit of Swedish archbishop postponed in flap over homosexuals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) - Roman Catholic opposition to a photo exhibit
in Sweden depicting Jesus in scenes with homosexuals has led the
Vatican to postpone a visit by a Swedish Lutheran leader.
	   Church of Sweden Archbishop Karl-Gustav Hammar had been
scheduled to meet Saturday with Pope John Paul II.
	   The Vatican said Tuesday the visit had been put off ``taking
into account the recent events in Sweden and the public discussions
they produced.''
	   Reports from Sweden said the Vatican had been canceled, but the
Vatican said it will take place at a later date to be set by the
two sides.
	   A Church of Sweden statement said the Vatican decision came
``after pressure from Catholic circles in Sweden.''
	   ``I regret the strong Vatican position and am very surprised
that they would give this signal,'' Hammar was quoted as saying.
	   Neither the Vatican nor the Swedish church gave the specific
reason, but the Swedish news agency TT reported that the cause was
Hammar's outspoken support for homosexual clergy and for allowing
the photo exhibit ``Ecce Homo'' to be shown at Uppsala Cathedral,
the seat of the Church of Sweden.
	   ``That's how I understand it,'' Hammar was quoted as saying by
TT.
	   ``Ecce Homo'' depicts Jesus in scenes with homosexuals and as an
AIDS victim. One photo, with the figures in the position of
Michelangelo's Pieta, shows Jesus lying in a woman's lap with an
intravenous-drip device attached to his arm.
	   The pope's long-standing position is that homosexuals should be
treated with compassion, but he rules out sex between gays along
with any sex outside marriage. He has also said that abstinence --
not condoms -- is the way to prevent AIDS.

Dutch bank ING Barings lays off Singapore and Hong Kong staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Dutch bank ING Barings said Tuesday it was
laying off employees from its Singapore and Hong Kong branches as
global market turmoil hinders its business.
	   The bank cut 39 of its 310 employees in Singapore and 78 from
its 650 staff in Hong Kong as part of a worldwide move to retrench
1,200 employees.
	   ``We are making them in response to shrinking volumes,'' Graham
Willis, country manager for the Singapore office, told Dow Jones
Newswires. ``The cuts are a result of the turmoil in the emerging
markets and downturn in client activity.''
	   He added that ING Barings wasn't planning to pull entirely out
of Hong Kong and Singapore, its largest and second-largest
operations in Asia respectively.
	   Those laid off in Singapore were to include both junior and
senior staff, expatriate and local workers, cutting ``right across
the board,'' Willis said.
	   While the Singapore operations are ``intrinsically profitable,
we have to cut our costs,'' he said, adding that ING Baring's
profits would likely grow in 1998.
	   Willis couldn't say whether there would be more job cuts after
Tuesday's, but said the company would respond to the market
situation as necessary.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived
in Ankara Tuesday on the second leg of his shuttle diplomacy to
avoid a military confrontation between neighbors Turkey and Syria
over Kurdish rebels.
	   Despite calls for calm from its neighbors, Turkey has kept up
its harsh rhetoric accusing Damascus of supporting the rebels that
have been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey for over a

	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said in Parliament Tuesday.
	   Yilmaz warned that Turkey would not be satisfied with empty
promises, and asked on Monday for Syria to extradite rebel leaders
who are said by the Turks to live in Syria.

Cabinda separatists say 200 fighters and 35 civilians killed in

Angolan offensive &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 200 have died in recent
fighting between Angolan troops and armed separatists in the
Angolan enclave Cabinda, Cabinda's independence movement said
Tuesday.
	   Angolan troops began advancing on rebel strongholds after
crossing into the tiny oil-rich territory from Congo two weeks ago.
	   Clashes in the territory's eastern region have killed more than
200 armed rebels and Angolan soldiers, the separatists said in a
statement faxed to the Associated Press in Lisbon.
	   The statement also claimed that Angolan soldiers slaughtered 35
civilians who refused to act as guides for them.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   The Angolan government last week acknowledged carrying out
military operations in Cabinda but declined to give details.
Officials in Luanda were not immediately available for comment
Tuesday.
	   Cabinda is an impoverished 7,000-square-kilometer
(4,400-square-mile) patch of Angolan territory wedged between Congo
and the Republic of Congo, north of Angola.
	   Major western oil companies operate platforms off the Cabindan
coast and have bases in the enclave's coastal capital, also called
Cabinda. Oil revenue provides much of the Angolan government's
income.
	   Heavy Angolan security in the capital has kept the separatists
in remote inland areas since they launched their fight for
independence two decades ago following Angola's independence from
Portugal.
	   Angola has also deployed troops in western Congo, near the
Cabinda border, to help President Laurent Kabila quell an
insurgency.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes
freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign
if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week.
	   ``We must respect the will of the voters. If we win the
confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the
baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day
French-Italian summit in Florence.
	   But sounding cautiously optimistic, he said ``we still have a
window of opportunity.''

Yeltsin gives more clout to senior security officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin moved Tuesday to
strengthen Russia's security service by giving more clout to its
senior officers.
	   According to his decree, the heads of the Moscow and St.
Petersburg branches of Russian Federal Security Service will also
serve as deputy directors of the agency. The service is the main
successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
	   The order would ``significantly boost the status'' of the
security service chiefs in Russia's two largest cities, director
Vladimir Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin appointed Putin, a former KGB spy who was stationed in
Germany during Soviet times, as head of the Federal Security
Service in July. Putin previously worked as Yeltsin's deputy chief
of staff, and his appointment was widely seen as the Kremlin's
attempt to ensure stronger control over the security service.
	   Putin also said Tuesday that Gen. Nikolai Patrushev, who had
recently been appointed chief of the presidential department
controlling regional officials, has returned to the security
service in the post of deputy director in charge of economic
crimes.

KLA representative calls for NATO military intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A representative of the Kosovo
Liberation Army who resigned last month said Tuesday he was again
speaking for the rebels in separatist Kosovo province and called on
NATO to intervene militarily.
	   Adem Demaci said the international community must carry through
with the threats of military intervention in order to destroy the
Serbian war machine.
	   ``The Serbian war machine and its military and political
structure must be destroyed. ... All it has ever caused was
conflict, starting with the breakup of former Yugoslavia,'' Demaci
told reporters in provincial capital Pristina.
	   Demaci had backed out from representing the KLA last month
during an apparent disarray among the rebels, claiming nervous
tension and worsening diabetes as reasons for his withdrawal from
political life.
	   But analysts in Pristina then believed Demaci had made the
decision because of differences with the KLA over hardliners'
refusal to accept anything short of full independence for Kosovo.
	   On Tuesday Demaci said he was returning to the political scene
and speaking for the KLA again.
	   ``Without destroying or dismantling the Serbian war machine,
there can be no peace in our region,'' Demaci assessed.
	   Asked what it would take for the KLA to give up the armed
struggle, Demaci said there were many conditions.
	   ``If the international community intervenes militarily and
continues its role in mediating between the two sides after the
intervention... then the UCK would be ready to abandon the armed
struggle,'' said Demaci, referring to the Albanian-language acronym
for the KLA.
	   The West would also have to respect the ethnic Albanian right to
self-determination, Demaci concluded, indicating the KLA was not
ready to give up its goal of Kosovo's complete independence from
Serbia.

Iraqi opposition leader dismisses U.S. attempts to oust Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Iraq-Unrest &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top Iraqi opposition leader declared
Tuesday that U.S. efforts to help Iraqi dissidents overthrow
President Saddam Hussein were not ``sufficiently serious.''
	   His remarks came a day after the U.S. House of Representatives
voted to direct the Pentagon to channel up to dlrs 97 million in
military aid to Iraqi opposition groups trying to topple Saddam.
	   Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, however, refused to commit
his group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
to any U.S.-backed plans to oust the Iraqi leader.
	   ``We have always said that the American efforts do not pay
attention seriously to the sufferings of the Iraqi people,''
al-Hakim told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
the group's headquarters in Tehran, Iran.
	   ``Therefore, we do not believe they are sufficiently serious,
and we do not participate in them,'' he said.
	   The bill passed by 360-38 seeks to ``remove the regime headed by
Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a
democratic regime'' in its place, without use of U.S. armed forces.
The bill also would give dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, which
was set up under earlier legislation.
	   The bill did not specify which groups would receive aid, but
al-Hakim's rejection could pose an obstacle to U.S. attempts to
strengthen the fractured Iraqi opposition.
	   Al-Hakim's council is an umbrella organization for several
Shiite groups which have been fighting a guerrilla war against
government troops in southern Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, al-Hakim's group and another opposition movement,
the Iraqi Communist Party, reported that Iraqi forces had widened a
campaign against Shiite rebel bases in southern Iraq.
	   In a statement, the council said soldiers backed by tanks and
artillery attacked several villages in marshes near Nasiriya, 360
kilometers (225 miles) south of Baghdad, where tens of thousands of
Iraqis, mostly Shiites, took refuge after soldiers crushed a Shiite
rebellion in southern Iraq following Saddam's defeat in the 1991
Gulf War.
	   The raids were part of a campaign that began last week when
troops launched an attack against rebel positions between Nasiriya
and Al-Amara, 140 kilometers (90 miles) to the northeast.
	   The Communist Party reported intensive fighting in the region
this week between rebels and army deserters and army units
supported by the ruling Baath Party militia.
	   It said dozens of troops were killed or wounded and others were
taken prisoner. It did not give figures for opposition casualties.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate word from the Iraqi government on any fighting.
	   Offices of the Baath Party in Baghdad, Basra, Amara, Diwanya and
Kerbala were also bombed, the Communist Party said, without giving
details.

Voters begin to register for '99 Nigerian polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Preparations for next year's presidential
elections have begun in earnest in Nigeria, where voters this week
started to register to be eligible to cast their ballots.
	   Leading newspapers on Tuesday said turnout was low in Nigeria's
commercial capital, Lagos, in part because of heavy rains that kept
many people at home.
	   The country's military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar
registered in the capital of Abuja on Monday and urged the National
Electoral Commission to ensure the presidential polls were held on
schedule next year.
	   ``I want you to stick to your time-table so that come May 29,
1999, we will be able to hand-over power,'' Abubakar said.
	   Registration continued without much incident except for minor
complaints at some centers about registration materials.
	   The Lagos Guardian and the Vanguard newspaper reported some
minor clashes in the oil-rich Rivers State where a group of youths
disputed the location of a voters registration center.
	   Abubakar, who came to power in June after the sudden death of
his predecessor Gen. Sani Abacha, has been lauded for moving
Africa's most populous nation toward democratic reform and civilian
rule.
	   An estimated 56 million Nigerians are expected to register over
the next two weeks to be eligible to vote next year.

Minister urges investigation into link between arrested couple and
</HEADLINE>
mass poisoning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's minister in charge of criminal
investigations urged police Tuesday to do their utmost to uncover
any links between a mass poisoning that killed four people and a
couple arrested in a separate poisoning in the same town.
	   The comments by Home Affairs Minister Mamoru Nishida underline
the growing fears gripping the nation over two high-profile
poisonings in the same small town in Wakayama prefecture (state) in
western Japan.
	   The couple were arrested Sunday on charges of attempted murder
and insurance fraud.
	   But the real mystery has been over an earlier case in which
police say arsenic was poured into curry served at a summer
festival, sickening dozens of people and killing four, including
two children.
	   ``I hope for an early end to this nation's fears,'' Nishida told
reporters. ``I know they will press forward with a thorough
investigation on any links with the July 25 murder using the
poisoned curry.''
	   There have been no arrests in the curry poisoning, which shocked
Japan _ a nation that long prided itself on a relatively crime-free
society.
	   It set off a series of apparent copycat poisonings, including
the death of a man who drank a can of tea bought at a supermarket
and discovered later to have been laced with cyanide. Police
suspect someone inserted the poison through a tiny hole in the can,
glued it over and then slipped it on the shelf.
	   On Tuesday, police continued searching the home of the couple
arrested in the insurance fraud case, but officers refused to say
whether they were suspects in the curry poisoning.
	   Their arrest, involving dozens of officers, was covered
intensively by Japanese media.
	   Masumi Hayashi, a 37-year-old former insurance saleswoman, is
accused of serving a man food laced with arsenic last year in an
effort to collect his insurance money. Her husband Kenji, 53, was
arrested on insurance fraud charges.
	   Even before their arrest, the Japanese media had detailed the
couple's alleged dubious insurance deals, which reportedly numbered
nearly a dozen involving several companies and included friends and
relatives of the couple. Some did not even know policies had been
taken out under their names, the reports said.
	   The couple, who freely granted interviews to Japanese TV news
programs prior to their arrest, have repeatedly asserted their
innocence. They say they trust the police and hope the true
culprits will be caught soon.

Accord struck down, truckers again threaten crippling strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Raising the specter of a new crippling trucker
strike like the one two years ago, French union leaders on Tuesday
blasted a legal body's decision to scrap an order forcing companies
to boost the drivers' pay.
	   The Council of State, the highest legal body for administrative
matters, on Monday struck down the 1996 government order to pay
truckers for down-time during loading and unloading, saying the
government ``had no power to take such a measure.''
	   ``It's a declaration of war,'' said Roger Poletti,
secretary-general of the Workers Force transport union, which
participated in the November 1996 strike that paralyzed French
roadways _ Europe's main transportation axis _ for two weeks.
	   A Workers Force statement, citing all the major unions, said the
Council of State decision was ``heavy with consequence. ... We
can't sit by in silence.''
	   Poletti told The Associated Press he expected protests, and it
was ``sure and certain that any trucker's protest translates into
strikes and roadblocks.''
	   But Poletti declined to say when such protests would take place.
``We'll have to take the temperature'' of the rank and file and
``their commitment to mobilize, he said. ``It will take time.''
	   Management held out hope of a peaceful solution, even though
union representatives quit the bargaining table.
	   Owners say they need to cut costs to compete in a sector that
has become increasingly competitive in recent years with the
European Union's single market and low-wage drivers from Eastern
Europe.
	   Unions are seeking to protect their members from the trend, and
truckers have staged strike in other EU countries as well.
	   The unions ``left the table to attract attention to find a
solution,'' said Philippe Choutet, delegate-general of the trucking
owners' Union of Transport Federations.
	   ``It's in a phase of reflection,'' he said, adding that talks
were to continue.
	   Poletti remained combative, contending the management ``doesn't
want an agreement'' on the extra pay that unions and management
were unable to agree on at the European Union level. The EU last
month decided to write its own legislation without the extra pay
clause.
	   Without the accord, ``we'll have to integrate ourselves into the
European context. We were taking refuge in the agreement that has
just been annulled,'' the union leader said.
	   Without the French agreement, owners ``can now adopt the EU
text,'' Poletti said, calling that ``a scrap of paper that allows
anything.''
	   But the text is still being written. Last Wednesday, the EU's
European Commission said it plans to propose legislation covering
working conditions for the trucking industry after the EU talks
broke down.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived
in Ankara Tuesday on the second leg of his shuttle diplomacy to
avoid a military confrontation between neighbors Turkey and Syria
over Kurdish rebels.
	   Despite calls for calm from its neighbors, Turkey has kept up
its harsh rhetoric accusing Damascus of supporting the rebels that
have been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey for over a
decade.
	   He was scheduled to hold talks with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on the crisis before returning to Cairo later Tuesday.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said in Parliament Tuesday.
	   Yilmaz warned that Turkey would not be satisfied with empty
promises, and asked on Monday for Syria to extradite rebel leaders
who are said by the Turks to live in Syria.
	   Syria said Monday that threats were not suitable in such
situations and called for dialogue.
	   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side
Tuesday.
	   He warned that ``any aggression against Syria will be considered
as an aggression against Libya according to the Arab joint defense
pact.''
	   ``Tens of Turkish companies will loose their business in Libya
immediately and Greek companies will replace them if Turkey attacks
Syria,'' he said.

Singapore police mend fences with Malaysian counterparts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore police said Tuesday they had resolved
a recent tiff with their Malaysian counterparts, who conducted
interviews in the city-state last week without informing
authorities here first.
	   ``Both police forces have resolved the matter expeditiously and
amicably because of (their) strong ties and close working
relationship,'' said a statement from the Singapore Police Force.
	   Malaysian police came to Singapore five days ago to question
journalists at U.S.-owned television network CNBC Asia about how
they obtained interviews with jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim and
his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   The unannounced visit prompted Singapore authorities to issue a
statement Friday criticizing their Malaysian counterparts. Foreign
police forces ``do not have any extra-territorial jurisdiction in
Singapore,'' that statement said.
	   Singapore authorities said senior officers from both countries'
police forces met Tuesday in the city-state, and the Malaysian
police said ``such an incident would not happen again.''
	   The statement added that police from the two Southeast Asian
neighbors ``will continue to work closely together in our common
fight against crime.''
	   The surprise visit last week by Malaysian authorities to
Singapore threatened to become the latest aggravation in soured
relations between the two countries.
	   They have argued recently over everything from the relocation of
a border checkpoint and the sale of water to trading practices and
the memoirs of Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew.

Bruce Springsteen fights pirate album in British court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rock star Bruce Springsteen went to court Tuesday
to try to block a British company from releasing an album
containing songs he wrote and recorded early in his career.
	   Springsteen wants an injunction barring Masquerade Music from
pirating the previously unreleased collection of songs, which he
recorded in 1972.
	   Springsteen, whose hits include ``Born to Run,'' and ``Dancing
in the Dark,'' showed up in a charcoal gray suit and dark blue tie
for the hearing in London's High Court.
	   His lawyer, Nigel Davis, told the court that Masquerade's
attempts to release the songs were damaging to Springsteen because
it was an attack on his artistic integrity _ the songs often were
not used on Springsteen's albums because they didn't meet his
standards.
	   ``This was a matter of tremendous importance to Mr. Springsteen,
and it matters enormously to him that he should retain control of
his artistic output,'' Davis said.
	   Masquerade, which claims rights to the songs through an
agreement with a New York company with whom Springsteen previously
had a relationship, is trying to release the collection on a CD
called ``Before the Fame.''

Russia will use U.N. veto to stop force against Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 6-10, 15-16 with comment from Foreign Ministry,
defense minister, minor editing to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is willing to use its veto in the U.N.
Security Council to stop possible NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, the foreign minister said Tuesday.
	   ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation, it'll do just
the opposite,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned in an interview
with the Interfax news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis in Kosovo, the southernmost
province in Yugoslavia, which is made up mostly of ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' Yeltsin told Russian news agencies.
	   The Russian leader has spoken with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, U.S. President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques
Chirac among others. Yeltsin and Chirac agreed that force would not
work and would entail ``serious international consequences,'' a
statement from the Kremlin press office said.
	   The United States and its NATO allies appear to be moving toward
the use of force, possibly within days.
	   Russia has for months strongly opposed the use of force against
the Serbs, their traditional allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren.
	   If the U.N. Security Council considers applying force in Kosovo,
Russia ``without a doubt will use its right to veto,'' Ivanov told
Interfax.
	   Russia agrees with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's violent campaigns against ethnic Albanians must be
stopped. Moscow has approved Security Council resolutions that
don't include the use of force.
	   ``We take note that recently there have been no military actions
taking place in Kosovo,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news conference Tuesday. ``Of course, the
situation is far from being resolved. It needs intensive efforts.''
	   Yeltsin told Germany's Chancellor-elect Gerhard Shroeder that
Yugoslavia had accepted a Russian proposal for an international
delegation to investigate the crisis, Yeltsin's press service said.
	   Russia has proposed that a delegation from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe go to Kosovo to investigate ways
to peacefully end the crisis.
	   In Russia's parliament, which is dominated by Communists and
nationalists, deputies have said that NATO bombings would endanger
Russia's ties with the NATO alliance.
	   ``If NATO starts bombing strikes ... Russia will assume a very
tough stand and will demand that Russia's agreement with NATO be
broken off,'' Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of
parliament's lower house, was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   In Greece, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO
strikes would seriously damage Russia's relations with the West.
	   ``We have invested so much effort to create this so far fragile,
but developing house of European security for the 21st century,''
Sergeyev was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``The
20th century must not end with a war.''

Malaysia to retain currency controls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Malaysia will retain sweeping foreign
exchange controls it imposed last month until its ailing economy
stabilizes, a senior Malaysian official said Tuesday.
	   ``I think it has been made clear by Central Bank that it will
continue until the situation improves, until stability is
restored,'' said Asmat Kamaludin, secretary-general of Malaysia's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   He said the controls would not likely restrict trade in
Malaysia, which has been driven into recession by Asia's 15-month
financial crisis.
	   The Malaysian controls imposed last month included a fixed
ringgit exchange rate, a ban on trading of the Malaysian currency
and stocks outside the country, and restrictions that went into
effect Oct. 1 on how much local and foreign currency travelers can
take with them.
	   The measures have insulated Malaysia for the time being from
foreign speculation but have frightened away the long-term
investment in manufacturing and technology that Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad wants.
	   Tan is in Manila to attend a meeting of Southeast Asian trade
ministers seeking freer investment in the region.

Iraq criticizes U.N. compensation program of Gulf War victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq criticized Tuesday a U.N. plan to
compensate victims of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis from Iraqi oil sales
as misguided and politically motivated.
	   ``Iraq has said that most of the demands for war compensation
are imaginary, illegal and baseless,'' Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Compensation awards approved by a U.N. commission are paid using
Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations seeking compensation for
loss and damage caused by the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
	   Since its inception, the commission awarded millions of dollars
for companies and individuals in compensation.
	   Ramadan's letter was carried by the Iraqi News Agency.

Shearer hints he could leave Newcastle if fortunes don't improve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ England captain Alan Shearer hinted
Tuesday he could leave Newcastle if the club doesn't start winning
trophies.
	   Shearer, who has scored seven goals in the Premier League this
season, has been at the forefront of a mini Newcastle resurgence,
which was halted Sunday with a 3-0 loss to Arsenal.
	   Newcastle was languishing at the bottom of the table before
former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit took over for Kenny Dalglish at
Newcastle. The Magpies are currently 10th in the league standings.
	   ``The bottom line is I came here to win trophies. That is all
important to me,'' Shearer was quoted saying in the Sun newspaper.
	   ``I have never wanted to go abroad before. But you can never say
never in football. It would be foolish of me to do that.''
	   ``Read into that what you like.''

Report: Chinese president to visit Australia in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS statement from Australian prime minister delighted at
visit, graf 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin will make
a landmark visit to Australia in 1999, in a further sign of thawing
relations between the two countries, Australian Associated Press
reported Tuesday.
	   In accepting a longstanding invitation, Jiang will be the most
senior member of China's Communist leadership to ever journey to
Australia.
	   Confirmation of next year's visit came Tuesday as China
congratulated Prime Minister John Howard on his victory in
Saturday's election, the Australian domestic news agency reported
from Beijing.
	   It followed speculation that a visit could be organized as early
as next month to follow the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
leaders' forum in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``He (Jiang) is not going this year. He has accepted an
invitation to visit next year. We don't have any dates yet. They
are still to be confirmed,'' AAP quoted an Australian Embassy
spokesman as saying.
	   ``I am delighted to hear that Jiang Zemin is coming,'' Howard
said in a statement to AAP. ``We have a strong, practical
relationship with China and I look forward to welcoming him here to
Australia.''
	   A November visit had been discussed but Chinese officials felt
that the president would be busy with major domestic commitments in
the aftermath of this year's floods, the spokesman said.
	   Zhu Bangzao, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, declined when
asked by a reporter to confirm next year's visit.
	   But he said China believes that meetings between Australian and
Chinese leaders ``play an important and irreplaceable role for the
development of bilateral relations.''
	   Howard extended an open invitation to Jiang to visit Australia
during an official visit to China in early 1997.
	   The prime ministerial tour helped ease bilateral tensions after
China was angered by early diplomatic stumbles by the Howard
government shortly after its election in 1996.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji _ now the second highest ranked Chinese
leader _ visited Australia in May 1997, but at the time was ranked
fifth in the powerful seven-member Communist Party Politburo
standing committee.
	   Zhu's visit was marked by small demonstrations railing against
China's human rights record.
	   During Jiang's visit to the United States last year, thousands
of demonstrators dogged his trail to protest against human rights
abuses and urge greater political freedom in China.
	   Australia has received a series of official visits since early
1997 as relations rebounded from the downturn in 1996 on the back
of the Howard government's softer approach to the human rights
issue.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Following difficult talks with Milosevic late Monday, Richard
Holbrooke met here in the Kosovo capital with ethnic Albanian
political leaders, who have refused to negotiate with Milosevic
until he halts the seven-month crackdown which has killed hundreds
and driven more than a quarter million people from their homes.
	   Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters before heading into talks with ethnic Albanian
political leader Ibrahim Rugova, who says NATO airstrikes would be
welcome.
	   Holbrooke was expected to return to Belgrade for another meeting
with Milosevic Tuesday night.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic in
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the seven-month crisis
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted several
hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the ``the
grave situation we are facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia. But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with
Milosevic, and Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere to
any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army called on NATO
Tuesday to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman
last month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said:
``The Serbian war machine and its military and political structure
must be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   French President Jacques Chirac insisted that the Security
Council must authorize any military intervention, but indicated
that the human suffering going on might be the loophole NATO needs
to go in, and that France would go along with that.
	   ``It is necessary that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in
Florence, Italy. ``Combat must cease. If that is not the case, a
NATO intervention will become inevitable.''
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
Monday that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making
false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.

Albright sees Netanyahu, Arafat; says time is running out

 &UR; Desk: UPDATES in 7 grafs with end of Albright meeting with
Netanyahu, Picks up 4th graf pvs. Israeli adviser comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held
more than two hours of inconclusive talks Tuesday with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on prospects for a West Bank
accord with the Palestinians.
	   There was no report of progress, and a senior Israeli official,
David Bar-Ilan, said Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority had done
nothing to rout terrorists on land under its control ahead of this
month's planned Washington summit.
	   ``Nothing, nothing, nothing,'' Netanyahu's adviser said after a
news conference at which Albright placed highest priority on
security measures. But she also said there were a number of issues
where ``parallel'' movement by Israel and the Palestinians was
needed.
	   Netanyahu, for his part, said Israel had met its obligations _
meaning a willingness to relinquish more land on the West Bank _
and ``the crucial question'' was whether the Palestinians would
reciprocate.
	   Bar-Ilan complained specifically about anti-Israel provisions
that remain in the Palestine Liberation Organization's covenant,
and the alleged presence of 13 indicted terrrorist suspects and 25
members of the militant group Hamas in the Palestinian police
force.
	   Albright's next meeting was in Jericho with Arafat. She may see
Netanyahu again and possibly stage a three-way meeting with the two
Mideast leaders before she leaves.
	   With the admonition that ``time is running out,'' Albright
trying to narrow differences on a West Bank accord before U.S.
President Bill Clinton hosts a summit with the two Mideast leaders
later in the month.

Bourse recovers day after lowest drop since June '97
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Shares on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange gained some ground Tuesday, a day after dropping to their
lowest level in 15 months, but remained skittish.
	   At midday, the 27-share AEX index was up 20.68 points, or 2.5
percent, to 849.99 points. It had closed Monday at its lowest point
since June 1997, and has lost around 23 percent of its value in the
last month.
	   Traders said the market remained nervous as world leaders
struggled to find solutions to the economic crises that have
wracked Asia, Russia and Latin America.
	   Tuesday's main gainer was Belgian-Dutch financial services group
Fortis, whose shares surged up 12.3 percent following its
announcement late Monday cancelling a planned 4 billion guilder
(dlrs 2 billion) equity issue.
	   Dutch insurance giant Aegon was up 3.1 percent at midday;
banking group ING was up by 4.2 percent; and shares in KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines rose by 5.3 percent.

EU parliament votes to lift Le Pen's immunity

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Le Pen reaction; FIXES typo in 8th graf to drop
apostrophe from parliaments. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament voted Tuesday
to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Nazi gas
chambers ``a detail'' of World War II history.
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity
came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right
leader told a news conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in
the history of the Second World War.''
	   Le Pen reacted angrily to the vote.
	   ``Let us not forget that I am the victim. It wasn't I who
invented the concentration camps, but the fathers, grandfathers and
uncles of my German colleagues,'' he said.
	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
could face up to five years in prison.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against would be an attack on his right to free speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliaments are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''

Hanson concedes defeat, blames media and voting system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An angry Pauline Hanson on Tuesday
conceded defeat in her parliamentary seat and blamed the media for
One Nation's disastrous election campaign.
	   Hanson broke her media silence to rule out taking over One
Nation's sole parliamentary spot -- Heather Hill's Senate seat in
Queensland.
	   ``I've always said that Heather wins that seat, she's won it in
her own right. I would not ask her to step aside. I've never even
discussed it with her,'' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   Instead Hanson will take over running One Nation, setting up a
national office in Queensland.
	   But she denied that her move was aimed at shutting out party
organizers David Oldfield and David Ettridge, both of whom have
been blamed for an election campaign that at times looked more like
high farce than politics.
	   Ettridge came in for more criticism Tuesday when he suggested
Hanson's name would be dropped from the name of the party she
founded 18 months ago.
	   But Hanson said she was not dumping either organizer, and
dismissed Ettridge's comments that she would receive a six-figure
salary for her role as party president, saying nothing had been
discussed.
	   ``He has no right to actually say that,'' she said.
	   Despite locking the media out of some launches, even calling the
police to evict journalists from one event, Hanson said the media
had failed to report on One Nation's policies.
	   ``We put out some very good policies which the public had no
knowledge of because the media did not tell the public about our
policies,'' she said.
	   ``The media hounded me and hounded me. They were only looking
for the negatives. The image of what Pauline Hanson and One Nation
stands for was so negative from the media that I'm quite angry with
the media.''

Russia defense chief promises to stick to Cyprus missile deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Russia will not back off plans to ship
anti-aircraft missiles to Cyprus despite threats from Turkey of
conflict on the divided island, Russia's defense minister said
Tuesday.
	   But Igor Sergeyev refused to give a firm date for the arrival of
the S-300 missiles, whose anticipated delivery has been delayed by
several months.
	   Russia will ``fulfill all obligations'' concerning the sale and
delivery of the missiles, Sergeyev said following a meeting with
the Cypriot defense minister, Yiannakis Omirou, at a defense
industry trade show.
	   Turkey has threatened to strike at the planned missiles. Greece,
which has a defense pact with Cyprus, could be drawn into the
conflict. And last month, the deputy chairman of the Russian
parliament's Defense Committee, Alexei Arbatov, said Russia may
also consider giving military support if Turkey attacked.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied its northern third after an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Some Western nations have urged Cyprus to call off or delay the
S-300 deal.
	   But Omirou said ``Cyprus is a sovereign country and will answer
to no one.''
	   Sergeyev is in Athens to visit the defense show and hold
meetings with Greek officials, who are considering whether to
purchase the S-300s or the U.S.-made Patriot missile system.

Macedonian army receives APCs in gift from German government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Macedonian army has taken
possession of 60 armored personnel carriers it received from the
German government following an agreement struck in August between
Bonn and Macedonian authorities.
	   The APCs, valued at dlrs 70 million, arrived at a military base
near the Macedonian capital Skopje late Monday, accompanied by 35
tons of spare parts.
	   The carriers, used BTR-70s, were originally the property of
former East Germany's army.
	   The German government has agreed to service the APCs for two
years.
	   The APCs should significantly raise the effectiveness of
Macedonia's poorly equipped, 10,000-man army.
	   They will be distributed to military barracks in major
Macedonian towns.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Construction workers excavating a site
uncovered 13 human skulls and other remains, the state-run
television news reported Tuesday.
	   The skulls, together with remnants believed to be parts of human
arms and legs, were discovered Monday in a three-meter
(10-foot)-deep hole at the site of a future underground railway
station near Singapore's Little India district.
	   Six Bangladeshi workers uncovered the remains, along with about
two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of gold jewelry and coins, the report
said.
	   The skulls had ``no cracks'' and were in ``very good
condition,'' said security guard R. Santiago.
	   The age of the remains is not yet known, the report said.
	   Pathologists were examining the bones, and Singapore police
requested that anyone with information or clues contact them.
	   Nearby residents said the site once housed a mortuary that dated
back to World War II, the television station added.

With Syria's nod, army commander will be new Lebanon president

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Army commander Gen. Emile Lahoud will be
Lebanon's next president after Syria, the power-broker in the
country, approved his name, officials and news reports said
Tuesday.
	   ``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri told Lahoud Monday in a telephone conversation, which
was headlined on the front-page of As-Safir, a leftist newspaper.
	   Lebanese media said the matter was settled at a meeting in
Damascus Monday between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller
neighbor.
	   Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, told
reporters Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the
128-member Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.
	   The election is a formality since other candidates have little
chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind Lahoud. In
another formality prior to the election, the Parliament will amend
the constitution, which forbids senior public servants from running
for president.
	   ``It's been decided ... and the general will be elected within
10 days,'' An-Nahar, a leading newspaper, said.
	   The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi
leaves office at the end of his six-year term.
	   ``It was a good choice,'' Hariri, who is visiting Saudi Arabia,
was quoted by An-Nahar as saying.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a
55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite
Muslim.
	   Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth
running of the government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship
with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change was expected in
the policies of the government.
	   Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of
the next head of state.
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the
United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home and
has good relations with Syria.
	   But the choice could not have been sealed before a final say
from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this country. His word is
referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.''
	   Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army
commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during
the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the
55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias. In
Lebanon, the army commander heads the air force, navy and the
ground forces.
	   Many hope he will copy his success with the military in
government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public funds.
	   But others fear that a military man holding the nation's highest
office could turn the country into a virtual police state.
	   ``The election of a military man is a threat to democracy in
Lebanon,'' Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living in
self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper Tuesday.
	   Lahoud will have to leave his army post after he becomes
president.

Military parade marks war with Israel, Mubarak criticizes Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt celebrated the 25th anniversary of its
last war against Israel with a military parade Tuesday, and
President Hosni Mubarak hailed the war as a victory for peace.
	   The parade, conducted at an army camp near the Suez Canal town
of Ismailia, was the first on the anniversary since the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Saddat by Muslim militants during
a similar show of military strength.
	   In Tuesday's ceremony, shown on national television, Mubarak was
driven past a forest of rocket launchers, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles and artillery pieces, and naval assault boats
looking incongruous on the desert sands.
	   The show included heavy US-made M1A1 tanks, better known as
Abrams, lighter Egyptian made Walid and Fahd armored vehicles and
anti-aircraft missile systems.
	   Before attending the parade Mubarak told Egyptian television
that Middle East 1973 War war was ``a lightning point in Egypt's
modern military history.''
	   ``It was a war that opened the road for peace,'' he said on the
program Good Morning Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
	   But Mubarak warned against what he called Israel's growing
arsenal, saying it constitutes ``a threat to the security of the
region.''
	   Mubarak has used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a
series of interviews, blaming the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalemate in peace talks with the
Palestinians.
	   ``From the day Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing
has been implemented. The peace process has stopped,'' Mubarak told
Israel's Channel 2 Monday night.
	   Mubarak watched Tuesday's parade through aviator-style
sunglasses, flanked by his defense minister and senior army
officers. The president, a former pilot, was air force commander in
the 1973 war.
	   Some 2,500 Israelis, 15,000 Egyptians, 7,700 Syrians and 125
Iraqis were killed in the war of 0ct. 6-24, 1973. Tens of thousands
were wounded.
	   Egypt considers the war a military victory because its soldiers
overran Israeli forces in crossing the Suez Canal, challenging the
myth of Israel's invincibility. Egyptians believe the rebuilding of
Arab pride from the war led to peace with Israel six years later.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Iran last week signed an
economic agreement protecting investments in each country and
avoiding double taxation, Economic Minister Janusz Steinhoff's
office announced Tuesday.
	   The agreement was signed Oct. 1 during Steinhoff's visit to Iran
for talks with government officials and a meeting of the
Polish-Iranian Ministerial Committee for Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said Economic Ministry spokesman Pawel Badzio.

Report: Abbey Christmas tree from queen nearly banished
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Westminster Abbey official nearly ended the
100-year-old tradition of displaying a decorated Christmas tree in
the storied cathedral _ until he found out the tree is a gift from
Queen Elizabeth II, the Times of London reported Tuesday.
	   Instead, Dean of Westminster Wesley Carr agreed to place two
smaller trees, decorated with white lights, at the information
desks instead of the traditional 20-foot (6.1 meters) tree in the
nave of the abbey, the newspaper reported.
	   The idea was to make more room in the nave for worshippers at
Christmas. And many clergy are uncomfortable with Christmas trees
because of their pagan links with yule festivals, the Times said.
	   Westminster Abbey is a so-called Royal Peculiar that falls under
the jurisdiction of the queen. She takes a personal interest in the
abbey and annually donates two trees from Great Windsor Park, the
newspaper said.
	   Last year's Christmas tree is featured on this year's abbey
Christmas card.

Hanson concedes defeat, blames media and voting system

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An angry Pauline Hanson on Tuesday
conceded defeat in her parliamentary race and blamed the media for
her One Nation party's disastrous election campaign.
	   Hanson broke her media silence to rule out taking over One
Nation's sole parliamentary spot _ Heather Hill's Senate seat in
Queensland.
	   ``I've always said that Heather wins that seat, she's won it in
her own right. I would not ask her to step aside. I've never even
discussed it with her,'' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   Instead Hanson will take over running One Nation, setting up a
national office in Queensland.
	   But she denied that her move was aimed at shutting out party
organizers David Oldfield and David Ettridge, both of whom have
been blamed for an election campaign that at times looked more like
high farce than politics.
	   Ettridge came in for more criticism Tuesday when he suggested
Hanson's name would be dropped from the name of the party she
founded 18 months ago.
	   But Hanson said she was not dumping either organizer, and
dismissed Ettridge's comments that she would receive a six-figure
salary for her role as party president, saying nothing had been
discussed.
	   ``He has no right to actually say that,'' she said.
	   Despite locking the media out of some launches, even calling the
police to evict journalists from one event, Hanson said the media
had failed to report on One Nation's policies.
	   ``We put out some very good policies which the public had no
knowledge of because the media did not tell the public about our
policies,'' she said.
	   ``The media hounded me and hounded me. They were only looking
for the negatives. The image of what Pauline Hanson and One Nation
stands for was so negative from the media that I'm quite angry with
the media.''
	   Hanson had blamed crime, disease and drugs in Australia on Asian
immigrants and called for an end to Asian immigration.
	   She also wanted to abolish Aboriginal welfare programs, and
repeal the nation's stringent new gun control laws.

Natural gas monopoly owed billions by ex-Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet republics owe Russia's natural gas
monopoly some dlrs 2 billion in unpaid bills and talks are being
held to discuss ways to clear up the debts, the company chief said
Tuesday.
	   Rem Vyakhirev, president of Gazprom, told an international
conference that many of the cash-strapped nations don't have the
means to pay their bills and talks are focusing on debt
restructuring and barter deals.
	   Gazprom has said that the failure of many of its customers to
pay their bills has crippled its ability to pay taxes and other
bills. The company is Russia's single largest taxpayer.
	   Vyakhirev said Gazprom delivers about 72 billion cubic meters of
natural gas to former Soviet republics, with about 70 percent going
to Ukraine.

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ A leading faction of Gabon's largest
opposition party has chosen a Roman Catholic priest _ who is also
the mayor of the capital city _ as its candidate for the upcoming
presidential elections.
	   The Rev. Paul Mba Abessole was selected by members of the
Assembly of Lumberjacks opposition party during a weekend
convention, Libreville-based Africa No. 1 Radio reported Tuesday.
	   Abessole has called for free and fair elections.
	   ``The massive fraud of 1993 almost plunged our nation into civil
war,'' Abessole said of the weeks of violence which followed
President Omar Bongo's election in 1993.
	   Abessole came second in those elections _ the country's first
multi-party vote since Bongo took power in 1967 and declared Gabon
a one-party state.
	   Bongo agreed to the elections only after pro-democracy protests
forced him to legalize political opposition. He won with 51 percent
of the vote.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi arrived
on a one-day visit to Kampala Tuesday to open the sixth Uganda
International Trade Fair.
	   Moi, who was accompanied by his ministers of foreign affairs,
East African cooperation and trade, was also expected to discuss
the conflict in Congo with President Yoweri Museveni, who returned
last week from a trip to Libya.
	   Museveni was quoted by the Libyan News Agency JANA as saying he
had welcomed a proposal by Libyan leader Moamar Gadhafi to send an
African intervention force to Congo to replace Ugandan troops
Museveni says are in northeastern Congo to protect Ugandan borders
from rebels.
	   Museveni has not commented publicly on this aspect of his trip
since his return.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have sent troops to Congo to
support President Laurent Kabila. Rwanda no longer denies claims it
is backing the two-month rebellion to oust Kabila; Uganda still
maintains its troops are not fighting with the Congolese rebels.
	   Kenya has said it will only support intervention backed by the
United Nations or the Organization of African Unity to resolve
conflicts in Africa.
	   --
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The European Union's special envoy to
central Africa said Tuesday that the Angolan government was
essential for a political resolution of Congo's 3-month-old
dispute.
	   ``We are working towards a political solution, rather than a
military one,'' Aldo Ajello told Angolan state radio RNA, after
meeting with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Prime Minister
Franca Van-Dumen on Monday.
	   Ajello was expected to leave Wednesday for a tour of regional
countries to promote a negotiated end to Congo's civil war, which
has drawn in most of its nine neighbors.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have deployed troops in Congo
to help President Laurent Kabila contain a rebel coalition of
ethnic Tutsi fighters and other opponents of Kabila's regime.
	   Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila's own rise to power in a
rebel war last year, have refuted government accusations that they
are masterminding the latest uprising.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A gang of five thieves struck in
broad daylight at a Cape Town jewelery store on Tuesday, making off
with a haul of gems worth up to 3 million rand (dlrs 500,000),
police said.
	   While two of the gang waited outside Pinns Jewellers in the
popular Waterfront shopping area, three other robbers entered the
store and forced staff to open a safe where the diamonds were kept.
	   ``They did not produce any weapons, but they ordered the staff
to hand over the jewels,'' said police spokesman Andre Traut.
	   The Waterfront is one of Cape Town's most popular tourist
destinations and attracts thousands of visitors every day.
	   Police said they were scanning footage from security cameras in
the area in the hope they may have caught Tuesday's robbers on
film.
	   South Africa has one of the highest rates of crime in the world,
though Cape Town is seen as a safer destination than other large
cities such as Johannesburg.

U.N. chief: Kosovo fighting continues despite demands for

cease-fire &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3 and 13-16 with Russia saying it will

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite a U.N. resolution demanding a
cease-fire in Kosovo and the withdrawal of Yugoslav police units
from the province, Serb forces intensified attacks on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians in the last few weeks, the U.N. chief says.
	   In his widely anticipated report to the Security Council,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan listed apparent violations of a Sept.
23 resolution but said he couldn't give an independent assessment
of whether Serb forces had complied with the council's demands.
	   That responsibility, he said, falls to the council's 15 members,
who will take up the report Tuesday. Russia, a veto-holding council
member, said it was likely to veto any use of force, and China _
which also holds a veto _ said it also opposed force.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States said
there was sufficient evidence in the report that the Serb special
police units were still active and an estimated 275,000 Albanian
refugees hadn't been allowed to return to their homes.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
end to the fighting that has left hundreds of people _ mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted tens of thousands
since a Serb crackdown began in February. Most ethnic Albanians
want independence for the province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic stripped Kosovo's autonomy
in 1989.
	   In its resolution, the council demanded Milosevic withdraw his
special forces from the province and allow for the safe return of
refugees and for humanitarian access to them. It demanded both
sides work toward finding a political solution and threatened
unspecified action if both sides failed to comply with the entire
resolution.
	   In Monday's report, Annan reported that in the week following
the resolution, government security forces ``intensified their
operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica region,''
and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, Annan said.
	   As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly displaced, he
said.
	   While fighting began to wind down in the last days of September,
with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number of
police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received
information ``that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that the operations of the special police
continue,'' Annan wrote.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Moscow agreed with most of
Annan's observations but said Moscow wanted updated information
about an apparent easing of the military offensive over the
weekend. ``We understand things have been moving and in the right
direction,'' he said.
	   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia is willing
to use its veto in the U.N. Security Council to stop possible NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation, it'll do just
the opposite,'' Ivanov told the Interfax news agency.
	   China said Tuesday it also opposed the use of force.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang urged the
international community to settle the dispute ``through political
dialogue.''

Iraq names new ambassadors to Turkey, Morocco, Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has named new ambassadors to Turkey,
Morocco and Yemen following a major diplomatic reshuffle President
Saddam Hussein ordered in June, Arab diplomats said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Abdel Jabar al-Douri was named
ambassador to Morocco and Farouk Hijazi, a senior intelligence
officer, will be the new Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, the diplomats
said. Sabah Yassin, the former head of the Radio and Television
Organization, will be head of the Iraqi mission to Yemen.
	   Saddam has ordered at least 17 ambassadors, including his half
brother Barzan al-Tikriti, to return to Baghdad in his biggest
diplomatic reshuffle since the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Al-Tikriti, who served as Iraq's ambassador to the U.N.
headquarters in Geneva, has reportedly refused to return to Iraq
after his diplomatic service ended last month.
	   Some 30 junior diplomats also were transferred to the Foreign
Ministry in Baghdad, said the diplomats, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Most of the ambassadors were in their post for more than eight
years. Iraq routinely rotates its envoys every four years.
	   Several Iraqi ambassadors have defected to the West after they
were moved from their posts. The last was Majid al-Samarra'i, the
ambassador to Bulgaria. He defected to Britain last year.

Forest fires in Far East still not under control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires that have caused enormous damage in
Russia's Far East are lessening, but a top official said it was too
early to say if the problem was under control, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Vladimir Pominov, a top forestry official in the Far East, said
20 fires had been put out, but 78 other fires continue to rage,
covering some 450,000 hectares (1.1 million acres) of forest.
	   The fires, some of which have been raging since the summer, have
destroyed some 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of
woodlands since the summer. The fires have killed huge amounts of
local wildlife.
	   A U.N. mission was expected to arrive Tuesday to study the
situation and consider possible international assistance.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least two Russians will not be joining a
nationwide labor protest Wednesday: the cosmonauts on the Mir space
station.
	   Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will work as usual while
Russians take to the streets to protest the government's failure to
pay months-long wage and pension debts and offer solutions to
raging economic crisis. Organizers expect tens of millions of
workers to take part.
	   The cosmonauts do sympathize with the protesters, however, the
ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Viktor Blagov, deputy chief of Russian
Mission Control, as saying.
	   ``The cosmonauts are also feeling the shortage of funds. They've
had their research program scaled back and a cargo ship arrive
behind schedule,'' Blagov said Tuesday. ``I think they support the
protesters' economic demands.''
	   The next supply ship was to head for Mir on Oct. 15, but
Russia's financial problems have forced a delay until the end of
October.
	   The lack of funding for Mir was the main reason behind the
Russian Space Agency's decision to discard the station next June,
half a year earlier than planned.

chief of staff, that a larger outlay would constitute a waste of
government funds in the economically struggling country.
	   Romania has an army of 200,000 soldiers, some of whom did
peacekeeping duty in Bosnia and Angola.
	   The country has also offered NATO the airport at Timisoara, a
city near the border with Yugoslavia, some 425 kilometers (265
miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   Degeratu's statement was confirmed by the Defense Ministry press
office.

Romania soccer team's top three strikers injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's top three forwards, Adrian
Ilie, Radu Niculescu and Gheorghe Craioveanu, will miss upcoming
European qualifiers, sports media reported Tuesday.
	   Romania plays Portugal Oct. 10 and Hungary Oct. 14.
	   ``Our strikers fall like flies,'' Pro Sport sport magazine wrote
Tuesday.
	   Romania's team doctor announced that Adrian Ilie, nicknamed
``The Cobra,'' who plays for Spain's Valencia, had a ruptured thigh
muscle and is under a special medical treatment.
	   ``We'll try to do our best to recover him until the game with
Hungary,'' Pompiliu Popescu told the national radio station.
	   Gheorghe Craioveanu who plays for Spain's Villareal, was
recently suspended two games by FIFA for offending a referee, while
Radu Niculescu has strained his right leg muscle.
	   Romania's coach Victor Piturca would probably call up Adrian
Mihalcea, Viorel Moldovan and Ionel Danciulescu as replacements,
the national soccer federation said in a statement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in the secessionist
Kosovo province.
	   Following difficult talks with Milosevic late Monday, Richard
Holbrooke met in the Kosovo capital with ethnic Albanian political
leaders, who have refused to negotiate with Milosevic until he
halts a seven-month crackdown against separatists rebels, which has
killed hundreds and driven more than a quarter-million people from
their homes.
	   Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters before heading into talks with ethnic Albanian
political leader Ibrahim Rugova, who says NATO airstrikes would be
welcome.
	   Holbrooke was expected to return to Belgrade for Tuesday night
meeting with Milosevic on the southern province in Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2
million-strong Kosovo population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Jerusalem, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks in the Yugoslav
capital, Belgrade.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke late Monday that his government is
willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the crisis in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting in which Holbrooke
told the Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are
facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters Tuesday in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to give Milosevic a last chance to halt
his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic Albanians on the future
of the province.
	   But there was no sign that the diplomatic deadlock was ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and
Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere to any such plan
in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday urged
NATO to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman last
month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said: ``The
Serbian war machine and its military and political structure must
be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   French President Jacques Chirac insisted that the U.N. Security
Council must authorize any military intervention, but indicated
that the human suffering going on might be the loophole NATO needs
to go in, and that France would go along with that.
	   ``It is necessary that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in
Florence, Italy. ``Combat must cease. If that is not the case, a
NATO intervention will become inevitable.''

Israeli army to dismantle parts of tomb of Hebron mosque massacre

gunman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's army has decided to dismantle parts of
the tomb of the Hebron mosque massacre gunman in an effort to
discourage Jewish extremists from making pilgrimages to the site, a
lawyer in the case said Tuesday.
	   The gunman, New York-born Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on
Muslim worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the West Bank
town of Hebron in February 1994, killing 29 people before being
bludgeoned to death by survivors.
	   Over the years, Goldstein's grave in a small park in the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, adjacent to Hebron, has been turned into
a shrine that has drawn many ultranationalist Jews.
	   The army informed Goldstein's family in a letter Sunday that
parts of the shrine would be removed, said the family's lawyer,
Naftali Werzberger.
	   The engraving on the tombstone, which refers to Goldstein as
``holy'' and a ``martyr,'' is to be altered, Werzberger said. The
two words are to be removed.
	   On Tuesday, the Goldstein family petitioned the Supreme Court to
prevent any changes at the tomb, which includes elaborate lighting,
benches, a glass cabinet for prayer books, a limestone plaza and
rose bushes.
	   In the petition, the Goldsteins said the army had granted all
the necessary licenses for erecting the shrine and acted under
political pressure in reversing its position now.
	   Werzberger said tampering with the grave site would incite angry
reactions from Goldstein's supporters.
	   Army comment was not immediately available Tuesday.

Magistrate orders investigating officer to appear in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A magistrate Tuesday ordered the police
officer in charge of the investigation into the slaying five months
ago of a Rwandan opposition leader to appear in court to explain
why he has not yet presented any evidence against three men
arrested for the crime.
	   Senior resident magistrate Christine Meoli issued the order to
appear Oct. 21 after the prosecution told the court the evidence
files were not ready.
	   A Rwandan, a Kenyan and an Ugandan were arrested several days
after former Rwandan Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga was gunned
down May 16 with his driver at a busy Nairobi intersection.
	   The accused are Rwandan David Akiki Kiwanuka, Kenyan Charles
Wamuthoni Muhanji and Ugandan Christopher Ruganda Mulunda.
	   Sendashonga was living in exile in Kenya after being dismissed
from the Rwandan government in August 1995.
	   Once she has the evidence files, the magistrate said she will
decide whether to refer the accused to the high court to stand
trial for murder or release them.
	   The accused have been held without bail since May.
	   After the arrests, police spokesman Njeru Kianda said a Rwandan
Tutsi businessman living in Nairobi had confessed to ordering
Sendashonga's death to avenge the killing of the man's father on
the former minister's orders.
	   Sendashonga was a member of the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan
Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in Rwanda
in July 1994 that ordered a three-month genocide campaign in which
more than 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.

Palestinians accuse Israel in death of Yemenite prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians blamed Israel on Tuesday for the
death of a Palestinian from Yemen who had been held in an Israeli
jail for illegally entering the country.
	   Ahmed Asfour, 23, and a Yemenite citizen, tried to hang himself
in his prison cell last month after being held for 10 months, said
a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prisons Authority, Orit Messer-Harel.
	   Asfour was transferred unconscious and in serious condition to a
hospital where he died three days later, said Messer-Harel.
	   In December 1997, Israel had sentenced Asfour to six months for
trying to enter Israel illegally through the Gaza Strip. He was
still being held after the end of his sentence as the Israeli
government tried to get Yemen to accept him in return, she said.
	   The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group said Asfour's
arrest was illegal. ``The death of Asfour stresses the negligence
of the Israeli government with regards to Palestinian lives,'' the
group said in a release.
	   Asfour had entered the Gaza Strip from Yemen with Israeli
permission to visit his family in 1995. His permit expired and he
did not leave the country.

Russian official: economy will shrink by more than 5 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with customs collections, inflation. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gross domestic product will shrink by
more than 5 percent and the country's trade will plummet because of
the economic crisis, a top official predicted Tuesday in a plea for
international aid.
	   Russia's new tax chief, Georgy Boos, announced meanwhile that
the tax service had collected only 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 620
million) in September, 2 billion rubles (dlrs 133 million) less
than in the previous month, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The government has been running a large budget deficit for years
and regularly lacks money to pay millions of state workers on time.
But with the economy in decline, and most bank accounts frozen, tax
collection has become even more difficult than usual.
	   Deputy Economy Minister Nikolai Shamrayev, who announced a
series of depressing economic figures, said help from the
International Monetary Fund could soften the impact of the crisis.
	   ``The reaction of the world financial community is vital to
correct the country's course,'' he told a conference of gas company
executives and analysts in Moscow.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chief Viktor
Gerashchenko are in Washington this week trying to persuade the IMF
to resume disbursement of its loan to bail out the Russian economy.
A high-level delegation from the European Union is due in Moscow
later this week.
	   Shamrayev said that inflation should total 200-230 percent in
1998, but that IMF aid could limit the rate to 100 percent.
	   Industrial production will fall 5.5 percent to 6 percent by the
end of the year, he said. Imports will fall by 20-23 percent and
exports will fall 13 percent, he said.
	   Shamrayev's prediction of a 5-5.5 percent contraction in GDP is
more optimistic than most analysts, who have said GDP could fall by
as much as 8 percent.
	   Shamrayev said that the slide could worsen, however, if the
government is unable to restart the paralyzed banking system. Money
transfers between businesses have been frozen.
	   The head of Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom, Rem Vyakhirev, told
the conference that the government would probably sell its 5
percent stake in the gas giant within the next six weeks.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale of its stake
because of poor market conditions. But Vyakhirev said the
government needs the money because it looks unlikely to get any aid
soon from the IMF.
	   In Washington, Gerashchenko said a draft agreement on new terms
for Russia to pay its debts to private banks could come as soon as
Oct. 15 or Oct. 20, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Zadornov
said that the government would provide the same terms for both
Russian and foreign banks, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In other economic news Tuesday:
	   _ Customs revenues in September increased 39.5 percent over
August, reaching 6.54 billion rubles (dlrs 43 million), in spite of
a 45 percent drop in imports, ITAR-Tass reported. The State Customs
Committee attributed the increase to improved controls that stopped
``dishonest importers'' from avoiding customs duties.
	   _ A top government official denied that the government has
secretly been printing money to meet its budget obligations. There
should be no talk of ``secret emissions that society wouldn't know
about,'' said Andrei Korotkov, head of the government press office,
according to Interfax.
	   _ Inflation in Russia reached 38.4 percent in September, the
State Statistics Committee said Tuesday, according to Interfax. In
the first nine months of the year, consumer prices rose by 49.6
percent.

Poland and Iran sign joint agreements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Iran last week signed an
economic agreement protecting investments in each country and
avoiding double taxation, Economic Minister Janusz Steinhoff's
office announced Tuesday.
	   The agreement was signed Oct. 1 during Steinhoff's visit to Iran
for talks with government officials and a meeting of the
Polish-Iranian Ministerial Committee for Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said Economic Ministry spokesman Pawel Badzio.
	   Steinhoff met with Mohammad Shariatmadari, the Iranian trade
minister, to discuss trade between the countries, which totaled
dlrs 92 million in 1997, about double the figure for the previous
year.
	   Poland exports steel products, fertilizers, electric equipment
and machine parts to Iran, which exports oil products, fruit, nuts
and aluminum products to Poland.
	   The United States has imposed sanctions against Iran for
promoting terrorism, but some European countries, including many in
the European Union, have continued to deal with Tehran. Poland
hopes to join the European Union in five years.

Tokyo-bound Boeing 777 makes emergency landing in Hokkaido

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Continental Airlines twin-engine Boeing 777 on a
test flight from New York to Tokyo made an emergency landing in
northern Japan Tuesday because of engine trouble, an airport
spokesman said.
	   The plane landed safely at 2:25 p.m. (0525 GMT) carrying 84
Continental Airlines officials and crew members, said Tetsuya
Watanabe at New Chitose airport, 829 kilometers (518 miles)
northeast of Tokyo.
	   The pilot had discovered that one engine was consuming an
excessive amount of oil, said Watanabe. He said the cause of the
trouble was not immediately known.
	   Watanabe said the plane would leave Chitose for Tokyo Wednesday
evening.
	   Continental Airlines is scheduled to begin daily non-stop
service between Newark, New Jersey, and Tokyo on Dec. 1 and daily
non-stop service between Houston, Texas, and Tokyo on Jan. 31, said
Kenji Makino, an official of the Transport Ministry's aviation
department.

Japanese journalist expelled from China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese journalist accused by Chinese
authorities of illegally possessing secret documents was expelled
from China and returned home Tuesday, a spokesman for his newspaper
said.
	   Yukihisa Nakatsu, 39, the Beijing correspondent for the Yomiuri,
Japan's largest-circulation daily, was questioned three times by
Chinese authorities after returning from Tibet last month, the
spokesman said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Chinese authorities searched Nakatsu's home and demanded to know
where he had obtained certain documents they had found, the
newspaper said.
	   The spokesman refused to say what the documents were, or whether
the Chinese had objected to any specific reports in the Yomiuri.
	   Nakatsu, who refused to tell the Chinese authorities the source
of the documents, was ordered Sunday to leave China within three
days.
	   Yomiuri managing editor Shoichi Oikawa defended Nakatsu's
actions and said he was confident Nakatsu had engaged in ethical
and proper reporting.
	   ``We believe that his refusal to disclose the sources of those
documents follows the rules of ethics of journalism,'' he said.
``There will be no change in the Yomiuri stance to pursue fair
reporting of China.''

Thai investment chief says indicators good for recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Foreign direct investment in Thailand
in this year's first five months roughly equaled 1997's full-year
total of about 104 billion baht (dlrs 2.6 billion at current
exchange rates), the head of the country's investment board said
Tuesday.
	   Along with other promising economic indicators, the figures
support the idea that Thailand will be the first country to recover
from the economic crisis that struck the region last year, Board of
Investment Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon said.
	   While gross domestic product is likely to decline around 8
percent this year, Staporn said, export figures are healthy.
	   He said the Board of Investment estimated that 1998 exports will
exceed dlrs 53 billion, while imports will decline, leaving
Thailand a trade surplus of about dlrs 11.5 billion.
	   He said the current account was projected to show a surplus of
dlrs 15 billion, or 14 percent of GDP.
	   ``While the value of Thai exports is likely to decline in U.S.
dollar terms, the volume of exports has risen by an estimated 14
percent through the first seven months of 1998,'' Staporn was
quoted saying in a news release from his office.
	   Comparisons in dollar terms are difficult to make because the
Thai baht has lost about one-third of its value since it was
allowed to float against the dollar in July 1997.
	   Speaking at a meeting of Thai and British businessmen, Staporn
said exports of computers, canned seafood, rubber products,
automobiles and components were showing double-digit growth in
dollar terms, and ``traditional exports such as rice and garments
are ahead of last year's pace.''
	   Staporn said British companies such as Boots, Unilever and Shell
had recently expanded their investments in Thailand, and Britain's
largest retailer, Tesco, has recently entered the market.
	   He said the Board of Investment had liberalized joint-venture
rules to permit foreigners to own the majority of shares in
existing manufacturing projects with the consent of Thai
shareholders.
	   The policy had seen 137 foreign companies invest more than 16
billion baht (dlrs 410 million), he said.
	   To aid them in competing internationally, the investment board
had offered further assistance to manufacturers by granting import
duty exemptions and relaxing zoning requirements, he said.

Yeltsin seeks more tax money from Russia's vodka lovers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With tax revenues shrinking by the month,
President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday ordered tougher tax enforcement
on a familiar target: the country's huge alcohol industry.
	   The government, which already plays a major role in regulating
the industry, now intends to have a controlling stake in all 184
distilleries that make pure alcohol so they can more easily collect
taxes, officials said. In most cases, the government already has a
controlling stake in them.
	   The companies that buy alcohol from the distilleries to make
name brands, such as Stolichnaya and Smirnov vodka, will remain in
private hands, and the government does not intend to nationalize
these firms, Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said.
	   ``The government's key objective is to establish order in the
industry and to protect the alcohol market from inferior
products,'' Kulik was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   But the government also wants more tax money. In Soviet times,
alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of the federal budget.
Today, the figure is around 2 to 4 percent, according to officials.
	   The problem is that about half of the alcohol consumed in Russia
_ mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, according to government estimates.
	   Some state-licensed distilleries are believed to be producing
alcohol that they do not report to the government, and bootleggers
also make large quantities of cheap, untaxed booze.
	   The Finance Ministry has estimated that the new plan could add
around 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion) to the state budget each
year.
	   Kulik claimed the retail price of alcohol would not rise, and
that the plan was aimed at enforcing existing tax laws.
	   The Russian government has been seeking to collect around 14
billion rubles (dlrs 933 million) a month. But it rarely reaches
the target, and tax collections dipped to just 9.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 620 million) last month, due largely to the country's
economic crisis.
	   Alcohol remains cheap and plentiful in Russia, with a bottle of
vodka going for about 30 rubles (dlrs 2).

Romania soccer team's top three strikers injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's top three forwards, Adrian
Ilie, Radu Niculescu and Gheorghe Craioveanu, will miss upcoming
European qualifiers, sports media reported Tuesday.
	   Romania plays Portugal Oct. 10 and Hungary Oct. 14.
	   ``Our strikers fall like flies,'' Pro Sport sport magazine wrote
Tuesday.
	   Romania's team doctor announced that Adrian Ilie, nicknamed
``The Cobra,'' who plays for Spain's Valencia, had a ruptured thigh
muscle and is under a special medical treatment.
	   ``We'll try to do our best to recover him until the game with
Hungary,'' Pompiliu Popescu told the national radio station.
	   Gheorghe Craioveanu, who plays for Spain's Villareal, was
recently suspended two games by FIFA for offending a referee, while
Radu Niculescu has strained his right leg muscle.
	   Romania's coach Victor Piturca would probably call up Adrian
Mihalcea, Viorel Moldovan and Ionel Danciulescu as replacements,
the national soccer federation said in a statement.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima
Nasrin, as well as Islamic extremists seeking her death for alleged
blasphemy, have both crossed the line, Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said Tuesday.
	   Extremists have been calling for the death of Nasrin, who
returned last month to Bangladesh. A newspaper quoted her in 1994
as saying the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten,
but she says she was misquoted.
	   ``The Islamic groups are overreacting ... but Taslima should
also know that there is limit to freedom of expression,'' Hasina
told The Associated Press in an interview in her first public
remarks about the protests now raging in the country.
	   Hasina said free speech ``does not mean the right to hurt one's
religious sentiments,'' but added her government would not allow
anyone to violate the law in response.
	   Nasrin has been in hiding since returning to Bangladesh last
month after four years of exile in Europe and the United States to
be with her mother, who has colon cancer. She has asked the
government to protect her from assassination because extremists
have offered a 200,000-taka (dlrs-5,000) reward to anyone who kills
her.
	   Asked about the writer's request, the prime minister said Nasrin
should face a warrant for her arrest and surrender.
	   ``She should go to the court. There is a rule of law in this
country,'' Hasina said.
	   On Sunday, riot police fired tear gas at 2,000 protestors and
arrested 12 of them, touching off more street protests in the
Bangladesh capital and a general strike Monday in the northeastern
town of Sylhet.
	   Nasrin also faces an arrest warrant that a Dhaka magistrate
revived in a civil suit, in a second blasphemy case filed in
addition to the charges brought by the state.
	   Though she was freed on bail in the state-sponsored criminal
case and permitted to leave the country in 1994, she now needs to
seek bail in the second case.
	   If convicted of blasphemy, the writer could be sentenced to
maximum two years in jail.
	   ``I want my freedom back,'' she told The Associated Press from
her hide-out in an earlier interview. ``This is my country and I've
every right to live here.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Following difficult talks with Milosevic late Monday, Richard
Holbrooke met in the Kosovo capital with ethnic Albanian political
leaders, who have refused to negotiate with Milosevic until he
halts the seven-month crackdown that has killed hundreds and driven
more than a quarter million people from their homes.
	   An Albanian source familiar with the content of talks between
Holbrooke and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova said the
American told Rugova that the ``NATO threat of air strikes is no
bluff, and that all is now up to the Serbian side,'' the source
said.

Ukraine says it would support U.N. decision on Kosovo airstrikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine would support any U.N. Security
Council resolution to allow NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, a
Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Kiev would ``unconditionally support'' such a decision, said the
head of the ministry's political analysis department, Andriy
Veselovsky.
	   But Veselovsky also urged caution over the conflict in Kosovo, a
mostly ethnic Albanian and separatist-minded province in southern
Yugoslavia.
	   ``The United Nations Security Council is expressing the joint
will of the world community, and such a decision should be taken
only on the basis of a comprehensive study of the situation and on
the condition that all other methods have been exhausted,'' he
said.
	   Ukraine seeks a peaceful solution to the crisis, and the
apparent withdrawal of some Yugoslav forces from Kosovo shows that
this possibility still exists, Veselovsky noted.
	   Separately, Ukraine's parliament adopted a resolution Tuesday
calling on the world community to avoid force and resolve the
Kosovo conflict by peaceful methods.
	   It said a solution to the crisis could be found in talks on
autonomy for Kosovo within Yugoslavia.
	   The leftist-dominated legislature, echoing its counterparts in
neighboring Russia, stressed that NATO airstrikes on the Serbs over
Kosovo might spark a much wider Balkan and European conflict.
	   Russia, which strongly opposes the use of force against the
Serbs, its traditional allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren, says it
is willing to use its veto in the Security Council to stop possible
NATO airstrikes.

Kohl's party chooses new leader amid calls for renewal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schaeuble recommendation passed, Kohl quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Amid calls for revitalizing the party by
promoting younger members and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
defeated Christian Democrats closed ranks Tuesday behind a new
leader _ Kohl's own right-hand man.
	   The party's executive committee voted unanimously to recommend
as chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's parliamentary faction leader
and the man he handpicked as his replacement. A final vote is to be
made at a party convention on Nov. 7.
	   The choice of Schaeuble came despite criticism from some party
members that a bolder break was needed from Kohl, who led the
Christian Democrats in last week's election to its worst showing in
50 years.
	   Kohl insisted there was ``no bitterness'' during the closed
meeting.
	   ``There was no criticism at all directed at me,'' he said.
``Others were criticized for what they said before the session,''
he added, apparently referring to calls for party renewal while
refusing to name names.
	   The Christian Democratic Union has dominated German postwar
politics by attracting a wide range of conservative voters. But
young members in particular worry that the party has lost touch
with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and his
16 years as chancellor.
	   ``It's incomprehensible that Kohl again says what's coming,''
Christian Wulff, party chief in Lower Saxony state, was quoted as
saying Monday.
	   He is among five candidates running for four deputy chair
positions at the convention next month.
	   Only one is a woman _ Kohl's outgoing Environment Minister
Angela Merkel.
	   Rita Suessmuth, a Christian Democrat who will be losing her post
as parliamentary president, called for the party to bring more
women to top posts.
	   ``Women in the CDU are ready to help renew, but are not being
included,'' she told Stern magazine in an interview published
Tuesday.
	   She called for replacing the outgoing party secretary, Peter
Hintze, with a woman. ``That's overdue and needs no additional
reason,'' she said.
	   Kohl declined to comment on her suggestion, saying that was a
decision for Schaeuble now to make.
	   He also said there was no discussion about a future official
role for him in the party. Some reports suggested he might be made
honorary chairman.
	   ``My party is my home,'' he said. ``I'll give my advice when
asked. Otherwise I'll enjoy life ... and fulfill my duties'' as a
regular member of parliament.
	   In a jovial spirit, he added: ``I've heard people say they can't
imagine that a former chancellor just sits in (parliament). I say,
`Well I'm not going to stand. I'm going to sit.'''

Woman chains self to radiator to force bank to give her money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A woman chained herself to a radiator in an
attempt to force a Moscow bank to return her deposit, a news agency
said Tuesday.
	   The woman entered a branch of the Russian Credit Bank on Tuesday
afternoon and demanded her money, Interfax said. When she was
refused, she handcuffed herself to a radiator and said she would
not leave until she got her money.
	   Many Russian banks either do not have money because of the
country's current economic crisis or have frozen customers'
accounts.

 &UR; France gives Prodi boost but chides Italy over interest rates &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ France's top leaders gave Premier Romano
Prodi's precarious government a morale boost Tuesday but chided
Italy for keeping interest rates too high, a potential risk for
recession.
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac
called for even stronger cooperation with Rome to help Europe's
economy, deal with global financial crises and map foreign policy.
	   At the end of a two-day Italian-French summit, an annual
appointment to take stock of bilateral relations and European and
world concerns, Jospin stressed the importance of Italian political
stability and expressed ``profound respect for the Italian
government.''
	   Prodi this week is battling to keep his center-left majority
alive, after his Communist allies decided to oppose his 1999
budget, which was tailored to keep Rome in line with European
Monetary Union rules.
	   With the French leaders at his side in a frescoed salon of
14th-century Palazzo Vecchio, Florence's town hall, Prodi called
the political turn against him a ``cloud'' threatening his
government's ``long and fruitful phase of political stability''
that allowed Rome to improve its financial house and become a
charter member of the euro currency club.
	   But ``there are no clouds'' in French-Italian relations, Prodi
said, obviously grateful for the praise reaped on him by Jospin and
Chirac.
	   However, Prodi admitted that in their talks, which begin Monday
evening and continued Tuesday morning, the French ``expressly asked
that Italy lower its interest rates.''
	   Italy's discount rate stands at 5 percent, and Italy's
government and markets, as well as others aboard, have been calling
for the central bank to cut the rate to reduce the risk of
recession.
	   Saying Rome agreed with Paris on Kosovo, Chirac went on to press
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw forces from Kosovo
and warned that NATO intervention could come within days if the
Serb didn't comply.

Swissair working on further compensation for Flight 111 families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking at
procedures for making payments of up to around dlrs 137,000 to
families of those killed in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a
spokesman for the airline said Tuesday.
	   The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability
under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any
responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.
	   No date could be given for payments, which would be deductible
from a future settlement, he added. Exact entitlements have yet to
be established.
	   All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York to
Geneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea off
Peggy's Cove. The causes of the crash have not been determined.
	   Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families an
immediate dlrs 20,000 payment to cover their expenses. More than
130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.
	   Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years have
opted out of a dlrs 75,000 liability cap for people killed or
injured during international flights.
	   The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been served
with a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiring
problems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ a possible cause of
the accident _ and did little to correct them.

Jordan testifies in breach of contract lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Michael Jordan says the money _ almost pocket
change by his standards _ wasn't the reason he didn't go through
with making the basketball movie ``Heaven is a Playground.''
	   The Chicago Bulls star denied in court Monday that he failed to
go through with making the 1991 flop because of the dlrs 350,000
paycheck.
	   Later, Jordan signed a dlrs 4 million deal to make ``Space
Jam,'' a box office success.
	   Jordan and agent David Falk contend the producers of ``Heaven is
a Playground'' failed to come up with adequate financing for the
movie.
	   The movie ultimately was made with former Loyola Marymount star
Bo Kimble in the role Jordan was to have played.
	   The producers are seeking between dlrs 16 million and dlrs 20
million in damages, or what they believe could have been the film's
profit.
	   Jordan maintains both sides agreed to postpone the film, and he
has countersued, alleging that the producers knowingly misled him
about financing.

Tight security surrounds Australians appearance at bribes inquiry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes from Australians &QL;

 &UR; By MUNIR AHMED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Inside a walled compound, patrolled by
armed guards, Australian batsman Mark Waugh told a judicial inquiry
Tuesday that Pakistani test player Salim Malik offered him
''thousands of dollars'' to throw a match.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned that's the end of the matter,'' said
Waugh, who declined to travel to Pakistan in 1995 to give evidence
after the matter became public.
	   ``I've made my statement which is the same as my affidavit which
I gave four years ago. That's all I've got to say so that's the end
of it as far as I'm concerned,'' he said
	   According to the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Control Board,
Khalid Mahmood who attended the closed-door inquiry in the Punjab
provincial capital, Waugh said he was offered ''thousands of
dollars'' in 1994 and he turned it down.
	   Waugh and Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor appeared before
a one-judge panel along with Malik, whose lawyer later told
reporters that his client would produce evidence to clear his name.
	   However Khwaja Zafar wouldn't elaborate on the evidence.
	   Neither Waugh nor Taylor said they felt threatened by the
surrounds or Malik and his team.
	   ``It made it a little uneasy but I'm probably only a third party
in this . . . I was simply passing on information supplied to me by
Warney, Maysie and Mark Waugh,'' Taylor said.
	   ``It's not something I found pleasant but it was something both
Mark and I felt we needed to do. We felt we had a duty to do so and
we've done it,'' he said.
	   The testimony was given before Justice Malik Qayuum, the man
heading the inquiry into the bribery allegations.
	   The hearing was held inside the grand white marble residence of
Punjab Chief Justice Rashid Khan amid tight security. Outside the
large black rod iron gates, security guards with automatic weapons
patrolled. Plain clothes security also roamed the lush grounds.
	   Australian team manager Steve Bernard told Australian reporters
with the team in Pakistan that the players flew to Lahore in secret
to avoid a media and public crush at the hearing.
	   ``We were worried about the security of Mark and myself while we
were here. We were hoping to make it a private affair until after
the event,'' Taylor said.
	   Waugh and two other players not on the current tour _ Shane
Warne and Tim May _ alleged that the former Pakistan captain Salim
Malik tried to bribe them to play badly on Australia's 1994 tour of
Pakistan. Taylor was captain during the tour.
	   ``The situation developed late yesterday afternoon and it was
decided later in the day that Malcolm and the two Marks would go to
Lahore this morning to give evidence,'' Bernard said.
	   The Australian team finished the first test in Rawalpindi on
Monday and the pair traveled to Lahore on Tuesday.
	   Waugh, Warne and May wrote affidavits about the alleged bribery
attempt soon after the matter became public in 1995 but they had
refused to fly to Pakistan for hearings.
	   Warne, who is absent from the current tour because of injury,
said Monday that he did not expect he would go to Pakistan for
hearings.
	   ``We sent signed affidavits the last time and we got called
liars, so I'm not to rush back to testify when I've already said
that and I was called a liar by a judge,'' Warne said.
	   Taylor admitted the bribery scandal had affected both him and
Waugh during the first test, although Australia won by an innings
and 99 runs for its first victory in Pakistan in 39 years.
	   ``It would be nice to clear it up but I don't think we're ever
going to clear it up fully,'' Taylor said Monday. ``We'll try and
do the best we can.''

Head of players union calls for strike to protest handling of
</HEADLINE>
doping scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The head of Italy's soccer players' union has called
for a six-month strike to protest the handling of the doping
scandal which has engulfed the Serie A.
	   Sergio Campana said the inquiries into the use of banned
substances in Italy's first division had violated players' rights
to privacy.
	   ``The players are the first ones to feel indignation by this
daily release of names and precise references to players and
teams,'' Campana said Monday night. ``There have been macroscopic
violations of privacy.''
	   The union head said no names should be mentioned until
prosecutors had completed their investigations.
	   Prosecutors in Bologna and Torino have been carrying out doping
inquiries since this summer when AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman
suggested two Juventus players had used illegal substances.
Anti-doping investigators at the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI)
have also opened an inquiry.
	   The fallout caused the resignation of CONI president Mario
Pescante and the firing of the chief of CONI's drug-testing
laboratory.
	   Serie-A players caused an uproar in March 1996 when they failed
to turn up for weekend games to protest what they said were unfair
working conditions.
	   ``If the results (of the inquiry) show that players voluntarily
broke anti-doping regulations then they should be punished for
ruining soccer's image,'' Campana said.

Growing deficit in Hungary's foreign trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Russian economic crisis and the
annual summer lull have resulted in a growing foreign trade deficit
in the first eight months of the year, a Trade Ministry official
said Tuesday.
	   According to preliminary data, exports amounted to dlrs 14,176
billion and imports to dlrs 16,103 billion. The resulting dlrs 1.93
billion deficit is dlrs 341 million more than in the same period
last year.
	   ``If worst comes to worst, exports can drop by dlrs 250-350
million by the end of the year,'' deputy State Secretary Gyoergy
Gilyan told a news conference. ``That drop isn't staggering when
compared to the dlrs 22 billion, Hungary's total exports projected
for 1998.''
	   Hungary's exports to Russia were four percent of the country's
total, down from 5.1 percent over the same period in 1997.

Rebel, government troops battle for key eastern town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were
poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern
Congo _ a battle that could determine the future of the two-month
Congolese war.
	   After trekking several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense
tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19
kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to
President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad
for offensives.
	   If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235
miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the
last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for
rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
	   A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of
ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the Congolese army and
opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to
Kabila's efforts to fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2.
	   Rebel commander Richard Mondo said troops had fired artillery
rounds into Kindu Monday and early Tuesday, sending the population
fleeing out of town.
	   Advance units had crossed the Lualaba River from the north and
were meeting stiff resistance in the town, he said.
	   Since the assault on the town began at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), at
least 18 enemy soldiers were killed and 40 taken prisoner, Mondo
said, adding the number was expected to rise. The rebels took
casualties, too, but the number was not known. One rebel soldier
was wounded in the stomach, he said.
	   He said the large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside
town, was deserted and no one appeared to be in control.
	   ``Our soldiers are in the town and the fighting is continuing,''
rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda said in Kalima, 80
kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. On
Sunday, a spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already under
rebel control.
	   In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the
Congolese army was firmly in control of Kindu.
	   Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion walked 240 kilometers (150
miles) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake Kivu to Kalima, which
fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance.
	   The rebel fighters, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark green
uniforms, rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault rifles
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, said they were advancing
slowly through the lush forest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall
grass.
	   ``We've been resting a lot. It took us two weeks to get here,''
Mondo said.
	   The rebels are now using Kalima, a town with one main street,
scattered houses and mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with
rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition.
	   A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) away from Kalima
is just barely long enough for the rebels' Russian-built Antonov
AN-72 transport aircraft.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and
Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila.
	   Rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo,
including Kisangani, the country's third-largest city.

EU parliament votes to lift Le Pen's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Munich prosecutor, Jewish group;
minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament voted Tuesday
to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Nazi gas
chambers ``a detail in the history of the Second World War.''
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity
came from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right
leader made the comment during a news conference in the German
city.
	   Le Pen reacted angrily to the vote.
	   ``Let us not forget that I am the victim. It wasn't I who
invented the concentration camps, but the fathers, grandfathers and
uncles of my German colleagues,'' he said.
	   Judicial authorities in Munich want to charge Le Pen under an
article of the German criminal code which makes it an offense to
trivialize the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen could face
up to five years in prison.
	   In Munich, chief prosecutor Manfred Wick said his office will
launch an investigation as soon as they are formally notified of
the parliament's decision.
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France,
welcomed the vote. ``By this decision, the European deputies refuse
to consider as defendable ... the expression of pure anti-Semitism
that consists of rendering banal, insignificant, the Shoah, the
industrial extermination of European Jews in gas chambers,'' the
council said in a statement.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against him would be an attack on free speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliaments are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''
	   Le Pen said his comments had not denied or minimized the gas
chambers and had been distorted by the Munich prosecutors. ``If
these comments have been interpreted in a way that made sincere
people suffer, I'm sorry,'' he said.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting
a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs
3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo province.
	   Following difficult talks late Monday with Milosevic, Richard
Holbrooke met with ethnic Albanian political leaders, who have
refused to negotiate with Milosevic until he halts the seven-month
crackdown against separatist rebels that has killed hundreds and
driven more than a quarter million people from their homes in the
southern Serbian province.
	   An Albanian source familiar with the talks said Holbrooke told
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova that the ``NATO threat of air
strikes is no bluff, and that all is now up to the Serbian side,''
the source said.

 &UR; By MUNIR AHMED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Inside a walled compound patrolled by
armed guards, Australian batsman Mark Waugh reportedly told a
judicial inquiry Tuesday that Pakistani test player Salim Malik
offered him ``thousands of dollars'' to throw a match.
	   Pakistan Cricket Control Board Chairman Khalid Mahmood, who
attended the closed-door inquiry in the Punjab provincial capital,
said that Waugh told the court he was offered thousands of dollars
in 1994 and he turned it down.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned that's the end of the matter,'' Waugh,
who declined to travel to Pakistan in 1995 to give evidence after
the matter became public, told reporters.
	   ``I've made my statement which is the same as my affidavit which
I gave four years ago. That's all I've got to say so that's the end
of it as far as I'm concerned,'' he said
	   Waugh and Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor appeared before
a one-judge panel along with Malik, whose lawyer later told
reporters that his client would produce evidence to clear his name.
	   Neither Waugh nor Taylor said they felt threatened by the
surrounds or Malik and his team.
	   ``It made it a little uneasy but I'm probably only a third party
in this . . . I was simply passing on information supplied to me by
Warney, Maysie and Mark Waugh,'' Taylor said.
	   ``It's not something I found pleasant but it was something both
Mark and I felt we needed to do. We felt we had a duty to do so and
we've done it,'' he said.
	   The testimony was given before Justice Malik Qayuum, the man
heading the inquiry into the bribery allegations.
	   The hearing was held inside the grand white marble residence of
Punjab Chief Justice Rashid Khan amid tight security. Outside the
large black rod iron gates, security guards with automatic weapons
patrolled. Plain clothes security also roamed the lush grounds.
	   Australian team manager Steve Bernard told Australian reporters
with the team in Pakistan that the players flew to Lahore in secret
after finishing the first test in Rawalpindi, in order to avoid a
media and public crush at the hearing.
	   ``We were worried about the security of Mark and myself while we
were here. We were hoping to make it a private affair until after
the event,'' Taylor said.
	   Waugh and two other players not on the current tour _ Shane
Warne and Tim May _ allege that the former Malik tried to bribe
them to play badly on Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan. Taylor was
captain during the tour.
	   Waugh, Warne and May wrote affidavits about the alleged bribery
attempt soon after the matter became public in 1995 but they had
refused to fly to Pakistan for hearings.
	   Warne, who is absent from the current tour because of injury,
said Monday that he did not expect he would go to Pakistan for
hearings.
	   ``We sent signed affidavits the last time and we got called
liars, so I'm not to rush back to testify when I've already said
that and I was called a liar by a judge,'' Warne said.
	   Taylor admitted the bribery scandal had affected both him and
Waugh during the first test, although Australia won by an innings
and 99 runs for its first victory in Pakistan in 39 years.
	   ``It would be nice to clear it up but I don't think we're ever
going to clear it up fully,'' Taylor said Monday. ``We'll try and
do the best we can.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police said Tuesday they will not
allow Malaysia's governing coalition to organize a giant rally at
the capital's new national stadium.
	   The rally Saturday, intended to bolster suport for Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, would have been the latest move in the
political storm that developed after Mahathir fired his deputy on
Sept. 2.
	   An opposition group had said it would organize a bigger rally.
All public gatherings of more than five people in Malaysia require
a police permit.
	   Mahathir said he dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his deputy and finance
minister, because he was morally unfit to lead. The two had
differed over economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared
he was a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar since has been arrested
on charges of sodomy and abusing his powers to interfere with an
investigation.
	   In the weeks after Anwar's dismissal, thousands of demonstrators
turned out in downtown Kuala Lumpur streets to demands reforms and
Mahathir's resignation.
	   About 150,000 people had been expected to attend Saturday's
pro-Mahathir rally, organized by the youth wing of the United
National Malays Organization.
	   Kuala Lumpur's police chief, Kamaruddin Ali, said a permit was
denied ``for reasons of security,'' the national news agency
Bernama reported.
	   ``Any attempt by anyone including the organizers and members of
the public to attend illegal gatherings or rallies is an offense
and action will be taken against them,'' he warned.
	   Kamarudin also said police would not issue permits for any other
rallies in the city that day.
	   This would deter a fledgling coalition of opposition parties,
called the Malaysian Justice Movement, from applying for a permit
to organize a rally of 50,000 in downtown Kuala Lumpur that
evening.
	   The coalition, which has been calling for an end to restrictions
on assembly and speech, has announced plans to bring out even more
people to the national stadium the following week.
	   To counter shows of support for the ousted deputy, governing
party leaders had begun preparing to circle the country to explain
to Malaysians why Anwar was fired.
	   Those plans, however, have run into a possible obstacle. A
recent High Court ruling has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt
or innocence.

Growing deficit in Hungary's foreign trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Russian economic crisis and the
annual summer lull have resulted in a growing foreign trade deficit
in the first eight months of the year, a Trade Ministry official
said Tuesday.
	   According to preliminary data, exports amounted to dlrs 14,176
billion and imports to dlrs 16,103 billion. The resulting dlrs 1.93
billion deficit is dlrs 341 million more than in the same period
last year.
	   ``If worst comes to worst, exports can drop by dlrs 250-350
million by the end of the year,'' deputy State Secretary Gyoergy
Gilyan told a news conference. ``That drop isn't staggering when
compared to the dlrs 22 billion, Hungary's total exports projected
for 1998.''
	   Hungary's exports to Russia were four percent of the country's
total, down from 5.1 percent over the same period in 1997.

Defiant of China, Taiwan calls for APEC support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite China's efforts to isolate it,
Taiwan remains a viable international force thanks to its
democratic credentials and economic strength, Foreign Minister
Jason Hu said Tuesday.
	   China is enlisting all its commercial resources, diplomatic
experience and political will power to achieve its goal of
separating Taiwan from its remaining diplomatic allies by 2000, Hu
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``With that in mind, with all these other objective factors, we
are very clearly facing serious and difficult challenges in the
years ahead,'' Hu said.
	   But Taiwan will be sustained by the respect and support it has
won with its flourishing democracy and massive trade and
investment, he said.
	   ``So you cannot just rule out (Taiwan's) 21 million people. ...
At the end of the day we will still be there, we will still be
recognized and accepted by many people in the world, and then
mainland China will have to learn to face us on a more realistic
position,'' Hu added.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
foreign relations, and its relentless isolation campaign has
reduced the number of nations formally recognizing the island to
just 27. Many other countries, including the United States, have
extensive unofficial ties with Taiwan.
	   Hu also reiterated Taiwan's commitment to aiding neighbors
stricken by the Asian economic crisis, saying Taiwan is proceeding
with deals to pre-pay Malaysia for U.S. dlrs 1 billion worth of
natural gas and send Indonesia 200,000 tons of rice in a barter
deal.
	   Also being pursued is a proposal for better-off countries and
international lending institutions to guarantee bonds issued by
struggling nations, Hu said.
	   That proposal will be discussed at the Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum's November meeting in Malaysia, and Hu said the
16-member group is more important now than ever.
	   Hu said he disagreed with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and
Philippines President Joseph Estrada, who have proposed not
attending the APEC summit over the arrest and alleged beating of
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``You may want to take a position on some political issues on
other occasions, but let APEC survive and support APEC. ... It's
not a good time to damage the function of APEC,'' Hu said.
	   Kept afloat by nearly U.S. dlrs 85 billion in foreign currency
holdings and sound economic fundamentals, Taiwan has mostly avoided
the effects of the regional financial crisis that has battered its
neighbors from Tokyo to Thailand.
	   Taiwan has participated enthusiastically in the affairs of APEC,
one of the few international organizations China has been unable to
keep it out of.

EU OKs deal with car makers to cut pollution by 25%; Sees US, Asian
</HEADLINE>
deals &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union nations approved an accord
Tuesday under which European car makers voluntarily agree to cut
carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent by 2008.
	   Officials said they will seek similar deals with automobile
makers in Asia and North America.
	   ``It is essential (that) all cars sold in the European Union,
regardless of their origin, meet similar environmental standards,''
said EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
	   He said if European producers break their word, the EU will
legislate them into making less polluting vehicles.
	   Kinnock hailed approval of the accord with the European car
makers federation ACEA as key to getting the EU to meet its overall
goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
	   In Kyoto, Japan, last December, 38 nations, including the 15 EU
members, pledged to reduce these emissions to 1990 levels by 2008
to 2012.
	   At a meeting, the EU environment ministers accepted the ACEA
deal that took the European Commission six months to negotiate.
	   Under the accord, all European-made cars coming on the market in
2008 cannot produce more than 140 grams of carbon dioxide per
kilometer, a 25 percent reduction from today.
	   For diesel engines, the agreement sets a norm of 120 grams per
kilometer in 2002. ACEA and the European Commission will annually
monitor compliance with the agreement. Also, in 2002 or 2003, they
will jointly set new pollution limits for 2010 and thereafter.
	   The accord is part of a series of measures, also tentatively
approved by the environment ministers, to force Europeans to buy
cleaner cars in the years ahead.
	   Starting in 2000, EU governments must produce annual reports on
carbon dioxide emissions of new cars.
	   Also by then, new cars must come with a ``fuel-efficiency''
label and information on how much it pollutes the environment.
	   At a public session here, the environment ministers welcomed
these measures and had some suggestions on their own.
	   French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet and other delegates
expressed dismay electric cars were not covered by the voluntary
agreement with ACEA. Also, she added, ``We should gradually
harmonize and reduce the speed limit'' on urban roads and highways
across the 15-nation EU. She suggested a maximum highway speed of
130 kilometers per hour.
	   The environment ministers also had an initial debate end-of-life
vehicles, old cars that are being discarded _ some 8 to 9 million
each year in the EU.
	   About a quarter of the weight of these vehicles is hazardous
waste _ heavy metals, gasoline, oils, hydraulic fluids and
anti-freeze, according to an EU report.
	   It added the ``shredding residue'' amounts to 1.9 million metric
tonnes of waste per year, or 10 percent of the total amount of
hazardous waste generated annually in the EU.
	   The European Commission is proposing legislation forcing member
state governments to have recognized car wreckers issue a
``certificate of destruction'' to the last owner of a car. Only
with such a certificate can a car be taken off the road and
de-registered. (rw)

Top official calls for rearming Russia's strategic forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At a time when the government is struggling to pay
off huge wage and pensions debts, a senior Cabinet minister said
Tuesday that Russia must build dozens of missiles every year to
modernize its aging nuclear arsenal.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said that Russia's
strategic weapons, most of which were built during the Soviet
times, are rapidly aging and will soon lose their combat
capability.
	   ``In two or three years we will have to start taking them out of
combat duty en masse,'' Maslyukov said in a statement carried by
Russian news agencies.
	   ``In seven or eight years we will be left without a single
missile, submarine or bomber built during the Soviet times.''
	   Maslyukov, a Communist, had a successful carrier in the Soviet
military-industrial complex, rising through the ranks to become the
last chairman of the Soviet central planning agency, Gosplan. He's
now in charge of economic strategy for the new Cabinet.
	   ``We mustn't delude ourselves by the talk about strategic
partnership with one or another country,'' Maslyukov said,
indicating that Russia should not be lulled into a false sense of
security just because of the end of the Cold War.
	   ``The modern world is complex and a military force still plays
not the least part in it.''
	   Maslyukov pushed for ratification of the START II arms reduction
agreement with the United States that has been repeatedly delayed
by other Communists and hard-liners in the Russian parliament.
Russia's military brass supports the treaty on the grounds the
weapons it would eliminate would become outdated anyway.
	   Maslyukov linked the ratification with progress on further arms
cuts and speedier production of new weapons.
	   ``Along with rearming our strategic forces, it's necessary to
use diplomatic means to achieve a limitation and reduction of the
U.S. nuclear capability,'' he said.
	   He added that Russia must insist that the United States observe
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 as the ``only way to
guarantee the mutual nuclear deterrence.''
	   Maslyukov said that Russia must build 35-45 new Topol-M
ballistic missiles every year starting in 2000 and build several
nuclear submarines of the Yuri Dolgoruky class armed with ballistic
missiles. It must also modernize its control, early warning and
space intelligence systems, he said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A public offer of 25 million government shares in
the Contracting and Marine Services Co. has been oversubscribed by
2.8 times, the underwriter of the subscription announced Tuesday.
	   The shares were offered at a total of 9.25 million dinars (dlrs
30.2 million) in a two-week subscription that ended Sept. 30.
	   The Kuwait Financial Center said in an advertisement published
in Al-Rai Al-Amm daily that the government has therefore decided to
raise the offer by 1.2 million shares.
	   The 25 million shares represented 33.3 percent of the company's
stock. In November, the state auctioned 10 million shares, or 13.3
percent of the stock, for 3.7 million dinars (dlrs 12.1 million).
The state will keep a nominal stake in the company.
	   The sell-off is part of a government plan to privatize the
economy which is dominated by the public sector.
	   CMS was established in 1973. Its paid-up capital is 7.3 million
dinars (dlrs 23.85 million).

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Three local Lebanese banks plan to merge
in the first move of its kind since a law was passed in 1991 to
facilitate bank mergers, the An-Nahar newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Al-Mughtareb Bank, the United Bank of Lebanon and the National
Trust Bank will be merged into the National Trust Bank with a
paid-up capital of dlrs 57 million, the paper said.
	   It added that the plan still needs the Central Bank's approval.
	   The majority of shares of the merged banks would go to a group
of Lebanese and Saudi Arabian investors and the Ark Financial
Group, an investment company that was established with combined
Lebanese, Saudi and Gulf capital last December.
	   The company last week raised its capital from dlrs 16 million to
dlrs 42 million, An-Nahar said.

	   First quarter assets of offshore banking units amounted to dlrs

	   BMA is the island's central bank.
	   Meanwhile, the BMA report showed that total assets of the
island's commercial banks fell slightly in the second quarter of
1998 to dlrs 11.27 billion dinars compared with dlrs 11.29 billion
in the first quarter.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi American Bank, which is
partially owned by Citicorp of the United States, made a net profit
of 883 million riyals (dlrs 245.5 million) in the first nine months
of 1998, al-Eqtisadiah newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The profit was an increase of 13.7 percent from 776 million
riyals (dlrs 207 million) a year earlier, the paper said.
	   The newspaper quoted the bank's general manager, Isa al-Isa, as
saying that the profit increase was a result of a tight control of
expenses and gains from investment portfolios.
	   He added that the bank has no major investments in emerging
markets which have been badly hit by global financial turmoil.
	   The Saudi American Bank, in which Citicorp owns a 30 percent
stake, is a leading commercial bank in Saudi Arabia. It is listed
on the local stock market.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Army commander Gen. Emile Lahoud will be
Lebanon's next president after Syria, the power-broker in the
country, approved his name, officials and news reports said
Tuesday.
	   ``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri told Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday, which
was headlined on the front-page of As-Safir, a leftist newspaper.
	   Lebanese media said the matter was settled at a Monday meeting
in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller
neighbor.
	   Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said
Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member
Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.
	   The election is a formality since other candidates have little
chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind Lahoud. In
another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend
the constitution, which forbids senior public servants from running
for president.
	   The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi
leaves office at the end of his six-year term.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a
55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite
Muslim.
	   Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth
running of the government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship
with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change was expected in
government policy.
	   Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of
the next head of state.
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the
United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home and
has good relations with Syria.
	   But the choice could not have been sealed before a final say
from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this country. His word is
referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.''
	   Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army
commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during
the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the
55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias. In
Lebanon, the army commander heads the air force, navy and the
ground forces.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Edith Stein, the Orthodox Jew-turned-Catholic nun
whom Pope John Paul II is elevating to sainthood, once offered her
life in atonement for the sins of her ``unbelieving'' people.
	   Today, those words of Stein, who was killed in the gas chambers
of Auschwitz, make Catholics as uncomfortable as they make Jews
angry.
	   Church officials avoid mentioning them as they prepare for
Saturday's canonization of Stein _ a woman who embodied the
conflicts and contradictions facing John Paul's papacy as it tries
to come to terms with the Holocaust, and with Jews.
	   A German-born convert, Stein appealed to Pope Pius XII in 1933
to speak out against the Nazis. Jewish groups have since condemned
the pope for failing to say more as the Holocaust gathered.
	   Yet when the Catholic bishops of the Netherlands did speak out,
the Nazis retaliated by shipping Stein and other converts to
Auschwitz _ the very kind of retaliation that Pius would have
risked if he had been more outspoken, his supporters say.
	   In Rome, posters heralding the upcoming ceremony in St. Peter's
Basilica are taped in scattered churches. The woman in them stares
out of a sepia photo, her eyes gleaming, intelligent, unreadable.
	   ``Edith Stein,'' the lettering says, naming the oval of a face
under a nun's wimple. The name she chose in the church _ ``Teresa,
Blessed of the Cross'' _ appears almost as an afterthought.
	   Jewish leaders loudly protested Stein's 1987 beatification,
saying her martyrdom was not the Catholic church's to claim. Her
canonization is approaching far more quietly.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center reserved its public protests for
last weekend's beatification of Alojzije Stepinac, a Croatian
cardinal accused by some of collaboration with a Nazi-backed
government.
	   ``For us, these two steps taken by the Vatican should give us
cause to reflect on the damage inflicted upon us by the two major
scourges of the 20th century in Jewish terms: anti-Semitism and
assimilation,'' said Ephraim Zuroff of the Wiesenthal center's
office in Israel.
	   ``And it's unfortunate that people whose lives represented those
two phenomena are being canonized by the Catholic church,'' Zuroff
said.
	   Born on Yom Kippur, Stein before conversion acquired a wide
reputation in the phenomenology school of philosophy that is said
to be important to the current pope. Her teacher said she was the
best doctoral student he ever had _ and he taught Martin Heidegger.
	   Stein was an atheist before she joined the Catholic church in
1922. She credited Catholicism with leading her back to
appreciation of Judaism.
	   ``Kristallnacht,'' the Nazis' three-day attack on Jews and
Jewish institutions in November 1938, made clear the danger in
Germany. She fled to Holland with her sister, Rosa, who also had
converted.
	   There, she wrote the spiritual last will and testament required
of Carmelite nuns. In it, she offered her life ``for the sins of
the unbelieving people, so the Lord will be accepted by his own.''
	   When the 1942 order came sending Holland's Jewish converts to
Auschwitz, Stein took her sister by the hand.
	   ``Come, Rosa. We're going for our people.''
	   In canonizing her, the church had to waive the requirement that
there be relics of her body. They went up the chimneys at
Auschwitz.
	   Also waived was the usual testimony on whether she kept her
faith to the end. Any witnesses to that went up the chimneys as
well.
	   Stein became one of at least five Holocaust figures whose
canonization has been initiated under John Paul. That's not
counting the wartime pope, Pius, also proposed for veneration.
	   Under John Paul, more saints have been named than under any
other papacy; the pope believes strongly in the process for its
power to set examples.
	   ``We see her canonization as a unique opportunity for Jews and
Catholics and for reflection and reconciliation,'' said the Rev.
Remi Hoeckman, secretary of the Vatican's commission for relations
with Jews.
	   ``It in no way lessens, but in reality strengthens, our need to
honor the 6 million Jews who died in the Shoah,'' Hoeckman said.
	   As Stein's canonization approaches, he said, it would be wrong
to focus exclusively on one of the most divisive aspects _ her own
statement of atonement for the sins of her ``unbelieving people.''
	   ``Then we betray her as we were betraying the Jewish people,''
Hoeckman said.
	   In one of the few accounts of Stein's last days after she was
taken to the camps on Aug. 7, 1942, testimony quotes a camp guard
as putting a crucial question to her: What faith was she?
	   Catholic, she said.
	   The Nazi guard chose otherwise: ``You damn Jew, stand there,''
he said.

Malaysia to retain currency controls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agreement not to discuss Anwar's arrest in new
grafs 7-8 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Malaysia will retain sweeping foreign
exchange controls it imposed last month until its ailing economy
stabilizes, a senior Malaysian official said Tuesday.
	   ``I think it has been made clear by the Central Bank that it
will continue until the situation improves, until stability is
restored,'' said Asmat Kamaludin, secretary-general of Malaysia's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
	   He said the controls would not likely restrict trade in
Malaysia, which has been driven into recession by Asia's 15-month
financial crisis.
	   The Malaysian controls imposed last month include a fixed
exchange rate, a ban on trading of the Malaysian currency and
stocks outside the country, and restrictions that went into effect
Oct. 1 limiting amounts of local and foreign currency that
travelers can take with them.
	   The measures have insulated Malaysia for the time being from
foreign speculation but have frightened away long-term investment
in manufacturing and technology that Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad wants.
	   Asmat is in Manila to attend a meeting at which trade ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are discussing plans
to lower barriers to free trade in the region.
	   Officials said the arrest and detention of former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, which many say could affect investors'
confidence in Malaysia, would not be discussed in the meetings.
	   ``We agreed to subordinate politics to economics,'' said
Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens will get at least two
posts _ foreign minister and environment minister _ in
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet, a Greens leader said
Tuesday.
	   Juergen Trittin will be in the environment post, said Gunda
Roestel, who co-chairs the Greens party with him. Joschka Fischer,
who co-heads the Greens faction in parliament, will take over the
Foreign Ministry, she said.
	   Roestel said the party had proposed two female candidates as
justice minister, adding that the talks with Schroeder's Social
Democrats were ``sharpening.''
	   Those talks resume Wednesday with government finances and
unemployment on the agenda. Cabinet posts were to be finalized at
the end of the talks, which run through next week.
	   The Greens said Sunday they wanted to name four ministers, at
least two of whom should be women.
	   Social Democratic lawmaker Ulla Schmidt on Tuesday also called
on Schroeder to appoint women to at least 40 percent of the top
jobs in his government.

Official: Ukraine seeks to export 2 million tons of wheat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is hoping to export 2 million
metric tons (2.2 million short tons) of wheat from its 1998
harvest, an agriculture official said Tuesday.
	   The former Soviet republic collected more wheat this year than
it needs domestically, even though the harvest was down overall
from 18 million metric tons (19.8 million short tons) last year to
14.5 million metric tons (15.95 million short tons) in 1998, said
Deputy Agriculture Minister Vasyl Yaroshovets.
	   Ukraine is looking for potential customers in the Middle East,
where demand is higher than in Europe for its relatively
low-quality wheat.
	   Ukraine had hoped to export some of the wheat to Russia because
of a poor harvest there this year, but Russia's debilitating
financial crisis has made the sale unlikely, Yaroshovets said.
	   Because of an overall drop in world grain prices in 1998,
Ukrainian wheat in September was selling for dlrs 85 to dlrs 90 a
ton, in contrast to dlrs 160 to dlrs 175 a ton last year, Interfax
said.

Commission President calls for new fraud unit in wake of scandals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Responding to accusations of a
cover-up, European Union Commission President Jacques Santer
proposed Tuesday to create an independent fraud unit after a slew
of fraud scandals hit the EU's executive office.
	   Santer agreed a new Fraud Investigation Office should be formed
to act ``in total independence from the Commission,'' after a draft
report from the EU parliament raised suspicions the Commission's
in-house fraud unit helped hide corruption.
	   ``Let us pledge ourselves to work together to instill a sense of
morality at all levels in the institutions so that all remaining
doubts can be dispelled,'' he told the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, France.
	   The parliament's draft report said ``the Commission's policy in
cases of corruption within its own ranks is still unclear and
inconsistent'' and added there was ``a tendency to cover up such
cases wherever possible.''
	   The draft report was already approved by the parliamentary
Committee on Budgetary Controls by 14 votes to 4 with one
abstention. The full parliament votes on the report Wednesday and
is expected to back the Committee.
	   The draft report severely criticized the UCLAF in-house fraud
unit and said ``the suspicion arises in some cases that UCLAF was
actually being used to cover up the truth.''
	   Santer strongly denied this. ``Your report makes an intolerable
insinuation,'' he said. ``I take this as a personal attack.''
	   Several recent fraud scandals have dented the Commission's
integrity. The Commission handles an annual budget of some dlrs 86
billion.
	   EU officials had investigated the disappearance of some 500,000
European currency units (dlrs 550,000) from Commission's
humanitarian aid coffers and one ECHO official has been suspended.
	   The missing funds were part of four aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994, totaling 2.4 million ecus
(dlrs 2.6 million).
	   EU Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has filed suit in a
French court case against Liberation newspaper for defamation after
the Paris daily alleged that Cresson, a former French prime
minister, was involved in irregularities in awarding a commission
contract.
	   Santer said that since 1995, the Commission had dealt with 49
cases of fraud and ``other forms of reprehensible behavior,'' and 8
officers were removed from their post.
	   The draft report drawn up by German deputy Herbert Bosch said
the Commission did not take action quickly enough when suspicions
were raised.
	   ``It cannot be denied that, when suspicions arise of malpractice
within its own ranks, the Commission refers such matters to the
competent judicial authorities only in exceptional cases,'' Bosch
wrote.
	   The Socialist group, the biggest in the 626-seat parliament also
criticized Santer's Commission.
	   ``The culture in respect of openness in the Commission has got
to change. There still is not a proper degree of exposure,'' said
Socialist leader Pauline Green.

EU parliament votes to lift Le Pen's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reaction from Munich prosecutor,
Jewish group; minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Parliament voted Tuesday
to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen so a German court can try him for calling the Nazi gas
chambers ``a detail'' in World War II history.
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift Le Pen's immunity, with six abstentions.
	   Munich prosecutors asked legislators in April to waive Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity, after the far-right leader told reporters
there that ``the gas chambers were a detail in the history of the
Second World War.''
	   Le Pen reacted angrily to the vote.
	   ``Let us not forget that I am the victim. It wasn't I who
invented the concentration camps, but the fathers, grandfathers and
uncles of my German colleagues,'' he said.
	   Judicial authorities in the German city want to charge Le Pen
under a law that makes it an offense to trivialize the Holocaust.
If tried and convicted, Le Pen could face up to five years in
prison.
	   In Munich, chief prosecutor Manfred Wick said his office will
launch an investigation as soon as they receive formal notice of
the parliament's decision.
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France,
welcomed the vote. ``By this decision, the European deputies refuse
to consider as defendable ... the expression of pure anti-Semitism
that consists of rendering banal, insignificant, the Shoah, the
industrial extermination of European Jews in gas chambers,'' the
council said in a statement.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against him would be an attack on free speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliaments are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''
	   Le Pen said his comments had not denied or minimized the gas
chambers and had been distorted by the Munich prosecutors. ``If
these comments have been interpreted in a way that made sincere
people suffer, I'm sorry,'' he said.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen was convicted in his homeland for assaulting
a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined 20,000 French francs (dlrs
3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.

Philippine Supreme Court acquits Imelda Marcos on graft charge

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court
acquitted former first lady Imelda Marcos of corruption Tuesday,
saving her from a 12-year prison term.
	   In an 8-5 vote, with one judge abstaining, the court overturned
the only verdict so far in which the widow of former President
Ferdinand Marcos had been found guilty of graft during her late
husband's strong-arm rule.
	   ``Thank God, once again the system works. Justice prevailed,''
Mrs. Marcos said in a statement.
	   An aide said Mrs. Marcos, 69, had been in seclusion for several
days, praying for an acquittal.
	   Mrs. Marcos gained notoriety for an extensive shoe collection
and lavish lifestyle at a time when most Filipinos were mired in
poverty.
	   She and her late husband were accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his 20-year presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.
	   A special anti-graft court had found Mrs. Marcos guilty on two
corruption charges in 1993.
	   In January of this year, a Supreme Court panel acquitted her on
one charge but upheld her conviction on the second charge, which
carried a maximum prison term of 12 years. She was also fined 189
million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   The panel, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos to appeal the ruling one
final time to the entire Supreme Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans had
been accused of entering into five unfavorable contracts involving
a government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Prosecutors said they awarded leases on property owned by the
rail line to the hospital foundation at excessively low rates. Dans
had been acquitted earlier.
	   It its ruling, the Supreme Court said Mrs. Marcos did not
personally sign the leases and it was not proven that the prices
were ``grossly and manifestly disadvantageous'' to the government
as prosecutors had argued.
	   The court said the anti-graft court also violated rules of due
process in reaching its verdict, such as holding unscheduled and
informal discussions on the case outside its offices, allowing a
non-member of the court division to participate, and excluding a
member from the deliberations.
	   Mrs. Marcos' son, Ferdinand ``Bongbong'' Marcos Jr., said his
mother was elated.
	   ``People have berated her, people have ridiculed her, and in the
end this decision has proven that she was right,'' he said. ``She
is in exceedingly high spirits.''
	   President Joseph Estrada said the decision would not affect
government efforts to recover Marcos' alleged ill-gotten wealth. He
said talks have resumed with the Marcos family on a possible
division of the money between them and the government.
	   Mrs. Marcos still faces numerous other criminal and civil cases
related to her husband's rule.
	   She also faces a meeting Thursday with tax officials at the U.S.
Embassy to discuss charges she failed to pay more than dlrs 5
million in U.S. income taxes between 1986 and 1991, when the
Marcoses lived in exile in Hawaii.
	   In a letter to Mrs. Marcos obtained by The Associated Press, the
Internal Revenue Service said she also failed to file income tax
returns from 1992 to 1997.
	   It warned that a levy could be placed on her bank accounts and
other properties might be seized if she failed to attend the
meeting.

Noel Coward's apartment gets special interest preservation rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Noel Coward's London house where the playwright
lived and wrote much of his finest work has been designated of
special architectural and historic interest, Arts Minister Alan
Howarth said Tuesday.
	   Coward lived in one of two apartments at 17 Gerald Road in
London's chic Chelsea district from 1930 to 1956.
	   He made alterations, including a fixed stage for rehearsal and a
fixed desk at which he wrote, and added interior paneling, wrought
ironwork, a staircase and book cases.
	   The work reflected both traditional tastes of the time and
personal touches by a man whose teasing portrayals of the life the
English upper classes still delights millions.
	   The current owner of the apartment, an American, sought the
government listing, fearing the building would otherwise be
vulnerable to redevelopment.
	   Coward, who died in 1973, wrote 50 plays, 25 films and hundreds
of songs, poems and stories. His works include ``A Room with a
View,'' ``Private Lives,'' and ``A Song at Twilight.''
	   The government listing means that any alterations would require
special approval by the authorities, and the building is likely to
be preserved indefinitely.
	   Coward, who was knighted as Sir Noel Coward, left England in
1956 for tax exile in Bermuda, Switzerland and Jamaica.
	   Next year is the centenary of the playwright's birth.

Indonesia calls on Portugal to accept East Timor autonomy plan as
</HEADLINE>
final &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's foreign minister called on
Portugal Tuesday to accept its proposal to grant autonomy, not
independence, to East Timor as ``a final and peaceful solution''
for the troubled territory.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas' comments came as Indonesian and
Portuguese officials prepared to meet at the United Nations to
negotiate details of the autonomy plan.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has pledged to grant special
autonomy to East Timor in return for international recognition that
East Timor is an integral part of Indonesia.
	   ``We proposed that autonomy will be a final and peaceful
solution for East Timor,'' Alatas said.
	   Alatas said Portugal, however, seems to regard the autonomy plan
as only a temporary measure.
	   ``From their statements, I think Portugal considers this
proposal was only an intermediate solution,'' he said.
	   Separatists on the half-island territory, 2,000 kilometers
(1,200 miles) east of Jakarta, have demanded that a referendum be
held on self-determination.
	   However, the Indonesian government has repeatedly rejected the
idea, saying it could reopen old divisions and conflicts within
East Timorese society.
	   ``We cannot accept the idea of a referendum in East Timor since
it can cause trouble there,'' Alatas said.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it the following year. However, the United Nations has
never recognized Indonesia's sovereignty.
	   Since the invasion, East Timor has been wracked by human rights
abuses and guerrilla warfare.

ASEAN to accelerate free trade in bid to help crisis recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with ASEAN officials agreeing to speed
trade liberalization; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated4ls from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
said they set of goal of complete elimination of tariffs for many
products traded in the region by the year 2003, instead of their
previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5 percent by that
year.

<TEXT>
	   As a result, average tariffs will fall from 5.37 percent this
year to 2.68 percent in 2003, they said.
	   ASEAN also agreed to accelerate tariff cuts for some sensitive
agricultural products, such as rice and sugar, after Indonesia
offered to eliminate all tariffs on rice by the year 2010 within
the region.
	   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said
the measures showed that fears that ASEAN would backslide on its
free-trade commitments were unfounded and that tariffs are being
reduced despite the impact of the regional crisis.
	   But, he added: ``To come out of this crisis, ASEAN needs to have
all markets of the world kept open and liberalization commitments
kept on track.''
	   ASEAN officials said freer trade would help countries in the
region recover from the crisis by stimulating economic production
and attracting investment from outside the region.
	   ``We want to make this area an attractive area for investment
and trade,'' said Singaporean Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock
Suan.
	   Lee said that despite the severity of the crisis, the
``fundamentals that make ASEAN strong haven't disappeared.''
	   In a statement, the ASEAN officials noted that inter-ASEAN trade
rose 4.7 percent last year and that export growth remains strong.
	   But Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo noted that flows of
investment into Southeast Asia have plunged by 50 percent since the
regional financial crisis erupted in July 1997.
	   On Thursday, ASEAN trade ministers are expected to sign an
agreement creating an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove
barriers to investment from ASEAN countries by the year 2010 and by
2020 for investment from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country would be
granted the same privileges in areas such as land ownership and
investment rights as their counterparts in another ASEAN country in
which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions where a
country's constitution limits equal treatment.
	   Thailand's Supachai said he would propose to his counterparts
that the AIA's target date of 2010 should be brought forward.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Denmark to legalize prostitutes, tightens law on child
</HEADLINE>
prostitution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prostitution, already widely
tolerated in Denmark, would become legal under a new law the
government announced Tuesday that it will propose.
	   Current law bans prostitution as a main source of income.
Pimping also is illegal under current law, and would remain so
under the proposed new measure.
	   The proposal also aims to clamp down on child prostitution,
prohibiting the purchase of sexual services from anyone under age
18.
	   In announcing the proposal, the government said it was not
supporting prostitution per se but wanted to decriminalize it
because its is a social issue rather than a criminal one.
	   Over the summer, a majority of lawmakers said it would support
such a bill. The measure was presented by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen when Parliament reconvened Tuesday after its summer
recess.
	   The move as Denmark's Scandinavian neighbor Sweden is clamping
down on prostitution. Beginning in 1999, the purchase of all sexual
services will be illegal in Sweden, although prostitution itself
will not be criminalized.

Ukraine's parliament rejects president's new pension payments

scheme &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Tuesday rejected
President Leonid Kuchma's proposal to strip post offices of their
exclusive right to dispense the country's pensions.
	   The vote sinks Kuchma's plan to introduce an entirely new system
of pension payments in Ukraine, which would have distributed
pensions through commercial banks.
	   The leftist-dominated legislature voted 226-25 to reject the
bill, automatically blocking the introduction of the new scheme.
	   Kuchma had said the new plan would have saved the government 300
million hryvna (dlrs 88 million).
	   But the parliament's committee for pensioners and war veterans
argued that using banks to distribute pensions would cause 6,000
post offices to close, forcing about 25,000 people out of their
jobs.

Iraq criticizes U.N. compensation program of Gulf War victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. plan to compensate victims of the
1990-91 Gulf crisis from Iraqi oil sales is misguided and
politically motivated, Iraq said Tuesday.
	   ``Iraq has said that most of the demands for war compensation
are imaginary, illegal and baseless,'' Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Compensation awards approved by a U.N. commission are paid using
Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
requests for a total of dlrs 240 billion from individuals,
governments and corporations seeking compensation for loss and
damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
	   Since its inception, the commission awarded millions of dollars
for companies and individuals.
	   Ramadan's letter was carried by the Iraqi News Agency.

Bowie tops Beatles in British survey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a knack for reinventing his image and music
to suit the times, David Bowie outpaced the Beatles as the top
music star of the past 30 years in a poll of his British
contemporaries.
	   The 51-year-old rock icon was named the most important act of
the last three decades, according to the survey of pop stars,
musicians, critics and industry figures.
	   The poll was conducted by London listings magazine Time Out to
mark its 30th birthday, with votes from the likes of Culture Club's
Boy George and Mick Hucknall of Simply Red. The magazine did not
say how many people were polled.
	   Bowie released his first album 31 years ago and has been at the
forefront of glam rock, '70s soul, and '80s funk, as well as being
the leader of a full-fledged _ but critically ridiculed _ rock
band, Tin Machine.
	   His skills as a collaborator have given a springboard to the
careers of Mott The Hoople, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop.
	   And even in the past year, his ``Let's Dance'' single was used
as the inspiration for Puff Daddy's hit ``Been Around The World,''
while his career has been the loose inspiration for Ewan McGregor's
new film, ``Velvet Goldmine.''
	   Rounding out the top 10 were the Beatles, Bob Marley, James
Brown, Marvin Gaye, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, Kraftwerk, Iggy
Pop and Bob Dylan.

Kohl's party chooses new leader amid calls for renewal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl critic abstaining in vote; Ruehe quote &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Amid calls for revitalizing the party by
promoting younger members and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
defeated Christian Democrats closed ranks Tuesday behind a new
leader _ Kohl's own right-hand man.
	   The party's executive committee voted unanimously, with one
abstention, to recommend as chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's
parliamentary faction leader and the man he handpicked as his
replacement. A final vote is to be made at a party convention on
Nov. 7.
	   The choice of Schaeuble came despite criticism from some party
members that a bolder break was needed from Kohl, who led the
Christian Democrats in last week's election to its worst showing in
50 years.
	   Kohl insisted there was ``no bitterness'' during the closed
meeting.
	   ``There was no criticism at all directed at me,'' he said.
``Others were criticized for what they said before the session,''
he added, apparently referring to calls for party renewal while
refusing to name names.
	   The Christian Democratic Union has dominated German postwar
politics by attracting a wide range of conservative voters. But
young members in particular worry that the party has lost touch
with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and his
16 years as chancellor.
	   Saxony state governor, Kurt Biedenkopf, a longtime Kohl critic,
said he abstained in voting for Schaeuble because he didn't think
one person should head both the party and the parliamentary faction
_ like Kohl did.
	   But outgoing defense minister Volker Ruehe, who was believed to
covet the top party job himself, backed off his earlier criticism
of Kohl's push for Schaeuble.
	   ``We're on a good path toward the right generational mix,''
Ruehe said.

Amid growing tensions, plant director killed in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A factory director in North Ossetia was shot and
killed and his deputy seriously injured in the latest violent
incident in Russia's restive southern regions, a news agency said
Tuesday.
	   Soslav Sumenov, the 36-year-old director of a corn-processing
plant, was killed Monday outside a house in the center of the North
Ossetian capital, Vladikavkaz, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   His deputy, Erik Tandelov, was hospitalized with multiple
gunshot wounds.
	   Sumenov had complained about threats and extortion attempts
against him, and police believe the killing was linked to Sumenov's
work, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   North Ossetia, which is located near Chechnya, has been plagued
by spillover violence from the breakaway region as well as its own
ethnic conflicts.
	   Meanwhile, security forces in Ingushetia, which borders
Chechnya, held exercises Tuesday to ``improve their actions in
different circumstances and contingencies,'' the chief of staff of
Ingushetia's Internal Ministry, Shamil Dachayev, was quoted as
saying. No other details were given.
	   Russia's Caucasus Mountains have been plagued by kidnappings and
other crimes since the end of Chechnya's two-year war for
independence ended in 1996. Hundreds of Russians and foreigners
have been abducted by gangs seeking ransom, and dozens are still
being held.
	   An official from the Russian government mission in Chechnya,
Akmal Saidov, was kidnapped, tortured and killed last week. He was
buried in Moscow on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian lawmakers Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the nationalities
committee, called the killing a ``brazen political assassination
aimed at torpedoing all peace agreements signed between Moscow and
(Chechnya's capital) Grozny,'' Interfax reported.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander working for a British phone
company were kidnapped over the weekend. Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin expressed ``deep concern'' over the
kidnappings, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``The kidnappings of foreigners ... can be regarded only as a
challenge to the present Chechen leadership and to the world
community,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov planned to meet with
parliamentary deputies on Thursday to discuss the ``political
crisis'' in the republic and opposition calls for Maskhadov's
resignation, Chechnya's deputy premier Turpal Atgeriyev said,
according to Interfax.
	   Maskhadov was also planning to meet with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday to discuss the increasing tensions.
The announcement has riled Chechen opposition leader Shamil
Basayev, who had led a five-day demonstration against Maskhadov in
Grozny.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke's statement appeared to signal that
international military action was a step closer. If more Serb
forces don't pull out of the province as demanded, NATO
intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   Before heading back to Belgrade for more talks with Milosevic,
Richard Holbrooke met with ethnic Albanian political leaders, who
have refused to negotiate until Milosevic halts the seven-month
crackdown that has killed hundreds and driven more than a quarter
million people from their homes.
	   An ethnic Albanian source familiar with the talks between
Holbrooke and Ibrahim Rugova said the American told the ethnic
Albanian leader that the ``NATO threat of airstrikes is no bluff,
and that all is now up to the Serbian side.''
	   Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic in
the Yugoslav capital Belgrade.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke in difficult talks Monday night that
his government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   His defiant comments came after a meeting that lasted several
hours in which Holbrooke told the Yugoslav president of the ``the
grave situation we are facing.''
	   ``If he thinks NATO is bluffing, if he is willing to take that
risk, all I can do is convey the views of the U.S. government,''
Holbrooke told reporters in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia. But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with
Milosevic, and Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere to
any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army called on NATO
Tuesday to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman
last month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said:
``The Serbian war machine and its military and political structure
must be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.
	   ``It is necessary that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in
Florence, Italy. ``Combat must cease. If that is not the case, a
NATO intervention will become inevitable.''
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
Monday that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making
false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.

Thailand's Bangkok Land makes big sale to British investment firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One of Thailand's largest financially
ailing property companies, Bangkok Land, said Tuesday it has signed
an agreement to sell 1.80 billion baht (dlrs 46.2 million) worth of
its real estate holdings to an investment fund based in Britain.
	   The properties sold to the Asian Opportunities Fund of the
British-based Jupiter International Group account for 3.6 percent
of Bangkok Land's total assets of 50 billion baht (dlrs 1.3
billion), said public relations manager Sunithi Plenghri-ngam.
	   The Asian Opportunities Fund invests mainly in property assets
in Asia. Jupiter International Group is affiliated with Commerzbank
A.G. of Germany.
	   The sale includes 250 condominium units and two pieces of land
in Bangkok at market prices, Sunithi said, adding that it is the
company's biggest sale of assets since Thailand's financial crisis
began in July last year.
	   The Asian Opportunities Fund is expected make payment later this
month, she said.

Owen says NATO credibility depends on military action vs. Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Lord David Owen, former European Union peace envoy
to Yugoslavia, said Tuesday that NATO's future credibility depends
on a military intervention to halt the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``In the last 8-10 years there has been a tendency for NATO to
speak loudly but never actually to use the stick,'' Owen told
reporters while attending an international humanitarian aid
conference in Geneva.
	   ``NATO's credibility matters to everybody in Europe and indeed
in the world and having uttered these threats, then I think they
have got to make good on them.''
	   NATO countries, who have been preparing for action, Tuesday were
considering a report from U.N. chief Kofi Annan before deciding
whether to use military force to stop the Serb offensive against
ethnic Albanians in the southern Yugoslav province.
	   Kosovo Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province 9-to-1.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States have
said there is sufficient evidence in the report to justify action.
	   The possibility of air strikes to stop the Serb offensive is
becoming inevitable, Owen said. The U.N. Security Council must give
NATO the go-ahead to intervene militarily.
	   Between 1992 and 1994 Owen joined U.N. envoys Cyrus Vance of the
United States and then Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway in protracted
efforts to mediate an end to the fighting among Serbs, Croats and
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   He said it would be ``culpable negligence'' by NATO to carry out
air strikes without backing them up with ground forces. Air strikes
were necessary but Yugoslavia would be able to cope with them.
	   ``They (the Serbs) have to be faced by a serious strategy. The
thing Milosevic will take very seriously, the real deterrent, is
seeing the evidence of an assembling of ground forces in and around
the former Yugoslavia, ready to come into Kosovo at an instant
order,'' the British politician said.
	   ``I think there is a great danger of retaliation on the civilian
population as a result of any military action taken by NATO.
	   Military intervention would not only halt massacres, but would
also prevent a humanitarian crisis this winter and create a
framework of impartiality in which serious negotiations about
autonomy could take place, Owen said.
	   Ground troops currently based in Bosnia could be transferred to
Kosovo very quickly, he said.
	   The United Nations has demanded that Milosevic call a
cease-fire, pull Serb Army and special police forces out of areas
where guerrilla groups are seeking independence from Yugoslavia and
negotiate with ethnic Albanians, perhaps returning the autonomy
they lost in 1989.

Swissair working on further compensation for Flight 111 families
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking at
making payments of up to dlrs 137,000 to families of those killed
in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a spokesman for the airline
said Tuesday.
	   The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability
under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any
responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.
	   No date could be given for payments, which would be deductible
from a future settlement, he added. Exact entitlements have yet to
be established.
	   All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York to
Geneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea off
Peggy's Cove. The causes of the crash have not been determined.
	   Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families an
immediate dlrs 20,000 payment to cover their expenses. More than
130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.
	   Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years have
opted out of a dlrs 75,000 liability cap for people killed or
injured during international flights.
	   The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been served
with a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former U.S. boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiring
problems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ a possible cause of
the accident _ and did little to correct them.

German Jewish leader doubts Holocaust Memorial will be built
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) - The head of Germany's Central Council of
Jews was quoted Tuesday as saying he no longer expects a planned
Holocaust Memorial to be built in Berlin.
	   In an interview with the Dresden-based Saechsischen Zeitung,
Ignatz Bubis reacted to the outcome of the Sept. 27 elections won
by the leftist Social Democrats and chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who has said he is for reconsidering the project.
	   Ten days before the election, Bubis told Der Tagesspiegel
newspaper in Berlin that if Chancellor Helmut Kohl lost, there
would be no memorial. Kohl was the project's staunchest backer.
	   ``I believe a decision has been made,'' Tuesday's report quoted
Bubis as saying.
	   ``The initiators wanted to erect a memorial by non-Jews to
remember the murdered Jews of Europe. In my view that is a gesture
that is needed.''
	   Kohl last month backed off his pledge to push ahead with the
memorial before the elections, saying he didn't want it to become a
campaign issue.
	   Schroeder has said he is not against the memorial in principle,
but wasn't sure whether the chosen site and the scale of the
project are appropriate.
	   The leading design, by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman, envisions
a labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a cemetery. Critics
complain it is too monumental and wrong for the site, just south of
the historic Brandenburg Gate.

Radio: Uganda deploys troops along Sudanese border after bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army deployed troops to two Uganda
towns near the border with Sudan after they were bombed by a
Sudanese plane, a radio station said Tuesday.
	   The troops were sent to Adjumani and Pakele, about 350
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Kampala, where bombs wounded
six people on Saturday, the private Central Broadcasting Service
said.
	   ``The army has been deployed in Adjumani and is capable of
destroying Sudanese planes,'' the radio quoted regional commander,
Col. Julius Oketa, as saying. ``There should be no fear.''
	   The report could not be independently verified, and the military
spokesman could not be reached for comment. The broadcast did not
say how many troops had been deployed.
	   The aircraft dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani,
goverment and aid officials said Monday.
	   They fell near the Adjumani offices of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees and the U.N. World Food Program, and in
the compound of a dlrs 9 million government hospital recently
opened by President Yoweri Museveni.
	   About 158,756 refugees from Sudan's 15-year civil war live in
more than two dozen settlements in the area.
	   Uganda has protested the bombing, but the Sudanese government
denies carrying out the attack.
	   Sudan has repeatedly charged that both Uganda and Eritrea are
backing the latest offensive by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army in southern Sudan.
	   Both countries have denied the allegations.
	   On Sunday, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir repeated charges
that Museveni had sent troops into southern Sudan and threatened to
take the war to Uganda.
	   ``The battles with Museveni will not be confined to the southern
Sudan jungles alone,'' el-Bashir was quoted as saying in the
independent newspaper Akhbar al-Youm.
	   The Sudanese media said an estimated 600 Eritreans are fighting
in Sudan. It said among those killed was an Eritrean officer,
identified as Omar Tashombi, who commanded artillery units.
	   Sudanese rebels, drawing support from Christians and followers
of tribal religions, have been waging a military campaign against
the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 1983 for more autonomy
for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An army commander will become Lebanon's
next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the
country's powerbroker, official reports said Tuesday.
	   ``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a
telephone conversation Monday that was headlined Tuesday on the
front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir.
	   Lebanese media said the matter was settled at a Monday meeting
in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller
neighbor.
	   Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said
Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member
Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.
	   The election is a formality since other candidates have little
chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In
another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend
the constitution, which forbids senior public servants from running
for president.
	   The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi
leaves office at the end of his six-year term.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a
55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite
Muslim.
	   Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth
running of the government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship
with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change was expected in
government policy.
	   Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of
the next head of state.
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the
United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home and
has good relations with Syria.
	   But the choice could not have been sealed before a final say
from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this country. His word is
referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.''
	   Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army
commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during
the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the
55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias. In
Lebanon, the army commander heads the air force, navy and the
ground forces.
	   Lahoud will become the second army commander to head the
country: Fouad Chehab was president from 1958-64.

Russia's leading wholesaler calls for reestablishing faith with
</HEADLINE>
westerners &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's wholesalers will not regain the trust of
western exporters or save their collapsing distribution system
unless the government admits it has wronged foreign investors, the
president of Russia's leading wholesale company said Tuesday.
	   ``We have to say, `Hey, we've made some stupid mistakes, but
we're not like the others, and we'll pay off our debts,''' said
Stanislav Anisimov, head of Roscontract. ``This is problem No. 1.''
	   Russia's reliance on imports makes it crucial that the country
resurrect its collapsed trade system as soon as possible, he said.
The government says 48 percent of the country's consumer goods are
imported.
	   Imports are expected to drop by 20 percent by the end of 1998,
in part because foreign creditors have no guarantees they will be
paid for helping Russian wholesalers buy foreign goods.
	   Some officials have said Russia's far-flung regions face serious
food shortages because widespread bank collapses have wrecked a
reliable distribution system for imports. Without banks, importers
cannot get money from their Russian buyers.
	   Anisimov played down these fears, saying a strong enough system
of Russian wholesalers was set up in the last few years to provide
the regions with basic goods, if not luxury items.
	   ``The biggest wholesalers are buying up the most necessary goods
and will send them to the regions,'' he said. ``We do have a
mechanism set up that will help us get out of this crisis.''
	   Still, he stressed that the country's punishing tax system
doesn't allow most wholesalers to form a reliable network for
covering Russia's vast distances. ``If we could take on a western
tax scheme, we could give companies a chance to stand on their own
two legs,'' he said.

Spice Girls' ex-chauffeur challenges gag order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls' former chauffeur went to court
Tuesday to challenge a gag order that prevents him from writing a
book about the pop group.
	   Paul Attridge, 31, is seeking to overturn an injunction granted
to the group in June by a High Court judge.
	   Attridge's attorney, Kevin Garnett, told the judge that his
client wanted to write a book about his time with the group and had
only what amounted to ``tittle-tattle'' and trivia about the women
that came to him on the job.
	   Attridge had not deliberately eavesdropped or surreptitiously
gathered data, Garnett said.
	   The Spice Girls, best-known for their hit ``Wannabe,'' sought
the injunction after an article in a Sunday newspaper in May in
which Attridge speculated about the reasons for Ginger Spice Geri
Halliwell leaving the group.
	   A judge subsequently ordered that Attridge must not disclose any
information relating to the girls' sexual or emotional lives, or
details relating to their business, legal or financial affairs or
their spending habits.
	   The four remaining Spice Girls and Halliwell already have sought
jail time for Attridge, claiming he violated the injunction by
failing to hand over unspecified ``confidential'' material in his
possession.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Opening Sweden's new Parliament on
Tuesday, Prime Minister Goeran Persson said the government should
make major strides heading in the next decade and opposition leader
Carl Bildt said it shouldn't last into next week.
	   Following Persson's speech to the Riksdag, whose members were
chosen in Sept. 20 elections, Bildt called for a declaration of
no-confidence in the government.
	   Persson remained prime minister after the elections, even though
his Social Democrats party got less than 37 percent of the vote,
its worst-ever showing in a national election.
	   The weak showing means the Social Democrats have remained the
governing party only by assembling an awkward cooperation with the
ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens.
	   ``After an election that involved a very significant decline for
the government party, the prime minister should step down and
prepare space for a government-building process under the
leadership of the parliament speaker,'' Bildt said in calling for
the vote of no-confidence, which could be held as early as
Thursday.
	   Bildt's conservative Moderates got just 22 percent of the vote
in the recent elections, but would be likley to get the support of
three other non-socialist parties in a no-confidence vote.
	   Together, the Social Democrats, Left and Greens have 190 of the
Riksdag's 349 seats and it is unlikely either of the two smaller
parties would support an effort to push the Social Democrats out of
power.
	   Nonetheless, Bildt's move keeps pressure on a government that
many Swedes fear will be ineffectual because of the unusual
alliance that keeps it afloat.
	   Persson, in his speech opening the parliament, declared that
``Sweden will step into the next decade with more jobs, greater
rights and widened cooperation.''
	   ``Sweden will contribute to forming Europe's future,'' he said.
``Membership in the European Union gives Sweden the possibility to
work for a continent characterized by democracy, solidarity and
openness.''
	   That statement underlined one of the potential weaknesses of the
government. Both the Left and the Greens are strongly opposed to
Sweden's membership in the EU and are expected to push for a
referendum on whether Sweden should permanently stay out of the
bloc's common-currency system.

Two French citizens shot in Cambodian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Frenchmen, including a French
Embassy employee, were shot and wounded in what appeared to be a
robbery attempt, the embassy said Tuesday.
	   The embassy employee, a policeman whose name was not disclosed,
pulled up to his friend's home in a car with diplomatic license
plates late Monday night, and two armed Cambodians approached each
side of the vehicle and threatened its occupants, a French Embassy
spokesman reported.
	   The driver attempted to flee and the attackers opened fire, the
embassy said. The driver was shot in the left arm, and one
passenger _ described only as a French businessman _ was shot in
the right arm and chest.
	   The victims drove straight to a local hospital and were treated
for their injuries.
	   The embassy said it appeared the attack was an attempted
robbery, but police said Tuesday they had not ruled out other
motives.
	   ``We have not reached any conclusion on whether the attack was a
robbery or connected to a personal dispute,'' said Yim Siekmony, a
district police chief.

Poles to get dlrs 4.6 million for pension reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland will receive dlrs 4.6 million from
the United States for Western-style pension reforms that would make
retirement payments dependent on employee contributions to state or
private funds.
	   Under an agreement signed Tuesday, the money funneled through
the U.S. Agency for International Development by the year 2000 will
be spent on an information campaign, training and supervision of
funds, according to U.S. Ambassador Daniel Fried.
	   He called Poland's pension reforms vital for completing the
former East Bloc nation's transformation from communism to
democracy and a market economy.
	   ``Poland's success is important for us,'' Fried said after
signing the agreement with Ewa Lewicka, Poland's top pension reform
official.
	   The new system, which will replace an obsolete communist-era
social security fund, will be launched Jan. 1, 1999.
	   It offers working Poles the possibility of larger pensions than
the current scheme, which provides meager payments not directly
related to workers' contributions.
	   The new plan also will ease the burden on the strained national
budget by eliminating subsidies for social security payments.
	   Heavy subsidies to cover average payments of 720 zlotys (dlrs
205) a month to 7.5 million pensioners amounted to 3.8 billion
zlotys (dlrs 1.08 billion) in 1996, the same as total spending on
culture and higher education.
	   The U.S. aid agency previously gave dlrs 1.7 million for
Poland's pension reforms. Since the fall of communism in 1989, the
U.S. government has contributed nearly dlrs 1 billion to support
Poland's market reforms, Fried said.

World Bank sees lower growth rate in South Asia till year 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Despite a forecast drop in growth
rate this year and in 1999, the World Bank expects South Asia will
be the fastest economically growing region in the world until the
year 2000.
	   This is a historic first for this region, the World Bank said in
a statement received Tuesday.
	   It forecast a growth rate of 4.6 percent this year and 5.5
percent in 1999. This compares to an average growth of 5.7 percent
in the last seven years.
	   But still South Asia _ India, Pakistan and Bangladesh _ is
expected to be the fastest growing region in the world, the World
Bank said.
	   ``This is the first time in recorded history that the region has
accomplished this distinction,'' according to the statement.
	   A risk for South Asia, however, is the possibility that the
global economy may sink deeper into recession. And there are risks
specific to the region, the statement said.
	   For example Pakistan faces a difficult time because of economic
sanctions imposed following its testing of nuclear devices in May
in response to its neighbor India.
	   Pakistan, which is scrambling to get billions of dollars worth
of loans, has warned that without international financing it may
have to seek a moratorium on the repayment of its external debt
worth dlrs 32 billion.

Bus, train drivers strike over violence; gangs on rise in Paris

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more police being deployed

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Attacks on bus and train employees triggered more
transit strikes Tuesday on more than a dozen lines in and around
Paris, leaving about 2 million commuters stranded or delayed.
	   The walkout that cut service by at least half was the latest to
hit French public transportation as a result of attacks, and it
came days after gang violence exploded during a wedding in Paris
last week.
	   Bus drivers on 12 lines in northern Paris joined the walkout
Tuesday after a driver was beaten and stabbed in the abdomen Monday
afternoon by a rider who wanted to be dropped off between two stops
near the Porte Brunet. The driver was hospitalized.
	   More than 200,000 riders on the RER D line linking the capital
with southern suburbs around Melun were stranded since Monday
afternoon by train drivers protesting an attack on an employee last
week.
	   A gang of youths attacked the employee, spraying him with a
paint can and striking him with it after he tried to stop them from
vandalizing the station at Le Ferte-Alais in the Essonne suburb
south of Paris.
	   Attacks on two drivers on the Evry-Ville-Nouvelle bus line in
Essonne set off a strike Monday afternoon.
	   Authorities had deployed some extra security guards on trains,
but unions were demanding more protection in a city where about 9
million depend on public transit daily.
	   Tuesday afternoon, the Paris transit authority RATP promised to
deploy 200 more elite CRS national police.
	   The authority also plans the rapid hiring of more 350 youths as
transit attendants, more than tripling the number already in the
Paris area, as part of the leftist government's youth jobs program.
	   Coming from disadvantaged areas, the youths are trained to
dissuade their aggressive peers from resorting to violence.

BayStars beat Swallows 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose doubled home the tying run and Takahiro
Saeki hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning as the Central
League's front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Yakult Swallows
4-1 at Yokohama Tuesday.
	   The BayStars are 5 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons and need two more victories _ or two Dragons losses _ to
clinch their first league pennant in 38 years and their second
ever.
	   The Baystars have six more games and the Dragons, who were idle
Tuesday, have seven.
	   Playing at the BayStars' home ground, the Swallows led 1-0 in
the first inning on Takahiro Ikeyama's one-run single.
	   But after the Baystars went ahead, relief pitcher Kazuhiro
Sasaki held the Swallows scoreless over the last 1 1/3 innings for
his 45th save this season, a Japanese professional record. The old
mark of 44 was set in 1988 by Taiwanese Kuo Yuan Tzu, who retired
from the Chunichi Dragons in 1996.
	   Saeki has nine homers this season.
	   No other Central League games were scheduled Tuesday.
	   In the Pacific League, the front-running Seibu Lions scored the
tie-breaking run in the fourth inning on Kintetsu third baseman
Norihiro Nakamura's error and went on to beat the Buffaloes 7-3.
	   The Lions are 3 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Nippon Ham
Fighters, who beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 3-1 at Chiba on catcher
Toshihiro Noguchi's two-run double in the three-run second inning.
	   The Lions will clinch their 13th pennant since 1982 if they win
two more games, or the Fighters lose two more games.
	   The Lions have eight games remaining and the Fighters two.
	   The Fukuoka Daiei Hawks have completed all their scheduled
games, while the Orix BlueWave were idle Tuesday.

Germany and Norway take first golds at cycling World Championships

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Germany and Norway picked up the
first gold medals of the Cycling World Championships Tuesday but
the real racing begins Wednesday with France's Jeannie Longo
defending her title in the elite women's time trial.
	   Germany's Trixi Worrack won the first gold of the 10-race
championships that end Sunday. Starting from the middle of the
30-strong field for the junior women's time trial, the 17-year-old
German was a surprise victor in a time of 23 minutes, 22.70
seconds, beating defending champion Olga Zabelinskaia of Russia
into second place by 5.44 seconds.
	   Setting off from a central square in the heart of the medieval
city of Maastricht, the cyclists powered along a 15.2 kilometer
(9.5 mile) course through the hills of the southern Limburg
province with temperatures around six degrees Celsius (43 degrees
Fahrenheit).
	   Thor Hushovd, 20, of Norway took the men's under-23 time trial
title in a time of 43 minutes 19.84 seconds. Frederic Finot of
France was second, 3.51 seconds back, and Italy's Gianmario Ortenzi
was third.
	   The under-23 men were the first riders of the week to take on
the Cauberg hill at the end of their 32.8 kilometer (20.6 mile)
time trial course. The one-kilometer (0.6-mile) climb rises steeply
out of the cafe-lined streets of downtown Valkenburg before the
cyclists hit a gentle descent to the finish line.
	   Although the climb did not pose many problems in the time
trials, it is expected to be a decisive point in the longer road
races when riders face it more than once. Riders in Sunday's elite
men's race have to tackle the hill a strength-sapping 15 times.
	   Defending champion Longo of France will hit the hill for the
first time Wednesday as she aims for her 13th world title in the
23-kilometer (14.5-mile) elite women's time trial.
	   The 39-year-old Frenchwoman, who says these will be her last
World Championships, was training separately from the rest of the
French team Tuesday because of her rocky relationship with her
national federation.
	   At last year's event in San Sebastian, Spain, Longo, Laurent
Jalabert and Laurent Brochard all picked up gold for France. The
dominant French also took six of 12 titles at this year's indoor
track World Cycling Championships.
	   But with Jalabert and Brochard not competing this year in the
wake of the doping scandal that enveloped the Tour de France, Longo
is France's best hope for gold.
	   Australians Anna Wilson, gold medallist in the recent
Commonwealth Games, and 1992 Olympic road race champion Kathy Watt
as well as local favorite Leontine van Moorsel will be among the
pack of younger riders aiming to knock Longo, who won her first
world title in 1985, off her throne.

Lukashenko: Belarus will give military aide to Serbs against NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus will give military help to
Yugoslavia if NATO decides to use airstrikes to end fighting in
Kosovo province, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said
Tuesday.
	   ``We will give Yugoslavia any support and help that our fellow
Slavs may need,'' Lukashenko told reporters. ``Anything the
Yugoslavs will need, we will provide, including military
(assistance).''
	   However, Belarus will not send troops to Kosovo because ``the
constitution forbids that,'' Lukashenko said.
	   Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader openly nostalgic for the
Soviet Union, frequently tries to defy and criticize the West and
has a history of troubled relations with western democracies.
	   ``The Yugoslavs can count on us. We will fulfill our obligations
under our agreement on friendship and cooperation,'' Lukashenko
said.
	   He said that Belarus ``supports'' neighboring Russia's position
in the conflict but is willing to go much further.
	   Moscow supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not independence
from Serbia, which like Belarus is a traditional ally and fellow
Orthodox Slavic country.
	   However, Russia strongly opposes military intervention in
Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Russia agrees with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's violent campaigns against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
most be stopped, and has. approved U.N. Security Council
resolutions that don't include the use of force.

E-W Europeans join forces in fighting crime, child porno,
</HEADLINE>
pollution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The 15 European Union nations and 11 neighbors
pledged to join forces Tuesday to fight against organized crime,
child pornography and cross-border pollution.
	   Their foreign ministers said in a statement after a one-day
meeting ``the prevention of, and the fight against, sexual
exploitation of children, in particular child pornography requires
concerted action.''
	   They added the smuggling of human beings ``is emerging more and
more frequently as a new and serious form of organized crime.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his country registered
some 17,000 cases of sexual abuse of children in 1997. He estimated
child pornography had a turnover last year of 1.5 billion marks
(almost dlrs 1 billion).
	   Jozef Sestak, Slovakia's deputy foreign minister, said his
country ``has become a transit country for prostitution,
pornography, sex and pedophile tourism.''
	   ``The problem of child prostitution requires a concerted
approach ... with police corps abroad in detecting and recording
child pornography and child sexual abuse for commercial purposes,''
he told the meeting.
	   The European ministers also vowed to boost cooperation in
matters of cross-border pollution from the Arctic Circle to the
Mediterranean.
	   ``We are aware of the international dimension of environmental
issues and the need to further strengthen the cooperation among
participants in this area,'' the ministers said in a joint

Owen says NATO credibility depends on military action vs. Serbs

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Lord David Owen, former European Union peace envoy
to Yugoslavia, said Tuesday that NATO's future credibility depends
on a military intervention to halt the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``In the last 8-10 years there has been a tendency for NATO to
speak loudly but never actually to use the stick,'' Owen told
reporters while attending an international humanitarian aid
conference in Geneva.
	   ``NATO's credibility matters to everybody in Europe and indeed
in the world and having uttered these threats, then I think they
have got to make good on them.''
	   NATO countries, who have been preparing for action, Tuesday were
considering a report from U.N. chief Kofi Annan before deciding
whether to use military force to stop the Serb offensive against
ethnic Albanians in the southern Yugoslav province.
	   Kosovo Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province 9-to-1.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States have
said there is sufficient evidence in the report to justify action.
	   Between 1992 and 1994 Owen joined U.N. envoys Cyrus Vance of the
United States and then Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway in protracted
efforts to mediate an end to the fighting among Serbs, Croats and
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   The possibility of air strikes to stop the Serb offensive is
becoming inevitable, Owen said. The U.N. Security Council must give
NATO the go-ahead to intervene militarily.
	   It would be ``culpable negligence'' by NATO to carry out air
strikes without backing them up with ground forces, he said. Air
strikes were necessary but Yugoslavia would be able to cope with
them.
	   ``They (the Serbs) have to be faced by a serious strategy. The
thing Milosevic will take very seriously, the real deterrent, is
seeing the evidence of an assembling of ground forces in and around
the former Yugoslavia, ready to come into Kosovo at an instant
order,'' the British politician said.
	   Ground troops based in Bosnia could be transferred to Kosovo
very quickly, Owen said. In the event of air strikes, they would
help stop retaliatory attacks by Serbs on civilians.
	   ``I think there is a great danger of retaliation on the civilian
population as a result of any military action taken by NATO,'' Owen
said.
	   Military intervention would not only halt massacres, but would
also prevent a humanitarian crisis this winter and create a
framework of impartiality in which serious negotiations about
autonomy could take place, he added.
	   The United Nations has demanded that Milosevic call a
cease-fire, pull Serb Army and special police forces out of areas
where guerrilla groups are seeking independence from Yugoslavia and
negotiate with ethnic Albanians, perhaps returning the autonomy
they lost in 1989.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Tuesday
he will speed up the passage of economic stimulus measures
including a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 52 billion) tax cut and 10
trillion yen (dlrs 74 billion) in new public spending.
	   Obuchi, who has been under intense pressure from Washington and
other nations to take quick action to bring Japan out of its
recession, also called on his Cabinet to boost the size of the
stimulus package, which he had initially proposed in August.
	   Earlier in the day, the government announced that Japan's
economy will likely shrink for a second straight year. Its forecast
of a 1.8 percent contraction reversed a previous forecast of 1.9
percent growth.
	   ``The world economy is facing a crisis that can't be ignored,''
Obuchi said in Parliament, where lawmakers were debating bills to
clean up Japan's biggest economic headache, its teetering banking
system. ``Reviving the economy is our biggest task.''
	   Japanese media reports said the package may win approval as soon
as mid-October.
	   The Tokyo stock market reacted positively to Obuchi's decision.
The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, closing at 13,021.64. On Monday,
worries about the health of Japan's economy had sent the Nikkei
plunging 2.08 percent to its lowest close in 12 years.
	   Tuesday's announcement by the Economic Planning Agency marks the
first time the Japanese economy has declined two years in a row
since 1955, when the government started calculating the gross
domestic product _ the sum of all goods and services produced
within the country.
	   The projected contraction is much steeper than last year's 0.7
percent, suggesting Japan's economic slide may only be worsening.
	   Andrew Shipley, economist at Schroders Securities in Tokyo, told
Dow Jones Newswires that the forecast was still ``on the optimistic
side.''
	   ``I still think the government is failing to appreciate just how
rapid the pace of economic deterioration is,'' he said.
	   The report blamed faltering domestic demand for new goods and
services and sharp declines in housing starts and business
investment in new factories and equipment.

Fearing attack, U.S. missions in Saudi to close Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The U.S. missions in Saudi Arabia
will close Wednesday to review security because of information that
the embassy in Riyadh is under threat of a terrorist attack, the
embassy said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The statement said the embassy in the capital, along with
consulates in the cities of Jiddah and Dhahran, would close until
Saturday to ``review present security measures and to implement
physical security enhancements.''
	   The missions generally are closed Thursday and Friday, in line
with local custom.
	   The statement said ``the U.S. government has received
information indicating a terrorist attack may be planned on the
American Embassy in Riyadh.'' It did not elaborate.
	   The embassy statement noted that a number of American embassies
and consulates ``have received threats of possible terrorist
activity'' since the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Saalam, Tanzania, in which 259 people were killed
and more than 5,000 injured.
	   The U.S. missions in the kingdom closed for a day in August
after retaliatory U.S. missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan.
	   The attack on Afghanistan was aimed at camps run by the exiled
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, whom the U.S. blamed for the
embassy bombings. The missiles in Sudan targeted a factory that the
U.S. said made a precursor for nerve gas and the Sudanese said made
pharmaceuticals.
	   Security for the 40,000 Americans working in the oil-rich
kingdom _ along with an estimated 5,000 military personnel _ has
been a priority following two fatal bombings aimed at U.S. troops.
	   Five American servicemen and two Indian nationals were killed in
an attack on a military center in Riyadh in November 1995. A truck
bombing in the eastern city of Dhahran in June 1996 killed 19 U.S.
airmen.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Searching for a breakthrough to
avert NATO airstrikes, a senior American envoy said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke's statement appeared to signal that
international military action was a step closer. If more Serb
forces don't pull out of the province as demanded, NATO
intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   Before heading back to Belgrade for more talks with Milosevic,
Richard Holbrooke met with ethnic Albanian political leaders, who
have refused to negotiate until Milosevic halts the seven-month
crackdown that has killed hundreds and driven more than a quarter
million people from their homes.
	   An ethnic Albanian source familiar with the talks between
Holbrooke and Ibrahim Rugova said the American told the ethnic
Albanian leader that the ``NATO threat of airstrikes is no bluff,
and that all is now up to the Serbian side.''
	   Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police still
maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international
demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke in difficult talks Monday night that
his government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are battling for
independence.
	   But he also called the threats of aggression against Yugoslavia
``a criminal act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian
villains, not the Albanian people,'' according to a statement
issued through state media.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia. But the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with
Milosevic, and Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic would adhere to
any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army called on NATO
Tuesday to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman
last month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said:
``The Serbian war machine and its military and political structure
must be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.
	   ``It is necessary that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in
Florence, Italy. ``Combat must cease. If that is not the case, a
NATO intervention will become inevitable.''
	   Allied leaders are still debating what form intervention would
take, and whether they are prepared after initial airstrikes to
send in troops to enforce the peace in Kosovo.
	   Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said ground forces
would be needed to back any peace agreement, for two reasons: ``To
secure that Milosevic just doesn't roll his gear out of the
barracks again and to secure that there are no attacks on Serbs''
by the KLA.
	   Lord David Owen, former European Union peace envoy to
Yugoslavia, said all the threats about intervention have put NATO's
credibility at stake.
	   ``In the last 8-10 years there has been a tendency for NATO to
speak loudly but never actually to use the stick,'' Owen told
reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.
	   ``Having uttered these threats, then I think they have got to
make good on them,'' he said.
	   He said it would be ``culpable negligence'' by NATO to carry out
airstrikes without backing them up with ground forces.

Unemployment rate in Germany sinks, lowest in nearly two years

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing conservative
government claimed credit Tuesday for the lowest jobless figure in
nearly two years. But the incoming center-left coalition said the
figure - 3.96 million - was still too high.
	   Unemployment nationwide now averages 10.3 percent, compared to
11.2 percent this time last year, the Federal Labor Office said.
	   In a familiar pattern since Germany was unified in 1990,
joblessness in the former communist East Germany - a whopping 16.3
percent - dragged up the figure across the country. Unemployment in
the former West Germany was 8.8 percent.
	   Joblessness, stuck above 4 million since November 1996, was a
key reason for the defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in national
elections last week, won by the Social Democrats on promises to put
Germans back to work.
	   The head of Germany's federal labor office in Nuremberg,
Bernhard Jagoda, attributed the drop to the outgoing government's
intensified job-creation policies, particularly in eastern Germany,
and to a strengthened economy.
	   Jagoda, however, said the 10.3 percent unemployment rate is
``unacceptably high, even if it has fallen by 0.9 percent on the
year.''
	   Reacting to the figures, Kohl accused the Social Democrats of
telling ``considerable lies during the election,'' by declaring his
attempts to fight joblessness would not succeed in bringing the
figure below 4 million.
	   Both Kohl's government spokesman and labor minister claimed
credit for the dip. ``The Kohl government's reforms are also
bearing fruit on the labor market,'' said outgoing Labor Minister
Norbert Bluem. ``No one can deny that anymore.''
	   But the Social Democrats' designated labor minister, Walter
Riester, said the lower jobless figure did not indicate a trend
toward an improved jobs market, citing an increase in long-term
unemployed.
	   Riester said the incoming center-left government would quickly
put in place a jobs program to fight unemployment among young
people. The program was the first initiative agreed by the Social
Democrats and their likely junior coalition partner, the Greens,
during talks that started last week.
	   The Social Democrats also repeated their key campaign pledge for
fighting unemployment: creation of a national alliance of
employers, unions and government officials to brainstorm on job
creation programs.
	   Business leaders and labor unions, meanwhile, called on the new
government to quickly implement job-creation policies. The problem
was not about to go away, they said.
	   A dip under the 4-million mark was not a sign ``that
unemployment is about to disappear on its own,'' said Ursula
Engelen-Kefer, deputy president of a federation of labor unions,
the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund.
	   And a key employers association, the Zentralverbandes des
Deutschen Handwerks, backed the roundtable alliance and called on
the incoming government to explore any measure that would ease
persistent joblessness.
	   The improvement in September's figures was largely expected. The
labor office had predicted earlier the rate would drop below 4
million in September and October, but that it may rise again in
November.
	   Germany's high unemployment is in part a result of its
reunification with East Germany in 1990, with massive economic
restructuring underway in that part of the country.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians already hard-hit by high prices and
shortages will face inflation of 200 percent and a sharp drop in
imports this year unless the country obtains urgent outside aid, a
top official said Tuesday in a litany of depressing economic
predictions.
	   Deputy Economy Minister Nikolai Shamrayev's warnings came while
Russia's finance minister and Central Bank chief were in Washington
seeking more cash from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Facing a nationwide labor protest Wednesday, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was to announce Tuesday night his plans for paying
overdue wages and pensions and tackling the economic crisis, which
has seen Russia's financial markets implode and its currency lose
60 percent of its value since August.
	   Shamrayev forecast that inflation would total 200 to 230 percent
in 1998, but that IMF aid could limit the rate to 100 percent.
Inflation spiked to 38.4 percent in September, the State Statistics
Committee said Tuesday. It was just 0.2 percent in July.
	   Imports, which have dominated Russian shelves in recent years,
will fall 20 to 23 percent by the end of the year, and exports will
fall 13 percent, he said. Industrial production will fall up to 6
percent.
	   Shamrayev warned that Russia's gross domestic product will
shrink by more than 5 percent this year, after initial projections
of long-awaited growth. Most analysts have said it could fall by as
much as 8 percent.
	   ``The reaction of the world financial community is vital to
correct the country's course,'' Shamrayev told a conference of gas
company executives and analysts in Moscow.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chief Viktor
Gerashchenko are trying to persuade the International Monetary Fund
to resume disbursement of a bailout loan. A high-level delegation
from the European Union is due in Moscow later this week.
	   Also Tuesday, Russia's new tax chief Georgy Boos announced that
the tax service had collected only 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 620
million) in September, 2 billion rubles (dlrs 133 million) less
than in the previous month, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The government regularly lacks money to pay millions of state
workers on time, but with the economy shriveling and most bank
accounts frozen, tax collection has become even more difficult in
recent weeks.
	   In another blow, Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom, by far Russia's
largest taxpayer, is proposing to pay most of its taxes through
barter, its chairman told Tuesday's gas conference. The company has
run up huge tax arrears, but also is owed billions of rubles
(dollars) by government-run agencies.
	   Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev also said the government would
probably sell its 5 percent stake in Gazprom within six weeks to
raise money because it looks unlikely to get any aid soon from the
IMF.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima
Nasrin, as well as Islamic extremists seeking her death for alleged
blasphemy, have both crossed the line, Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said Tuesday.
	   Extremists have been calling for the death of Nasrin, who
returned last month to Bangladesh. A newspaper quoted her in 1994
as saying the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten,
but she says she was misquoted.
	   ``The Islamic groups are overreacting ... but Taslima should
also know that there is limit to freedom of expression,'' Hasina
told The Associated Press in an interview in her first public
remarks about the protests now raging in the country.
	   Hasina said free speech ``does not mean the right to hurt one's
religious sentiments,'' but added her government would not allow
anyone to violate the law in response.
	   Nasrin has been in hiding since returning to Bangladesh last
month after four years of exile in Europe and the United States to
be with her mother, who has colon cancer. She has asked the
government to protect her from assassination because extremists
have offered a 200,000-taka (dlrs-5,000) reward to anyone who kills
her.
	   Asked about the writer's request, the prime minister said Nasrin
should face a warrant for her arrest and surrender.
	   ``She should go to the court. There is a rule of law in this
country,'' Hasina said. ``Her writings are vulgar, not feminist. I
being a woman can't read her books.''

Malaysia's ruling party begins choosing new deputy prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of Malaysia's ruling
party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that
will test the country's legal system.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could
``drop dead'' at any time. But because of the large number of
candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays
National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly.
	   The UMNO supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top
candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision.
	   The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the
favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak, son of a former Malaysian prime minister,
Abdul Razak Hussein.
	   Badawi, a Mahathir loyalist, was among the first to criticize
Anwar's reform movement, calling it an effort to garner public
sympathy from the streets. He returned from a tour of the United
States and meetings at the United Nations for Tuesday's
deliberations.
	   The party leaders, who have been conducting a national campaign
to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2,
will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has
banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.
	   Meanwhile, police asked the ruling coalition to cancel a giant
rally in the capital Saturday that had been aimed at drawing in the
youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform has the most appeal. An
opposition group had said it would stage an even bigger rally
later.
	   Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege from his
posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he
was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks
of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and
Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows
police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his
family and lawyers.
	   On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked by
the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent
weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government.
Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas
and water cannons, arresting more than 100 people.
	   ``They decided that the government should be brought down
through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama news agency quoted
Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He returned
to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting.
	   After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face,
neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have
raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in
Malaysia next month.
	   The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit
to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, the
Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington as saying.
Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital
checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charges of
abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. His
trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings.
	   He has pleaded innocent to all charges, including another
corruption count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in
prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus
whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act,
which allows jail without trial.
	   Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered
Anwar associates and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12
had been released.

German Jewish leader doubts Holocaust Memorial will be built
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of newspaper, ADDS comment from Greens party
member &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) - The head of Germany's Central Council of
Jews was quoted Tuesday as saying he no longer expects a planned
Holocaust Memorial to be built in Berlin.
	   In an interview with the Dresden-based Saechsische Zeitung,
Ignatz Bubis reacted to the outcome of the Sept. 27 elections won
by the leftist Social Democrats and chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who has said he is for reconsidering the project.
	   Ten days before the election, Bubis told Der Tagesspiegel
newspaper in Berlin that if Chancellor Helmut Kohl lost, there
would be no memorial. Kohl was the project's staunchest backer.
	   ``I believe a decision has been made,'' Tuesday's report quoted
Bubis as saying.
	   ``The initiators wanted to erect a memorial by non-Jews to
remember the murdered Jews of Europe. In my view that is a gesture
that is needed.''
	   But Volker Beck, a member of the environmental Greens party that
are expected to form a government coalition with the Social
Democrats, issued a statement in Bonn saying the memorial issue was
still alive.
	   ``A decision on a memorial for the murdered Jews of Europe has
not been made. It would be false to give up the discussion,'' Beck
said.
	   He added that backing out of constructing a Holocaust memorial
in Berlin would lead to international criticism.
	   Kohl last month backed off his pledge to push ahead with the
memorial before the elections, saying he didn't want it to become a
campaign issue.
	   Schroeder has said he is not against the memorial in principle,
but wasn't sure whether the chosen site and the scale of the
project are appropriate.
	   The leading design, by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman, envisions
a labyrinth of 2,700 pillars resembling a cemetery. Critics
complain it is too monumental and wrong for the site, just south of
the historic Brandenburg Gate.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in central Russia seized 155 kilograms (340
pounds) of opium and 12 kilograms (26-1/2 pounds) of hashish and
heroin hidden in a truck carrying fruit juice from Tajikistan, a

	   Police Col. Gennady Vydrin said it was the largest stash of
drugs ever confiscated in the Ulyanovsk region, 1,000 kilometers

Police arrest man for allegedly making fake `morning-after' pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police arrested a former pharmacist
Tuesday for producing and selling fake contraceptive pills, a local
television station reported.
	   The man, identified as Pongvichit Suwannasakdi, was arrested
with at least 200,000 tablets bearing the brand name ``Postinor''
in a police raid on his office-home in a Bangkok suburb, the
television station ITV said.
	   The real pill is often used as an emergency contraceptive, taken
after sexual intercourse.
	   Police acted after receiving a complaint last month from the
distributors of the legitimate pill, ITV said.
	   Thai Food and Drug Administration officials confirmed the seized
pills were fakes _ containing 95 percent flour _ and incapable of
preventing pregnancy.
	   Mongkol na Songkhla, secretary-general of the Food and Drug
Administration, said his office had heard reports of fake pills in
the market and investigated on behalf of the legitimate producers.
	   He said it was difficult for consumers to tell by sight that the
pills were fakes.
	   He suggested consumers take note of unusually low prices for the
pills and avoid going to unqualified drug stores.
	   ``The fake pills were sold at 5 baht (dlrs 0.13) per pack but
the real Postinor is 8 baht (dlrs 0.20) a tablet,'' he said.

India, Pakistan to resume stalled dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan set a schedule
Tuesday for detailed discussions on Kashmir and other disputes,
agreeing to meet in each other's capitals for the first time in
more than a year.
	   International pressure has mounted on the two neighbors to talk
since they conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May. The two
nations' nuclear tests led to worldwide condemnation and economic
sanctions.
	   The top bureaucrat of India's foreign ministry will visit the
Pakistani capital Oct. 15-18 to discuss peace and security and the
conflicting territorial claims to Kashmir, which Pakistan considers
the core issue between the hostile neighbors.
	   Pakistani officials will then travel to the Indian capital Nov.
5-13 to take up terrorism, drug trafficking, a navigation project,
the demarcation of maritime boundary, economic and commercial
cooperation and cultural exchanges, a foreign ministry statement
said in New Delhi, the Indian capital.
	   A decision to resume the stalled dialogue was taken last month
during Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's meeting with
his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, in New York on the
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
control of Kashmir, in the past 50 years. India controls two-thirds
of the Himalayan Kashmir and Pakistan the rest. Both stake claim to
the entire territory.

Ukraine's president orders measures to boost alcohol and tobacco
</HEADLINE>
production &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma ordered government
officials on Tuesday to raise more money from the country's alcohol
and tobacco industries by cutting taxes and reducing smuggling, a
news agency said.
	   Taxes are so high on tobacco and alcohol that manufacturers
cannot pay them without going out of business completely, and so
they accumulate massive debts instead, Kuchma said at a meeting
with members of the state monopoly committee for alcohol and
tobacco production, Interfax reported.
	   Kuchma criticized a recent government increase in the excise tax
on alcohol. The increase had to be revoked last week because it
drove prices so high that almost all the country's alcohol plants
were unable to sell their products and had to halt production.
	   The heavy taxes on tobacco and alcohol have also backfired by
spurring a big black market trade of the goods, Kuchma said.
	   He said 75 percent of cigarettes and a quarter of all alcoholic
drinks sold in Ukraine are either smuggled or illegally produced,
and many are tainted, according to Interfax.
	   More than 30,000 people in the former Soviet republic have been
poisoned by tainted alcohol since 1997, Kuchma said.
	   Ukrainian leaders have been trying for the last two years to
impose effective control over domestic alcohol and tobacco
production in an attempt to raise much-needed budget revenues, but
with little result.

Patten warns against mixing trade and human rights in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-China-Britain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With Prime Minister Tony Blair touring China and
talking about human rights, former Conservative Party leader and
Hong Kong governor Chris Patten warned against mixing trade and
politics.
	   ``My own strong view is that we should keep trade and human
rights separate,'' Patten said on his BBC radio program, which
aired Tuesday after being taped this weekend.
	   ``China represents less than 2 percent of (Britain's) exports,
so economic threats shouldn't put us off pressing our legitimate
concerns about other issues _ from human rights to weapons
proliferation,'' he said. ``The trouble at the moment is that while
mixing trade and politics, we seem to veer rather nervously from
one extreme to another.''
	   Patten called for political reform in China.
	   ``My own view is that Deng Xiaping and his communist colleagues
were wrong to think that you can change the economy without any
political consequences,'' he said. ``Sooner or later, economic
reform requires political reform _ in China just like everywhere
else.''
	   He continued: ``I must come clean with a grave confession. I'm
not scared witless of the People's Republic of China. On balance,
I'm more concerned about things going wrong there _ the breakdown
of governance, the splintering of China.
	   ``But what I'm absolutely certain about is the next stage of
economic reform demands political liberalization. The two go hand
in hand.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ There's room for a few more names on a
20th century honor roll of writers, and one will be added this week
when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature
laureate.
	   Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with
readers as well as academics, critics and the authors themselves.
This year's winner _ or, possibly, winners _ will be announced
Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday.
	   ``The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard
of,'' said Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary
magazine. But the Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also
shines a light, usually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people
have read, he added.
	   His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's
convinced Naipaul probably won't win because of his ``dark ...
pessimistic'' and often scathing portrayals of post-colonial
African culture.
	   The academy keeps its deliberations secret. Who is considered
seriously, even who's nominated, isn't disclosed.
	   A writer's nationality, by the terms of the prize founder Alfred
Nobel's will, is supposed to be irrelevant. Two can share the
prize, though the last time that happened was 1974. Winners are
expected to personally receive it: awards are not given
posthumously.
	   Looking at the process from afar, Harold Bloom, a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Letters, said the award committee has
a unsettling record of selections that are ``nationally 'correct'
and politically 'correct.'''
	   The winners list is prestigious, he concedes, but by no means
uniformly lustrous. ``Absolutely not! Outrageously not,'' he said
in a telephone interview from New York. ``They include all kinds of
fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never got one, for heaven's sake.
Neither did Marcel Proust.''
	   Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of
``Blood Meridian''; Philip Roth, author of ``American Pastoral'';
and John Ashbery, ``the best living poet.''
	   A review of recent winners may foreshadow this year's laureate.
Seven of the past 10 were men _ does that favor a woman? Two of the
past three were poets _ does that favor a prose writer?
	   Four of the past 10 wrote in English, and the last three
laureates are European. In comparison, only three Asian writers
have ever won.
	   ``Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine,'' said Abe Harumasa,
editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. ``The
choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by
politics,'' given the poet's association with China's democracy
movement, ``but it's clear he's a wonderful poet.''
	   Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of Chinese literature at Japan's
prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing
Xin as worthy. The latter is known for her portrayals of the
struggles of Chinese women.
	   China, which translates and publishes the works of many Nobel
winners, ``desperately'' wants its first laureate, he added.
	   Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco Ayala, 92, winner of
this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, said Jose Maria
Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor and secretary of
the jury that selected Ayala.
	   Other presumed Latin candidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas
Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy,
Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works
have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent AP interview that
he's weary of speculation that this year, once again, he might win.
``Let's not get into that,'' he said. ``I just write.''

Settlement issue threatens to hamper Albright visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
he would go ahead with construction in a Jewish enclave in the West
Bank town of Hebron but that the work would not begin until an
archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
	   With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please both
Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a halt to
settlement expansion.
	   The future of the Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of
mobile homes in Hebron, was raised as Albright visited the region.
	   Last month, in response to the killing of a settler rabbi in his
Tel Romeida trailer, Netanyahu said he would replace the mobile
homes with permanent structures. The rabbi was stabbed to death,
apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu made several contradictory statement and
it was not immediately clear what his intentions were.
	   During a news conference with Albright, Netanyahu said the
mobile homes in Tel Romeida would only be reinforced to make them
bullet-proof. ``I want to remind you that this is not
construction,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are not speaking of expanding
the settlement to other territories.''
	   A statement by his office said that archeological digs would
have to be carried out in the neighborhood before building could
begin. Israeli officials said the dig could take several months.
	   But Netanyahu said in the statement that the activity would
entail actual construction of ``permanent structures,'' apparently
more than the simple reinforcement of buildings.
	   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the decision to
build in Hebron was a violation of peace agreements and will
``cause tension particularly because it coincides with Albright's
meeting with Netanyahu.''
	   Albright chose to sidestep the issue. She said both sides should
avoid unilateral action, but said she would not comment on the Tel
Romeida issue.
	   Baruch Marzel, a resident of Tel Romeida and a former leader of
the outlawed anti-Arab movement Kach, said Netanyahu was backing
down on his promise to build in the area. ``He is cheating the
Israeli people,'' Marzel said.

Russia to offer China gas supplies contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom plans to offer China
a 30-year contract to supply 30 billion cubic meters (1 trillion
cubic feet) of natural gas, Gazprom's chief said Tuesday.
	   Russian and Chinese officials signed an agreement to pipe
Siberian natural gas to China during President Boris Yeltsin's
visit to China last year.
	   Gazprom will propose specific terms for the project in a few
days, company chairman Rem Vyakhirev said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The project is expected to be financed by Asian banks and
companies, but some equipment may be supplied by European and
American companies, Vyakhirev said.

 &UR; Palestinians say Albright brought nothing from talks with Israel &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright did not bring anything from Israel to her talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Palestinian officials said after
Tuesday's talks.
	   Officials said however that there was a possibility Albright
would lead three-way talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu during the second day of her Mideast shuttle
Wednesday.
	   Albright met Arafat in the Palestinian-run West Bank city of
Jericho as part of her efforts to bring the sides closer to
completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal. If
Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps over a U.S. peace
initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely sign a deal in
Washington later this month.
	   ``A tri-lateral meeting will depend on what Secretary Albright
brings to us from Netanyahu tomorrow. She did not bring anything
from Netanyahu today,'' said a senior Palestinian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Albright met earlier Tuesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem,
several hours after arriving to the region early Tuesday.
	   The Palestinian official said Albright and Arafat discussed
``generalities.'' ``There were no specifics.''
	   Speaking after the Jericho meeting, Albright told reporters that
there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make,'' before
the Washington summit scheduled for October 15-18.
	   ``We reviewed in a comprehensive way all the issues of the
American initiative which (Arafat) has accepted in principle. Our
challenge now is to move forward and to try to reach an
agreement,'' she said.
	   Arafat said he hoped the secretary's visit would be one more
step towards the settling of all remaining issues between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   Time is running out between the sides to resolve a host of
disputes such as the status of Jerusalem, which both peoples claim
as their capital, Jewish settlements and permanent borders.
	   The current peace accords expire in May 1999, when the
Palestinians had hoped to declare independence. However, Netanyahu
opposes Palestinian statehood and the two sides have been haggling
for more than 18 months over a further Israeli troop redeployment
from West Bank areas, which it committed to in a previous accord.
	   Arafat's aide, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians had not been
shown Israel's maps for the proposed pullback. ``I think if there
is a sticking point, that is that Mr. Netanyahu refuses the concept
of reciprocity.''
	   The United States has proposed Israel withdraw from 13 percent
of the area, and after months of negotiating, both sides seem ready
to accept the deal with certain conditions. Israel wants security
guarantees from the Palestinians to strike at Islamic militants who
threaten peace.

Strong quake rattles western Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook the Ionian
island of Zakinthos in western Greece on Tuesday, but there were no
immediate reports of injuries or serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7, occurred at
3:28 p.m. (1228 GMT) under the sea bed about 245 kilometers (152
miles) west of Athens, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Continental Airlines twin-engine Boeing 777 on a
test flight from the New York area to Tokyo made an emergency
landing Tuesday in northern Japan because of engine trouble, an
airport spokesman said.
	   The plane landed safely at 2:25 p.m. (0525 GMT) carrying 84
Continental Airlines officials and crew members, said Tetsuya
Watanabe at New Chitose airport, 829 kilometers (518 miles)
northeast of Tokyo.
	   The pilot had discovered that one engine was consuming an
excessive amount of oil, said Watanabe. He said the cause of the
trouble was not immediately known.
	   Watanabe said the plane, which began in Newark, New Jersey,
would leave Chitose for Tokyo on Wednesday evening.
	   Continental Airlines is scheduled to begin daily non-stop
service between Newark and Tokyo on Dec. 1 and daily nonstop
service between Houston and Tokyo on Jan. 31, said Kenji Makino, an
official of the Transport Ministry's aviation department.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Overdue wages. Soaring inflation. Lost jobs.
	   Russians have endured a bitter economic crisis with few public
outbursts, but millions are expected to march in nationwide
demonstrations Wednesday in what's forecast to be one of the
largest ever protests during President Boris Yeltsin's tenure.
	   A broad band of government critics, led by trade unions and the
Communist Party, have spent months organizing hundreds protests in
cities, towns and factories across the country.
	   One of the most striking aspects of the Russian crisis, which
hit in mid-August, has been the muted public response. Many
Russians are deeply disillusioned with the government's inability
to halt the country's economic slide, but they have concentrated on
their personal survival strategies.
	   Protest organizers have sought to turn the private frustrations
into public rallies that could draw as many as 40 million people
around the country, according to Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
	   However, many observers predict the one-day demonstration is
more likely to resemble a similar protest in March 1997, when
around 2 million people rallied nationwide.
	   The Communists and the trade unions have had some difficulty
coordinating their aims, and this has partially muddied their
message.
	   The unions want to focus on basic economic issues in a country
where the economy has been contracting for the past decade and is
expected to shrink more than 5 percent this year. Millions of
workers get paid months late, and inflation has skyrocketed more
than 60 percent since the crisis began.
	   ``The problems of debts, (unpaid) wages and working places
appeared not today and not on Aug. 17,'' said Mikhail Shmakov,
leader of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions. ``It has been
gradually developing in the country during the past few years.''
	   The Communists, meanwhile, have been calling for Yeltsin's
resignation and see the protests as a way to further weaken the
president, who still has two years left in his term.
	   But the Communists find themselves in a bit of an awkward
position because several of their members are playing key roles in
the new government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   To further complicate the matter, the union leaders have said
they not only want Yeltsin to step down, they also want to see the
dissolution of parliament, where Communists make up the largest
faction.
	   Other Yeltsin opponents are also seizing the opportunity to
advance their own goals.
	   Alexander Lebed, governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province in
Central Siberia and a likely presidential contender, said Tuesday
that Yeltsin's resignation is ``inevitable,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Any government must serve the people, and if it fails to
deliver, it must go,'' Lebed was quoted as saying.
	   Yeltsin has maintained an extremely low profile since the
economic crisis struck, spending most of his time at a presidential
residence on the western outskirts of Moscow. He had no public
appearances planned for Wednesday.
	   The Communists and the unions have pledged that the protests
will be peaceful. Unrest is quite rare at demonstrations, and
several smaller, preliminary protest marches in recent days have
proceeded without any trouble.
	   Nonetheless, police and interior troops have been put on alert
throughout Russia. More than 11,000 policemen and 4,000 Interior
Ministry troops will be deployed in Moscow alone, according to an
Interior Ministry official cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Moscow city officials have said the demonstration in the capital
could draw up to 150,000 people, who will march to the edge of Red
Square.
	   Seeking to discourage angry rhetoric aimed at the government,
Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov warned that criminal
proceedings could be launched against opposition leaders who
recently called for the government's ouster by force.
	   Such statements are punishable by law, Krasheninnikov told a
news conference Tuesday. Justice Ministry officials plan to attend
rallies to see whether speakers comply with the law.
	   ``I would like to specifically warn those trying to incite
tensions that the authorities will closely follow the events. If we
hear calls for violent overthrow of the constitutional order, we
will make our conclusions,'' the minister said.

Airstrikes will hinder forensic work at atrocities sites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Airstrikes in Kosovo would delay the
arrival of a team of pathologists authorized by the European Union
to study sites of alleged atrocities in the separatist province,
Finnish officials said Tuesday.
	   ``If bombs start falling around the place, there's no way we
could do any work,'' said Timo Lahelma from the Foreign Ministry.
	   ``The threat of airstrikes being fairly strong now, we simply
wouldn't leave Finland,'' said Lahelma, who will accompany the
Finnish team.
	   The group was planning to arrive in Kosovo this week after EU
ministers on Monday authorized a team of Finnish forensic
scientists to the area. Others may join the team later, Lahelma
said.
	   The five-member team earlier studied corpses at massacre sights
in Bosnia in 1996 at the request of the United Nations. It includes
three pathologists from the University of Helsinki and two forensic
experts from the National Bureau of Investigation.
	   ``We will study human rights violations, find possible mass
graves and open them, and study the causes of death,'' said Helena
Ranta, a forensic dentist at the university.
	   ``Our job is also to investigate circumstances leading to death
and look for possible signs of torture, and then finally to
identify the victims,'' she said.
	   In 1996, Ranta's team of pathologists helped a German team study
the skulls of three siblings claiming to be descendants of the last
Russian czar.
	   Also, Finnish forensic scientists from the National Bureau of
Investigation helped identify bodies recovered after the 1994
Estonia ferry sank killing 852 people.
	   Even if NATO refrains from airstrikes, the Finnish team will be
faced by threats from mines, snipers and bands of soldiers or armed
rebels, Lahelma said.
	   ``We'll need all the luck we can get. But, as the EU paper says:
`the security of the team must be guaranteed and all technical
aspects arranged,''' he added.
	   Local opposing leaders in the region may also try to use the
team for their own political ends.
	   ``We don't want to become political tools. We must be guaranteed
the possibility of working completely independently,'' said Ranta,
who will head the team. ``That's the only way we can be sure that
one day we'll be able to say exactly what happened there.''

defiant
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with White House saying Milosevic `nowhere near'
compliance &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior American envoy searching
for a breakthrough to avert NATO airstrikes said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police
still maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated
international demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters.
	   In Washington, the White House was less diplomatic. President
Bill Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Yugoslavia's Serbian
leaders ``are nowhere near compliance'' with U.N. resolutions
demanding peace in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke conferred here with Ibrahim Rugova and other ethnic
Albanian leaders and then flew back to the capital Belgrade for a
second meeting with Milosevic in as many days.
	   During a late-night meeting Monday, Milosevic said he was
anxious for a political settlement with ethnic Albanians but
dismissed NATO threats as a ``criminal act.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have refused to negotiate until
Milosevic halts the seven-month crackdown that has killed hundreds
and driven a quarter-million people from their homes.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose attacks on Serb police
prompted the crackdown, has rejected any peace formula short of
full independence and has refused to accept Rugova as their leader.
The KLA has urged NATO to attack.
	   ``The Serbian war machine and its military and political
structure must be destroyed,'' said Adem Demaci, a veteran ethnic
Albanian politician who speaks for the rebels.
	   An ethnic Albanian source familiar with the talks between
Holbrooke and Rugova said the American made clear that the ``NATO
threat of airstrikes is no bluff, and that all is now up to the
Serbian side.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   There was no sign that the diplomatic deadlock was ending.
	   French President Jacques Chirac warned that if Serb forces don't
pull out of the province as demanded, NATO intervention ``will
become inevitable.''
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Moscow would veto any Security Council resolution to
approve airstrikes, which some NATO members believe is necessary
for the alliance to act.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether separatist Kosovo would separate from
Serbia.
	   But the KLA opposes the interim formula, and Albright voiced
skepticism Milosevic would adhere to such a plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.
	   ``It is necessary that the Serb forces pull out,'' he said in
Florence, Italy. ``Combat must cease. If that is not the case, a
NATO intervention will become inevitable.''
	   Allied leaders are still debating what form intervention would
take, and whether they are prepared after initial airstrikes to
send in troops to enforce the peace in Kosovo.
	   Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said ground forces
would be needed to back any peace agreement, for two reasons: ``To
secure that Milosevic just doesn't roll his gear out of the
barracks again and to secure that there are no attacks on Serbs''
by the KLA.
	   Lord David Owen, former European Union peace envoy to
Yugoslavia, said all the threats about intervention have put NATO's
credibility at stake.
	   ``In the last 8-10 years there has been a tendency for NATO to
speak loudly but never actually to use the stick,'' Owen told
reporters in Geneva.
	   ``Having uttered these threats, then I think they have got to
make good on them,'' he said.
	   He said it would be ``culpable negligence'' by NATO to carry out
airstrikes without backing them up with ground forces.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov criticized the West on
Tuesday for supporting the most liberal economic reforms that have

	   Luzhkov, a potential candidate in the next presidential
election, said he hoped that ``our partners will gradually realize
the seriousness of the mistakes made by our radically minded
reformers,'' Interfax said.
	   Luzhkov singled out former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar _ whose
government abolished Soviet-era price controls and pushed through
free-market reforms _ and Anatoly Chubais, the architect of
Russia's privatization.
	   The comments were in line with Luzhkov's usual populist style.
Both Gaidar and Chubais are widely disliked in Russia, where many
people believe that free-market reforms enriched a few insiders and
impoverished the rest of the country.
	   Luzhkov has indicated that he may run for president in the 2000
election, when Boris Yeltsin's second term in office expires.
	   Luzhkov appears to support greater state controls over the
economy than those advocated by Chubais and Gaidar, and a greater
social safety net. But the policies he favors would still be
significantly more liberal than Soviet-style methods.
	   Luzhkov has recently called for the formation of a Social
Democratic _ or ``new labor'' _ party in Russia that would support
the efficient management of property ``regardless of whom it
belongs to.'' He said he might head the party.
	   Luzhkov is a tremendously popular and powerful man in Moscow,
which he has turned into Russia's only boomtown, but it remains
unclear how much support he can muster elsewhere.
	   In his comments Tuesday, Luzhkov also criticized the West for
giving Russia aide ``for eating'' instead of using the funds to
support the country's industries, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news
agencies reported.
	   ``Uncontrolled spending is a disgrace for the West,'' Luzhkov
was quoted as saying.
	   ``Instead of market-based economy, we have received a wreck, on
which speculators thrive,'' he said.

Gazprom wants to expand in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom said Tuesday it
wants to expand its work in Iran, where the company is already
involved in a dlrs 2 billion deal to develop the South Pars natural
gas field.
	   The United States, which accuse Iran of sponsoring international
terrorism, has criticized the project, which also involves the
French oil company Total and Malaysia's Patrionas.
	   Gazprom chief Rem Vyakhirev said the company would like to
develop other gas fields in Iran, and supply equipment for Iran's
gas industry, ITAR-Tass reported.

Russia concerned over clash between Syria and Turkey, offers help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian is worried that mounting tension between
Turkey and Syria will lead to further instability in the Middle
East, and offered to mediate in the conflict, an official said
Tuesday.
	   ``This escalation ... can only aggravate still more the
situation in the Middle East, where crises are rife as it is,''
said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Turkey alleges that Syria is harboring Kurdish rebels who are
seeking more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern
Turkey. Relations worsened recently after Turkey sent troops to its
border with Syria and unconfirmed reports said Turkish jets had
violated Syrian airspace.
	   Russia urges the two sides to show restraint and to open a
political dialogue as soon as possible, and solve the conflict
without using force, Rakhmanin said.
	   He also said Russia can help establish the dialogue and maintain
contacts between both sides, ITAR-Tass reported.

Students led by Khamenei's brother rally against press crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 4,000 students led by the brother
of Iran's most powerful cleric demonstrated Tuesday against a
crackdown on the press by hard-liners in the ruling clergy.
	   ``We believe any confrontation with the press should be done
according to the law,'' said Hadi Khamenei, the younger brother of
Iran's hard-line spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Hadi Khamenei also is adviser for press affairs for Iran's
moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, and owns a liberal-leftist
newspaper, World of Islam.
	   ``If any newspaper breaks the limit of freedom, it should be
confronted _ but legally, in an open court with the presence of
lawyers, a jury and a judge,'' Khamenei told the demonstrators near
Tehran University.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the Ministry of Information
have shut down six publications, including two on Monday, and
arrested six journalists for allegedly printing lies. The
ministry's power stems from its authority to issue publication
licenses.
	   The crackdown is stymying efforts by Khatami to give more
freedom to the press. Still, a Khatami loyalist controls the
Interior Ministry, which gives permission for public rallies.
	   Tuesday's demonstration underscored the split in Iran's clerical
regime between hard-liners and moderates over relaxing the strict
social and political rules that were imposed after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   At the university, students carried pictures of Khatami and old
issues of banned newspapers, Tous and Jameah.
	   Streets surrounding the university were closed by dozens of
police, while bus loads of anti-riot police waited to intervene in
case of trouble. But the demonstration ended without incident.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under increasing attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on the judiciary to deal with
what he calls ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   The demonstration, which was called ``Freedom, security and
people's participation,'' also criticized the system of electing a
70-member Assembly of Experts whose job is to choose Iran's
spiritual leader.
	   Candidates for the assembly are vetted by a 12-member Guardian
Council, which is controlled by the hard-liners. The council also
approves candidates for parliament and the presidency.
	   Elections for the Assembly of Experts are scheduled for Oct. 23.
Members serve eight-year terms.
	   The student demonstrators called on Khatami to push for
canceling the screening process of candidates.
	   ``No faction has any right to impose its factional interests on
the people in the name of religion. We ask the cabinet of Khatami
to act like the majority government, not a minority,'' said Maysam
Saeedi, one of the speakers at the rally.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Another mild and short-lived increase in moisture is expected to
move from the Atlantic and across our islands this afternoon to
yield widely scattered to scattered showers, with a few
thunderstorms possible across interior and southwestern Puerto
Rico.
	   Tropical Storm Lisa was located in the central tropical Atlantic
early this morning about 900 miles east of the Virgin Islands.
	   Lisa has begun a slow turn towards the north-northwest and is
expected to gradually turn northeast and accelerate toward the
northern Atlantic. Lisa thus offers no threat to the Caribbean
islands, and all local residents can breath a sigh of relief.
	   The decrease in trade winds is also producing a corresponding
decrease in coastal seas this morning, and the small craft advisory
has been discontinued.
	   However, seas across the Atlantic and the Anegada Passage will
remain near 7 feet through Wednesday as moderate northeasterly
swells reach our waters.

American Maitozo, German Zulow win individual vaulting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Will be updated following team results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ America's David Maitozo and Germany's Nadia Zulow
won gold medals Tuesday in the individual vaulting at the 1998
World Equestrian Games.
	   ``This is a dream come true,'' said the 23-year-old Maitozo. ``I
bet with myself after winning the bronze (at the 1996 worlds) that
1998 would be my year to win, and I did.''
	   Maitozo, on Whiskey 191, totaled 8.890 points following a series
of tests, which ended Tuesday with the free style at the Santa
Barbara arena, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Rome.
	   Mathias Lang of France, on Quitus du Madon, captured the men's
silver with 8.643 points. Germany's Henrik Ossenbrink scored 8.641
points to claim the bronze on Panjano.
	   Zulow took the gold on the women's side, scoring 8.725 points on
Rainbow.
	   Kerith Lemon of the United States clinched the silver on Pasio I
with 8.469 points, repeating her result at both the 1994 worlds in
the Hague and the 1996 worlds in Kaposvar, Hungary.
	   Germany's Janine Oswald, who was third at the 1996
championships, took home the bronze again with 8.378 points.
	   Vaulting originated as part of military training and is a sort
of gymnastics on horseback. Vaulters carry out a series of
exercises on horseback with the help of a special handle instead of
a saddle. It is not an Olympic sport.
	   The championships, held at three venues near Rome, run through
Sunday.

EU parliament votes to lift Le Pen's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs version; RECASTS throughout
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament stripped French
far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen of his protection from
prosecution Tuesday so a German court can try him for calling the
Nazi gas chambers ``a detail in the history of the Second World
War.''
	   The European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg, France,
voted 420 to 20 to lift the parliamentary immunity of the National
Front leader, with six abstentions.
	   Munich prosecutors had requested a waiver of Le Pen's immunity
last April, after he made the comments at a news conference in the
southern German city.
	   Le Pen reacted angrily to the vote. ``Let us not forget that I
am the victim. It wasn't I who invented the concentration camps,
but the fathers, grandfathers and uncles of my German colleagues,''
he said.
	   Munich prosecutors want to charge Le Pen under German laws
making it a criminal offense to trivialize the Holocaust. Le Pen
could face a maximum of five years in jail if convicted.
	   Chief prosecutor Manfred Wick said his office will open an
investigation into Le Pen's comments as soon as it has been
formally notified of the parliament's decision.
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France,
applauded the vote. ``By this decision, the European deputies
refuse to consider as defendable ... the expression of pure
anti-Semitism that consists of rendering banal, insignificant, the
Shoah, the industrial extermination of European Jews in gas
chambers,'' the council said in a statement.
	   In a speech to the parliament before the vote, Le Pen said a
decision against him would be a violation of his right to free
speech.
	   ``You should vote massively to refuse this lifting of
immunity,'' Le Pen said. ``Parliaments are not legitimate if their
members are not free.''
	   Le Pen said he did not mean to deny or minimize the gas
chambers. ``If these comments have been interpreted in a way that
made sincere people suffer, I'm sorry,'' he said.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted unless the 626-member assembly votes for a lifting of
immunity. But French legislation gives EU deputies less protection.
	   Recently, Le Pen was found guilty at home for assaulting a
Socialist politician last year. The French court stripped him of
his civil rights for two years, in effect banning him from holding
office, running for office, or voting. He was also fined 20,000
french francs (dlrs 3,660).
	   Le Pen has appealed the French ruling. If he loses his appeal,
the conviction could make him ineligible to run in 1999 European
Parliament elections. He has said that in such a case his wife,
Jany, will run in his place.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior American envoy searching
for a breakthrough to avert NATO air strikes said Tuesday that
President Slobodan Milosevic has not met the terms laid down by the
United Nations to prevent military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke told reporters that Serbian military police
still maintain a strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated
international demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,'' he
told reporters.
	   The same message to Milosevic was voiced in Washington by
President Bill Clinton, and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
	   Clinton said Holbrooke was telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he
must do and to make clear that NATO is prepared to act if President
Milosevic fails to honor the United Nations resolutions.
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   Cohen told Congress a pullback of troops in Kosovo by Milosevic
was not enough to ward off NATO attacks. Any such air strikes might
be followed by some form of ``international presence'' on the
ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.

Goalkeeper Charbonnier walks out on French national squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ French goalkeeper Lionel
Charbonnier on Tuesday stormed out of the French squad's training
camp, apparently unhappy about not being the first choice for an
upcoming European Championship qualifier.
	   Charbonnier, who plays for the Glasgow Rangers, had hoped he
would play against Russia on October 10 after Fabien Barthez pulled
out of the squad this week with an injury.
	   But new coach Roger Lemerre instead called up experienced Paris
Saint-Germain goalkeeper Bernard Lama, with Charbonnier on the
bench.
	   ``The competition here wasn't to his liking,'' Lemerre told
reporters at the camp outside Paris. ``He came to my room this
morning to tell me the news.''
	   Charbonnier was seen speeding out of the training camp in his
gray Mercedes.
	   Lemerre immediately called up Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi as
cover. He declined to say whether Charbonnier would be fined.
	   Four days after playing Russia, France is to play Andorra. In
its first European Championship qualifier last month, France drew
1-1 away to Iceland.
	   Lemerre, formerly the French team's number two, took over from
Aime Jacquet, who quit after guiding France to victory in the World
Cup in July.

U.S. envoy expected for second attempt at peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Special envoy Anthony Lake was expected
in the Eritrean capital Tuesday to make a second attempt at finding
a peaceful solution to the simmering five-month border conflict
between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   Lake was to meet with President Isaias Afwerki and other
officials before travelling to Addis Ababa Thursday.
	   Eritrean officials have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward
the visit after Isaias' government called the previous U. S.
attempt to find a peaceful settlement ``unwarranted interference.''
	   But Ethiopia on Tuesday welcomed the resumption of U.S.
mediation, saying it ``appreciates the active role the government
of the United States has played ...''
	   In a statement, government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said,
however, that ``Ethiopia remains committed to the ongoing OAU
initiative as the only one that could guarantee a peaceful solution
to the crisis,'' but that any other efforts to bolster the
initiative were welcome.
	   The proposal by the Organization of African Unity includes a
call to both sides to withdraw to positions held before May 5 _ a
direct reference to Eritrea, which denies it is occupying any
territory other than its own.
	   Since brief but deadly fighting in three areas in the first part
of June, both countries have dug in along the disputed border with
large numbers of troops and weapons.
	   A June 14 moratorium on air strikes brokered by President Bill
Clinton still holds, but both sides have spoken of the possibility
of renewed fighting.
	   Eritrea insists on bilateral demilitarization and the expert
demarcation of the entire border under international observation.
Asmara has also called for direct talks, something Ethiopia refuses
until Eritrea withdraws.
	   Both countries accuse each other of human rights violations and
of expelling large numbers of each other's citizens.
	   While diplomats and international agencies have been unable to
find any systematic mistreatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea, there is
evidence that Ethiopia has expelled at least 20,000 Eritreans and
taken over their businesses and properties.
	   Others were accused of being spies and were jailed.
	   On Sunday, 1,200 Eritrean deportees, including women, children
and the elderly, arrived at the Burie border post west of the port
of Assab.
	   The OAU trio designated to determine the root causes of the
conflict _ Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti _ is scheduled to
meet Oct. 15 in the Burkina capital, Ouagadougou.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ French veteran Jeannie Longo aims
to win her 13th world title at the World Cycling Championships
Wednesday as she defends her elite women's time trial crown but it
was riders almost half her age who took the honors Tuesday.
	   Longo, who turns 40 later this month, won her first world title
in 1985. She says these championships will be her last _ although
she said that ahead of last year's World Championships too.
	   Longo was training separately from the rest of the French team
Tuesday because of her rocky relationship with her national
federation.
	   On the first day of racing, a 17-year old German and a 20-year
old Norwegian produced surprise gold medal performances.
	   Thor Hushovd of Norway took the men's under-23 time trial in a
time of 43 minutes 19.84 seconds. Frederic Finot of France was
second, 3.51 seconds behind, and Italy's Gianmario Ortenzi was
third, 10.64 seconds slower than the winner.
	   Hushovd posted his time from well back in the field for the
32.8-kilometer (20.6-mile) time trial which wound from the medieval
city of Maastricht through the hills of the southern province of
Limburg to Valkenburg.
	   ``It is difficult to start in the first group,'' he said.
``There are so many riders behind you that can look at your time.''
	   But the young Norwegian said that if his starting place didn't
suit him, the six degree Celsius (43 F) temperature did.
	   ``It is cold yes, but then it is cold in Norway, so it's great
for me.''
	   Germany's Trixi Worrack won the first event of the 10-race
championships that end Sunday, the junior women's time trial over
15.2 kilometers (9.5 miles).
	   Like Hushovd, Worrack also was an early starter, but she crossed
the line in 23 minutes, 22.70 seconds to beat defending champion
Olga Zabelinskaia of Russia into second place by 5.44 seconds.
Canada's Genevieve Jeanson was third, 23.35 seconds back.
	   The under-23 men were the first riders of the week to take on
the Cauberg hill. The one-kilometer (0.6-mile) climb rises steeply
out of the cafe-lined streets of Valkenburg before dipping into a
gentle descent to the finish line.
	   Although the climb did not pose many problems in the time
trials, it is expected to be a decisive point in the longer road
races when riders face it more than once. Competitors in Sunday's
elite men's race have to tackle the hill a strength-sapping 15
times.
	   Defending champion Longo will hit the hill for the first time
Wednesday in the 23-kilometer (14.5-mile) elite women's time trial.
	   At last year's event in San Sebastian, Spain, Longo, Laurent
Jalabert and Laurent Brochard all picked up gold for France. The
dominant French also took six of 12 titles at this year's indoor
track World Cycling Championships.
	   But with Jalabert and Brochard not competing this year in the
wake of the doping scandal that enveloped the Tour de France, Longo
is France's best hope for gold.
	   Australians Anna Wilson, gold medallist in the recent
Commonwealth Games, and 1992 Olympic road race champion Kathy Watt
as well as local favorite Leontine van Moorsel will be among the
pack of younger riders aiming to knock Longo, who won her first
world title in 1985, off her throne.
	   Top U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong, competing in his first world
championships since his comeback after cancer treatment, arrived in
the southern Netherlands Tuesday ahead of the elite men's time
trial on Thursday.
	   The 1993 road race world champion, who announced he had
testicular cancer on the eve of the 1996 World Championships, is
considered a serious contender for the time trial title.

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ After inconclusive back-to-back talks
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that both sides still had to make
``tough choices'' to reach a West Bank accord.
	   And, Albright said as she stood alongside Yasser Arafat in the
Palestinian leader's headquarters, ``time is not on our side. If we
don't move quickly we may find ourselves without a process of
peacemaking. ...''
	   Arafat declined to be drawn out on the security issue. ``Peace
means security, peace means freedom,'' he said.
	   Albright gave no indication pesky details, and Israel's demand
for tougher Palestinian measures against terrorism, had been
cleared up.
	   ``We recognize there are tough choices that have to be made by
both sides as we approach the Washington summit,'' Albright said of
the three-way talks President Bill Clinton intends to hold later in
the month with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   The aim is an Israeli pullback on the West Bank, the acquisition
of more territory for the Palestinians and the start of
negotiations over such issues as the future of Jerusalem and
Palestinian aspirations for a state.
	   Whatever the outcome, Albright said the United States intends to
pursue a better relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for
its own sake.''
	   She did not elaborate in response to a question whether the
Clinton administration was setting the stage for dealing ultimately
with a Palestinian state.
	   Earlier, in Jerusalem, there was no report of progress in
Albright's meeting with Netanyahu, and a senior Israeli official,
David Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority had done nothing in
the runup to the planned Washington summit to rout terrorists on
land under its control.
	   ``Nothing, nothing, nothing,'' Netanyahu's adviser told
reporters. Albright placed highest priority on security measures
but said there were a number of issues where ``parallel'' movement
by Israel and the Palestinians was needed.
	   Netanyahu, for his part, said Israel had met its obligations _
meaning a willingness to relinquish more land on the West Bank _
and ``the crucial question'' was whether the Palestinians would
reciprocate.
	   Bar-Illan complained specifically about anti-Israel provisions
that remain in the Palestine Liberation Organization's covenant and
the presence, he said, of 13 indicted terrorist suspects in the
Palestinian police.
	   Albright is trying to narrow differences between the two before
their meeting with Clinton.
	   ``There is a sense of urgency,'' Albright said on her way here
Monday from Washington for two days of talks.
	   ``The United States can do a great deal, but the leaders have to
be willing to make decisions,'' Albright told reporters.
	   But Netanyahu said there would be no agreement for an Israeli
pullback unless the Palestinian Authority carried out its
commitment to clamp down on Islamic militants opposed to the peace
process.
	   And Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated
Press Television News in Jericho, accused the Clinton
administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on living up to
past accords.
	   If Albright is unable to put the pieces together _ most
importantly secure from Arafat new guarantees to uproot terrorism _
Clinton could come up short in his bid to play peacemaker in the
Middle East as he successfully did in Northern Ireland.

Ugandan president condemns terrorism

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni offered
condolences Tuesday for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, and urged condemnation of Sudan as a sponsor of
terrorism.
	   ``Our stand against terrorists is that they are a bunch of
cowards,'' said Museveni, whose country has suffered many rebel
attacks that have left hundreds dead.
	   Museveni specifically criticized Sudan, which he has repeatedly
accused of harboring and arming Ugandan rebels. Uganda broke
diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1995.
	   ``Treating terrorism with kid gloves has toughened them. If we
treat them firm, they will weaken,'' Museveni said in defense of
Uganda's tough stance against Sudan.
	   ``The support given to these lawless elements should be
condemned by the whole world,'' Museveni said.
	   The attack in Nairobi, Kenya killed 248 people, including 12
Americans, while a nearly simultaneous bomb killed 11 in Tanzania.
More than 5,500 were wounded in the two attacks.
	   U.S. authorities have blamed Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden
for the bombings.
	   On Aug. 20, U.S. missiles hit bin Laden's purported terrorist
training camp in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in
Khartoum, Sudan. President Bill Clinton said the Khartoum raid was
justified because evidence of a nerve gas component had been found
at the plant.
	   Museveni spoke at a gathering of businessmen before Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi opened a trade show designed to attract
international investment to the region.

Settlement issue threatens to hamper Albright visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES in graf 9 Erekat comment to Israel radio &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
he would go ahead with construction in a Jewish enclave in the West
Bank town of Hebron but that the work would not begin until an
archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
	   With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please both
Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a halt to
settlement expansion.
	   The future of the Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of
mobile homes in Hebron, was raised as Albright visited the region.
	   Last month, in response to the killing of a settler rabbi in his
Tel Romeida trailer, Netanyahu said he would replace the mobile
homes with permanent structures. The rabbi was stabbed to death,
apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu made several contradictory statement and
it was not immediately clear what his intentions were.
	   During a news conference with Albright, Netanyahu said the
mobile homes in Tel Romeida would only be reinforced to make them
bullet-proof. ``I want to remind you that this is not
construction,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are not speaking of expanding
the settlement to other territories.''
	   A statement by his office said that archeological digs would
have to be carried out in the neighborhood before building could
begin. Israeli officials said the dig could take several months.
	   But Netanyahu said in the statement that the activity would
entail actual construction of ``permanent structures,'' apparently
more than the simple reinforcement of buildings.
	   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel radio that
the decision to build in Hebron was a violation of peace agreements
and will cause tension particularly because it coincides with
Albright's meeting with Netanyahu.
	   Albright chose to sidestep the issue. She said both sides should
avoid unilateral action, but said she would not comment on the Tel
Romeida issue.
	   Baruch Marzel, a resident of Tel Romeida and a former leader of
the outlawed anti-Arab movement Kach, said Netanyahu was backing
down on his promise to build in the area. ``He is cheating the
Israeli people,'' Marzel said.

After decades of debate and delays, Norway's new airport ready

<TEXT>
	   GARDERMOEN, Norway (AP) _ After decades of debate, delays and
disputes, Norway's new international airport finally is set to open
Thursday amid, naturally, more debate, delays and disputes.
	   The 12.9 billion kroner (dlrs 1.7 billion) Gardermoen airport
outside Oslo is the most expensive project this country of 4.4
million people has ever built on land.
	   Only the offshore oil platforms that make Norway so rich _ it is
the world's second largest oil exporter _ are comparable in scope.
	   ``We have great faith that everything will go fine,'' said
managing director Bjoern Sund. However, he warned it could take
months before everything runs smoothly at a facility designed to
handle 17 million passengers a year.
	   About 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital, the
spacious, modern terminal was built with conspicuous use of wood,
stone and other natural materials. Architectural inspiration came
from the stunning mountain venues of the 1994 Lillehammer Winter
Olympics.
	   Comparisons with Lillehammer seem inevitable. The Games cost
Norway nearly as much as the airport, and both projects became
national obsessions.
	   ``I guess it is kind of a Norwegian thing, anytime there is a
discussion about where to locate a project,'' said Reiulf Helgedal,
a 36-year-old businessman checking in for one of the few flights
already using Gardermoen. ``I still don't think this is the best
location.''
	   Norway's airport debate began 50 years ago, and heated up in the
early 1960s.
	   One reason for the passion is that Norway, a long country
divided by fjords and mountains, is now bound together by airplanes
more than roads or ships. Its air traffic has tripled since 1980,
making Norwegians the most frequent fliers in Europe.
	   The country went through decisions, reversals, new decisions and
new reversals for three decades until Parliament on Oct. 8, 1992 _
six years to the day before this week's scheduled opening _ picked
Gardermoen, at the time an airstrip mostly for charter and military
flights.
	   Norwegians are now debating what to do with the current national
airport, 59-year-old Fornebu in Oslo. One last minute idea was to
keep it active as a reserve airport.
	   But it's probably too late for that. Minutes after the last
passenger plane takes off at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) Wednesday, more than
500 trucks and other vehicles will begin rushing everything to
Gardermoen, which takes over 12 hours later.
	   ``The only thing we fear is snow. Otherwise, everything is
ready,'' said Kjell Arne Sakshaug, who is in charge of the airport
move.
	   It's a big job. The new airport has twice the capacity of
Fornebu. Its two runways can handle 80 flights an hour, including
jumbo jets too big for Fornebu. The terminal is about 900 meters
(3,000 feet) long, and the airport has 10,000 employees, plus
parking for 8,000 cars.
	   Worries remain, including repeated glitches in the baggage
system, direction and information signs and, worst of all, how
passengers are to get to and away from the new airport.
	   High speed trains from Oslo to the terminal won't be as fast or
frequent as promised, due to a 12-kilometer (8 mile) tunnel that
leaks from lakes above it.
	   Efforts to stop the leaks could take another year and mean
trains will have to go around the tunnel, increasing travel time
from 19 minutes to more than half an hour. The frequency of airport
trains will be halved during rush hour due to limited track
capacity.
	   Planners also fear traffic gridlock, and _ train problems
notwithstanding _ signs along access highways urge drivers to use
public transit.
	   ``There has been a lot of talk in the media about all the
problems at Gardermoen. But I think it's quite nice,'' said Solveig
Skar, 45, checking in amid stacks of lumber, plastic awnings,
screaming electric drills, and frantic preparations. ``You can't
expect an operation of this size to start up with no problems.''
	   After all the waiting, a new dispute could force Norway's
Braathens airline to miss the opening. Its 330 pilots walked out on
strike Tuesday over the terms of their move to Gardermoen.
	   ``If the strike lasts until Thursday, it is clear that we won't
be there for the opening of Gardermoen,'' said the Norwegian
airline's spokesman Audun Tjomsland.

Turkmen president says 1948 quake death toll higher than reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Turkmenistan said Tuesday that
160,000 people were killed in a 1948 earthquake in his Central
Asian country, higher than the previously reported death toll of
110,000, a news agency said.
	   President Saparmurad Niyazov said the victims included his
mother and two brothers, Interfax reported.
	   Niyazov spoke at the opening of a memorial complex for the
victims of the quake, which he said killed 160,000 of the 196,000
people then living in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, which
was then part of the Soviet Union.
	   Since 1995, Turkmenistan has marked Oct. 6 as a day of mourning,
commemorating the 1948 earthquake.

Iraqi expatriates urge government to open up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi expatriates are pressing the
government to ease restrictions on travel, transfer of capital and
ownership of property as a first step toward opening up to the
outside world.
	   Some 800 of them have gathered in Baghdad for a
government-sponsored conference, and many said Tuesday they came
only after the government assured them they will be allowed to
leave without difficulty.
	   No official figures are available on the number of Iraqis living
abroad, but the expatriates say nearly a million Iraqis have fled
in the past eight years, mainly due to hardships caused by U.N.
trade sanctions.
	   Meenas Shamu'il, a resident of Chicago, said about 500,000
Iraqis live in the United States but only a handful attended the
three-day conference that began Monday.
	   ``We need to see a lot of change here before bringing our money
to our own country,'' said Shamu'il.
	   Iraq does not allow dual-citizenship, and Iraqis with foreign
passports are not allowed to trade on Baghdad's stock exchange.
Iraqis also are not allowed to leave the country with more than
dlrs 50. In addition, they have to buy an exit visa for 400,000
dinars (dlrs 266).
	   President Saddam Hussein, however, waived the fee for those
attending the conference, which included 300 Iraqis from Romania.
	   Just a few Iraqis lived in Romania before the sanctions were
imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The number since has
increased to 30,000, said Ahmed al-Ujeil, head of Iraqi community
in Romania.
	   ``These are not political or economic refugees but Iraqis with a
lot of money,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   ``We have many who are multimillionaires but would not invest a
dime in the country,'' he added.
	   Saleh Abed Alwan, an Iraqi journalist living in France, said he
doubted the government would soften its attitude regarding travel
and investment.
	   He said he has been in France for more than 15 years and still
finds it difficult to send money to his family in Iraq.
	   Qahatan al-Ubeid, from Germany, said most Iraqis living abroad
would like to visit their homeland but they ``do not want to do it
with an Iraqi passport.''
	   ``There are so many restrictions. We need to see them removed to
be able to come and go like the citizens of the countries we live
in,'' he said.
	   Iraq organized a similar conference in 1996 in a bid to renew
links between Iraqi expatriates and their homeland.

Police injure 10 striking teachers in western Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police injured 10 teachers seriously when
they broke up a meeting with clubs and whips as a nationwide
teacher's strike entered its second day Tuesday.
	   Ambrose Adongo, the head of the Kenya National Union of
Teachers, or KNUT, called the strike by 260,000 primary, secondary
and technical school teachers a success.
	   The beatings occurred in Karachuonyo, about 240 kilometers (145
miles) northwest of Nairobi, when police broke up a gathering of
teachers discussing the strike on the grounds it was illegal.
	   ``Armed police stormed our meeting ... and opened fire, ordering
everybody to lie down flat,'' said KNUT official Peter Okeyo Okul.
``The police then descended on us with truncheons, whips and gun
butts, injuring 10 of our colleagues.''
	   The strike, which has left 7 million students idle, coincides
with high school final examinations.
	   President Daniel arap Moi's government agreed a year ago to
raise teachers' salaries by up to 200 percent over five years in a
desperate bid to end a 12-day strike before general elections last
December.
	   Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 20 years and is serving his last
constitutional term, was also worried the strike might hurt his
chances of re-election.
	   After paying only the first increment of the five-part pay hike,
in July the government said it had no money to pay the rest.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said if the raises agreed to
were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's 1998-99 budget
of dlrs 733 million would go to pay salaries.
	   Adongo told a news conference in Nairobi the union is willing to
negotiate another schedule of increments and call off the strike,
but he insisted the government must present a firm offer.
	   ``We are still ready for dialogue, and we will call off the
strike anytime as long as there are continued talks between us and
the government,'' Adongo said.
	   Before the strike, union officials complained the government
made no offer, insisting only that it had no money.
	   There were no reports of strike-related violence in other parts
of the country Tuesday.
	   On Monday, police broke up teachers demonstrations in several
towns and cities, including Nairobi and the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The commander of Lebanon's army will
become the country's next president after winning the crucial
backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon.
	   ``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a
telephone conversation Monday that was headlined on the front-page
of the leftist newspaper As-Safir.
	   Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting
in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller
neighbor.
	   Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said
Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member
Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.
	   The election is a formality since other candidates have little
chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In
another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend
the constitution, which forbids senior public servants from running
for president.
	   The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi
leaves office at the end of his six-year term.
	   The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a
55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite
Muslim.
	   Agreement among the three officials is essential for the smooth
running of the government. Since Lahoud has a good relationship
with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change was expected in
government policy.
	   Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of
the next head of state.
	   Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the
United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home and
has good relations with Syria.
	   But the choice could not have been sealed before a final say
from Assad, who keeps 30,000 troops in this country. His word is
referred to in the Beirut media as ``the password.''
	   Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army
commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during
the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the
55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias. In
Lebanon, the army commander heads the air force, navy and the
ground forces.
	   Many hope he will copy his success with the military in
government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public funds.
	   But some fear that a military man in the nation's highest office
could mean a return to the use of intelligence services to track
civilian life _ the case under Fouad Chehab, the only other army
commander to become president, who ruled from 1958 to 1964.
	   ``The election of a military man is a threat to democracy in
Lebanon,'' Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living in
self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper.

Settlement issue threatens to hamper Albright visit

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
he would go ahead with construction in a Jewish enclave in the West
Bank town of Hebron but that the work would not begin until an
archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
	   With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please both
Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a halt to
settlement expansion.
	   The future of the Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida, a cluster of
mobile homes in Hebron, was raised as Albright visited the region.
	   Last month, in response to the killing of a settler rabbi in his
Tel Romeida trailer, Netanyahu said he would replace the mobile
homes with permanent structures. The rabbi was stabbed to death,
apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu made several contradictory statement and
his intentions were not immediately clear.
	   During a news conference with Albright, Netanyahu said the
mobile homes in Tel Romeida would only be reinforced to make them
bulletproof. ``I want to remind you that this is not
construction,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are not speaking of expanding
the settlement to other territories.''
	   A statement by his office said that archeological digs would
have to be carried out in the neighborhood before building could
begin. Israeli officials said the dig could take several months.
	   But Netanyahu said in the statement that the activity would
entail actual construction of ``permanent structures,'' apparently
more than the simple reinforcement of buildings.
	   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel radio that
the decision to build in Hebron was a violation of peace agreements
and will cause tension particularly because it coincides with
Albright's meeting with Netanyahu.
	   Albright chose to sidestep the issue. She said both sides should
avoid unilateral action, but said she would not comment on the Tel
Romeida issue.
	   Baruch Marzel, a resident of Tel Romeida and a former leader of
the outlawed anti-Arab movement Kach, said Netanyahu was backing
down on his promise to build in the area. ``He is cheating the
Israeli people,'' Marzel said.

Egyptian President pursues mediation of Turkey-Syria crisis

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared
war between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarek, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's position that Syria
is harboring rebel Kurds who perpetrate cross-border attacks on
Turkey. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies the
accusation.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   After Ankara, Mubarak and his delegation headed back to Damascus
late Tuesday for what appeared to be a second round of talks with
Syrian leaders on the crisis.
	   ``We have talked to the Syrians. We have talked to the Turks,''
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters before leaving
for Damascus. ``I hope that we will be able to defuse the
situation.''
	   Demirel showed the Egyptian leader Turkish intelligence reports
allegedly showing that Syria sheltered a Kurdish rebel leader and
his guerrillas in Damascus, in other Syrian cities and in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, a Turkish official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side
Tuesday, saying ``any aggression against Syria will be considered
as an aggression against Libya according to the Arab joint defense
pact.''
	   The United States, along with most countries of the Middle East,
urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution.
	   Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad on Sunday.
Turkey played down Mubarak's role as a go-between, stating that
there was no need for mediation between the two countries.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the bolstering military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel.
	   But the recent rise in tension appears part of Ankara's push to
end fighting in a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency in which 37,000
people have died.
	   Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops to its border with
Syria. Newspapers have suggested that its forces could stage raids
on rebel camps in the Bekaa Valley.

Montenegrin parliament warns against NATO strikes, demands
</HEADLINE>
compliance

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The parliament of Montenegro,
Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia, warned Tuesday against NATO
intervention in Kosovo, but demanded that Yugoslavia fully comply
with all international demands over the Serbian province.
	   Montenegro's pro-western leadership has criticized the policies
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, including the seven-month
crackdown on Kosovo Albanians that has led to NATO planning for air
strikes to stop the bloodshed. Montenegro's parliament is dominated
by Milosevic's opponents.
	   But the parliament warned against NATO intervention as costly in
human lives, property damage and possibly counterproductive by
strengthening ``the position of the supporters of the radical
options over Kosovo.''
	   In an oblique slap at Milosevic, parliament demanded that
``those who are responsible for a negative stand by the
international community toward our country'' meet all international
demands on Kosovo.

U.S. envoy meets defiant Milosevic as NATO strikes loom

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP _ The prospect of NATO airstrikes moved
ominously closer Tuesday as a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he has not met U.N. demands for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Richard Holbrooke was to meet the Yugoslav president for the
second day Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian province,
where the Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence.
	   In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian political leaders,
Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters.
	   His statement appeared to signal that international military
action moved ominously closer to stop Milosevic's crackdown against
the secessionists, which has killed hundreds and left tens of
thousands ethnic Albanians homeless.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen told the Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told the Associated Press Television News that the complete
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
	   ``Who in the right mind would do so? Is there a country in the
world that would do so, especially with an armed rebellion in their
hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Holbrooke spoke by telephone twice with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright about the results of his talks with Milosevic.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' Rubin said. ``NATO military preparations
and discussions and decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke in talks Monday night that his
government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
crisis in Kosovo. But he also called the NATO threats against his
country ``a criminal act.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade Milosevic to
halt his crackdown and enter meaningful talks with ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism
Milosevic would adhere to any such plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army called on NATO
Tuesday to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned as KLA spokesman
last month but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said:
``The Serbian war machine and its military and political structure
must be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.

	   KENEMA, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Traditional fighters wearing
threadbare dresses and womens' wigs ambushed barefoot rebels in
densely forested eastern Sierra Leone, killing at least 52
renegades and wounding many others, paramilitary officers and
troops said Tuesday.
	   The Kamajor traditional fighters, who are battling to defeat the
remnants of Sierra Leone's former junta and their rebel
Revolutionary United Front allies, laid a trap late Monday on a
road near Mandekelema village about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
the Liberian border, Kamajor staff officer Francis Silikie said.
	   At least one Kamajor was killed and three others were missing in
the gun-battle and hand-to-hand fighting that ensued. An unknown
number of rebels drowned while trying to retreat across a small
river, Silikie said.
	   Several rebels wearing tattered civilians' clothes were taken
prisoner in Tuesday's battle and several earlier skirmishes and
were paraded before journalists by Kamajor officers.
	   ``These are the lucky ones,'' said Silikie. ``Some of the rebel
commanders killed have not been identified because they were
completely mutilated by fighters for our just cause.''
	   The rebels, who roam the forests of eastern and northern Sierra
Leone, are widely feared in the interior as a result of mass
killings, rapes and mutilations of unarmed civilians.
	   The Kamajors, a volunteer society of traditional hunters and
fighters from several ethnic groups, have declared a ``patriotic
war'' against the rebels.
	   Although the government has said it cannot afford to pay them,
the Kamajors are widely popular in many communities which often
give food, toll fees and hunting weapons to the fighters in return
for protection from rebels.
	   The fighters believe that by dressing in women's clothing and
wearing garlands of fetishes blessed by their society leaders they
are made impervious to enemy bullets.
	   Although the latest casualties could not be independently
confirmed, journalists witnessed five wounded Kamajors arriving
Tuesday morning in a blood-soaked pickup truck at the hospital in
the diamond-mining town of Kenema.
	   Loads of captured weapons were unloaded at the Kamajors'
headquarters in Kenema, where dozens of battalions of the
traditional fighters have begun amassing for a collective drive
against rebel positions to the east.
	   The Kamajors, who range in age from 8 to 60-years-old use
captured guns as well as traditional weapons such as spears and
axes against the rebels, who formed an alliance with Sierra Leone's
former military junta.
	   The junta and their rebel allies were ousted from power in
February by a West African coalition force fighting on behalf of
Sierra Leone's elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Although the junta and the RUF no longer control power in the
capital, they continue to wage war in the countryside.

American Maitozo, German Zulow win individual vaulting
</HEADLINE>

Devon sted David. Will be updated following team results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ America's Devon Maitozo and Germany's Nadia Zulow
won gold medals Tuesday in the individual vaulting at the 1998
World Equestrian Games.
	   ``This is a dream come true,'' said the 23-year-old Maitozo, who
is from Cupertino, California. ``I bet with myself after winning
the bronze (at the 1996 worlds) that 1998 would be my year to win,
and I did.''
	   Maitozo, on Whiskey 191, totaled 8.890 points following a series
of tests, which ended Tuesday with the free style at the Santa
Barbara arena, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Rome.
	   Mathias Lang of France, on Quitus du Madon, captured the men's
silver with 8.643 points. Germany's Henrik Ossenbrink scored 8.641
points to claim the bronze on Panjano.
	   Zulow took the gold on the women's side, scoring 8.725 points on
Rainbow.
	   American Kerith Lemon clinched the silver on Pasio I with 8.469
points. The 22-year-old from Soquel, California, has two other
silver medals from the 1994 worlds in the Hague and the 1996 worlds
in Kaposvar, Hungary.
	   Germany's Janine Oswald, who was third at the 1996
championships, took home the bronze again with 8.378 points.
	   Vaulting originated as part of military training and is a sort
of gymnastics on horseback. Vaulters carry out a series of
exercises on horseback with the help of a special handle instead of
a saddle. It is not an Olympic sport.
	   The championships, held at three venues near Rome, run through
Sunday.

Russian government to pay debt to space agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government promised to pay its dlrs 44.5
million debt to the Russian Space Agency before the end of the year
so that it can complete a long-delayed component of the
international space station, a top space official said Tuesday.
	   The announcement followed the space agency's decision, announced
Monday, to sell its research time on the international station to
the United States for dlrs 60 million to raise money for the
construction.
	   Russia's space agency has failed to meet three target dates for
the launch of the crew module because of a lack of funds, putting
the whole project more than one year behind schedule.
	   The Russian government's debt will be paid in three installments
of dlrs 15 million in October, November and December, Space Agency
director Yuri Koptev said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   It is not clear how much money Russia needs to finish building
the crew module, but the government payments alone are not expected
to be enough, meaning the deal with NASA will probably stand.
	   Space Agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov said the NASA deal would
not change Russia's rights and obligations under the dlrs 21
billion project and would not hurt Russia's space program. Russia
would only lose research time for the period of the station's
assembly in orbit, expected to last at least four years.
	   Media reports last month said that NASA will also ask Congress
and the White House for approval to buy up to dlrs 660 million in
goods and services from the Russian Space Agency over the next four
years to let it meet its obligations on the international space
station.
	   The project involves 16 countries, including Russia, the United
States, Canada and Japan.
	   A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company, under
contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched on Nov. 20.
NASA will follow in December with the launch of a second part, an
American-built passageway.
	   Another Russian-made module is to be launched in July, not in
April as earlier planned.

Famous or obscure, Nobel winner instantly will be acclaimed the
</HEADLINE>
world over &QL; 
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ There's room for a few more names on a
20th century honor roll of writers, and one will be added this week
when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature
laureate.
	   Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with
readers as well as academics, critics and the authors themselves.
This year's winner _ or, possibly, winners _ will be announced
Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday.
	   ``The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard
of,'' said Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary
magazine. But the Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also
shines a light, usually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people
have read, he added.
	   His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's
convinced Naipaul probably won't win because of his ``dark ...
pessimistic'' and often scathing portrayals of post-colonial
African culture.
	   The academy keeps its deliberations secret. Who is considered
seriously, even who's nominated, isn't disclosed.
	   A writer's nationality, by the terms of the prize founder Alfred
Nobel's will, is supposed to be irrelevant. Two can share the
prize, though the last time that happened was 1974. Winners are
expected to personally receive it: awards are not given
posthumously.
	   Looking at the process from afar, Harold Bloom, a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Letters, said the award committee has
an unsettling record of selections that are ``nationally 'correct'
and politically 'correct.'''
	   The winners list is prestigious, he concedes, but by no means
uniformly lustrous. ``Absolutely not! Outrageously not,'' he said
in a telephone interview from New York. ``They include all kinds of
fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never got one, for heaven's sake.
Neither did Marcel Proust.''
	   Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of
``Blood Meridian''; Philip Roth, author of ``American Pastoral'';
and John Ashbery, ``the best living poet.''
	   A review of recent winners may foreshadow this year's laureate.
Seven of the past 10 were men _ does that favor a woman? Two of the
past three were poets _ does that favor a prose writer?
	   Four of the past 10 wrote in English, and the last three
laureates are European. In comparison, only three Asian writers
have ever won.
	   ``Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine,'' said Abe Harumasa,
editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. ``The
choice could be interpreted as being motivated partly by
politics,'' given the poet's association with China's democracy
movement, ``but it's clear he's a wonderful poet.''
	   Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of Chinese literature at Japan's
prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing
Xin as worthy. The latter is known for her portrayals of the
struggles of Chinese women.
	   China, which translates and publishes the works of many Nobel
winners, ``desperately'' wants its first laureate, he added.
	   Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco Ayala, 92, winner of
this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, said Jose Maria
Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor and secretary of
the jury that selected Ayala.
	   Other presumed Latin candidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas
Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy,
Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works
have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent Associated Press
interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once
again, he might win. ``Let's not get into that,'' he said. ``I just
write.''

Baggage handler takes involuntary trip in aircraft luggage

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A baggage handler took an involuntary
trip to Switzerland in cramped and chilly quarters after being
trapped in the luggage container of a Zurich flight, a Hungarian
airlines official said Tuesday.
	   The man whose name was not released, took the 1 hour 20 minutes
journey Monday in the 3.5 meters (yards)-long, 1.5 meters wide, and
1.1 meters high compartment of the British Aerospace 146-type
aircraft, said Miklos Benczce, director of Malev Hungarian airways.
	   The temperature in the luggage compartment was 5-6 degrees
Celsius (43-43 Fahrenheit), but the man survived the journey safe
and sound after being mistakenly locked in.
	   The man returned to Budapest later Monday by another aircraft,
this time in the passenger's cabin.

promoting younger members and more women, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's

abstention, to recommend Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's handpicked
successor, as chairman. A final vote is to be made at a party
convention on Nov. 7.
	   Schaeuble, who also was re-elected as parliamentary faction

Unions call general strike next week to protest vacation cut
</HEADLINE>
proposal &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Labor unions on Tuesday ordered 1.2 million
Norwegians to strike one day next week to protest a government
proposal to cut national vacations by one day a year.
	   Officials said the planned general strike on Oct. 15 would be
the biggest-single labor action in the history of Norway, a
heavily-unioned country of 4.4 million people.
	   The two-hour protest was expected to disrupt oil production,
banks, public transit, schools, and many other workplaces.
	   ``The government's proposal to remove a vacation day is a
declaration of war against the country's workers,'' stated a joint
communique by the four largest trade unions.
	   Norwegians complain they have among the shortest vacations in
Western Europe: four weeks plus one day paid leave per year.
	   The Christian Democrat-led government of Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik on Monday presented a 1999 national budget that
included sharp spending cuts and tax hikes that aim to cool off
this oil-rich nation's economy before it overheats.
	   The three-party minority coalition proposed reducing vacation
time by one day to exactly four weeks.
	   The extra day was tacked onto vacations in the 1980s by former
Labor prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland as part of a failed plan
to extend vacations by one day a year until the total reached five
weeks, as is common in nieghboring Sweden and other European
nations.
	   It is now known as ``Gro Day.'' Eliminating that day while
hiking taxes, fees and other costs for households was too much for
the unions. The four groups ordered a strike by their 1.4 million
members, excluding about 200,000 who would be scheduled to work to
handle emergency services
	   ``It has created such strong reactions that we had to step in
and control the form protest actions would take,'' said Yngve
Haagensen, leader of Norway's largest union, called the LO.

Frankfurt book fair celebrates 50th anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Established in the rubble of World War
II, the Frankfurt Book Fair celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year as the largest in the world.
	   For five days every fall, publishers from all over the world
exhibit their current and backlist books, seal publishing deals and
trade translation rights in the halls of the Frankfurt fair
grounds.
	   Beginning Wednesday, nearly 300,000 visitors are expected to
press through the halls to visit the 6,500 exhibitors from 105
countries and catch a glimpse of a favorite author. Among this
year's participants: Ken Follet, Patricia Cornwell, Richard
Baldacci and Stewart O'Nan. By comparison, the second largest book
fair, in Chicago, features 1,000 exhibitors.
	   The birth of the Frankfurt Book Fair in September 1949 was
modest. ``It was held in St. Paul's Cathedral with only 200
exhibitors participating,'' director Peter Weidhaas recalled
Tuesday.
	   Frankfurt, like much of Germany, was in ruins, and the book fair
was an attempt to return to normalcy. Germany's great book fair for
centuries had been held in Leipzig, which after the war was under
Soviet occupation and subject to communist censorship.
	   Since establishing the Frankfurt fair, sponsors have evoked the
Leipzig link, claiming a 500-year tradition that dates back to the
invention of type by Gutenburg in Mainz.
	   A modest book fair has been established in Leipzig since former
communist East Germany was unified with West Germany in 1990. But
after 50 years, Frankfurt's dominance is unchallenged.
	   ``In Frankfurt, as early as 1953 there were more international
exhibitors at the fair than German. Today, the proportion is two
thirds foreign to one third German exhibitors,'' said Weidhaas, the
book fair's director.
	   One attribute of the early post war years in Germany was the
strong desire for uncensored and foreign literature, which was
forbidden under the Nazis.
	   American Thornton Wilder was the favorite playwright, Hemingway
the favorite author. Even the United States Information Agency
printed books by American authors in German and made them available
in their Amerika Haus network.
	   Since its inception, the book fair has survived its share of
turbulence.
	   In the late 1960s the wave of student protests against bourgeois
literature, art and politics threatened to engulf the fair itself.
In 1969, protesters destroyed stands of countries they considered
undemocratic and police were called in to restore order.
	   A number of publishers, upset about presence of police, closed
their stalls and threatened never to return. But they did, the very
next year.
	   As Fred Jordan, editor of the New York, avant garde magazine,
``Evergreen Review'' said in 1970: ``I come to Frankfurt because
everybody in the business comes to Frankfurt. It seems to be our
fate, no matter how much we complain about the city ...''
	   In 1976, the Frankfurt Booksellers Association, which sponsors
the book fair, featured literature from Latin America, the first
time a theme was adopted. The result was a huge success, attracting
both big deals and readers to Latin American literature. A country
or continent has been featured almost every year since.
	   In its 50th year the Frankfurt Book Fair features Swiss writers.

Germany's incoming government discovers budget gap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with budget experts saying they found 20 billion mark
gap &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will
have less money for new programs than expected because revenues
next year will be 20 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion) less than
forecast, his budget experts said Tuesday.
	   Finance experts from the Social Democratic Party and the Greens,
meeting ahead of resumed coalition talks on Wednesday, said another
20 billion marks is at risk in the coming years due to
over-generous economic growth forecasts.
	   ``The new government will have to deal with this, but it won't
be easy,'' the Greens' Fritz Kuhn said after the meeting.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's parliamentary faction leader, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, denied there was any gap in the 1999 budget presented by
Finance Minister Theo Waigel last month, calling such reports
fabrications.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens were to focus on finances and
unemployment at Wednesday's talks. Cabinet posts were to be
announced next week.
	   But a Greens leader said Tuesday on Germany's Greens will get at
least two posts _ foreign minister and environment minister _ in
Schroeder's Cabinet.
	   Juergen Trittin will be in the environment post, said Gunda
Roestel, who co-chairs the Greens party with him. Joschka Fischer,
who co-heads the Greens faction in parliament, will take over the
Foreign Ministry, she said.
	   Roestel said the party had proposed two female candidates as
justice minister, adding that the talks with Schroeder's Social
Democrats were ``sharpening.''
	   The Greens said Sunday they wanted to name four ministers, at
least two of whom should be women.
	   Social Democratic lawmaker Ulla Schmidt on Tuesday also called
on Schroeder to appoint women to at least 40 percent of the top
jobs in his government.

Hungarians hope to be in new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The former Communists have dropped
their refusal to cooperate with an ethnic Hungarian party in a
future government, improving the chances for a multiparty coalition
Cabinet to rule Slovakia for the next four years.
	   The Democratic Left last Friday suddenly announced they wound
not enter into a coalition with the Hungarians following last
month's parliamentary elections in which the combined opposition
won a sufficient majority to form a government and change the
constitution.
	   Reacting to the move, Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian
Coalition Party, which represents Slovakia's 550,000 ethnic
Hungarians, threatened to be a strong opposition to the other three
parties if left out of the coalition.
	   Without the Hungarians, the opposition coalition would hold only
78 seats in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament, far short of the 90
votes needed to make changes to the constitution.
	   But that was the main objective of all opposition parties in the
campaign leading up ot the elections. After the vote, Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar said he would step down later this month,
worsening even further prospects for his Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia to form a government.
	   The Democratic Left's reluctance to cooperate with the
Hungarians was prompted by fears that the latter might seek
regional autonomy and construction of a controversial hydropower
project as well as challenge the validity of the so-called Benes
decrees.
	   Under the decrees bearing the name of former President Eduard
Benes, up to 60,000 Hungarians _ alongside millions of ethnic
Germans _ were deported from the territory of Czechoslovakia after
1945 as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people and their property
was confiscated by the state.
	   The chairman of the Hungarian party, Bela Bugar said on Monday
that ``the Party of the Democratic Left changed its mind, probably
because they want to improve their position in the government.''
	   Bugar said his party did not bring up the Benes'decrees at the
negotiations.
	   ``We want to form a government for four years, and as soon as we
can. We do not want to go back to these questions when we are in
the government,'' said Jozef Migas, chairman of the Party of the
Democratic Left on Tuesday.
	   The negotiations of the four opposition parties will continue on
Thursday when they are to discuss a coalition agreement.

Pilots strike grounds major domestic airline in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A strike by 335 pilots grounded all aircraft
operated by the Norwegian airline Braathens ASA on Tuesday, less
than two days before the carrier has to move to Norway's new
international airport.
	   The pilots walked out after state mediation failed to settle new
terms for their employment at Gardermoen, an airport that opens
north of Oslo on Thursday to replace the country's current main
airport, Fornebu.
	   Gardermoen is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Oslo,
while Fornebu is just a few kilometers (miles) from the center of
the capital city. The pilots demanded that extra travel time to the
new airport be counted as work time, which the airline refused,
Braathens said in a statement.
	   The strike stops about 200 flights a day, mainly on Norwegian
domestic routes. It was not clear how long the conflict might last.
	   According to Norway's NRK radio network, Braathens managed to
direct all off its aircraft away from Fornebu Airport before the
strike began.
	   Norway's Civil Aviation Administration said any aircraft still
at the old Fornebu airport after it closes permanently on Wednesday
evening would not be allowed to take off, and would have to be
disassembled for transport.

Palestinians say Albright brought nothing new from Israel to talks

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright brought nothing new from Israel to her talks with Yasser
Arafat on a troop withdrawal from the West Bank, Palestinian
officials said.
	   Albright met Arafat in the Palestinian-run West Bank city of
Jericho as part of her efforts to bring the sides closer to
completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal. If
Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps over a U.S. peace
initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely sign a deal later
this month in Washington.
	   Officials said that Albright could lead three-way talks
Wednesday with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
during the second day of her Mideast shuttle.
	   ``A trilateral meeting will depend on what Secretary Albright
brings to us from Netanyahu tomorrow. She did not bring anything
from Netanyahu today,'' said a senior Palestinian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Albright met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem, several hours after
her Tuesday arrival.
	   The Palestinian official said Albright and Arafat discussed
``generalities.'' ``There were no specifics.''
	   Speaking after the Jericho meeting, Albright told reporters that
there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make,'' before
the Washington summit scheduled for October 15-18.
	   ``We reviewed in a comprehensive way all the issues of the
American initiative which (Arafat) has accepted in principle. Our
challenge now is to move forward and to try to reach an
agreement,'' she said.
	   Arafat said he hoped the secretary's visit would be one more
step toward settling remaining issues between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   Time is running out to resolve a host of other disputes such as
the status of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital,
Jewish settlements and permanent borders.
	   The current peace accords expire in May 1999, when the
Palestinians had hoped to declare independence. However, Netanyahu
opposes Palestinian statehood and the two sides have been haggling
for more than 18 months over a further Israeli troop redeployment
from West Bank areas, which it committed to in a previous accord.
	   Arafat's aide, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians had not been
shown Israel's maps for the proposed pullback. ``I think if there
is a sticking point, that is that Mr. Netanyahu refuses the concept
of reciprocity.''
	   The United States has proposed Israel withdraw from 13 percent
of the area, and after months of negotiating, both sides seem ready
to accept the deal with certain conditions. Israel wants security
guarantees from the Palestinians to strike at Islamic militants who
threaten to disrupt any peace.

Russian vows to veto airstrikes, Belarus offers military aid to

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia threatened Tuesday to use its veto in the
U.N. Security Council to stop NATO airstrikes against Serbia, while
Belarus offered military assistance to their traditional Slav ally.
	   ``Use of force won't normalize the situation,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Ivan Ivanov reiterated in an interview with the Interfax
news agency. ``It will do just the opposite.''
	   Russia has for months opposed the use of force against Serbs,
their long-time allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren. Russia has
intensified efforts to find a peaceful solution to fighting in
Kosovo province as the United States and its NATO allies appear to
be moving toward the use of airstrikes.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin dispatched his foreign and
defense ministers to Serbia, and he spent much of Monday and
Tuesday on the telephone with world leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Yeltsin and French President Jacques Chirac agreed that force
would not work and would have ``serious international
consequences,'' a statement from the Kremlin press office said.
	   In Greece, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said NATO
strikes would seriously damage Russia's relations with the West.
	   ``We have invested so much effort to create this so far fragile,
but developing house of European security for the 21st century,''
Sergeyev was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``The
20th century must not end with a war.''
	   Russia agrees with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's violent campaigns against ethnic Albanians must be
stopped and has approved Security Council resolutions that don't
include the use of force.
	   But if the Security Council considers applying force in Kosovo,
Russia ``without a doubt will use its right to veto,'' Ivanov told
Interfax.
	   In neighboring Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko said his
country will give military help to Serbia if there are NATO
airstrikes, although he noted his constitution prevents him from
sending troops.
	   ``We will give Yugoslavia any support and help that our fellow
Slavs may need,'' Lukashenko told reporters. ``Anything the
Yugoslavs will need, we will provide, including military
(assistance).''
	   Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader openly nostalgic for the
Soviet Union, frequently tries to defy and criticize the West and
has a history of troubled relations with western democracies.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange closed sharply higher Tuesday, rebounding a day after the
bourse's sharpest plunge in a year and a half.
	   The 27-share AEX index closed up 48.87 points, or 5.9 percent,
to 878.18 after soaring in the late afternoon on the back of a
strong opening on Wall Street.
	   Tuesday's gains were in sharp contrast to Monday's losses. On
Monday, the Amsterdam bourse closed at its lowest point since June
1997. The index has lost more than 20 percent of its value in the
last month.
	   Tuesday's best performer was Dutch-Belgian financial services
group Fortis. Its shares jumped 15 percent after an announcement
late Monday that it was canceling a planned 4 billion guilder (dlrs
2 billion) stock issue.
	   Other financial stocks also rebounded strongly Tuesday. ABN
Amro, the leading Dutch bank, closed up 9.7 percent; Dutch
insurance giant Aegon closed up 6.4 percent; and the ING group
ended the day up 11 percent.
	   Shares in KLM Royal Dutch Airlines rose 9.2 percent, and prices
of Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever closed up 8.2
percent.

France Telecom to develop new Net access computer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with company confirmation, details. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France Telecom and IBM will develop a new machine
that seeks to combine the best features of the PC and the Minitel
to allow improved access to the Internet, the companies said
Tuesday.
	   The Minitel, a screen and keyboard console linked to the
telephone, has since 1983 given users access to a variety of
information services in France. But its Internet access has been
limited to E-mail messages.
	   About 15 million people use more than 6 million Minitel
terminals, which can be rented for as little as 22 francs (dlrs
5.60) a month.
	   Users won't be able to access the Internet via the current
Minitels, but the new computer, to be tested next year, will offer
the best features of both, the companies said.
	   ``France Telecom wants to democratize Internet use by making
technological innovations accessible to as many people as
possible,'' said France Telecom president Michel Bon.
	   The partially privatized company didn't say how much it would
invest in the project, but said it will work with IBM to develop
software that could then be sold to other companies around the
world.
	   The companies want to combine the simplicity of a Minitel with
the functionality of a personal computer.
	   A PC-Minitel combination could help to drive Internet
development in France, which has lagged behind that of some other
countries, analysts said.
	   ``Buying a pricey and complex PC is still a big obstacle for
many people and now that could be reduced,'' said Bram Moerman,
managing director for France at Analysys, a communications
consulting firm. ``People could get cheap access to the Net for the
first time.''
	   In a recent study by OECD, France ranked 19th out of 29
countries in terms of Internet use.
	   Analysts say only four percent of French people subscribe to
Internet services, less than half the figure in Britain, Germany
and Scandinavia, Europe's most-developed markets.
	   The popularity of the Minitel is one of the main reasons that
the Internet has been slower to develop in France. Many French
consumers are comfortable with the Minitel and see Internet access
as too complex.
	   ``Takeup of services has a lot to do with familiarity and France
is familiar with the Minitel,'' said Sam Paltridge, director of
telecom research at the OECD.
	   He added that phone charges in France still deter many from
getting wired, whereas most local calls in the United States are
free.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy seeking a breakthrough
in the Balkans said Tuesday that President Slobodan Milosevic has
not met the terms laid down by the United Nations to prevent NATO
military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Diplomat Richard Holbrooke said Serb military police maintain a
strong presence in Kosovo despite repeated international demands
for them to ease their crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information is not good,'' he said.
	   The same message to Milosevic was voiced in Washington by U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen.
	   Clinton said Holbrooke was telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he
must do and to make clear that NATO is prepared to act if President
Milosevic fails to honor the U.N. resolutions.
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   Cohen told Congress a pullback of troops in Kosovo by Milosevic
was not enough to ward off NATO attacks. Any such airstrikes might
be followed by some form of ``international presence'' on the
ground, he said.
	   Cohen said airstrikes could cost Milosevic a substantial portion
of his military capability.''There is a lot that can and will be
done by air,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke conferred here with Ibrahim Rugova and other ethnic
Albanian leaders and then flew back to the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade for a second meeting with Milosevic.
	   During their meeting late Monday, Milosevic said he was anxious
for a political settlement with ethnic Albanians but dismissed NATO
threats as a ``criminal act.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to Belgrade in what appeared to be a
last-ditch effort to persuade Milosevic to halt his crackdown and
enter talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the province.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders have refused to negotiate until
Milosevic halts the seven-month offensive that has killed hundreds
and driven a quarter of a million people from their homes.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose attacks on Serb police
prompted the crackdown, has rejected any peace formula short of
full independence and has refused to accept Rugova as its leader.
The KLA has urged NATO to attack.
	   ``The Serbian war machine and its military and political
structure must be destroyed,'' said Adem Demaci, an ethnic Albanian
politician who speaks for the rebels.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Jerusalem, Holbrooke briefed U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright twice on his talks, her spokesman said.
	   ``President Milosevic has not agreed at this time to ...
sustainable and irreversible compliance with the demands of the
international community,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   There was no sign the diplomatic deadlock was ending.
	   French President Jacques Chirac warned that if Serb forces don't
pull out of the province as demanded, NATO intervention ``will
become inevitable.''
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Moscow would veto any Security Council resolution to
approve airstrikes, which some NATO members believe is necessary
for the alliance to act.
	   China also said Tuesday it opposed the use of force or sanctions
in Kosovo.
	   China and Russia _ along with the United States, France and
Britain _ have veto power as permanent members of the Security
Council.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia.
	   But the KLA opposes the interim formula, and Albright voiced
skepticism Milosevic would adhere to such a plan in any case.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright told
reporters en route from Washington to Jerusalem.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes. No
decision is expected until Thursday, when NATO ambassadors meet in
Brussels.
	   Allied leaders are still debating what form intervention would
take, and whether they are prepared after initial airstrikes to
send in troops to enforce the peace in Kosovo.

Amid growing tensions, plant director killed in southern Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A factory director in North Ossetia was shot and
killed and his deputy seriously injured in the latest violent
incident in Russia's restive southern regions, a news agency said
Tuesday.
	   Soslav Sumenov, the 36-year-old director of a corn-processing
plant, was killed Monday outside a house in the center of the North
Ossetian capital, Vladikavkaz, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   His deputy, Erik Tandelov, was hospitalized with multiple
gunshot wounds.
	   Sumenov had complained about threats and extortion attempts
against him, and police believe the killing was linked to Sumenov's
work, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   North Ossetia, which is located near Chechnya, has been plagued
by spillover violence from the breakaway region as well as its own
ethnic conflicts.
	   Russia's Caucasus Mountains have been plagued by kidnappings and
other crimes since the end of Chechnya's two-year war for
independence ended in 1996. Hundreds of Russians and foreigners
have been abducted by gangs seeking ransom, and dozens are still
being held.
	   An official from the Russian government mission in Chechnya,
Akmal Saidov, was kidnapped, tortured and killed last week. He was
buried in Moscow on Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian lawmakers Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the nationalities
committee, called Saidov's killing a ``brazen political
assassination aimed at torpedoing all peace agreements signed
between Moscow and (Chechnya's capital) Grozny,'' Interfax
reported.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander working for a British phone
company were kidnapped over the weekend.
	   Chechnya's deputy prosecutor general Magomed Magomadov said that
a half-hour after the kidnapping, three people were treated for
gunshot wounds at a Chechen hospital, and investigators suspect
they have been involved in the kidnapping.
	   However, the hospital apparently discharged the men without
identifying them, Interfax reported.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin expressed
``deep concern'' over the kidnappings, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``The kidnappings of foreigners ... can be regarded only as a
challenge to the present Chechen leadership and to the world
community,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov planned to meet with
parliamentary deputies on Thursday to discuss the ``political
crisis'' in the republic and opposition calls for Maskhadov's
resignation, Chechnya's deputy premier Turpal Atgeriyev said,
according to Interfax.
	   Maskhadov was also planning to meet with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday to discuss the increasing tensions.
The announcement has riled Chechen opposition leader Shamil
Basayev, who had led a five-day demonstration against Maskhadov in
Grozny.

Radio: Uganda deploys troops along Sudanese border after bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army deployed troops to two
Uganda towns near the border with Sudan after they were bombed by a
Sudanese plane, a radio station said Tuesday.
	   The troops were sent to Adjumani and Pakele, about 350
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Kampala, where bombs wounded
six people on Saturday, the private Central Broadcasting Service
said.
	   ``The army has been deployed in Adjumani and is capable of
destroying Sudanese planes,'' the radio quoted regional commander,
Col. Julius Oketa, as saying. ``There should be no fear.''
	   The report could not be independently verified, and the military
spokesman could not be reached for comment. The broadcast did not
say how many troops had been deployed.
	   The aircraft dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani,
goverment and aid officials said Monday.
	   They fell near the Adjumani offices of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees and the U.N. World Food Program, and in
the compound of a dlrs 9 million government hospital recently
opened by President Yoweri Museveni.
	   About 158,756 refugees from Sudan's 15-year civil war live in
more than two dozen settlements in the area.
	   Uganda has protested the bombing, but the Sudanese government
denies carrying out the attack.
	   Sudan has repeatedly charged that both Uganda and Eritrea are
backing the latest offensive by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army in southern Sudan.
	   Both countries have denied the allegations.
	   On Sunday, Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir repeated charges
that Museveni had sent troops into southern Sudan and threatened to
take the war to Uganda.
	   ``The battles with Museveni will not be confined to the southern
Sudan jungles alone,'' el-Bashir was quoted as saying in the
independent newspaper Akhbar al-Youm.
	   The Sudanese media said an estimated 600 Eritreans are fighting
in Sudan. It said among those killed was an Eritrean officer,
identified as Omar Tashombi, who commanded artillery units.
	   Sudanese rebels, drawing support from Christians and followers
of tribal religions, have been waging a military campaign against
the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 1983 for more autonomy
for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

Nigeria protests Cameroon oil deal in disputed territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria on Tuesday accused neighboring
Cameroon of awarding an oil exploration contract to a foreign
company in the disputed territory of the oil-rich Bakassi
peninsula.
	   Acting Director of Defense Information Sam Tella said Cameroon
had signed a four-year exploration deal with a Canadian firm in an
area called Rio Del Ray.
	   Citing a Cameroonian newspaper report as the source for his
information, Tella said if the news was accurate it would represent
a violation of territory claimed by both Nigeria and Cameroon.
	   Disputes over the Bakassi peninsula have nearly driven the two
West African neighbors to war and have set off a string of armed
clashes in recent months.
	   Earlier this year, the World Court at the Hague deemed it had
jurisdiction to rule over the dispute, although Nigeria has
repeatedly said it would not necessarily abide by the court's
ruling if it was not in its favor.
	   The World Court also ruled to enjoin both Nigeria and Cameroon
from initiating any new projects in the contested region until a
settlement had been reached.
	   Tella said Nigeria's Foreign Ministry planned to lodge a formal
protest over the reported contract.
	   Nigeria earlier this year accused Cameroon of massing more than
2,000 troops in the peninsula as a prelude to war.
	   Several times in recent months Nigeria has accused Cameroon of
attacking unarmed villagers in the disputed section of the
peninsula. Cameroon has leveled similar charges against Nigeria.
	   Both sides claim sovereignty over the Bakassi peninsula in the
Gulf of Guinea. At least 87 people have been killed in sporadic
clashes since 1994.
	   Oil and petroleum are the biggest foreign-exchange earners for
both Cameroon and Nigeria.

Venus and Serena Williams advance to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Venus Williams, fresh from her
lucrative victory at the Grand Slam Cup, and sister Serena advanced
Tuesday to the second round of the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   Both sisters needed three sets to go through in the dlrs 450,000
indoor tournament that has drawn all top-ranked women players
except Monica Seles.
	   Venus Williams beat Silvia Farina of Italy 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, and
Serena Williams defeated Czech qualifier Kveta Hrdlickova 7-6
(7-5), 3-6, 6-0.
	   The tournament could see Lindsay Davenport displace Martina
Hingis at the top of the rankings.
	   Both had a bye into the second round and were not in action
Tuesday.
	   But both have tough second-round matches: Davenport plays Mary
Pierce and Hingis is up against Anna Kournikova, who has already
beaten the No. 1 once this year.
	   Kournikova slept through the first set against qualifier Barbara
Schett, overcame a 5-2 deficit in the third set, won the last five
points in the decisive tiebreaker and finally prevailed 1-6, 6-4,
7-6 (7-5).
	   The fifth-seeded Venus Williams hit an amazing backhand winner
down the line to win the first set, but she quickly ran into
trouble in the second.
	   Farina broke serve for a 3-2 lead and gained another break to go
up 5-2. Williams pulled one break back but could not prevent the
Italian form taking the second set.
	   The third set also began badly for Williams when she dropped her
serve in the first game.
	   But the American broke back immediately and then took a decisive
3-1 lead. Farina, ranked No. 24, saved one match point with a
volley, but Williams than hit an overhead smash that the Italian
could not get over the net.
	   Williams, 18, won the inaugural edition of the women's Grand
Slam Cup on Sunday in Munich, beating Patty Schnyder in three sets
to win dlrs 800,000.
	   Her 17-year-old sister Serena struggled in the first two sets
against Hrdlickova, who matched the American's power from the
baseline and often came up to score with volleys.
	   But after Williams had saved three break points to hold serve at
the start of the third set, Hrdlickova, who is ranked No. 64, ran
out of steam against the 19th-ranked American.

In its first hours, Sweden's government faces call for
</HEADLINE>
no-confidence vote &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Opening Sweden's new Parliament on
Tuesday, Prime Minister Goeran Persson said the government should
make major strides in the next decade and opposition leader Carl
Bildt said it shouldn't last into next week.
	   Following Persson's speech to the Riksdag, whose members were
chosen in Sept. 20 elections, Bildt called for a declaration of no
confidence in the government.
	   Persson remained prime minister after the elections, even though
his Social Democrats party got less than 37 percent of the vote,
its worst showing in a national election.
	   The weak showing means the Social Democrats have remained the
governing party only by assembling an awkward cooperation with the
ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens.
	   ``After an election that involved a very significant decline for
the government party, the prime minister should step down and
prepare space for a government-building process under the
leadership of the parliament speaker,'' Bildt said in calling for
the vote of no confidence, which could be held as early as
Thursday.
	   Bildt's conservative Moderates got just 22 percent of the vote
in the recent elections, but would be likely to get the support of
three other non-socialist parties in a no-confidence vote.
	   Together, the Social Democrats, Left and Greens have 190 of the
Riksdag's 349 seats and it is unlikely either of the two smaller
parties would support an effort to push the Social Democrats out of
power.
	   Nonetheless, Bildt's move keeps pressure on a government that
many Swedes fear will be ineffectual because of the unusual
alliance that keeps it afloat.
	   Persson, in his speech opening the parliament, declared that
``Sweden will step into the next decade with more jobs, greater
rights and widened cooperation.''
	   ``Sweden will contribute to forming Europe's future,'' he said.
``Membership in the European Union gives Sweden the possibility to
work for a continent characterized by democracy, solidarity and
openness.''
	   That statement underlined one of the potential weaknesses of the
government. Both the Left and the Greens are strongly opposed to
Sweden's membership in the EU and are expected to push for a
referendum on whether Sweden should permanently stay out of the
bloc's common-currency system.

E-W Europeans join forces in fighting crime, child porno,
</HEADLINE>
pollution &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Child Exploitation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The 15 European Union nations and 11 neighbors
pledged to join forces Tuesday to fight against organized crime,
child pornography and cross-border pollution.
	   Their foreign ministers said in a statement after a one-day
meeting ``the prevention of, and the fight against, sexual
exploitation of children, in particular child pornography requires
concerted action.''
	   They added the smuggling of human beings ``is emerging more and
more frequently as a new and serious form of organized crime.''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his country registered
some 17,000 cases of sexual abuse of children in 1997. He estimated
child pornography had a turnover last year of 1.5 billion marks
(almost dlrs 1 billion).
	   Jozef Sestak, Slovakia's deputy foreign minister, said his
country ``has become a transit country for prostitution,
pornography, sex and pedophile tourism.''
	   ``The problem of child prostitution requires a concerted
approach ... with police corps abroad in detecting and recording
child pornography and child sexual abuse for commercial purposes,''
he told the meeting.
	   The European ministers also vowed to boost cooperation in
matters of cross-border pollution from the Arctic Circle to the
Mediterranean.
	   ``We are aware of the international dimension of environmental
issues and the need to further strengthen the cooperation among
participants in this area,'' the ministers said in a joint
statement.
	   The foreign ministers met in the Europe Conference _ a forum the
EU invented in 1997 to bring the EU nations together with all
candidate EU members, plus Turkey. However, Turkey, upset at being
snubbed as a candidate member, has to date boycotted all Europe
Conference meetings.

Students led by Khamenei's brother rally against press crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 4,000 students led by the brother
of Iran's most powerful cleric demonstrated Tuesday against a
crackdown on the press by hard-liners in the ruling clergy.
	   ``We believe any confrontation with the press should be done
according to the law,'' said Hadi Khamenei, the younger brother of
Iran's hard-line spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Hadi Khamenei also is adviser for press affairs for Iran's
moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, and owns a liberal-leftist
newspaper, World of Islam.
	   ``If any newspaper breaks the limit of freedom, it should be
confronted _ but legally, in an open court with the presence of
lawyers, a jury and a judge,'' Khamenei told the demonstrators near
Tehran University.
	   In recent months, hard-liners at the Ministry of Information
have shut down six publications, including two on Monday, and
arrested six journalists for allegedly printing lies. The
ministry's power stems from its authority to issue publication
licenses.
	   The crackdown is stymieing efforts by Khatami to give more
freedom to the press. Still, a Khatami loyalist controls the
Interior Ministry, which gives permission for public rallies.
	   Tuesday's demonstration underscored the split in Iran's clerical
regime between hard-liners and moderates over relaxing the strict
social and political rules that were imposed after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   At the university, students carried pictures of Khatami and old
issues of banned newspapers, Tous and Jameah.
	   Streets surrounding the university were closed by dozens of
police, while bus loads of antiriot police waited to intervene in
case of trouble. But the demonstration ended without incident.
	   Journalists say they are the victims of powerful hard-liners in
the regime, who have found themselves under increasing attack by an
increasingly daring press.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on the judiciary to deal with
what he calls ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   The demonstration, which was called ``Freedom, security and
people's participation,'' also criticized the system of electing a
70-member Assembly of Experts whose job is to choose Iran's
spiritual leader.
	   Candidates for the assembly are vetted by a 12-member Guardian
Council, which is controlled by the hard-liners. The council also
approves candidates for parliament and the presidency.
	   Elections for the Assembly of Experts are scheduled for Oct. 23.
Members serve eight-year terms.
	   The student demonstrators called on Khatami to push for
canceling the screening process of candidates.
	   ``No faction has any right to impose its factional interests on
the people in the name of religion. We ask the cabinet of Khatami
to act like the majority government, not a minority,'' said Maysam
Saeedi, one of the speakers at the rally.

Hungarians hope to be in new government

 &UR; Eds: DELETES erroneous reference to hydropower dam in 5th graf . &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The former Communists have dropped
their refusal to cooperate with an ethnic Hungarian party in a
future government, improving the chances for a multiparty coalition
Cabinet to rule Slovakia for the next four years.
	   The Democratic Left last Friday suddenly announced they wound
not enter into a coalition with the Hungarians following last
month's parliamentary elections in which the combined opposition
won a sufficient majority to form a government and change the
constitution.
	   Reacting to the move, Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian
Coalition Party, which represents Slovakia's 550,000 ethnic
Hungarians, threatened to be a strong opposition to the other three
parties if left out of the coalition.
	   Without the Hungarians, the opposition coalition would hold only
78 seats in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament, far short of the 90
votes needed to make changes to the constitution.
	   But that was the main objective of all opposition parties in the
campaign leading up ot the elections. After the vote, Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar said he would step down later this month,
worsening even further prospects for his Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia to form a government.
	   The Democratic Left's reluctance to cooperate with the
Hungarians was prompted by fears that the latter might seek
regional autonomy and challenge the validity of the so-called Benes
decrees.

Four French players undergo drug tests; training delayed

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ A training session by the French
soccer squad was interrupted Tuesday after four players were chosen
by authorities to undergo a random drug test.
	   The tests were ordered by the French Sports Ministry, and the
players were asked to submit urine samples.
	   French Football Federation spokesman Philippe Tournon said the
identity of the players would not be revealed, citing the need for
confidentiality.
	   The tests meant the squad's first training session was delayed
by about 30 minutes. France is preparing for an Oct. 10 European
Championship qualifier against Russia. Four days later it is to
play Andorra.
	   It was the second time in nine months that authorities have
descended on a French training camp to conduct tests. Last
December, four players also had their urine tested, but the results
proved negative.
	   Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet has said the government
should take a stronger role in preventing the use of illegal
substances in soccer, and in sport in general.
	   Earlier this year, the Tour de France cycling race was plagued
by a drug scandal after the Festina team was expelled for admitting
to using the banned doping substance EPO.
	   Six other teams then withdrew in protest of a police
investigation into further drug-taking allegations.
	   A drug scandal is also currently overshadowing Italian soccer,
with leading clubs accused of supplying players with
performance-enhancing substances.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A clash between special police
forces and a group of former paramilitary fighters ended with a
dozen people hurt and six men arrested in the Salvadoran capital.
	   The police fired tear gas Monday night to break up a peaceful
demonstration by 2,000 former fighters who are demanding government
compensation for their services during El Salvador's 1979-92 civil
war.
	   ``The protest was peaceful, and they attacked us with gases,''
said Augustin Flores of the Association of Salvadoran Agriculture
Producers, which represents about 30,000 former paramilitary
fighters.
	   The group is demanding dlrs 2,000, housing and farmland for each
farm laborer who helped the army fight leftist rebels during the
civil war.
	   It has rejected President Armando Calderon Sol's offer to
provide monthly pensions of dlrs 34.50 to all fighters who are over
the age of 45 and who served for more than 20 years.

U.S.: Agreement on teeth for germ-war pact hopeful by end 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV102 &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The increasing danger of a rogue country using
germ warfare is pushing negotiators finally to give meaning to a
global ban on biological weapons, a key U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   ``This is a very urgent problem,'' said John Holum, acting
undersecretary of state for arms control. ``It's become worse, not
better, since 1972.''
	   The United States estimates a dozen countries have developed
biological weapons, Holum said, but he named only Iraq as being on
the list.
	   Despite U.N. inspections, currently broken off, Iraq remains a
major concern and is capable of rebuilding its germ-warfare
capacity in a very short period, Holum said.
	   The 26-year-old Biological Weapons Convention is little more
than a pledge not to develop or stockpile biological weapons
without any provisions to catch or punish those who do.
	   Holum, who came to Geneva on Monday to prod negotiators, told
reporters the United States' new push to put teeth in the treaty
have a good chance of succeeding after four years of desultory
talks.
	   He said he thought it realistic for negotiators to spend 20
weeks in talks in 1999, nearly double the amount of time scheduled
this year.
	   That will make it possible to wrap up the accord by the end of
the year so that countries could attend a signing conference in
2000 and implement the tougher treaty the next year, Holum said.
	   Negotiators are trying to add to the pact some of the
verification features of the chemical weapons treaty, adopted after
the Gulf War under the specter of Iraq's arsenal of poison gas.
	   Holum said that biological weapons often are paired with
chemical weapons, but really should be classed with nuclear bombs
because of the number of people that can be wiped out with a small
amount of material.
	   Holum said the treaty must empower inspectors to look for any
dangerous material because new types of pathogens constantly appear
which could be used for biological weapons.
	   Countries now generally agree on the need for on-site
``challenge inspections'' where there is a suspicious outbreak of
disease or a credible allegation of possession of illegal material,
he said.
	   But work is also needed to develop other less drastic forms of
inspection, Holum added.
	   A means of inspecting industrial sites while maintaining
legitimate business secrets also need to be resolved, he said.
	   Some 140 nations, including Iran and Libya, have ratified the
biological weapons treaty, and another 18 have signed it. The
accord was approved during the height of the Cold War when no one
seriously thought germ warfare possible.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has made a better treaty a top
priority. Chinese President Jiang Zemin joined him last June in
backing the effort.

Russia condemns Turkey's attacks on Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Tuesday condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops, a news agency said.
	   The Turkish government sent about 10,000 soldiers into northern
Iraq earlier this month to attack Kurdish rebels. The raid followed
two days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases.
	   The attacks were a ``gross violation of the sovereignty of a
neighboring country and an open encroachment on its territorial
integrity,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said.
	   Russia also demands that Turkey ``immediately withdraw its
troops from northern Iraq and not allow any such violent actions in
the future,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   He also noted that Moscow is worried about the possibility of
increased unrest in the region, which borders several former Soviet
republics and is close to Russia.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Turkish-Kurdish war has killed more than 37,000 people since
1984.

Cabinda separatists say 200 fighters and 35 civilians killed in
</HEADLINE>
Angolan offensive &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ More than 200 people have died in recent
fighting between Angolan troops and armed separatists in the
Angolan enclave of Cabinda, the enclave's independence movement
said Tuesday.
	   Clashes in the territory's eastern region have killed more than
200 armed rebels and Angolan soldiers, the separatists said in a
statement faxed to the Associated Press in Lisbon. The statement
also claimed that Angolan soldiers slaughtered 35 civilians who
refused to act as guides for them.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   Angolan troops began advancing on rebel strongholds after
crossing into the tiny oil-rich territory from Congo two weeks ago.
	   The Angolan government last week acknowledged carrying out
military operations in Cabinda but declined to give details.
Officials in Luanda were not immediately available for comment
Tuesday.
	   Cabinda is an impoverished 7,000-square-kilometer
(4,400-square-mile) patch of Angolan territory wedged between Congo
and the Republic of Congo, north of Angola.
	   Major western oil companies operate platforms off the Cabindan
coast and have bases in the enclave's coastal capital, also called
Cabinda. Oil revenue provides much of the Angolan government's
income.
	   Heavy Angolan security in the capital has kept the separatists
in remote inland areas since they launched their fight for
independence two decades ago following Angola's independence from
Portugal.
	   Angola has also deployed troops in western Congo, near the
Cabinda border, to help President Laurent Kabila quell an
insurgency.

Policeman dies as Northern Ireland politicians depart for New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's conflict
claimed another victim Tuesday when a police officer died from
wounds suffered in a grenade attack last month.
	   Politicians from all sides condemned those responsible for
killing Constable Frank O'Reilly, 30. He had suffered severe blast
wounds to his head when police officers confronted a militant mob
Sept. 5 in the hard-line Protestant town of Portadown.
	   Extremists have protested almost nightly in the town since July,
when police and British soldiers prevented a Protestant fraternal
group, the Orange Order, from conducting their annual march through
Portadown's main Catholic section.
	   Northern Ireland's police commander, Chief Constable Ronnie
Flanagan, noted that O'Reilly was a Catholic within the
predominantly Protestant force and also helped coach a Protestant
youth soccer team in Portadown.
	   ``Frank bridged all the divides in our society,'' Flanagan said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said those responsible for
throwing the homemade grenade ``should hang their heads in shame.
It is time the unseemly confrontation in Portadown was brought to a
speedy conclusion.''
	   But Portadown's chief spokeman for the Orange Order, David
Jones, said the protests would continue until the group got to
march past hostile Catholic homes along the town's Garvaghy Road.
	   To call off protests now, Jones said, ``would give no guarantee
that Portadown would be peaceful. In fact, the reverse could be
true.''
	   O'Reilly, who left behind a Protestant wife and three children _
the youngest just 15 weeks old _ was the first officer killed since
the Irish Republican Army shot dead two policemen in June 1997, one
month before the outlawed group called a cease-fire.
	   ``This is a dastardly murder of a brave young officer, who was
simply doing his duty in Portadown, protecting people and their
property,'' said David Trimble, who has been elected to lead a new
cross-community government for Northern Ireland under terms of
April's peace agreement.
	   Trimble, a Protestant who represents Portadown in British
Parliament in London, left for New York on Tuesday with Seamus
Mallon, his moderate Catholic colleague, to start an 11-city tour
of the United States and Canada in hopes of drumming up increased
business investment in Northern Ireland.

Turkish publisher can't travel to Germany to get Book Fair prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Turkish publisher Ayse Nur Zarakolu
has been been banned from traveling to Germany to pick up an award
from the this year's international Book Fair, an official said
Tuesday.
	   Gerhard Kurtze, president of the German Book Publishers'
Association, said that Zarakolu was to be the first recipient of
the newly-established ``Freedom to Publish Award'' to be presented
at the fair annually.
	   Fair officials have strongly protested the travel ban through
government channels, because hundreds of publishers, authors
journalists and book dealers were being hindered in their work
worldwide, Kurtze said.
	   Zarakolu, 42, has been a publisher with Belge Publishing House
based in Istanbul for 20 years. She has served a total of almost 16
months in prison for publishing books raising the issues of the
Kurdish war and human rights violations in Turkey.
	   Other court cases are still pending against her. The latest is
about a book on executions by military coup leaders in 1980, which
went on sale early last year.
	   ``I have been trying to get a passport since 1993,'' said
Zarakolu in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in
Ankara. She said police were returning her application without an
explanation.
	   ``They are after us for our struggle for peace,'' Zarakolu said.
	   Kurtze said the award would be accepted Wednesday for Zarakolu
by her husband Ragip Zarakolu, a columnist and writer, who was
allowed to travel to Frankfurt with their son.

U.S. envoy meets defiant Milosevic as NATO strikes loom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs: UPDATES with more Yugoslav troops pulled out.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP _ The prospect of NATO air strikes
moved ominously closer Tuesday as a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he has not met U.N. demands for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Richard Holbrooke was to meet the Yugoslav president for the
second day Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian province,
where the Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence.
	   In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian political leaders,
Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Belgrade, reporters saw
about 100 Yugoslav military vehicles of all sorts - ranging from
armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops - moving
outside Kosovo. It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance
with international demands that his forces pull far back from
front-line areas.

	   ``It's very satisfying to win against the world number five,''
said Kiefer, playing for the first time at the Swiss Indoors. ``I
served well and was very aggressive. It's likely due to my last
three weeks of training, which were very intense.
	   ``I have a 100 percent record against Petr, and have also had
very tight matches aginst other top-10 players, including Rusedski,
Agassi and Kafelnikov.''
	   Korda, who was hoping a good performance in Basel might
springboard him into the top-eight standings for a berth in the ATP
Tour World Championship in Hannover next month, refused to comment
after the match.
	   In other first round play, fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 7-5, 6-3, while Britain's
Tim Henman, seeded sixth, recorded a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is arranging tri-lateral talks with Israel's premier and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be held during the second day
of her Mideast shuttle, officials from both sides said Tuesday.
	   Albright met with Arafat in the Palestinian-run city of Jericho
in the West Bank and was scheduled to hold her second meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
	   An Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that tri-lateral talks would likely take place early Wednesday at
the Erez border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. There
was concern that a planned trip by Arafat to Moscow for Wednesday
would hurt the chances for such a meeting but the talks would be
held early enough to accomodate his departure.
	   `The feeling is that since there seems to be a real impass where
the deadlock is not surmountable on the lower levels of
officialdom, that perhaps it can be overcome if the principles
discuss the matter themselves in the presence of the secretary of
state,'' the Israeli official said.
	   Earlier, a Palestinian official said that Albright did not bring
anything from Israel to her Tuesday talks with Arafat.
	   Palestinian officials later said that Albright would lead
three-way talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   Albright met with both leaders as part of her efforts to bring
the sides closer to completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal. If Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps
over a U.S. peace initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely
sign a deal in Washington later this month.
	   ``A tri-lateral meeting will depend on what Secretary Albright
brings to us from Netanyahu tomorrow. She did not bring anything
from Netanyahu today,'' said a senior Palestinian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Albright met earlier Tuesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem,
several hours after arriving to the region early Tuesday. They were
to hold a second meeting later in the evening.
	   The Palestinian official said Albright and Arafat discussed
``generalities.'' ``There were no specifics.''
	   Speaking after the Jericho meeting, Albright told reporters that
there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make,'' before
the Washington summit scheduled for October 15-18.
	   ``We reviewed in a comprehensive way all the issues of the
American initiative which (Arafat) has accepted in principle. Our
challenge now is to move forward and to try to reach an
agreement,'' she said.
	   Arafat said he hoped the secretary's visit would be one more
step towards the settling of all remaining issues between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   Time is running out between the sides to resolve a host of
disputes such as the status of Jerusalem, which both peoples claim
as their capital, Jewish settlements and permanent borders.
	   The current peace accords expire in May 1999, when the
Palestinians had hoped to declare independence. However, Netanyahu
opposes Palestinian statehood and the two sides have been haggling
for more than 18 months over a further Israeli troop redeployment
from West Bank areas, which it committed to in a previous accord.
	   Zvi Hendel, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition
government said Tuesday that Netanyahu had promsied to annex large
chuncks of West bank land should Arafat declare statehood. But
Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said he doubted Netanyahu would
make such a statement and that that was not Israel's policy. He
reiterated however warnings that Israel would counter such a
declaration with unspecified unilateral actions of its own.
	   Israeli officials said the only thing holding up a deal now is
Palestinian agreement to a set of detailed steps to take in
fighting Islamic militants.
	   Arafat's aide, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians had not been
shown Israel's maps for the proposed pullback. ``I think if there
is a sticking point, that is that Mr. Netanyahu refuses the concept
of reciprocity.''
	   The United States has proposed Israel withdraw from 13 percent
of the area, and after months of negotiating, both sides seem ready
to accept the deal with certain conditions. Israel wants security
guarantees from the Palestinians to strike at Islamic militants who
threaten peace.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared
war between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel argued his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurds who are carrying out cross-border attacks.
Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies the
accusation.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the teroristic activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,'' a
statement from Demirel's office said after the talks.
	   The statement did not say what Turkey was demanding, although
Premier Mesut Yilmaz said Monday that Syria should extradite
Kurdish rebel leaders. It added that the Egyptians were given a
dossier, apparently containing intelligence reports that allegedly
confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   After Ankara, Mubarak and his delegation headed back to Damascus
late Tuesday for what appeared to be a second round of talks with
Syrian leaders on the crisis.
	   ``We have talked to the Syrians. We have talked to the Turks. I
hope that we will be able to defuse the situation,'' Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters before leaving for
Damascus.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side
Tuesday, saying ``any aggression against Syria will be considered
as an aggression against Libya according to the Arab joint defense
pact.''
	   Turkey underlined Tuesday that the issue was not linked to
Turkish-Arab relations, the presidential statement said.
	   The United States and Russia, along with most countries of the
Middle East, urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution.
	   Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad on Sunday.
Turkey initially played down Mubarak's role as a go-between, but
said Tuesday it was grateful to Egypt's efforts.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the bolstering military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel.
	   But the recent rise in tension appears part of Ankara's push to
end fighting in a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency in which 37,000
people have died.
	   Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops to its border with
Syria. Newspapers have suggested that its forces could stage raids
on rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda
was toppled by Germany's Nicolas Kiefer on Tuesday, in the first
round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors tennis tournament.
	   Kiefer, ranked 32 in the world, cruised past the third-seed
Czech in 1 hour, 17 minutes to win 6-2, 6-4.
	   ``It's very satisfying to win against the world number five,''
said Kiefer, playing for the first time at the Swiss Indoors. ``I
served well and was very aggressive. It's likely due to my last
three weeks of training, which were very intense.
	   ``I have a 100 percent record against Petr, and have also had
very tight matches against other top-10 players, including
Rusedski, Agassi and Kafelnikov.''
	   Korda, who was hoping a good performance in Basel might
springboard him into the top-eight standings for a berth in the ATP
Tour World Championship in Hannover next month, refused to comment
after the match.
	   In other first round play, fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 7-5, 6-3, while Britain's
Tim Henman, seeded sixth, recorded a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win
over Australian Jason Stoltenberg.
	   Lucky-loser Jeff Tarango of the United States beat France's
Nicolas Escude 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the second round. Later in
the day, fourth seed Andre Agassi played 1998 Wimbledon junior
champion and U.S. Open junior finalist Roger Federer of
Switzerland.
	   Home favorite Marc Rosset, ranked 57, faced Germany's Tommy
Haas, 39th.

Military parade marks war with Israel, Mubarak criticizes Israelis

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Tuesday marked the 25th anniversary
of its last war against Israel with a military parade reviewed by
President Hosni Mubarak, who called the war a victory for peace.
	   The parade, conducted at an army camp near the Suez Canal town
of Ismailia, was the first on the anniversary since the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Muslim radicals during a
similar show of strength.
	   In Tuesday's ceremony, shown on national television, Mubarak was
driven past a forest of rocket launchers, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles and artillery pieces, and naval assault boats
looking incongruous on the desert sands.
	   The show included heavy US-made M1A1 tanks, better known as
Abrams, lighter Egyptian made Walid and Fahd armored vehicles and
anti-aircraft missile systems.
	   Before attending the parade Mubarak told Egyptian television
that Middle East 1973 War war was ``a lightning point in Egypt's
modern military history.''
	   ``It was a war that opened the road for peace,'' he said on the
program Good Morning Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
	   But Mubarak warned against what he called Israel's growing
arsenal, saying it constitutes ``a threat to the security of the
region.''
	   Mubarak has used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a
series of interviews, blaming the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalemate in peace talks with the
Palestinians.
	   ``From the day Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing
has been implemented. The peace process has stopped,'' Mubarak told
Israel's Channel 2 Monday night.
	   Mubarak watched Tuesday's parade through aviator-style
sunglasses, flanked by his defense minister and senior army
officers. The president, a former pilot, was air force commander in
the 1973 war.
	   Some 2,500 Israelis, 15,000 Egyptians, 7,700 Syrians and 125
Iraqis were killed in the war of 0ct. 6-24, 1973. Tens of thousands
were wounded.
	   Egypt considers the war a military victory because its soldiers
overran Israeli forces in crossing the Suez Canal, challenging the
myth of Israel's invincibility. Egyptians believe the rebuilding of
Arab pride from the war led to peace with Israel six years later.
	   In Syria, the occasion was marked by Syrian war planes flying in
formation low over the capital Damascus.
	   Suleiman Qaddah, an official in the ruling Baath party, told a
rally that Syria will go on with its efforts to liberate the Golan
Heights, which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
	   Syria got back Quneitra, the capital of the Golan, in a
disengagement agreement brokered in 1974 by then-U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger. Syria demands the return of the rest of the
Golan as a condition for peace with Israel.

Denmark to legalize prostitutes, tightens law on child
</HEADLINE>
prostitution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prostitution, already widely
tolerated in Denmark, would become legal under a proposal presented
Tuesday by the government.
	   In announcing the proposal, the government said it was not
supporting prostitution, but wanted to decriminalize what it
described as a social rather than criminal matter.
	   Prostitution is currently banned as a main source of income.
Pimping would remain illegal so under the proposed new measure,
presented by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen when Parliament
reconvened Tuesday after its summer recess..
	   The proposal _ to be considered by parliament sometime before
the legislature recesses next summer _ also aims to clamp down on
child prostitution, prohibiting the purchase of sexual services
from anyone under age 18.
	   A majority of lawmakers have said they would support such a
bill.
	   The move comes as Denmark's Scandinavian neighbor Sweden is
clamping down on prostitution. Beginning in 1999, the purchase of
all sexual services will be illegal in Sweden, although
prostitution itself will not be criminalized.

no-confidence vote &QL;

 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Opening Sweden's new Parliament on
Tuesday, Prime Minister Goeran Persson said the government should
make major strides heading in the next decade and opposition leader
Carl Bildt said it shouldn't last into next week.
	   Following Persson's speech to the Riksdag, whose members were
chosen in Sept. 20 elections, Bildt called for a declaration of
no-confidence in the government.
	   Persson remained prime minister after the elections, even though
his Social Democrats party got less than 37 percent of the vote,
its worst-ever showing in a national election.
	   The weak showing means the Social Democrats have remained the
governing party only by assembling an awkward cooperation with the
ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens.
	   ``After an election that involved a very significant decline for
the government party, the prime minister should step down and
prepare space for a government-building process under the
leadership of the parliament speaker,'' Bildt said in calling for
the vote of no-confidence, which could be held as early as
Thursday.
	   Bildt's conservative Moderates got just 22 percent of the vote
in the recent elections, but would be likley to get the support of
three other non-socialist parties in a no-confidence vote.
	   Together, the Social Democrats, Left and Greens have 190 of the
Riksdag's 349 seats and it is unlikely either of the two smaller
parties would support an effort to push the Social Democrats out of
power.
	   Nonetheless, Bildt's move keeps pressure on a government that
many Swedes fear will be ineffectual because of the unusual
alliance that keeps it afloat.
	   Persson, in his speech opening the parliament, declared that
``Sweden will step into the next decade with more jobs, greater
rights and widened cooperation.''
	   ``Sweden will contribute to forming Europe's future,'' he said.
``Membership in the European Union gives Sweden the possibility to
work for a continent characterized by democracy, solidarity and
openness.''
	   That statement underlined one of the potential weaknesses of the
government. Both the Left and the Greens are strongly opposed to
Sweden's membership in the EU and are expected to push for a
referendum on whether Sweden should permanently stay out of the
bloc's common-currency system.
	   Persson predicted Sweden will join the currency system within
this government's four-year term.
	   He also announced the creation of a new Growth Ministry to
coordinate the government's growth policies. It will most of the
functions of the ministries for communication and transport, labor,
industry and trade and the ministry for the interior, which will
all be shut down.
	   Lena Hjelm-Wallen, currently minister for foreign affairs, will
become the new deputy prime minister.
	   The new minister for foreign affairs will be Anna Lindh,
presently minister for the environment.

Head of Britain's spy agency called to testify about arms sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of Britain's spy agency has been summoned
to give evidence before members of Parliament about the sale of
arms to Sierra Leone in violation of a U.N. embargo.
	   Sir David Spedding, who heads the MI6 and is known as ``C,''
will be questioned behind closed doors by the House of Commons
foreign affairs select committee, said Labor lawmaker Donald
Anderson, who heads the committee.
	   The questioning will center on arms shipments by a British
company, Sandline International, to the forces of Sierra Leone
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who had been ousted in a May 1997
coup.
	   Sandline said it had government permission to assist Kabbah,
despite a U.N. arms embargo imposed on the West African nation. The
embargo applied to Kabbah's forces even though the United Nations
recognized his side as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone.
	   Kabbah was restored to power in March by a Nigerian-led African
force.
	   An official inquiry into the arms sale, conducted by Sir Thomas
Legg, found in July that Britain's violation of the embargo
resulted from staff blunders rather than a secret policy decision.
It noted that officials didn't know the embargo applied to Kabbah.
	   Anderson said that while his committee doesn't want to repeat
the work of the earlier investigation, ``this episode revealed a
number of apparent deficiencies in the Foreign Office's
administration, not all of which fell within the scope of the Legg
Report. It is therefore right that we should conduct this brief
inquiry and report to the House of Commons as appropriate.''
	   Anderson's committee has also summoned Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook and Peter Penfold, the British high commissioner to Sierra
Leone, to appear.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake was
arrived in the Eritrean capital Tuesday to make a second attempt at
finding a peaceful solution to the simmering five-month border
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   Lake, President Bill Clinton's former national security adviser,
was to meet with President Isaias Afwerki and other officials
before travelling to Addis Ababa Thursday.
	   Eritrean officials have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward
the visit after Isaias' government called the previous U. S.
attempt to find a peaceful settlement ``unwarranted interference.''
	   But Ethiopia on Tuesday welcomed the resumption of U.S.
mediation, saying it ``appreciates the active role the government
of the United States has played ...''
	   In a statement, government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said,
however, that ``Ethiopia remains committed to the ongoing OAU
initiative as the only one that could guarantee a peaceful solution
to the crisis,'' but that any other efforts to bolster the
initiative were welcome.
	   The proposal by the Organization of African Unity includes a
call to both sides to withdraw to positions held before May 5 _ a
direct reference to Eritrea, which denies it is occupying any
territory other than its own.
	   Since brief but deadly fighting in three areas in the first part
of June, both countries have dug in along the disputed border with
large numbers of troops and weapons.
	   A June 14 moratorium on air strikes brokered by Clinton still
holds, but both sides have spoken of the possibility of renewed
fighting.
	   Eritrea insists on bilateral demilitarization and the expert
demarcation of the entire border under international observation.
Asmara has also called for direct talks, something Ethiopia refuses
until Eritrea withdraws.
	   Both countries accuse each other of human rights violations and
of expelling large numbers of each other's citizens.
	   While diplomats and international agencies have been unable to
find any systematic mistreatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea, there is
evidence that Ethiopia has expelled at least 20,000 Eritreans and
taken over their businesses and properties.
	   Others were accused of being spies and were jailed.
	   On Sunday, 1,200 Eritrean deportees, including women, children
and the elderly, arrived at the Burie border post west of the port
of Assab.
	   The OAU trio designated to determine the root causes of the
conflict _ Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti _ is scheduled to
meet Oct. 15 in the Burkina capital, Ouagadougou.

Euros at the Rat and Parrot? Former Treasury chiefs disagree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with debate between Treasury chiefs, Thatcher backs
Hague
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ The Conservative Party has turned
its back on the European currency project, but what of the Rat and
Parrot pub in Scunthorpe?
	   Two former Treasury chiefs, ignoring party leader William
Hague's declaration that the argument was over, debated the single
currency Tuesday in one of the ``fringe'' meetings at the
Conservative Party conference.
	   Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, an opponent of
British entry into a single currency, clearly had the party behind
him. Some 84 percent of members voted to back Hague's policy of
opposing the single currency for the next decade.
	   ``The idea that this means we're going to be using Euros in the
Rat and Parrot in Scunthorpe is a rather far-fetched idea,'' Lamont
said, getting a laugh from a standing-room-only crowd.
	   ``I'm not sure that there is a Rat and Parrot in Scunthorpe,''
rejoined Kenneth Clarke, who succeeded Lamont in John Major's
Conservative government.
	   ``I'll have a bet with Norman that if both of us are still in a
fit state to consume it, I will buy him a drink in the Rat and the
Parrot in Scunthorpe in 10 years time, and my bet is that I'll be
paying for it in Euros.''
	   The parrot theme was strong as the Conservative conference
opened Tuesday. The Sun newspaper, the nation's largest-selling
tabloid, proclaimed the Tories a ``dead parrot,'' a la Monty
Python, and showed a feathered Hague hanging upside-down on its
front page.
	   The Tories are dead, The Sun said, because of the continuing
blood-letting over Britain's place in the European Union, and its
stance on the single currency being launched next year by 11 EU
members.
	   ``The real political danger in the single currency is that we do
not have a political culture in Europe, we do not have a common
political identity,'' Lamont said. ``That is why I say that
Britain, which has a totally different history, a totally different
tradition, cannot _ cannot _ be at the heart of Europe.''
	   Major declared that he wanted to put Britain ``at the heart of
Europe'' after he succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. The European
issue contributed to her downfall, and it bedeviled Major until the
Conservatives went down to a landslide defeat in 1997.
	   Lady Thatcher congratulated Hague on taking ``a bold chance.''
	   ``Keeping our national independence is a great cause and it is
one on which the British people can rally. Moreover it gives the
Conservative party an excellent chance of winning next time,'' she
said at an appearance with Hague.
	   Hague hoped to end the debate with the party vote backing his
policy.
	   ``With such a decisive majority, and so few votes against, it is
the settled will of the Conservative Party to fight the next
election in favor of keeping the pound,'' he said in his opening
speech.

U.N. rights chief criticizes Myanmar over repression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
Tuesday urged the government of Myanmar to end repression of
opponents and release political detainees.
	   Mary Robinson said she had been ``following with increasing
concern the intensification of repression against Myanmar's
political opposition over the last few weeks.''
	   In recent months, the government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, has
been in a sustained confrontation with the opposition.
	   It began mass arrests in May and intensified them in September
in an effort to block the opposition National League for Democracy
from carrying out a threat to convene parliament on its own.
Robinson lamented ``repeated harassment'' of NLD leader Aung San
Suu Kyi.
	   The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the
military never allowed parliament to meet.
	   ``Conditions of detention in the country fall far short of
international standards,'' Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for
human rights, said in a statement.
	   She noted a U.N. report in August which roundly condemned
Myanmar for widespread and systematic use of forced labor. ``There
also appears to be an official policy of forced displacement of
ethnic minorities,'' she said.
	   Robinson added that she ``received no satisfactory response''
from Myanmar's foreign minister, U Ohn Gyaw, when she raised these
issues with him at a meeting in New York last month.
	   She also urged the government to allow the U.N.'s human right
investigator, Rajsoomer Lallah, to visit the country. It has so far
refused to do so.
	   In April, the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemned Myanmar for
widespread rights abuses.

UN celebrates 50 years of peacekeeping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations commemorated 50 years
of peacekeeping Tuesday, honoring three fallen peacekeepers and
reflecting on their goal to ``confront and defeat the worst in man
with the best in man.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan awarded medals to the families of
three of the 1,582 people slain in the line of duty _ a new honor
that carries the name of one of the United Nations' most prominent
martyrs _ Dag Hammarskjold.
	   The family of the second U.N. secretary-general received the Dag
Hammarskjold medal, as did relatives of two other peacekeepers
killed during the first U.N. peacekeeping operation, the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization, which monitored an Israeli-Arab truce in
1948.
	   Rene de Labarriere of France and Count Folke Bernadotte of
Sweden were killed in July and September 1948, respectively.
Hammarskjold died Sept. 18, 1961, in what is now Zambia, when his
plane crashed during a trip to the region in connection with U.N.
operations in Congo.
	   Opening a special General Assembly meeting to remember the men
and mark the 50th anniversary of the ``Blue Helmets,'' Annan
praised the initial idea that propelled the first soldiers in 1948
to take to a battlefield ``under a new flag, with a new mission: a
mission of peace.''
	   ``It would be no exaggeration to say that that mission was
without precedent in human history,'' Annan said. ``It was an
attempt to confront and defeat the worst in man with the best in
man; to counter violence with tolerance, might with moderation, and
war with peace.''
	   Fifty years after 36 observers were sent to what was then
Palestine and other Arab lands, 14,000 peacekeepers are serving
today in 17 different missions, Annan said.
	   ``No figures, however, can do justice to the ultimate sacrifice
that more than 1,500 peacekeepers have made over this half
century,'' Annan said. ``Today we pay tribute, above all, to the
brave `blue helmets' who gave their lives in the cause of peace.''
	   To mark the occasion Tuesday night, New York's Empire State
Building was lighting its famous spire in the blue and white colors
of the United Nations.
	   In addition, Annan announced that the United Nations would build
a permanent memorial on the U.N. grounds to honor slain civilian
and military peacekeepers. The memorial will be paid for by the
proceeds from the Nobel Peace Prize that U.N. peacekeepers won in
1988.
	   In his speech, Annan listed what he called peacekeeping's
``unmistakable successes'' in Namibia, Mozambique and El Salvador.
But he also reflected on the failed missions, mentioning the two
that Annan himself supervised as head of U.N. peacekeeping
operations.
	   ``And in some places _ Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia _ we
have found ourselves standing by, in impotent horror, while the
most appalling crimes were committed,'' Annan said.
	   ``We yield to no one in our regret and our pain over these
calamities,'' he said. ``We will forever measure our proudest
achievements against the memory of those worst of days.''

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda
was toppled by Germany's Nicolas Kiefer on Tuesday, in the first
round of the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors tennis tournament.
	   Kiefer, ranked 32nd in the world, cruised past the third-seed
Czech in 1 hour, 17 minutes to win 6-2, 6-4.
	   ``It's very satisfying to win against the world number five,''
said Kiefer, playing for the first time at the Swiss Indoors. ``I
served well and was very aggressive. It's likely due to my last
three weeks of training, which were very intense.
	   ``I have a 100 percent record against Petr, and have also had
very tight matches against other top-10 players, including
Rusedski, Agassi and Kafelnikov,'' he said.
	   Korda, who was hoping a good performance in Basel might
springboard him into the top-eight standings for a berth in the ATP
Tour World Championship in Hannover, Germany, next month, refused
to comment after the match.
	   In other first round play, fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 7-5, 6-3, while Britain's
Tim Henman, seeded sixth, recorded a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win
over Australian Jason Stoltenberg.
	   Jeff Tarango of the United States beat France's Nicolas Escude
6-3, 6-3 to advance to the second round. Later in the day, fourth
seed Andre Agassi was scheduled to play 1998 Wimbledon junior
champion and U.S. Open junior finalist Roger Federer of
Switzerland.
	   Home favorite Marc Rosset, ranked 57th, faced Germany's Tommy
Haas, ranked 39th.

U.S. envoy meets defiant Milosevic as NATO strikes loom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout and UPDATES with more Yugoslav troops
pulled out, Yugoslav reaction. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The prospect of NATO air strikes
moved ominously closer Tuesday as a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he has not met U.N. demands for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Richard Holbrooke was to meet the Yugoslav president for the
second day Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian province,
where the Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence.
	   In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian political leaders,
Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Belgrade, reporters saw
about 100 Yugoslav military vehicles of all sorts _ ranging from
armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops _ moving
outside Kosovo. It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance
with international demands that his forces pull far back from
front-line areas.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule for the province in Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen told the Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told Associated Press Television News that a complete withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops is out of question.
	   ``Who in the right mind would do so? Is there a country in the
world that would do so, especially with an armed rebellion in their
hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke in talks Monday night that his
government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
crisis in Kosovo. But he also called the NATO threats against his
country ``a criminal act.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to
give Milosevic a last chance to halt his crackdown and enter
meaningful talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the
province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto in
the U.N. Security Council to stop approval of airstrikes on
Yugoslavia. The Council was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   A representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday urged
NATO to intervene. Adem Demaci, who resigned last month as KLA
spokesman but said he was again speaking for the rebels, said:
``The Serbian war machine and its military and political structure
must be destroyed.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes within
hours of receiving an order. No final decision is expected until
Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries gather for a
NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin continued to press for a
political solution to the crisis on Tuesday.
	   ``I have spent almost two days preparing and holding telephone
talks on Kosovo,'' he told Russian news agencies.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.

Military parade marks war with Israel, Mubarak criticizes Israelis

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt celebrated the 25th anniversary of its
last war against Israel with a military parade Tuesday, and
President Hosni Mubarak hailed the war as a victory for peace.
	   The parade, conducted at an army camp near the Suez Canal town
of Ismailia, was the first on the anniversary since the 1981
assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Muslim militants during a
similar show of military strength.
	   In Tuesday's ceremony, shown on national television, Mubarak was
driven past a forest of rocket launchers, thousands of tanks,
armored vehicles and artillery pieces, and naval assault boats
looking incongruous on the desert sands.
	   The show included heavy US-made M1A1 tanks, better known as
Abrams, lighter Egyptian made Walid and Fahd armored vehicles and
anti-aircraft missile systems.
	   Before attending the parade Mubarak told Egyptian television
that the 1973 Mideast War was ``a lightning point in Egypt's modern
military history.''
	   ``It was a war that opened the road for peace,'' he said on the
program Good Morning Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
	   But Mubarak warned against what he called Israel's growing
arsenal, saying it constitutes ``a threat to the security of the
region.''
	   Mubarak has used the war anniversary to criticize Israel in a
series of interviews, blaming the government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for the stalemate in peace talks with the
Palestinians.
	   ``From the day Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing
has been implemented. The peace process has stopped,'' Mubarak told
Israel's Channel 2 Monday night.
	   Mubarak watched Tuesday's parade through aviator-style
sunglasses, flanked by his defense minister and senior army
officers. The president, a former pilot, was air force commander in
the 1973 war.
	   Some 2,500 Israelis, 15,000 Egyptians, 7,700 Syrians and 125
Iraqis were killed in the war of 0ct. 6-24, 1973. Tens of thousands
were wounded.
	   Egypt considers the war a military victory because its soldiers
overran Israeli forces in crossing the Suez Canal, challenging the
myth of Israel's invincibility. Egyptians believe the rebuilding of
Arab pride from the war led to peace with Israel six years later.
	   In Syria, the occasion was marked by Syrian war planes flying in
formation low over the capital Damascus.
	   Suleiman Qaddah, an official in the ruling Baath party, told a
rally that Syria will go on with its efforts to liberate the Golan
Heights, which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
	   Syria got back Quneitra, the capital of the Golan, in a
disengagement agreement brokered in 1974 by then-U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger. Syria demands the return of the rest of the
Golan as a condition for peace with Israel.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A woman chained herself to a radiator in an
attempt to force a Moscow bank to return her deposit, a news agency
said Tuesday.
	   The woman entered a branch of the Russian Credit Bank on Tuesday
afternoon and demanded her money, Interfax said. When she was
refused, she handcuffed herself to a radiator and said she would
not leave until she got her money.
	   Many Russian banks either do not have money because of the
country's current economic crisis or have frozen customers'

U.N. rights chief criticizes Myanmar over repression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations' top human rights official
Tuesday urged the government of Myanmar to end repression of
opponents and release political detainees.
	   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said
she had been ``following with increasing concern the
intensification of repression against Myanmar's political
opposition over the last few weeks.''
	   In recent months, the government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, has
been in a sustained confrontation with the opposition.
	   It began mass arrests in May and intensified them in September
in an effort to block the opposition National League for Democracy
from carrying out a threat to convene parliament on its own.
Robinson lamented ``repeated harassment'' of NLD leader Aung San
Suu Kyi.
	   The NLD won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the
military never allowed parliament to meet.
	   ``Conditions of detention in the country fall far short of
international standards,'' Robinson said in a statement.
	   She noted a U.N. report in August which roundly condemned
Myanmar for widespread and systematic use of forced labor. ``There
also appears to be an official policy of forced displacement of
ethnic minorities,'' she said.
	   Robinson added that she ``received no satisfactory response''
from Myanmar's foreign minister, U Ohn Gyaw, when she raised these
issues with him at a meeting in New York last month.
	   She also urged the government to let U.N. human rights
investigator Rajsoomer Lallah visit the country. It has so far
refused to do so.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commission condemned Myanmar for
widespread rights abuses.

Seven civilians, seven Islamic militants killed in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria's security services said Tuesday
they were searching for a group of armed assailants who massacred
seven civilians in western Algeria.
	   The civilians were killed overnight Monday near Mascara, 400
kilometers (250 miles) west of Algiers, an area where violence has
escalated recently, the security services said in a statement.
	   No further details were immediately available.
	   In other violence, newspaper reports Tuesday said seven Islamic
militants were killed during army sweeps in Algiers and near
Tipaza, 100 kilometers (62.5 miles) west of the capital.
	   The newspaper Horizons said five members of the Islamic Front
for the Armed Jihad (FIDA) had been killed near Tipaza.
	   The group is believed to be comprised of members of the educated
elite, as opposed to most Algerian insurgents who are from poor
areas. The report said two of those killed were leaders of the
group. No identities were released.
	   Horizons also reported that two members of the Armed Islamic
Group, the most radical faction in Algeria's insurgency, were
killed in the western suburbs of Algiers Monday.
	   They are thought to have killed two policemen Saturday in the
capital.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the six-year insurgency
that flared up after the military-backed government canceled 1992
parliamentary elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the shadow of towering
apartment buildings, a living monument to victims of the worst
Dutch air disaster bears this inscription: ``The Tree That Saw
Everything.''
	   Six years later, investigators are struggling to uncover what no
one can see _ the cause of chronic illnesses that have plagued the
neighborhood and its rescuers since the crash of an Israeli cargo
jet.
	   New disclosures the plane was carrying a chemical that can be
used to produce the deadly nerve gas sarin have reignited demands
for the truth _ and renewed speculation over what the Israelis
intended to do with the material.
	   ``Once and for all, we must put an end to the disaster. The
suffering has lasted too long,'' Hannah Belliot, who heads the
neighborhood council, said Sunday in a memorial service near trees
that survived the inferno.
	   Forty-three people were killed on Oct. 4, 1992, when the
Israel-bound Boeing 747 cargo jet lost its two right engines and
smashed into a 12-story apartment block shortly after takeoff from
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   While the cause of the crash was determined to be a design flaw,
its cargo has been a nagging mystery to the scores of residents and
rescue workers suffering from chronic health problems.
	   Last week, the Israeli government confirmed what many had
suspected after years of official denials: The plane was carrying
dangerous cargo.
	   Up to 190 liters (50 gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate, an
ingredient used in sarin, many pesticides and in anti-retardants
were destined for the Israel Institute for Biological Research in
suburban Tel Aviv, the Israelis disclosed.
	   Recent reports have said Israel was making chemical and
biological weapons at the institute; the Israeli government has not
commented on those claims. The Dutch government, meanwhile, has
promised a fresh parliamentary probe.
	   Those suffering from health problems say knowing exactly what
was in the belly of the jet is their only hope for recovery.
	   ``I can't get it out of my mind,'' said ambulance driver Henk
Post, 48, a paramedic dispatched to the crash site in the
low-income, heavily immigrant Bijlmer neighborhood.
	   Post arrived within minutes of the early evening crash and
worked until the next morning _ all while wearing no special
protective gear. Three years later, he began suffering health
problems, including chronic fatigue and muscle aches. He also weeps
easily and suffers bouts of depression.
	   ``He's so emotional,'' said Post's 22-year-old daughter, Bianca.
``He's different. He's not my father anymore.''
	   Post said doctors are at a loss over how to treat him.
	   He's not alone. Doctors in Bijlmer say some 300 people have
suffered health problems since the crash, including nervousness,
stress, chronic fatigue, pain and drowsiness.
	   ``My whole body is a mess. There are all kinds of weird things
going on,'' said Ed Steur, 48, an auto mechanic who helped evacuate
the area and now suffers from bronchial problems and muscle pains
``so bad that I can't do anything anymore.''
	   Steur is angry at the Israeli and Dutch governments for keeping
the plane's cargo a secret. Over the years, officials have said the
plane carried a small amount of military equipment; one newspaper
report said it was carrying Sidewinder missiles.
	   Earlier this year, Israel's ambassador to the Netherlands, Yossi
Gal, told reporters the plane carried ``no dangerous goods ...
nothing secret.''
	   Dutch officials bristle at allegations of a coverup.
	   ``I don't believe ... that something was wittingly and knowingly
withheld,'' Transport Minister Tineke Netelenbos told the daily De
Telegraaf. ``What is important is that we establish quickly which
materials were burned, at what temperature, and what consequences
they have on public health.''
	   Still, experts say long-term exposure to a much higher dose of
the chemical than was aboard the plane would be neccessary to
produce illnesses.
	   ``People think since it can be used for sarin, it must have the
same toxicity as sarin. That's nonsense,'' said Hendrik Benshcop,
head of chemical toxicology at the Netherlands Organization for
Applied Science Research.
	   If so, the mystery just deepens for Everdina Douwes, who was
diagnosed with lung cancer three years after the crash.
	   ``I don't expect any (compensation) money from the government,''
she said. ``It's the truth that needs to come out.''

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ A trilateral meeting between Benjamin
Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat and Madeleine Albright aimed at goading
the recently revived peace talks forward will take place on the
second day of the U.S. secretary of state's Mideast shuttle,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Palestinian and Israeli officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that trilateral talks would likely take place early
Wednesday at the Erez border crossing between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
	   President Bill Clinton signalled a breakthrough last week after
meeting with the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, when Netanyahu
agreed to a U.S. proposal to withdraw from a further 13 percent of
the West Bank.
	   This week's trilateral talks would be aimed at overcoming
deadlock on lower-level bureaucratic levels, but would also address
more substantive issues: The Palestinians complain that they have
yet to see the Israeli maps detailing the withdrawal; The Israelis
want to know details of Palestinian pledges to contain Islamic
militant groups.
	   Wednesday's meeting would take place early enough for Arafat to
be able to make a planned trip to Moscow.
	   Albright met with both leaders as part of her efforts to bring
the sides closer to completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal. If Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps
over a U.S. peace initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely
sign a deal in Washington later this month.
	   Albright met earlier Tuesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem,
several hours after arriving to the region early Tuesday. They were
to hold a second meeting later in the evening.
	   A Palestinian official, speaking anonymously, said Albright and
Arafat discussed ``generalities.'' ``There were no specifics.''
	   Speaking after the Jericho meeting, Albright told reporters that
there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make,'' before
the Washington summit scheduled for October 15-18.
	   ``We reviewed in a comprehensive way all the issues of the
American initiative which (Arafat) has accepted in principle. Our
challenge now is to move forward and to try to reach an
agreement,'' she said.
	   Arafat said he hoped the secretary's visit would be one more
step towards the settling of all remaining issues between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   Time is running out between the sides to resolve a host of
disputes such as the status of Jerusalem, which both peoples claim
as their capital, Jewish settlements and permanent borders.
	   The current peace accords expire in May 1999, when the
Palestinians had hoped to declare independence. Netanyahu opposes
Palestinian statehood and the two sides have been haggling for more
than 18 months over a further Israeli troop redeployment from West
Bank areas, outlined in a previous accord.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared
war between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border
attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies
harboring the rebels.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,''
Demirel said in a statement after the talks.
	   Independent television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six
Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, recognize Turkey's
existing borders and promise to establish good, neighborly
relations.
	   The statement from Demirel's office said the Egyptians were
given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence reports
that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Premier Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak flew from the Turkish capital to the Syrian one late
Tuesday and went directly into talks with Syrian President Hafez
Assad. Neither leader talked with reporters before the meeting,
their second in three days on the crisis.
	   Turkey initially had played down Mubarak's role as potential
peacemaker but said Tuesday it was grateful to Egypt's efforts.
	   Egyptians expressed a measure of optimism about their diplomacy.
	   ``We have talked to the Syrians. We have talked to the Turks. I
hope that we will be able to defuse the situation,'' Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters in Ankara before leaving
for Damascus.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side
Tuesday, saying ``any aggression against Syria will be considered
as an aggression against Libya according to the Arab joint defense
pact.''
	   Turkey stressed Tuesday that the issue was not linked to
Turkish-Arab relations, the presidential statement said.
	   The United States and Russia, along with most countries of the
Middle East, urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the military and diplomatic ties
between Turkey and Israel.
	   But the recent rise in tension appears part of Ankara's push to
end fighting in a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency in which 37,000
people have died. The rebels are fighting for Kurdish autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
	   Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops to its border with
Syria. Newspapers have suggested that its forces could stage raids
on rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.

Primakov appeals for calm after officials announce more bad news

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged Russians on
Tuesday to remain calm during the country's economic crisis,
assuring them there would no shortage of basic foods and that wages
and pensions would be paid.
	   ``The populace will be fully provided with vegetables, fruit and
potatoes,'' Primakov said in an appeal broadcast on Russian
television the night before nationwide protests scheduled for
Wednesday.
	   ``I appeal to everyone not to rock our common boat in today's
too-turbulent sea,'' he said.
	   Primakov's statement came hours after a top official delivered a
litany of depressing economic predictions, telling Russians already
discouraged by high prices and shortages that they could face
higher inflation and a sharp drop in imports this year.
	   Deputy Economy Minister Nikolai Shamrayev forecast that
inflation would total 200 to 230 percent in 1998, but that outside
aid could limit the rate to 100 percent. Inflation spiked to 38.4
percent in September, the State Statistics Committee said Tuesday.
It was just 0.2 percent in July.
	   Shamrayev's warning came while Russia's finance minister and
Central Bank chief were in Washington seeking more cash from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Imports, which have dominated Russian shelves in recent years,
will fall 20 to 23 percent by the end of the year, and exports will
fall 13 percent, Shamrayev said. Industrial production will fall up
to 6 percent.
	   Shamrayev warned that Russia's gross domestic product will
shrink by more than 5 percent this year, after initial projections
of long-awaited growth. Most analysts have said it could fall by as
much as 8 percent.
	   ``The reaction of the world financial community is vital to
correct the country's course,'' Shamrayev told a conference of gas
company executives and analysts in Moscow.
	   Primakov said the government would begin paying overdue wages
and pensions and tackling the economic crisis, which has seen
Russia's financial markets implode and its currency lose 60 percent
of its value since August. But he provided few specifics of the
government's plan.
	   He also said that the shape of the plan would depend on whether
Russia can get more aid from western lenders.
	   ``The financial aspect of the program ... largely depends on the
negotiations that we are conducting both in the country and
abroad,'' he said.
	   The government's main tasks in resolving the crisis would be
``reviving'' the banking system, untangling the web of debts among
various companies and government agencies, and changing the tax
system to stimulate production, Primakov said.
	   But mostly, he sought to assuage Russians.
	   ``The way out of the crisis for Russia is through calm and
reconciliation, stability and discipline, abidance by the
constitution and laws. ... So let us all together solve the tasks
that are vitally important for our fatherland,'' he said.
	   Also Tuesday, Russia's new tax chief Georgy Boos announced that
the tax service had collected only 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 620
million) in September, 2 billion rubles (dlrs 133 million) less
than in the previous month, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The government regularly lacks money to pay millions of state
workers on time, but with the economy shriveling and most bank
accounts frozen, tax collection has become even more difficult in
recent weeks.
	   But Primakov said he ordered the tax committee Tuesday to return
to owners the more than dlrs 1 billion worth of goods and equipment
that has been seized for tax arrears. The prime minister said that
would allow factories to resume production, keep workers employed
and create more tax revenues.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris commuters faced a morning without bus service
Wednesday as drivers of city buses and one commuter train line,
angered by recent violence against them, were staying off the job.
	   On Tuesday evening, some unions, including the General
Confederation of Labor, said the bus strike would continue through
Wednesday morning at least.
	   Unions were demanding more protection in a city where about 9
million people depend on public transit daily.
	   The Interior Ministry, in response, announced that about 200
extra national police would patrol subway, bus and commuter train
lines.
	   Some 2 million bus commuters were left stranded Tuesday by the
latest walkout to hit French public transportation. The metro has
not been affected.
	   Drivers on 12 bus lines in northern Paris joined the walkout
Tuesday after a driver was beaten and stabbed in the abdomen a day
earlier by a rider who wanted to be dropped off between two stops.
The driver was hospitalized.
	   Meanwhile, more than 200,000 riders on the RER D line, which
links the capital with southern suburbs, have been stranded since
Monday afternoon by train drivers protesting an attack on an
employee last week.
	   A gang of youths attacked the employee, spraying him with a
paint can and striking him with it after he tried to stop them from
vandalizing the station at Le Ferte-Alais in the Essonne suburb
south of Paris.
	   The Paris transit authority, RATP, plans to add police
protection and also has promised to hire 350 youths as transit
attendants, more than tripling the number already in the Paris
area, as part of the leftist government's youth jobs program.
	   Coming from disadvantaged areas, the youths are trained to
dissuade their aggressive peers from resorting to violence.
	   Indicating that crime is a growing problem in Paris, a newspaper
on Tuesday reported rising gang activity in the capital with about
30 known groups _ mainly composed of rival youths from immigrant
families _ competing for turf.
	   In the most striking incident to date, a gang of youths opened
fire Friday on a Gypsy wedding in the 14th district of southwestern
Paris, injuring four people, one seriously.
	   The newspaper Le Parisien said the attackers were from a gang of
African and Arab youths.
	   Police have stepped up patrols in the area's low-cost housing
near the Notre Dame du Rosaire Church, the paper reported.
	   Youth violence has been linked to economic hard times in France,
where the jobless rate rises to 50 percent or more in poor
immigrant neighborhoods.

Mahathir says no successor for now

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
announced Wednesday he will not now appoint a successor and a
deputy to replace ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
faces trial next month.
	   Mahathir, 72, said the deputy post of the ruling will not be
filled until next year's elections of the ruling United Malays
National Organization Party.
	   ``We decided not to fill the vacancy until the next election,''
Mahathir said after chairing a 4-1/2-hour-long meeting of party
leaders.
	   Last week, Mahathir, who is president of the party, said he knew
he could die at any time, fueling speculation that would announce a
deputy.
	   Mahathir also said that the party had fired 10 members for
antiparty activities.
	   Since Anwar was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and launched a
nationwide campaign against Mahathir, the party has investigated
many of its members believed to be allied to Anwar. Several members
of UMNO were arrested under the Internal Security Act, a provision
which allows indefinite detention without trial.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 under the same law. Last week he
was arraigned on 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual
acts and a trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 2. Anwar denies the
charges and has pleaded innocent.
	   Mahathir, who had a heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fired his protege on grounds he
was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   Meanwhile, police asked the ruling coalition to cancel a giant
rally Saturday in the capital to attract the youth who had backed
Anwar's anticorruption campaign. An opposition group had promsied
to stage an even bigger rally later.
	   Mahathir said his party will abide by the police order, and that
it would respect a court ruling not to make speeches referring to
the charges against Anwar while the trial was on.
	   ``We must obey the laws of the country,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrators who had flocked by
the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent
weeks, calling them part of a plot to topple the government.
Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowds with tear gas
and water cannons, arresting more than 100 people.
	   ``They decided that the government should be brought down
through demonstrations, riots,'' the Bernama news agency quoted
Mahathir as saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He returned
to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting.
	   After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face,
neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie canceled a scheduled visit to
Malaysia, but he could still attend next month's meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. which he is hosting.
	   The United States would downgrade U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Kuala Lumpur for next month's APEC summit if Anwar
continued to be mistreated, according to a senior official quoted
Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Clinton would not make a separate
state visit, as is customary, and that officials wouldn't meet
their Malaysian counterparts.
	   Mahathir reacted angrily to the U.S. decision.
	   ``We are not beholden to them. We run our country in our own
way,'' he said.
	   ``If we mind our own mind business, it will be better for
everybody.''

<TEXT>
	   KALAMATA, Greece (AP) _ For many years, Greek olive oil makers
had just one main thing to say about their product: ciao.
	   About a third of Greece's annual olive oil production is
exported in bulk to Italy, where it is mixed with local and other
imported varieties and marketed under Italian brand names. There is
no way of knowing which brands mix oils and which do not.
	   Since the price of bottled oil on store shelves is significantly
higher than bulk sales, Greek producers lose out on large amounts
of potential profits when their oil is sold under Italian labels.
	   Now, Greek producers are looking for a little more respect _ and
possible revenue.
	   Near the southern city of Kalamata, one of Greece's most
renowned olive-producing regions, Yiannis Kozobolis proudly
displays a square glass bottle of extra virgin olive oil bearing
the logo of his agriculture cooperative, Avia, featuring the
region's castle.
	   Avia, comprising 295 olive producers, began efforts to package
and market its oil for export two years ago.
	   It has managed now to find a niche _ albeit tiny _ in the
international market, exporting to Britain, France and Germany.
About 19 tons of Avia's 340-ton production last season was sold to
these countries in brand form, Kozobolis said.
	   Another 80 tons were sold in bulk to Italy, while the rest was
sold personally by the cooperative members to friends and other
businesses, he added.
	   The effort by Avia and a few other small Greek olive oil
exporters could represent the first steps in raising the product's
profile _ and profits _ in a country where olives have been revered
since antiquity. The much coveted prize for winners of the ancient
Olympic games was a wreath of wild olives.
	   It's an uphill struggle in international markets dominated by
giants such as Italy's Bertolli, Berio and Colavita. The larger
companies have marketing expertise, established distribution
networks and _ above all _ a fierce competitiveness that leaves
little room for upstarts like new Greek brands.
	   Dimitris Drakos, prefect of the Messinia region which includes
Kalamata, urged the Greeks to try to emulate the Italians.
	   ``We must take care to copy them and to exceed them, and not to
accuse them,'' he said.
	   A marketing strategy to increase Greece's share of the retail
olive oil market abroad is gaining momentum through advertising and
subsidies for participation in international food fairs.
	   Yet trying to carve out a market share against powerful Italy is
no simple recipe. Italian brands have generations of loyal
customers, and Italy _ through the phenomenal popularity of its
cuisine _ carries a reputation as the cradle of Mediterranean olive
oil production.
	   ``The Italians have been in the American or Australian markets
for roughly 100 years,'' said George Economou, general manager of
the Greek Association of Industries and Processors of Olive Oil, or
SEVITEL. ``Italian cuisine is much more well-known, and as a
result, Italian products accompany these dishes rather than Greek
ones.''
	   Greece also has lacked the aggressive and imaginative
salesmanship of the Italians.
	   ``There is an impression that Italy is the only olive oil
country,'' said Dimitris Paraskevopoulos, sales and marketing
director of Gaea Products, which exports brand olive oil and Greek
food products.
	   Greece each year produces roughly 350,000 tons of olive oil _
with about 70 percent to 75 percent of this being the very pure
variety known as extra virgin.
	   Annual exports amount to between 100,000 and 120,000 tons, with
the majority sold in bulk to Italy, Economou says.
	   According to the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade, 42 percent
of all imported olive oil in 1996 was bought from Greece, as was
52.2 percent of all imported extra virgin oil.
	   Italy, which also imports olive oil from Spain and North Africa,
produced 390,000 tons of olive oil in 1996, while its 1997
production was estimated at 570,000 tons.
	   If the extra olive oil from Greece weren't exported to Italy, it
would be unused.
	   ``The solution of exporting this amount to Italy is a necessary
evil,'' said SEVITEL's Economou.
	   Although the price for olive oil has fallen recently, popular
attention to the Mediterranean diet could give Greek producers a
boost. Many nutritionists believe a diet rich in vegetables, fish
and olive oil helps combat heart disease.
	   ``Foreign markets are becoming aware of Greek products, mainly
through better knowledge of the benefits of the Mediterranean
diet,'' said Paraskevopoulos.
	   Economou believes the reason for the excellent quality of most
of the country's olive oil lies in its climate and terrain, as well
as in the continued widespread use of small, family-run olive
presses.
	   ``There are around 2,500 olive presses scattered around the
country,'' he said. Many are family businesses making relatively
small quantities which are sold immediately and spend little time
in storage.
	   ``Immediate processing contributes to the quality,'' Economou
explained.
	   But the drop in olive oil prices _ the result of increase in
European production coupled with a fall in consumption _ has forced
many Greek farmers to expand their activities.
	   ``We just can't survive on olive farming any more,'' complained
Christos Koutsis, a farmer in the Kallianeika village near
Kalamata.
	   Koutsis now also herds goats to make ends meet.

Pressured by a rival, UEFA announces changes to European soccer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Battling to keep its control over
European soccer competitions against a proposed rival Super League
that boasts it would generate much more money, UEFA unveiled plans
Tuesday to make its flagship competition more attractive to more
people.
	   The European Champions' League will next season be extended to
include 32 clubs playing in eight groups of four teams in the first
stage, European soccer's governing body announced after a meeting
here. The competition currently comprises 24 teams.
	   The new format will include more teams from Europe's top-ranking
soccer nations while also incorporating more teams from smaller
nations, broadening the potential television audience for games.
	   Teams from 48 European nations will be eligible to take part.
The number of clubs will depend on each country's UEFA ranking,
though there will be a limit of four from any single UEFA member
country.
	   ``In this new proposal, nobody will lose anything,'' UEFA
President Lennart Johansson told a news conference.
	   ``We are in a position to give more to the top associations and
to open the door wider to the smaller associations,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup will be merged into
one competition, called the UEFA Cup, though details still have to
be worked out, Johansson said.
	   The shake-up was part of UEFA's effort to dissuade Europe's top
clubs from defecting to the breakaway Super League proposed by a
private sports management company which is enticing the continent's
top clubs with jackpot payouts.
	   Media Partners, based in Milan, Italy, is touting a payout of
some dlrs 1.2 billion for participation in its Super League _ far
more than the dlrs 322 million generated by the Champions League in
1997-98, of which only dlrs 157 million went to the clubs.
	   Some clubs had criticized Media Partners' concept, saying it
would make the rich clubs richer and the poor clubs poorer.
	   Media Partners ``wanted to take over the best part of our club
competitions. UEFA had to react,'' Johansson said.
	   ``Now the speculations about the future of European soccer must
come to an end.''
	   Johansson declined to say how much cash would be paid to the
clubs under the new format, saying the potential sums would have to
be calculated after negotiations with commercial interests,
especially television.
	   However, UEFA General Secretary Gerhard Aigner said total prize
money would be at least dlrs 440-590 million, with the winners
pocketing dlrs 44-59 million.
	   Johansson said he was not concerned by the formal complaint
lodged against UEFA last week by Media Partners at the European
Commission, the European Union's executive arm.
	   The complaint alleges UEFA has abused its dominant position in
organizing European soccer.
	   UEFA, which has run European soccer for decades and is keen to
ensure the loyalty of European clubs, has threatened to suspend
clubs and players who opt into the proposed Super League.
	   ``We must be allowed to organize our own competitions ... We
haven't thrown anyone out,'' Johansson said.

Settlement issue threatens to hamper Albright visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Report: Netanyahu plans to expand Ariel settlement &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
he would go ahead with construction in a Jewish enclave in the West
Bank town of Hebron but that the work would not begin until an
archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
	   With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please both
Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a halt to
settlement expansion.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said that Netanyahu will also announce
expansion plans for an additional 3,000 homes in the West Bank
settlement of Ariel on Wednesday. Ariel is one the largest
settlements with some 14,000 Israelis living there.

U.S. lawyer sues Austrian bank in behalf of Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A U.S. lawyer acting in behalf of
Holocaust survivors has filed a class-action lawsuit against an
Austrian bank in addition to two major German banks, the Austria
Press Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The lawyer, Edward Fagan, accuses Creditanstalt of Vienna of
having conspired with Nazi authorities during World War II and
having profitted from the sale of gold robbed from Jewish victims
of the Holocaust, APA reported from New York.
	   But Gerhard Reidlinger, the Creditanstalt spokesman, said talks
would continue on compensation between Fagan and the bank's New
York lawyers, APA reported.
	   On Monday, Fagan told APA that the lawsuit would provide the
basis to move forward toward an agreement with the banks involved.
	   Creditanstalt lawyer Charles Moerdler underlined the Austrian
bank's resolve to live up to its moral responsibility.
	   Fagan said earlier that two other Austrian banks could soon be
faced with similar claims from Holocaust victims. He refused to
name them.
	   Austrian insurance companies will also be targets of class
action suits from Holocaust victims, despite their arguments that
they could not be taken to court in the United States, Fagan said.
	   Creditanstalt was taken over by Germany's Deutsche Bank during
the Nazi era.
	   Fagan has been seeking compensation for gold stolen by the Nazis
from Jewish families and allegedly transferred by Creditanstalt to
Turkey during World War II.
	   The Austrian news magazine Profil claimed last month that
Creditanstalt maintained ``business contacts'' with at least 13
concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen
and Dachau.
	   Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, one year before the
war began in Europe.

Sweden's coach announces additions to European qualification squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's national soccer coach Tommy
Soderberg added three players Tuesday for the European Cup
qualifier away against Bulgaria Oct. 14.
	   The three additions to the squad were Magnus Svensson of
Norway's Viking FK, Bari's Yksel Osmanovksi and Martin Aslund of
Norrkoping, which is placed 8th in the 14-team Swedish top league.
	   The 22-year-old midfielder Aslund was the main surprise in
Soderberg's selection. Soderberg noted that Aslund has had a great
season with Norrkoping and can play forward too.
	   The three will replace experienced players missing due to
injuries such as Bologna's striker Kennet Andersson and forward
Jorgen Pettersson of Borussia Moenchengladbach. Newcastle's Andreas
Andersson is an uncertain starter since he is still recovering from
glandular fever.
	   The rest of the squad, named last Friday, includes stalwarts
such as Anderlecht's playmaker Par Zetterberg, Henrik Larsson of
Celtic and Stefan Schwarz of Valencia.
	   Soderberg also included English Premier League newcomers Jesper
Blomqvist of Manchester United and Fredrik Ljungberg who scored in
his debut for Arsenal.
	   Sweden's 2-1 victory against England on Sept. 5 in the first
European qualifier has boosted interest in Swedish players, the
coach said.
	   Sweden has played nine times against Bulgaria and notched up
five victories (including the 1994 World Cup victory that gave
Sweden the bronze medal in the United States), two defeats and two
ties.
	   Earlier this year Sweden didn't allow a goal in pre-World Cup
friendlies against eventual world champion France and also beat
quarterfinalists Italy and Denmark.
	   The squad:
	   Goalies: Magnus Hedman (Coventry), Magnus Kihlstedt
(Lillestrom).
	   Defenders: Patrik Andersson (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Joachim
Bjorklund (Valencia), Pontus Kamark (Leicester), Teddy Lucic (IFK
Goteborg), Johan Mjallby (AIK), Roland Nilsson (Coventry);
	   Midfielders/forwards: Daniel Andersson (Bari), Jesper Blomqvist
(Manchester United), Magnus Erlingmark (IFK Goteborg), Henrik
Larsson (Celtic), Fredrik Ljungberg (Arsenal), Hakan Mild (IFK
Goteborg), Stefan Schwarz (Valencia), Par Zetterberg (Anderlecht),
Magnus Svensson (Viking), Yksel Osmanovski (Bari), Martin Aslund
(IFK Norrkoping).

Mourners fire in the air to force stores to close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with vehicles burned, gunfire in several neighborhoods
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Scores of vehicles were set on fire as
bands of young men roamed the streets of this southern port city on
Tuesday terrorizing residents and ordering store owners to shutter
their shops to mourn the death of two political leaders killed a
day earlier, eyewitnesses said.
	   The gunfire continued throughout the day and into the late night
as activists of the Muttiheda Qami Movement (MQM) prepared for a
second day of strikes on Wednesday.
	   The heavily armed activists are protesting the shooting deaths
on Monday of Aamir Zaki, 30, and Abdul Qadir.
	   Most of the disturbances occurred in the eastern and central
neighborhoods of this troubled port city, police said.
	   The MQM has ordered stores to close again on Wednesday and urged
bus drivers and taxis to remain off the roads.
	   Both MQM men died Monday when gunmen opened fire on their car in
Karachi, a teeming city of 14 million people wracked by relentless
violence between rival members of the MQM, who are battling for
control of neighborhoods.
	   The MQM, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, represents
Indian Muslims who came to Pakistan in 1947 when the British left
the Asian subcontinent.
	   Plumes of black smoke rose from some of the worst hit areas of
Liaqatabad and Nazimabad neighborhoods of Karachi, where the
largest MQM faction led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein dominates.
Both Zaki and Qadir belonged to this faction.
	   Several years ago the MQM split apart and the two factions
routinely clash. But fighting intensified this year and so far
police estimate as many as 600 people have been killed in Karachi
in ethnically motivated violence.
	   Daily the police is reporting more deaths. Often the bodies are
found mutilated, bound and abandoned in garbage bins.
	   The Hussein faction which also dominates the southern Sindh
provincial government is a member of the ruling coalition but has
withdrawn from the Cabinet to protest the bloodletting.
	   It has demanded its rivals the Haqiqi faction be reined in and
the paramilitary Rangers, which are part of the army and under the
control of the federal government, withdrawn from Karachi.
	   Currently there are hundreds of Rangers assisting the Karachi
police.

American Maitozo, German Zulow win individual vaulting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Germany winning team title; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ America's Devon Maitozo and Germany's Nadia Zulow
won gold medals in the individual vaulting at the World Equestrian
Games Tuesday while the team gold went to Germany.
	   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Maitozo, 23, of Cupertino,
California. ``I bet with myself after winning the bronze (at the
1996 worlds) that 1998 would be my year to win, and I did.''
	   Maitozo, on Whiskey 191, totaled 8.890 points following a series
of tests that ended Tuesday with the free style at the Santa
Barbara arena, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Rome.
	   Mathias Lang of France, on Quitus du Madon, captured the men's
silver with 8.643 points. Germany's Henrik Ossenbrink scored 8.641
points to claim the bronze on Panjano.
	   Zulow took the gold on the women's side, scoring 8.725 points on
Rainbow.
	   American Kerith Lemon clinched the silver on Pasio I with 8.469
points. The 22-year-old from Soquel, California, already has two
silver medals from the 1994 worlds in The Hague and the 1996
edition in Kaposvar, Hungary.
	   Germany's Janine Oswald clinched the bronze with 8.378 points,
repeating her result at the 1996 championships.
	   In team vaulting, Germany succeeded in defending its title, with
its nine-member team scoring a total of 7.759 points. Switzerland
earned the silver with 7.751 points.
	   The two nations traditionally are rivals and have each won three
golds in team vaulting at previous worlds.
	   The United States scored 7.537 points to clinch the bronze
medal.
	   Vaulting originated as part of military training and is a sort
of gymnastics on horseback. Vaulters carry out a series of
exercises on horseback with the help of a special handle instead of
a saddle. It is not an Olympic sport.
	   The championships run through Sunday at three venues in Rome.
The show jumping starts Wednesday.

10 people killed in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Indian border guards shot and killed five
suspected Muslim militants trying to sneak into India from the
Pakistani side of the disputed Kashmir border on Tuesday, an
official said.
	   At least five rebels turned back in the face of Indian firing in
Rajouri sector, 200 kilometers (125 miles) northwest of Jammu, the
winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said S. Kumar, the Border
Security Force spokesman.
	   Kumar claimed that the Pakistani security forces fired gunshots
to divert the attention of Indian guards and facilitate the entry
of the guerrillas to the Indian side.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the Kashmiri
separatists, a charge Islamabad denies.
	   There was no immediate comment by Pakistan. Islamabad says it
only provides moral and diplomatic support to the separatists
fighting the Indian security forces since 1989.
	   The BSF recovered five loaded AK-47 rifles, two rocket launchers
and two bags of explosives from those killed, Kumar said.
	   Another five people were killed when their car blew up after
hitting a land mine in Tral, a village 35 kilometers (20 miles)
southeast of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
police said.
	   Those killed were three members of a family, the car driver and
an armed guard, police said.
	   The Muslim rebels have been fighting for an independent Kashmir
or a choice to join neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state.
Jammu-kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in a predominantly
Hindu India.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
control of Kashmir, since they won independence from British
colonialists in 1947.

Report: Slimmed down Lewinsky offered spot on the catwalk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky must slim down if she
wants a fat paycheck: about dlrs 125,000 for a night's work as a
fashion model.
	   The offer from the Greek fashion house Lucifer also includes a
luxury hotel suite and round-the-clock bodyguards, according to
Greek media Tuesday citing sources at a small local magazine, Yes.
	   The catch is that the former White House intern must shed five
kilograms (11 pounds) before the Nov. 14 fashion show in Athens in
which Ms. Lewinsky would model two dresses, the reports said.
	   There was no word from Ms. Lewinsky on the offer.
Representatives at the fashion house and the magazine could not
immediately be reached for details or confirmation.

Norway's Viking FK, Bari's Yksel Osmanovksi and Martin Aslund of
Norrkoping, which is placed eighth in the 14-team Swedish top
league.
	   The 22-year-old midfielder Aslund was the main surprise in
Soderberg's selection. Soderberg noted that Aslund has had a great
season with Norrkoping and can play forward too.
	   The three will replace experienced players missing due to
injuries such as Bologna's striker Kennet Andersson and forward
Jorgen Pettersson of Borussia Moenchengladbach. Newcastle's Andreas
Andersson is an uncertain starter since he is still recovering from
glandular fever.
	   The rest of the squad, named last Friday, includes stalwarts
such as Anderlecht's playmaker Par Zetterberg, Henrik Larsson of
Celtic and Stefan Schwarz of Valencia.
	   Soderberg also included English Premier League newcomers Jesper
Blomqvist of Manchester United and Fredrik Ljungberg who scored in
his debut for Arsenal.
	   Sweden's 2-1 victory against England on Sept. 5 in the first
European qualifier has boosted interest in Swedish players, the
coach said.
	   Sweden has played nine times against Bulgaria and notched up
five victories (including the 1994 World Cup victory that gave
Sweden the bronze medal in the United States), two defeats and two
ties.
	   Earlier this year Sweden didn't allow a goal in pre-World Cup
friendlies against eventual world champion France and also beat
quarterfinalists Italy and Denmark.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ British author Salman Rushdie, who
still has 2.5 million bounty on his head for allegedly insulting
Islam, showed up at the Frankfurt international Book Fair late
Tuesday.
	   Wearing a tan suit and brown speckled tie, Rushdie walked into
the official opening ceremony at the fair, at times smiling broadly
as he chatted briefly with several apparent escorts.
	   Book fair officials played down the appearance, concentrating
instead on the theme of Swiss works for this year's week-long
event.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   A semi-official Iranian foundation placed the dlrs 2.5 million
bounty on Rushdie after Khomeini's edict was issued.
	   Debate over the edict stepped up after Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Sept. 24 distanced his government from the reward
for Rushdie's death.
	   On Sunday, a letter signed by more than half the members of
Iran's hard-line parliament was broadcast on Iranian television
saying the edict against Rushdie remains.
	   The Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union.
Moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in
elections in 1997, has been trying to improve ties with the West
since he took office.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
he would go ahead with construction in a Jewish enclave in the West
Bank town of Hebron but that the work would not begin until an
archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
	   With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please both
Jewish settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has demanded a halt to
settlement expansion.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said that Netanyahu will also announce
expansion plans for an additional 3,000 homes in the West Bank
settlement of Ariel on Wednesday. Ariel is one the largest
settlements with some 14,000 Israeli residents.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ After inconclusive back-to-back talks
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday both sides still had to make
``tough choices'' to reach a West Bank accord.
	   But Albright pushed ahead, having dinner with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and arranged to have a
three-way meeting on Tuesday with Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat at the Israel-Gaza border.
	   Albright said as she stood alongside Arafat in the Palestinian
leader's headquarters, ``Time is not on our side. If we don't move
quickly we may find ourselves without a process of peacemaking.
...''
	   Arafat declined to be drawn out on the security issue. ``Peace
means security, peace means freedom,'' he said.
	   Albright gave no indication pesky details, and Israel's demand
for tougher Palestinian measures against terrorism, had been
cleared up.
	   ``We recognize there are tough choices that have to be made by
both sides as we approach the Washington summit,'' Albright said of
the three-way talks President Bill Clinton intends to hold later in
the month with Arafat and Netanyahu.

East Timor talks open, autonomy plan and diplomatic relations on
</HEADLINE>
agenda &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia and Portugal discussed U.N.
proposals for autonomy for troubled East Timor on Tuesday and also
began talks on mending severed diplomatic relations, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   The talks are the first high-level negotiations on East Timor at
the United Nations since August, when the foreign ministers of
Indonesia and Portugal agreed to discuss granting limited autonomy
to the troubled province.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it soon after. The United Nations has never recognized
Indonesia's sovereignty.
	   East Timor has endured decades of guerrilla warfare since
Indonesia took control of the territory, 1,200 miles (1,900
kilometers) east of Jakarta. A small band of rebels regularly
attacks Indonesian troops, who have been accused of widespread
human rights violations.
	   In Jakarta on Tuesday, Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas,
called on Portugal to accept its proposal to grant autonomy, not
independence, to the half-island as ``a final and peaceful
solution'' for the troubled territory.
	   Portugal had previously backed nothing short of
self-determination for East Timor. Timorese separatists have
demanded that a referendum be held on self-determination.
	   However, the Indonesian government has repeatedly rejected the
idea, saying it could reopen old divisions and conflicts within
East Timorese society.
	   On Tuesday, the two sides held their first in-depth discussion
on a proposal for autonomy but were leaving aside the issue of a
final status for the province. They also discussed opening interest
sections _ the first step toward opening an embassy _ in each
other's countries, Eckhard said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris commuters faced a morning without bus service
Wednesday as drivers of city buses and one commuter train line,
angered by violent attacks against them, were staying off the job.
	   On Tuesday evening, some unions, including the General
Confederation of Labor, said the bus strike would continue through
Wednesday morning at least.
	   Unions were demanding more protection in a city where about 9
million people depend on public transit daily _ and where crime is
rising.
	   The Interior Ministry, in response, announced that about 200
extra national police would patrol subway, bus and commuter train
lines.
	   Some 2 million bus commuters were left stranded Tuesday by the
latest walkout to hit French public transportation. The metro has
not been affected.
	   Drivers on 12 bus lines in northern Paris joined the walkout
Tuesday after a driver was beaten and stabbed in the abdomen a day
earlier by a rider who wanted to be dropped off between two stops.
The driver was hospitalized.
	   Meanwhile, more than 200,000 riders on the RER D line, which
links the capital with southern suburbs, have been stranded since
Monday afternoon by train drivers protesting an attack on an
employee last week.
	   A gang of youths attacked the employee, spraying him with a
paint can and striking him with it after he tried to stop them from
vandalizing the station at Le Ferte-Alais in the Essonne suburb
south of Paris.
	   The Paris transit authority, RATP, plans to add police
protection and also has promised to hire 350 youths as transit
attendants, more than tripling the number already in the Paris
area, as part of the leftist government's youth jobs program.
	   Coming from disadvantaged areas, the youths are trained to
dissuade their aggressive peers from resorting to violence.
	   Indicating that crime is a growing problem in Paris, a newspaper
on Tuesday reported rising gang activity in the capital with about
30 known groups _ mainly composed of rival youths from immigrant
families _ competing for turf.
	   In the latest incident, police sources said Tuesday evening that
a gas-station attendant was stabbed to death overnight when he
tried to stop a gang of youths from stealing his car at the gas
station in northern Paris.
	   And last Friday, a gang of youths opened fire on a Gypsy wedding
in the 14th district of southwestern Paris, injuring four people,
one seriously.
	   The newspaper Le Parisien said the attackers were from a gang of
African and Arab youths.
	   Youth violence has been linked to economic hard times in France,
where the jobless rate rises to 50 percent or more in poor
immigrant neighborhoods.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is arranging trilateral talks with Israel's premier and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to be held during the second day
of her Mideast shuttle, Israel announced Tuesday.
	   Albright met with Arafat in the Palestinian-run city of Jericho
in the West Bank and was scheduled to hold her second meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu's office said that a three-way meeting would take
place at 11:00am (09:00gmt) Wednesday at the Ezer border crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. There was concern that a planned
trip by Arafat to Moscow for Wednesday would hurt the chances for
such a meeting but the talks would be held early enough to
accommodate his departure.
	   ``The feeling is that since there seems to be a real impasse
where the deadlock is not surmountable on the lower levels of
officialdom, that perhaps it can be overcome if the principles
discuss the matter themselves in the presence of the secretary of
state,'' said an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Earlier, a Palestinian official said that Albright did not bring
anything from Israel to her Tuesday talks with Arafat.
	   Palestinian officials also confirmed trilateral talks planned
for Wednesday.
	   Albright met with both leaders as part of her efforts to bring
the sides closer to completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal. If Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps
over a U.S. peace initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely
sign a deal in Washington later this month.
	   ``A trilateral meeting will depend on what Secretary Albright
brings to us from Netanyahu tomorrow. She did not bring anything
from Netanyahu today,'' said a senior Palestinian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

	   ABOARD THE USS ANZIO in the Ionian Sea (AP) _ If NATO launches
strikes against Yugoslav forces to halt the bloodshed in Kosovo,
the first shot could come from the decks of this guided missile
cruiser bristling with state-of-the art weapons.
	   The Anzio is part of the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower's
battle group, a formidable collection of warships and warplanes now
engaged in a massive NATO maneuver involving 17,000 military
personnel from 11 countries.
	   Although the maneuvers were planned long ago, the timing _ as it
turns out _ couldn't be better for NATO. The force is on display
just at the moment when the alliance appears closer than ever to
attacking the Yugoslav Serbs.
	   According to some scenarios, NATO's first volley would come from
Tomahawk cruise missiles _ and the Anzio has to potential to carry
up to 122 of them.
	   ``It's a 'Death Star,''' the Anzio's captain, Cmdr. Joe
Klingseis, said proudly of his warship, which also boasts torpedoes
to fight off other ships or subs and anti-aircraft weapons to
battle attacks from overhead.
	   ``With what we have here we can kill a whole bunch of people
simultaneously _ and they don't even know they're going to die.''
	   NATO's second volley would likely come from warplanes. And NATO
need look no further than the gigantic Eisenhower, which carries
dozens of F/A-18 Hornets equipped with laser-guided ``smart bombs''
as well as F-14 Tomcat fighters and other aircraft.
	   The prospect of strikes appeared close Tuesday as U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
he has not met U.N. demands for a peaceful solution to the crisis
in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the province's separatists has
killed hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless
and strengthened NATO's resolve to stop the violence.
	   ``Nobody likes the thought of a backyard bully,'' said
Klingseis. ``If there's a bully who's hurting people and he doesn't
need to be hurting people and I can help stop that ...''
	   If NATO decides to go ahead, the alliance's top commander in
Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, has said action could come ``in
a matter of hours and days.''
	   The 10-ship Eisenhower battle group was in the Ionian Sea south
of Italy on Tuesday. Its commander, Rear Admiral Scott A. Fry said
it could be within Tomahawk-striking distance of Yugoslavia ``very
quickly.''
	   Cruise missiles would likely be the first weapon of choice
because their 700-mile range would keep the Anzio well out of the
range of any retaliatory action.
	   Attack aircraft, on the other hand, would have to face
Yugoslavia's air defense system. So, to make the skies safe for
NATO pilots, Yugoslavia's anti-aircraft missile sites, air bases
and radar stations would likely be among the first targets locked
in on the banks of computer consoles and glowing screens in the
Anzio's combat room.
	   One of the men in charge of the combat systems, Ensign Timothy
Spaulding, is a veteran of the 1995 NATO bombing campaign that
helped end another Balkan conflict, in Bosnia. He says force is
sometimes the only answer.
	   ``I had my doubts then. I was surprised that a week later they
were in Dayton at the peace talks,'' he said. ``I hope that if we
fire in anger, something will come of it.''

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared
war between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border
attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies
harboring the rebels.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,''
Demirel said in a statement after the talks.
	   Independent television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six
Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, recognize Turkey's
existing borders and promise to establish good, neighborly
relations.
	   The statement from Demirel's office said the Egyptians were
given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence reports
that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Premier Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak flew from the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday
and went directly into talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Neither leader talked with reporters before the meeting, their
second in three days on the crisis.
	   Mubarak told Egyptian journalists on his plane that he has
proposed that Turkey and Syria ``meet to discuss the details of the
problem'' over the Kurdish rebels, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Mubarak acknowledged Demirel's concern about the rebels, but
added: ``I pointed out to him that our region does not accept or
endure any military action or armed confrontation.''
	   MENA also said Mubarak was trying to arrange a meeting between
the Turkish and Syrian foreign ministers as well as creation of a
``joint committee to start meeting to rebuild the bridges of
confidence'' between the neighboring countries.

Families of Chechen hostages emerge hopeful from meeting with
</HEADLINE>
Foreign Office

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The families of four men kidnapped in Chechnya at
the weekend met with the Foreign Office on Wednesday, and emerged
feeling ''very, very, very confident'' that their relatives would
be released.
	   ''We all came out of there feeling a million times better than
we did when we went in,'' said Deborah Hickey, sister of hostage
Darren Hickey.
	   Hickey and two of the other kidnaped men, Briton Rudolph Petschi
and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, were working for Granger Telecom, a
British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines
across Chechnya. The fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, was an
independent consultant working on behalf of British Telecom in
Chechnya.
	   The men were seized early Saturday after a gang shoot-out with
their bodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand.
	   British officials criticized Granger Telecom, saying they'd
given the company explicit warnings about the danger of working in
Chechnya. The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   Granger Telecom said they were aware of the dangers, but
believed the men would be well protected and considered the
five-year contract, worth several million dollars, justified the
risk.
	   A Foreign Office spokesman refused to disclose details of
Wednesday's meeting, which he called ''amicable.'' The Foreign
Office said they used the opportunity to ''develop working
relationships'' with the families and outline Britain's opposition
to paying a ransom to retrieve hostages.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Canadian embassy pulling out some personnel;
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The prospect of NATO air strikes
moved ominously closer Tuesday as a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he has not met U.N. demands for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Richard Holbrooke met the Yugoslav president for the second day
Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian province, where the
Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence.
	   In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian political leaders,
Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Belgrade, reporters saw
about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles of all sorts _ ranging from
armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops _ moving
outside Kosovo. It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance
with international demands that his forces pull far back from
front-line areas.
	   Additionally, state-run Serbian TV claimed that all Serbian
special police units, on the forefront of strikes against Kosovo
Albanian militants, were pulled out of the province. Their pullback
was one of the key international demands.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told the Associated Press Television News that the complete
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
	   ``Is there a country in the world that would do so, especially
with an armed rebellion in their hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   The Canadian government announced it was flying out nonessential
diplomatic personnel and their families from Yugoslavia. Other
countries were expected to follow suit.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
that because Milosevic continued to resist ``sustainable and
irreversible compliance with the demands of the international
community ... NATO military preparations and discussions and
decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade Milosevic to
halt his crackdown and enter meaningful talks with ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve air strikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch air strikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.

appeared to take into account several of Baghdad's key demands. The
United States, however, has raised objections to several of the
ideas and has noted that the council was not bound to the U.N.
chief's proposal.

	   ``It seems to me that the deliberations of the council and the
work on the preparations and the basis and the framework of the

said.

reports about the U.S. objections.

	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its

sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by Iraqi
escorts.
	   Annan has been trying to work out an end to the impasse by
putting together his ideas for a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Such a review, according to Annan's proposal, would clearly
state what information the council needs in order to declare Iraq
free of its weapons of mass destruction _ and when Iraq could
expect that declaration.

	   It wasn't clear whether Aziz's comments spelled an end to the

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ British author Salman Rushdie, who
still has 2.5 million bounty on his head for allegedly insulting
Islam, showed up at the Frankfurt international Book Fair late
Tuesday.
	   Wearing a tan suit and brown speckled tie, Rushdie walked into
the official opening ceremony at the fair, at times smiling broadly
as he chatted briefly with several apparent escorts.
	   Book fair officials played down the appearance, concentrating
instead on the theme of Swiss works for this year's week-long
event.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   A semi-official Iranian foundation placed the dlrs 2.5 million
bounty on Rushdie after Khomeini's edict was issued.
	   Debate over the edict stepped up after Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Sept. 24 distanced his government from the reward
for Rushdie's death.
	   Before Rushdie's appearance, Gerhard Kurtze, president of the
German Book Publishers' Association, said that great hope was
raised with Iran distancing itself from the call to kill Rushdie.
	   He added that when the bounty on Rushdie is finally lifted,
Iranian publishers, who have been barred from the fair since the
edict, would be welcomed back.
	   On Sunday, a letter signed by more than half the members of
Iran's hard-line parliament was broadcast on Iranian television
saying the edict against Rushdie remains.
	   The Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union.
Moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who defeated the hard-line
parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri in elections in 1997, has
been trying to improve ties with the West since he took office.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister said Tuesday
that he hadn't gotten sufficient guarantees from the Security
Council that it would conduct an honest review of Iraq's progress
on ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction in return for
Baghdad's resumed cooperation with arms inspectors.
	   Tariq Aziz, who has been in New York for over a week to try to
work out a solution to the latest impasse over arms inspections,
didn't say whether or not an agreement could be reached. He said he
was still planning to meet Wednesday with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   But he told reporters after meeting with the council president,
Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, that he hadn't received the
``complete, satisfactory guarantees,'' that Baghdad required to
move forward.
	   Annan outlined his proposal for a ``comprehensive review'' of
Iraq's compliance on Monday, and it appeared to take into account
several of Baghdad's key demands. The United States, however, has
raised objections to several of the ideas and has noted that the
council wasn't obligated to use the U.N. chief's proposal.
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and Britain, in particular, weren't prepared to give
Iraq any details of how a review would be carried out until Iraq
reverses its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with arms
inspectors.
	   ``It seems to me that the deliberations of the council and the
work on the preparations and the basis and the framework of the
comprehensive review has not yet reached its final end,'' Aziz
said.
	   ``But I have to say in frankness and honesty that there are a
number of elements which are disturbing,'' he said, referring to
reports about the U.S. objections.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.

49ers owner DeBartolo pleads guilty, pays dlrs 1 million

<TEXT>
	   BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (AP) _ San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty on Tuesday to failing to report an
alleged extortion scheme involving former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards.
	   As part of a plea agreement, DeBartolo was placed on probation
and assessed dlrs 1 million in penalties. He agreed to cooperate in
any future trials of the former governor and his son, Stephen
Edwards, stemming from an investigation of their roles in the
state's riverboat casino industry.
	   The agreement holds no guarantees on DeBartolo's future as an
owner of a National Football League franchise. League rules allow
commissioner Paul Tagliabue broad discretion to ban owners
connected to criminal activity.
	   DeBartolo gave Edwards dlrs 400,000 in cash shortly before his
company received a casino license last year. He resigned as 49ers
chairman and turned management control of the team over to his
sister in December, shortly after he was notified by prosecutors
that he was a target of the investigation.
	   Without the plea agreement, DeBartolo faced a maximum of three
years in prison. Instead, he was placed on two years' probation.
The formal charge was ``misprision of a felony'' _ knowing about a
crime and not reporting it.
	   Neither of the Edwardses has been indicted but both were
notified late last year that they were targets of the federal
investigation that has gone on for more than two years.
	   DeBartolo did not speak in court. His attorney, Aubrey Harwell,
told the judge that it was a mistake not to report what had
happened in his attempt to get the license.
	   ``He's accepted responsibility,'' Harwell said. ``He's entered a
plea. He's cooperating with the government. He voluntarily stepped
away from his team. He has been adequately punished. The man before
you in court is a victim.''
	   The former governor, one of the state's most flamboyant
politicians, was in the courtroom as DeBartolo entered his plea.
	   Edwards has acknowledged receiving dlrs 400,000 from DeBartolo
but has insisted it was for legitimate lobbying purposes. Edwards
said recently he was not worried about DeBartolo testifying against
him.
	   DeBartolo, 51, was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the only son of an
Italian immigrant who had made millions on shopping centers and
horse racing tracks.
	   He became president of the family business in 1979, then in
1994, he spun off most of the corporation's holdings into a dlrs 16
billion publicly traded real estate investment trust with 111
regional shopping centers and dealings in 32 states.
	   In 1977, he bought the 49ers for dlrs 17 million with backing
from his father, becoming the youngest owner in NFL history at age
30. He transformed the team into one of the league's most
respected, with 12 division titles and five Super Bowl
championships.
	   Forbes magazine last month estimated his worth at dlrs 830
million, ranking him 236th on its list of richest Americans.

U.N. chief: Kosovo fighting continues despite demands for
</HEADLINE>
cease-fire &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with council convening on Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council held preliminary
discussions Tuesday on the U.N. chief's Kosovo report, which stated
that Serb forces intensified their attacks on ethnic Albanians even
after the council demanded a cease-fire.
	   No immediate action was expected from the 15-member council,
which is divided as to whether to use force to end the Serb attacks
on Kosovo and whether NATO needs any more council authority to
initiate such force.
	   Russia, a veto-holding council member, said Tuesday it was
likely to veto any resolution specifically authorizing the use of
force, and China _ which also holds a veto _ said it also opposed
military intervention.
	   ``Use of force won't help normalize the situation. It'll do just
the opposite,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the
Interfax news agency.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang urged the
international community to settle the dispute ``through political
dialogue.''
	   The council isn't required to take any action on the report.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
end to the fighting that has left hundreds of people _ mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted tens of thousands
since a Serb crackdown began in February. Most ethnic Albanians
want independence for the province, which is 90 percent Albanian.
	   In its resolution, the council demanded that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic withdraw his special forces from the province
and allow for the safe return of refugees and for humanitarian
access to them. It demanded both sides work toward finding a
political solution and threatened unspecified action if both sides
failed to comply with the entire resolution.
	   In Monday's report, Annan reported that in the week following
the resolution, government security forces ``intensified their
operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica region,''
and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, Annan said.
	   As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly displaced, he
said.
	   Annan said he couldn't specifically determine Serb compliance
with U.N. resolutions because the United Nations doesn't have the
presence in Kosovo to confirm reports of atrocities. His report,
however, listed several apparent violations of the Sept. 23
resolution.
	   While fighting began to wind down in the last days of September,
with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number of
police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received
information ``that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that the operations of the special police
continue,'' Annan wrote.
	   In his report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in
Kosovo'' and said it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt'' that
Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.
	   He added there was reason to believe that the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been fighting the Serbs, was responsible
for atrocities as well.
	   Annan said he was outraged by recent reports of mass killings of
civilians in Kosovo _ reports that galvanized international threats
to intervene with military force.

 &UR; U.S. envoy meets defiant Milosevic as NATO strikes loom
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Canadian embassy pulling out some personnel;

 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The prospect of NATO air strikes
moved ominously closer Tuesday as a top U.S. envoy warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that he has not met U.N. demands for a
peaceful solution to the crisis in embattled Kosovo province.
	   Richard Holbrooke met the Yugoslav president for the second day
Tuesday after visiting the southern Serbian province, where the
Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence.
	   In Kosovo, where he met ethnic Albanian political leaders,
Holbrooke said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Belgrade, reporters saw
about 100 Yugoslav security vehicles of all sorts _ ranging from
armored personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops _ moving
outside Kosovo. It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance
with international demands that his forces pull far back from
front-line areas.
	   Additionally, state-run Serbian TV claimed that all Serbian
special police units, on the forefront of strikes against Kosovo
Albanian militants, were pulled out of the province. Their pullback
was one of the key international demands.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told the Associated Press Television News that the complete
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
	   ``Is there a country in the world that would do so, especially
with an armed rebellion in their hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   The Canadian government announced it was flying out nonessential
diplomatic personnel and their families from Yugoslavia. Other
countries were expected to follow suit.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
that because Milosevic continued to resist ``sustainable and
irreversible compliance with the demands of the international
community ... NATO military preparations and discussions and
decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade Milosevic to
halt his crackdown and enter meaningful talks with ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve air strikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch air strikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.

U.S. lawyer sues Austrian bank in behalf of Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A U.S. lawyer acting in behalf of
Holocaust survivors has filed a class-action lawsuit against an
Austrian bank in addition to two major German banks, the Austria
Press Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The lawyer, Edward Fagan, accuses Creditanstalt of Vienna of
having conspired with Nazi authorities during World War II and
having profited from the sale of gold robbed from Jewish victims of
the Holocaust, APA reported.
	   But Gerhard Reidlinger, the Creditanstalt spokesman, said talks
would continue on compensation between Fagan and the bank's New
York lawyers, the report said.
	   On Monday, Fagan told APA that the lawsuit would provide the
basis to move forward toward an agreement with the banks involved.
	   Creditanstalt lawyer Charles Moerdler underlined the Austrian
bank's resolve to live up to its moral responsibility.
	   Fagan said earlier that two other Austrian banks could soon be
faced with similar claims from Holocaust victims. He refused to
name them.
	   Austrian insurance companies will also be targets of class
action suits from Holocaust victims, despite their arguments that
they could not be taken to court in the United States, Fagan said.
	   Creditanstalt was taken over by Germany's Deutsche Bank during
the Nazi era.
	   Fagan has been seeking compensation for gold stolen by the Nazis
from Jewish families and allegedly transferred by Creditanstalt to
Turkey during World War II.
	   The Austrian news magazine Profil claimed last month that
Creditanstalt maintained ``business contacts'' with at least 13
concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen
and Dachau.
	   Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, one year before the
war began in Europe.

Attention turns to gubernatorial elections after Cardoso's virtual
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Tuesday developments. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Attention has shifted in Brazil from
the president's almost-certain re-election to gubernatorial runoff
elections, on which the success of belt tightening measures deemed
necessary to avert an economic meltdown may hinge.
	   With 69.5 percent of the votes counted Tuesday, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso Cardoso continued to lead with 52.4
percent of the vote. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
of the leftist Workers Party had 32.6 percent, and Ciro Gomes of
the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent.
	   Nine other candidates shared the rest. Cardoso must win more
than half the vote from Sunday's election to avoid a second-round
runoff _ a feat he is expected to easily accomplish.
	   The same rule applies to the gubernatorial candidates in all 27
states, and at least 14 of them appeared headed to a second round
of voting on Oct.25.
	   ``Governors have always exerted enormous influence on their
states' congressional bloc,'' said Luciano Dias a Brasilia-based
political consultant. ``And the outcome of the runoff elections
will definitely determine just how easy, or difficult, it will be
for Cardoso to persuade Congress to approve the austerity
measures.''
	   He said that if Cardoso opponents win runoff elections in the
states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do
Sul, ``the going will get tough.''
	   Together, those four states occupy 200 of the 513 seats in the
Chamber of Deputies and account for 67.29 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.
	   ``If the opposition wins in these states Cardoso will face a
formidable wall of resistance against the unpopular measures that
are certain to come,'' Dias said. ``The president will get his
measures, but he will have to negotiate, and that means bartering,
which could weaken the austerity package.''
	   Brazil, like other emerging markets, is suffering from a loss of
investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country's
foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70
billion posted at the end of July.
	   To prevent a collapse of the real and stem capital flight,
interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. Cardoso has
promised to tackle the country's ballooning a budget deficit _
equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ and hinted that
taxes would be increased.
	   Although most observers agree that the faster these measures are
defined and introduced, the better, Cardoso is unlikely to impose
them until after the second round of voting. To do so would
jeopardize the chances of pro-government gubernatorial candidates.
	   Chip Brown, chief Latin American economist for Salomon Smith
Barney in New York, said that little news was expected over the
next few weeks on the fiscal package meant to restore confidence
among investors.
	   ``I hope the market doesn't expect too much immediately,'' he
said, adding that the best markets can hope for in the short term
is broad sketches of a fiscal plan.
	   Ricardo Ribeiro, a Sao Paulo political consultant, said delaying
the measures could make their approval more difficult.
	   ``As the population gets a better notion of the seriousness of
the crisis and the severity of the measures that will certainly be
adopted, Cardoso's popularity will erode,'' he said. ``And if his
popularity drops, so will his chances to get Congress' approval for
these measures.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between Ankara and Damascus,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a feared
war between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border
attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies
harboring the rebels.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,''
Demirel said in a statement after the talks.
	   Independent television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six
Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, recognize Turkey's
existing borders and promise to establish good, neighborly
relations.
	   The statement from Demirel's office said the Egyptians were
given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence reports
that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Premier Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak flew from the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday
and met for more than an hour with Syrian President Hafez Assad. It
was their second meeting in three days.
	   Assad's spokesman, Jubran Kourieh, did not give details, saying
only that Mubarak outlined Ankara's views and listened to Syria's.
	   Reports in Egypt said Mubarak was trying to work out a mechanism
for the two sides to resolve the dispute peacefully.
	   Mubarak told Egyptian journalists on his plane that he proposed
that Turkey and Syria ``meet to discuss the details of the
problem'' over the Kurdish rebels, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Mubarak acknowledged Demirel's concern about the rebels, but
added: ``I pointed out to him that our region does not accept or
endure any military action or armed confrontation.''
	   MENA also said Mubarak was trying to arrange a meeting between
the Turkish and Syrian foreign ministers as well as creation of a
``joint committee to start meeting to rebuild the bridges of
confidence'' between the neighboring countries.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi weighed in on Syria's side
Tuesday, saying ``any aggression against Syria will be considered
as an aggression against Libya according to the Arab joint defense
pact.''
	   Turkey stressed in a presidential statement Tuesday that the
issue was not linked to Turkish-Arab relations.
	   The United States and Russia, along with most countries of the
Middle East, urged the two countries to reach a peaceful solution.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have long been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the military and diplomatic ties
between Turkey and Israel.
	   But the recent rise in tension appears part of Ankara's push to
end fighting in a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency in which 37,000
people have died. The rebels are fighting for Kurdish autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
	   Turkey has reportedly sent 10,000 troops to its border with
Syria. Newspapers have suggested that its forces could stage raids
on rebel camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.
There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets buzzing the
border area in a show of force.

Agassi thumps rising Swiss star Federer, Korda toppled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Agassi-Federer match &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi gave rising
Swiss star Roger Federer a tennis lesson Tuesday, brushing aside
the 1998 Wimbledon junior champion in the first round of the dlrs 1
million Swiss Indoors.
	   Australian Open champion Petr Korda was less successful,
becoming the only seeded casualty of the opening day, succumbing
6-2, 6-4 to Germany's Nicolas Kiefer.
	   Agassi, who won each of his four titles this year without
dropping a set, needed just 55 minutes to dispose of the U.S. Open
junior finalist, breaking Federer's opening serve in each set on
way to a 6-3, 6-2 win.
	   Playing in only his third career ATP Tour event, Federer took
advantage of a slight waver in Agassi's concentration to
immediately break back and even the score to 1-1 in the second set.
	   Agassi, however, quickly regained control to break the
17-year-old wildcard twice more to seal his victory.
	   ``I took control of the match, and stayed in control,'' said
Agassi, winner in Munich last weekend. ``I got a little careless
and he broke back but then I got it together again.
	   ``It was nice to get that first match in to get used to the
court. From here I intend to step it up as the tournament goes
on.''
	   Agassi's last appearance in Basel dates back 10 years when he
was 17-years-old himself and on his way up. The American said he
was impressed by Federer, who last week reached the quarterfinals
in Toulouse, only his second career ATP Tour tournament.
	   ``He seems younger than I felt back then,'' joked Agassi, who
also won titles in Washington, Los Angeles and Key Biscayne this
season. ``But I was very impressed by him. He's very talented.
	   ``He missed some shots my opponents normally wouldn't miss, but
I attribute that to being 17.''
	   A good result at the tournament could cement Agassi's place
among the top-eight in the ATP standings, and secure the American a
berth in the ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover next month.
	   Korda, ninth in the ATP rankings, was was hoping a good
performance in Basel might springboard him into the top-eight, past
Britain's Tim Henman, to qualify for a spot in Hannover. Instead
Korda spent just 77 minutes on the St. Jakobshalle court.
	   The third-seed Czech left the stadium immediately following his
defeat, refusing to talk to journalists.
	   ``It's very satisfying to win against the world number five,''
said Kiefer. ``I served well and was very aggressive. It's likely
due to my last three weeks of training, which were very intense.''
	   Kiefer will play the second round against lucky-loser Jeff
Tarango of the United States, who beat France's Nicolas Escude 6-3,
6-3.
	   In other first round play, fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 7-5, 6-3.
	   Currently eighth in the ATP rankings, sixth-seed Henman recorded
a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over Australian Jason Stoltneberg,
conserving his chances for a berth in Hannover.
	   Home-crowd favorite Marc Rosset, 57th in the world, defeated
Germany's Tommy Haas, ranked 39th, 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).
	   In further first-round action Wednesday, World No. 1 Pete
Sampras plays 1994 champion Wayne Ferreira, and two-time U.S. Open
champion Patrick Rafter takes on Czech Daniel Vacek.

Andreas Brehme, former German star, celebrates farewell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany (AP) _ Andreas Brehme, whose penalty
goal against Argentina five minutes from time gave Germany the 1990
World Cup title, celebrated his retirement Tuesday in a
star-studded game.
	   The match before 36,825 fans involved his last club FC
Kaiserslautern, the reigning German champion, and an international
All-Star selection.
	   Among others, the selection included Ivan Zamorano, Christian
Karembeu, Guiseppe Bergomi, Franco Baresi, Juergen Klinsmann,
Pierre Littbarski, Nicola Berti, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Rudi
Voeller, Toni Schumacher, Thomas Haessler and Brehme himself.
	   The All-Star selection had Franz Beckenbauer as coach, and
clinched a 4-4 draw on two goals by Voeller and one each from
Rummenigge and Toni Polster.
	   Brehme played 86 games for Germany and was one of the country's
best defenders in the 1980s and early 1990s. He retired after the
1994 World Cup, following Germany's ouster in the quarterfinals.
	   But he stayed in club soccer, returning to his original
Bundesliga club, Kaiserslautern.
	   Brehme had tears as his eyes as Kaiserslautern dropped out of
the Bundesliga for the first time in its history.
	   But Brehme was also part of Kaiserslautern's historic
achievement. The club gained immediate promotion and clinched the
Bundesliga title in its comeback season, something never done by
another Bundesliga club.
	   While Kaiserslautern was winning the title, Brehme was gradually
being phased out of the team by coach Otto Rehhagel and retired at
the end of the season.
	   He also played for Bayern Munich, Inter Milan and Real Zaragoza,
and later said his years in Italy were the most important for his
career.
	   By a strange coincidence, Brehme's first international _ in 1984
_ was against the same team as his last official game, the 2-1
quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria at the 1994 World Cup in the United
States.
	   Brehme will be remembered in Germany for his cool poise when he
took the penalty kick against Argentina at Rome's Olympic stadium
in the 1990 World Cup final, driving a low shot inside the right
post when no other German dared to take the shot.

	   ROME (AP) _ In an Oct. 4 story on the death of Frank Pogson
Doria Pamphili, The Associated Press failed to identify him by his
full name. He was born Frank Pogson, but upon marriage his surname
was joined with that of his wife's family, Doria Pamphili. The

family name, to Pogson Doria Pamphili. The family name was changed
at the express wish of the late Prince Doria.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between the Turkish and Syrian
capitals, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a
feared war between the two countries over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border
attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies
harboring the rebels.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,''
Demirel said in a statement after the talks.
	   Independent television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six
Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, recognize Turkey's
existing borders and promise to establish good, neighborly
relations.
	   The statement from Demirel's office said the Egyptians were
given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence reports
that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak flew from the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday
and went directly into talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Neither leader talked with reporters before the meeting, their
second in three days on the crisis.
	   Mubarak told Egyptian journalists on his plane that he has
proposed that Turkey and Syria ``meet to discuss the details of the
problem'' over the Kurdish rebels, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
	   Mubarak acknowledged Demirel's concern about the rebels, but
added: ``I pointed out to him that our region does not accept or
endure any military action or armed confrontation.''
	   MENA also said Mubarak was trying to arrange a meeting between
the Turkish and Syrian foreign ministers as well as creation of a
``joint committee to start meeting to rebuild the bridges of
confidence'' between the neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The government used
public funds to persuade voters to elect ruling party candidates in
southern Chiapas state, opposition leaders said Tuesday.
	   With 95 percent of the ballots counted in Sunday's vote, the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, led in most
counties, and appeared to have recovered some mayorships it lost
three years ago.
	   However, the conservative National Action Party retained control
of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   In Sunday's balloting, voters chose governments in 102 of the
state's 111 counties and members of the 40-seat state legislature.
The vote was postponed in eight flood-wrecked counties and
residents boycotted elections in the highlands county of San Juan
Chamula to protest the jailing a year ago of five men.
	   Despite the relatively calm balloting in the conflict-ridden
state, human rights organizations reported numerous irregularities.
	   In San Cristobal de las Casas, hundreds of Indians received dlrs
21 each from a federal anti-poverty program in the three days prior
to balloting, the La Foja newspaper reported.
	   In the highlands county of Huixtan, Indian peasants had to
present their voter credentials on election day to receive federal
agriculture subsidy checks, said Francisco Gallardo of the national
election watchdog group Civic Alliance.
	   In Ocosingo county, a bastion for the leftist rebel Zapatista
National Liberation Army, opposition leaders said officials offered
money and food for ruling party votes. They also accused federal
troops and pro-government paramilitary groups of inhibiting voters
by erecting checkpoints on main roads.
	   Only about 24 percent of the electorate there voted, leaders of
the Democratic Revolution Party said. Many rebel supporters
boycotted the vote.
	   In the flood-devastated Pacific Coast county of Tonala, National
Action leaders accused the victorious ruling party candidate of
using humanitarian aid to sway voters.
	   Observers with the San Francisco-based group Global Exchange
said last month's flooding and the presence of troops discouraged
voter turnout in two-thirds of the state.
	   State Congressman Jose Antonio Merida Mayorga, a leading ruling
party member, denied any federal funds were used to persuade
voters.
	   ``We have in no way put the party label on humanitarian aid or
other public works,'' Merida said. Chiapas voters ``can simply see
that the opposition does not offer a political platform, but only
seeks to shout about problems.''
	   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president of the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, said his party would demand new elections,
including for governor.
	   Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen was the second governor to be
appointed since Eduardo Robledo Rincon was forced from office in
Feburary 1995, two months into his term. Although the state
constitution requires new elections in such cases, special
balloting has never been called.

Albright says leaders still must make `tough choices'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede JERICHO &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with talks scheduled for Wednesday,
INCORPORATES BC-Palestinian-Mideast Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians have failed to make
the ``tough choices'' needed to conclude a West Bank accord and
unless they do, Mideast peacemaking could fall apart, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   Her remarks, as she met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu here and with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Jericho
on the West Bank, seemed designed to spur the leaders to tackle
their differences.
	   The key challenge appeared to be settling on security
arrangements that would enable Netanyahu to sign off on a 13
percent pullback from the West Bank with high hopes of getting the
deal through his rightist Likud coalition government.
	   Still, Albright set up a three-way meeting on Wednesday with
Arafat and Netanyahu at Erez, on the border between Israel and
Palestinian-held Gaza.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' Albright said, standing alongside
Arafat in his Jericho headquarters. ``If we don't move quickly, we
may find ourselves without a process of peacemaking, without an
agreement, and without the hope of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian
peace.''
	   Arafat declined to be drawn out on the security issue. ``Peace
means security, peace means freedom,'' he said.
	   The territorial issue _ the terms of Israel's pullback _ was
``largely resolved,'' said U.S. State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin. But dozens of other issues remain unresolved, he said.
	   Whatever Albright may accomplish here, there will be no
agreement before U.S. President Bill Clinton hosts a Washington
summit with Arafat and Netanyahu, he added.
	   ``I think we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where
some heavy lifting is going to be required,'' he said. ``We do not
envisage it as a photo-op in which everything is pre-cooked.''
	   The summit's exact date and site are in flux. The likely startup
is Oct. 15 or Oct. 20, and the location could be outside
Washington, such as at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern
Shore.
	   After Albright leaves the region, probably on Wednesday, U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
	   ``We recognize there are tough choices that have to be made by
both sides as we approach the Washington summit,'' said Albright,
wearing matching peace-dove earrings, bracelet and pin, as she gave
no indication that differences had been cleared up.
	   The aim is an Israeli pullback on the West Bank, the acquisition
of more territory for the Palestinians and the start of
negotiations over such issues as the future of Jerusalem and
Palestinian aspirations for a state.
	   Whatever the outcome, Albright said the United States intends to
pursue a better relationship with the Palestinian Authority ``for
its own sake.''
	   ``We have thought for some time about increasing the level of
discourse,'' she said.
	   But she declined to say whether the administration was setting
the stage for dealing ultimately with a Palestinian state.
	   Earlier, in Jerusalem, there also was no report of progress in
Albright's meeting with Netanyahu. A senior Israeli official, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority had done ``nothing,
nothing, nothing'' in the runup to the planned summit to rout
terrorists on land under its control.
	   Albright placed highest priority on security measures but said
there were a number of issues where ``parallel'' movement by Israel
and the Palestinians was needed.
	   For his part, Netanyahu said Israel had met its obligations _
meaning a willingness to relinquish more land on the West Bank _
and ``the crucial question'' was whether the Palestinians would
reciprocate.
	   Bar-Illan complained specifically about anti-Israel provisions
that remain in the Palestine Liberation Organization's covenant and
the presence, he said, of 13 indicted terrorist suspects in the
Palestinian police.

Afghan opium production drops thanks to bad weather
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Afghanistan's opium poppy crop is
expected to drop by 25 percent this year, the U.N. drug control
agency said. The decline is due mostly to bad weather rather than
effective measures by the country's Taliban religious rulers.
	   In a report, the Vienna-based U.N. Drug Control Program
estimated Afghanistan's 1998 production would reach about 2,100
metric tons down from the 1997 yield of 2,800 metric tons.
	   U.N. officials had expected this year's crop to surpass last
year's. Opium poppies are used to manufacture heroin, and U.N.
officials said the decline means 70 tons (63.5 metric tons) of
illicit heroin will be off the world markets.
	   ``An unusually long 1998 winter season, heavy and continuous
rains and hail storms in southern Afghanistan and unseasonal rains
in northern Afghanistan are all factors which adversely affected
the opium yield,'' the report said.
	   Despite the projected decline, the U.N. agency said opium poppy
cultivation spread for the first time to two new Afghan provinces _
Loghar and Laghman _ as well as several new districts.
	   That raised concerns that _ barring an effective government
crackdown _ next year's crop could increase significantly if the
weather improves.
	   ``I appeal to all parties in Afghanistan to exert their best
efforts in order to dissuade the farmers from planting opium poppy
in the coming growing season, especially in new areas,'' the head
of the drug control agency, Pino Arlacchi, said.
	   Arlacchi warned that if his appeal goes unheeded, he will ask
U.N. member states to tighten controls on Afghanistan's land
borders.
	   The United Nations estimates that heroin of Afghan origin
accounts for 80 percent of the European market and 20 percent of
the American.

	   OTTAWA, Canada (AP) -- The Canadian government is advising
Canadians to leave Yugoslavia while there are still commercial
flights available, ``unless their presence is essential.''
	   Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Sophi Legendre said all
non-essential diplomatic staff and the families of all diplomatic
staff are being evacuated from Belgrade this week.
	   She said the government made the move because ``we're
anticipating potential problems because of the current situation.''
	   She was referring to NATO threats to launch airstrikes unless
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts international demands
to halt the crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo
province.

Police reinforcements in Jerusalem, clash in West Bank

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fatah leaflet calling for strikes, violence grafs

 &UR; With BC-Albright-Mideast

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to prevent attacks by Islamic militants,
police reinforcements patrolled Jerusalem and sealed off downtown
streets Tuesday as thousands of Jews prayed at the Western Wall to
mark the Sukkot holiday.
	   The security measures came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived for talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   In the West Bank, two dozen Palestinians clashed with Israeli
soldiers at the entrance to the tense, divided city of Hebron.
Palestinian teenagers threw rocks and bottles at Israeli soldiers
at a roadblock. Israeli forces fired tear gas and rubber-coated
steel bullets at the demonstrators. No injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian police intervened to restore order. A Palestinian
policeman approached an Israeli soldier and threatened, ``if you
shoot one more rubber bullet, I will shoot you.'' After the arrival
of the Palestinian police commander in Hebron, the Israelis opened
the roadblock and allowed Palestinians to enter and leave the city.
	   A leaflet distributed in the Hebron and signed by Fatah, the
Palestinian movement aligned with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
called for a general strike Thursday and more clashes Friday to
protest a closure and curfew on the city.
	   ``this leaflets shows the disappointment and despair of the
people of Hebron and the daily harassment from the Israeli army
against our people,'' said Jamal Shobaki, a Fatah leader.
	   ``Albright talks about peace, but we have collective punishment,
closures, curfews ... all this is not in accordance with the peace
that Albright is talking about,'' he said.
	   Hebron has been sealed off for a week, since grenades were
thrown at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlers in the middle
of the city. Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled part of
downtown Hebron are still confined to their homes by an Israeli
curfew order.
	   In traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, police sealed off streets
outside the Old City. Officers were stationed every few meters
(yards). Police banned vehicles from entering the Old City, except
for public transport and cars of residents.
	   Israel police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said the measures around
Jerusalem were meant to control traffic because of the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot, when Jews throng to the Old City to pray at the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
	   She said police remain on high alert because of general warnings
of attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Israeli media broadcast warnings from unnamed security sources
about terror attacks being plotted by the militants, including
plans to kidnap Israeli politicians.
	   Hamas political leader Mahmoud Zahar refused to comment on the
reports. But he told the Associated Press that Hamas favors
retaliation against ``military or any other targets'' to stop
Israel from killing Palestinians. ``The Israelis do not understand
any language except violence,'' he said.
	   Israeli media have been warning people here of impending terror
attacks for three weeks, since Israeli forces shot and killed two
Hamas leaders in the West Bank.
	   The warnings drew fire from a columnist in the Israeli daily
Haaretz daily. Yoel Marcus charged that Israeli security services
were ``whistling in the dark.'' While admitting that there is
reason for concern, Marcus wrote, ``it would be better to
concentrate on scaring Hamas, not the Israeli public.''

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's markets closed up Tuesday as
expectations grew regarding the announcement of an economic package
to shore up Brazil's ailing economy.
	   Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange closed up 3.5 percent and the
smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange closed up 2.59 percent
	   ``Something has to come this week. Everybody here is expecting
it,'' said a Sao Paulo fund manager, citing the need for austerity
measures from the Brazilian government and an aid package from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``I would say that we should hear something concrete shortly
after (Finance Minister Pedro) Malan returns on Wednesday from the
IMF meetings (in Washington D.C.),'' he said. ``If there's nothing
by Thursday morning, share prices will fall sharply.''
	   Trading volume remained thin and market watchers expect it to
stay that way until investors get some news from the IMF and
Brazil's government.

Dutch demand to know: What was Israeli cargo plane carrying?

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In the shadow of towering
apartment buildings, a living monument to victims of the worst
Dutch air disaster bears this inscription: ``The Tree That Saw
Everything.''
	   Six years later, investigators are struggling to uncover what no
one can see _ the cause of chronic illnesses that have plagued the
neighborhood and its rescuers since the crash of an Israeli cargo
jet.
	   New disclosures the plane was carrying a chemical that can be
used to produce the deadly nerve gas sarin have reignited demands
for the truth _ and renewed speculation over what the Israelis
intended to do with the material.
	   ``Once and for all, we must put an end to the disaster. The
suffering has lasted too long,'' Hannah Belliot, who heads the
neighborhood council, said Sunday in a memorial service near trees
that survived the inferno.
	   Forty-three people were killed on Oct. 4, 1992, when the
Israel-bound Boeing 747 cargo jet lost its two right engines and
smashed into a 12-story apartment block shortly after takeoff from
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   While the cause of the crash was determined to be a design flaw,
its cargo has been a nagging mystery to the scores of residents and
rescue workers suffering from chronic health problems.
	   Last week, the Israeli government confirmed what many had
suspected after years of official denials: The plane was carrying
dangerous cargo.
	   Up to 50 gallons (190 liters) of dimethyl methylphosphonate, an
ingredient used in sarin, many pesticides and in anti-retardants
were destined for the Israel Institute for Biological Research in
suburban Tel Aviv, the Israelis disclosed.
	   Recent reports have said Israel was making chemical and
biological weapons at the institute; the Israeli government has not
commented on those claims. The Dutch government, meanwhile, has
promised a fresh parliamentary probe.
	   Those suffering from health problems say knowing exactly what
was in the belly of the jet is their only hope for recovery.
	   ``I can't get it out of my mind,'' said ambulance driver Henk
Post, 48, a paramedic dispatched to the crash site in the
low-income, heavily immigrant Bijlmer neighborhood.
	   Post arrived within minutes of the early evening crash and
worked until the next morning _ all while wearing no special
protective gear. Three years later, he began suffering health
problems, including chronic fatigue and muscle aches. He also weeps
easily and suffers bouts of depression.
	   ``He's so emotional,'' said Post's 22-year-old daughter, Bianca.
``He's different. He's not my father anymore.''
	   Post said doctors are at a loss over how to treat him.
	   He's not alone. Doctors in Bijlmer say some 300 people have
suffered health problems since the crash, including nervousness,
stress, chronic fatigue, pain and drowsiness.
	   ``My whole body is a mess. There are all kinds of weird things
going on,'' said Ed Steur, 48, an auto mechanic who helped evacuate
the area and now suffers from bronchial problems and muscle pains
``so bad that I can't do anything anymore.''
	   Steur is angry at the Israeli and Dutch governments for keeping
the plane's cargo a secret. Over the years, officials have said the
plane carried a small amount of military equipment; one newspaper
report said it was carrying Sidewinder missiles.
	   Earlier this year, Israel's ambassador to the Netherlands, Yossi
Gal, told reporters the plane carried ``no dangerous goods ...
nothing secret.''
	   Dutch officials bristle at allegations of a coverup.
	   ``I don't believe ... that something was wittingly and knowingly
withheld,'' Transport Minister Tineke Netelenbos told the daily De
Telegraaf. ``What is important is that we establish quickly which
materials were burned, at what temperature, and what consequences
they have on public health.''
	   There have been conflicting reports on whether the chemical by
itself is poisonous. But in any case, experts say long-term
exposure to a much higher dose of the chemical than was aboard the
plane would be necessary to produce illnesses.

Leewards defeats U.S. in Red Stripe opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on play. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Leeward Islands made a rousing start in
the defense of their Red Stripe Bowl cricket crown with a 242-run
win Tuesday over minnows the United States in the opening Group B
at Kensington Park.
	   The Leewards, bolstered by a strong first wicket stand between
debutant Wilden Cornwall and captain Stuart Williams, posted a
record 330 for four wickets in their 50 overs.
	   Their fearsome pace attack, spearheaded by fastbowler Anthony
Lake, then destroyed the American batting for a mere 88 in 28
overs.
	   Lake finished with five wickets for 41 runs from overs. Only
Wayne Headley made any score for the U.S., leading the way with 29.
	   The Leewards stroked their way to the highest total in a
regional one-day game thanks to superb batting from Cornwall who
cracked 126 and Williams who hit a sparkling 82 in an opening stand
of 187.
	   The pair plundered the tame American bowling and were separated
in the 30th over when Williams was caught off fastbowler Richard
Lewis. The Nevisian's enterprising innings came off only 90
deliveries and included eight boundaries.
	   Cornwall, from Antigua, was also in attacking mood, belting 14
boundaries and two sixes off only 122 balls. In all, he batted for
155 minutes.
	   West Indies discard Keith Arthurton, who made 38, and Sylvester
Joseph who finished unbeaten on 29, also got among the runs.
	   Action in Group B continues Wednesday with hosts Jamaica playing
the USA.

Turkish prime minister faces third parliamentary investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish Parliament voted Tuesday to
investigate allegations that Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz illegally
allocated state land to a private firm.
	   The probe, sponsored by pro-Islamic Virtue Party, was the third
investigation launched against Yilmaz in six months. Yilmaz, leader
of the center-right Motherland Party, denies any irregularity.
	   The Virtue Party accuses Yilmaz of allocating the land near the
western city of Izmit to leading Turkish holding Koc, to establish
a Ford autoplant.
	   Earlier this year, Parliament decided to probe allegations that
Yilmaz tried to conceal some of his personal wealth and cost the
state money by awarding consulting work to private firms at the
urging of Yilmaz's bitter rival, ex-premier Tansu Ciller's True
Path Party.
	   Parliament also voted late Tuesday to open an investigation into
Mrs. Ciller's alleged misuse of government funds when she was prime
minister. Mrs. Ciller has survived several corruption probes in
Parliament with the help of her Islamic coalition partners.
	   If the investigating commissions find evidence of corruption,
legislators would have to vote on whether to prosecute the
politicians.
	   The Virtue Party is the main opposition party, with 145 deputies
in the 550-member Parliament. It is the successor of the Islamic
Welfare Party, which was banned by the Constitutional Court earlier
this year for anti-secular activities.
	   Votes from a social democrat party, the Peoples' Republican
Party, allowed the measure to pass. The party backs Yilmaz's
minority government but says all corruption allegations should be
investigated.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year after the military forced Welfare
out of power.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors on Tuesday
disputed a proposal by the U.N. chief to make them responsible for
proving that Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction.
	   The proposal, which Iraq has long demanded, would reverse the
burden of disclosure that was clearly placed on Baghdad by the
Security Council in its resolutions, the inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission argued in a major six-month review of their
work.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan had floated the idea as part of his
proposal to persuade Iraq to reverse its decision to stop
cooperating with arms inspectors.

Former Oriole Mark Belanger dead at 54
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mark Belanger, who won eight Gold Gloves with
the Baltimore Orioles as one of the best fielding shortstops of his
generation, died of lung cancer Tuesday at 54.
	   A heavy smoker, Belanger was diagnosed with the disease about a
year ago.
	   Belanger played from 1965-81 and spent his whole career with
Baltimore. He had a lifetime batting average of only .228, but his
weak hitting was more than offset by his glove.
	   He won six consecutive Gold Gloves from 1973-78. Brooks
Robinson, with 16 Gold Gloves, is the only Orioles player to have
won more.
	   Belanger played for the 1970 World Series championship team and
on four pennant winners and six division champions.
	   After he retired, he became a key figure in the Major League
Baseball Players Association as the longtime assistant to union
head Donald Fehr.
	   Belanger helped keep players united during a two-day strike in
1985, a 32-day lockout in 1990 and a 230-day strike that wiped out
the end of the 1994 season, the entire postseason and the first
three weeks of the 1995 schedule.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Shuttling between the Turkish and Syrian
capitals, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak tried Tuesday to avert a
feared war between the two countries over Kurdish rebels.
	   In three hours of closed-door talks with Mubarak, Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel upheld his nation's case that Syria is
sheltering Turkish Kurd rebels responsible for cross-border
attacks. Turkey is threatening force against Syria, which denies
harboring the rebels.
	   ``The Turkish side has explained the support extended by Syria
to the terrorist activities in detail and said that this cannot go
on. It has been stated that the Turkish public is outraged and
pointed out to solid steps that have to be taken by Syria,''
Demirel said in a statement after the talks.
	   Independent television NTV said Mubarak left Ankara with six
Turkish demands for Syria: Cease support to the rebels, expel rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan, close rebel camps in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon, stop rebel trips across the border, recognize Turkey's
existing borders and promise to establish good, neighborly
relations.
	   The statement from Demirel's office said the Egyptians were
given a dossier _ apparently, one containing intelligence reports
that Turkey believes confirm Syrian backing for the rebels.
	   ``We are warning Syria for the last time to cease its support to
the separatist organization and abandon its hostile policy against
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak flew from the Turkish capital to Damascus late Tuesday
and met for more than an hour with Syrian President Hafez Assad. It
was their second meeting in three days.
	   Assad's spokesman, Jubran Kourieh, did not give details, saying
only that Mubarak outlined Ankara's views and listened to Syria's.

<TEXT>
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has been in New York for
over a week to discuss Annan's proposal for a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's seven-year effort to rid itself of its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   On Tuesday, Aziz told reporters that he hadn't yet received the
necessary guarantees he needed to move forward, indicating that
Iraq was not currently prepared to reverse its decision and allow
inspectors to resume their work.
	   ``There are some games of procrastination, and those elements
are of course disturbing,'' Aziz said.
	   A review of Iraq's progress, according to Annan's proposal,
would clearly state what information the council needs in order to
declare Iraq free of its weapons of mass destruction _ and when
Iraq could expect that declaration.
	   Annan clearly stated that inspectors, and not Iraq, should
provide evidence to back up their allegations that Iraq still has
proscribed weapons.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by Iraqi
escorts.

Argentina signs extradition of alleged Croatian WWII war criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's foreign minister
signed the extradition order of an alleged Nazi era concentration
camp guard to Croatia, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Nada Luburic-Sakic, 76, could be extradited in the next 10 days,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jorge Raventos told reporters.
	   Luburic-Sakic could follow in the footsteps of her husband Dinko
Sakic, the former Jasenovac concentration camp commandant, now in
Zagreb's main prison awaiting trial for war crimes.
	   To complete the steps before extradition, Foreign Minister Guido
Di Tella's order must be sent to Federal Judge Hernan Bernasconi,
who ordered Nada Sakic's arrest and the Croatian embassy in Buenos
Aires, Raventos said.
	   Nada Sakic is believed to have run a female block at Jasenovac,
where thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies died.
	   The Sakics fled Croatia in 1945, when its wartime Nazi puppet
state was defeated, and lived in Santa Teresita, 300 kilometers
southeast of Buenos Aires.

	   In their report, U.N. inspectors noted that because of Iraq's
decision, they had been unable to conduct spot searches for two
full months _ a third of the period under review.
	   Because of Iraq's defiance, ``the council may need to consider,
at some stage, that the effect of these actions by Iraq may prove
that the commission is obliged to conclude that it is unable to
provide 100 percent verification,'' that Iraq has destroyed all its
banned weapons, the inspectors said.
	   They repeated previous statements that they were close to
declaring that Iraq had complied with resolutions regarding its
chemical weapons and missiles, but that questions remained as to
Iraq's biological weapons program.
	   The report cites the biological problem as the reason why Iraq
and not inspectors should still be responsible for making
disclosures about banned weapons.
	   For nearly four years, Iraq failed to tell inspectors that it
had a biological weapons program, the inspectors said. Only when
forced did Baghdad disclose it, but its reports since then have
been ``neither credible nor verifiable.''
	   How then could inspectors be asked to prove what Iraq has
refused to divulge, the inspectors asked in their report. Iraq
should continue to be responsible for providing all information
about its banned weapons programs, as called for by U.N.
resolutions, the inspectors argued.

Chipper: Braves need to break out of business-like approach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The cackles come from all parts of the park
because these San Diego Padres clearly are having a ball.
	   Andy Ashby hoots after outjumping Wally Joyner for a fly. Jim
Leyritz shouts when he launches a drive to left. Carlos Hernandez
dances and does his best ``Rocky'' imitation.
	   An hour earlier Tuesday, it was the Atlanta Braves' turn to
prepare for the National League championship series.
	   Greg Maddux neatly dropped a bunt down the third-base line.
Keith Lockhart worked on his double-play pivot. Walt Weiss
practiced his hit-and-run swing.
	   Mostly in silence, by the way.
	   Which once again begs the question, going into Game 1 Wednesday
night at Turner Field: Are these Atlanta Braves too even-tempered
for their own good in October?
	   Built for success over the long haul of the regular season _
seven straight trips to the NLCS prove that _ many have wondered
whether the Braves are lacking the emotional element that some say
is necessary to win it all.
	   ``I think this business-type attitude hasn't gotten the job done
the last couple of years,'' Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones
admitted.
	   Pitching and hitting and fielding are no problem, as 106
victories this year attest. But, as only one World Series
championship may indicate to their fans and opponents, perhaps
these Braves teams are minus one key ingredient.
	   ``You have to have that extra emotion at this time of year,''
said Leyritz, a postseason hero with six home runs in 36 at-bats.
	   ``Maybe that extra edge is what's missing sometimes,'' he said.
``They have been here before, but they haven't won the World Series
that many times.''
	   Of course, it takes more than a lot of rah-rah attitude to win
games. Yet listen to Tony Gwynn talk about the Padres' mental state
right now: ``We're coming in euphoric, man.''
	   Certainly no one would think of ``euphoric'' when describing the
Braves. ``Efficient'' and ``effective,'' for sure, but not
``euphoric.''
	   Ashby is actually worried about getting too enthused for his
start in the opener.
	   ``The main thing for me is just control my emotions and my
excitement to a point where I can go out and do my job,'' said
Ashby, 2-0 against Atlanta this year. ``But it's a great feeling,
and there's nothing like it.''
	   The Padres partied for 90 minutes after beating Houston in the
first round of the NL playoffs, parading around the field at San
Diego while pitcher Kevin Brown and others spoke to the fans on the
public-address system.
	   The Braves also celebrated with champagne after their
first-round win over Chicago, showing more spirit than in recent
years. John Smoltz, 2-0 against the Padres this year going into his
start in Game 1, said there was a reason.
	   ``We changed our roster pretty dramatically in the offseason. We
have a lot of guys that have not been through this,'' he said.
``It's going to create more excitement for them, for us.
	   ``Some guys have played their whole lives and have not gotten
here,'' he said. ``I think nine or 10 guys are new to this, and
that brings new life and blood to what you're going through.''
	   Braves manager Bobby Cox contends there's plenty of emotion on
his team, even if it doesn't always show. Asked whether Atlanta has
anyone who gets as fired up as Leyritz, he answered: ``Twenty-five
guys on our side.''
	   Then again, remember that Cox made the extraordinary move of
pulling Andruw Jones in the middle of an inning this season when he
felt the talented center fielder lolly-gagged for a fly ball.
	   No matter, Chipper Jones hopes to see a different Atlanta club _
in the dugout, anyway _ this October.
	   ``I fully expect every time we do something good for guys to get
off the bench,'' he said. ``I think the team needs to thrive upon
those situations and let off a little steam.''

Argentina signs extradition of alleged Croatian WWII war criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's foreign minister
signed the extradition order of an alleged Nazi era concentration
camp guard to Croatia, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Nada Luburic-Sakic, 76, could be extradited in the next ten
days, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jorge Raventos told reporters.
	   Luburic-Sakic's husband, Dinko Sakic, the former Jasenovac
concentration camp commandant, has already been extradited to
Croatia, where he is in Zagreb's main prison awaiting trial for war
crimes.
	   Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's order to extradite
Luburic-Sakic must be sent to Federal Judge Hernan Bernasconi and
the Croatian embassy in Buenos Aires, Raventos said.
	   Nada Sakic is believed to have run a female block at Jasenovac,
where thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies died.
	   The Sakics fled Croatia in 1945, when its wartime Nazi puppet
state was defeated, and have lived in Santa Teresita, 185 miles
(300 kilometers) southeast of Buenos Aires.

Johnson to race against car, horses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson, thwarted repeatedly in his attempt
to be reinstated into track and field, has turned to racing against
horses and cars.
	   Morris Chrobotek, Johnson's agent, confirmed Tuesday that the
36-year-old sprinter will participate in a bizarre exhibition race
Oct. 15 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.
	   Johnson, who had the Olympic gold medal and 100-meter world
record stripped after testing positive for drugs at the 1988 Games,
will run against a standardbred pacer, a thoroughbred and a stock
car in an event organized by the Atlantic Lottery Corporation.
	   Proceeds from the race will go to the Charlottetown chapter of
the Children's Wish Foundation, which organizes trips and celebrity
visits for terminally ill children.
	   Lottery spokesman Mike Randall said the idea for the spectacle
came from his organization, which holds a fundraiser each year for
the charity.
	   ``I'd say it's probably the most unique event we've ever had,''
he said, adding it will be a serious race.
	   ``Ben is running to win, the horses are running to win and I
know the driver always drives to win,'' he said. ``It will be a lot
of fun but what's important is we're going to be able to raise some
money for a very worthwhile cause.''
	   Johnson hasn't competed since receiving a lifetime suspension
from the International Amateur Athletic Federation in 1993 after a
second positive drug test. His most recent appeal of the ban was
denied last month in an Ontario court.
	   Johnson has continued to train and Chrobotek contends his client
can still compete with the world's best sprinters. But the charity
race promises to be a strange event, one that even Chrobotek can't
resist joking about.
	   ``I want the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport to test the
horses,'' he said Tuesday. ``We ask that he (center director Victor
Lachance) personally go out and take the urine from them, I want
him personally to test the horses.
	   ``I want them to test the engine of the car to see if they're
putting any special gasoline in there.''
	   Johnson wasn't available for comment.
	   ``He's hiding out in training,'' Chrobotek said. ``He wants to
show you how slow horses are.''
	   Details of the race will be announced at a news conference
Thursday, but Randall said the four participants will cover
distances ranging from 80 to 300 meters during a live
harness-racing card at the Charlottetown Driving Park.
	   ``They'll be staggered based on their capable speed where the
car will probably be the furthest away and the human will probably
be the closest,'' he said.
	   Johnson waived his customary appearance fee and Chrobotek said
all he wants is a letter of appreciation from event organizers that
he hopes will one day will be displayed in museum devoted to
Johnson.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will hold a trilateral meeting with Israel's premier and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday, the last day of her
current Mideast shuttle.
	   Albright met with Arafat in the Palestinian-run city of Jericho
in the West Bank and held two meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu's office said that a three-way meeting would take
place at 11:00am (09:00gmt) Wednesday at the Erez border crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. There was concern that a planned
trip by Arafat to Moscow for Wednesday would hurt the chances for
such a meeting but the talks would be held early enough to
accommodate his departure.
	   ``We're standing at the possibility of completing a political
process with agreements that were difficult from our point of view,
we know that. But along with that, we said that we'll respect them
on the basis of two principles, one is guaranteeing security and
the second is achieving reciprocity,'' Netanyahu later told members
of his Likud party.
	   Earlier, a Palestinian official said that Albright did not bring
anything from Israel to her Tuesday talks with Arafat.
	   Albright met with both leaders as part of her efforts to bring
the sides closer to completing a deal for a long overdue Israeli
troop withdrawal. If Albright succeeds in bridging remaining gaps
over a U.S. peace initiative, the two Mideast leaders would likely
sign a deal in Washington later this month.
	   ``A trilateral meeting will depend on what Secretary Albright
brings to us from Netanyahu tomorrow. She did not bring anything
from Netanyahu today,'' said a senior Palestinian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Palestinian official said Albright and Arafat discussed
``generalities.'' ``There were no specifics.''
	   Speaking after the Jericho meeting, Albright told reporters that
there were ``tough choices that both sides have to make,'' before
an upcoming Washington summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton
scheduled for October 15-18.
	   ``We reviewed in a comprehensive way all the issues of the
American initiative which (Arafat) has accepted in principle. Our
challenge now is to move forward and to try to reach an
agreement,'' she said.
	   Arafat said he hoped the secretary's visit would be one more
step towards the settling of all remaining issues between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   Time is running out between the sides to resolve a host of
disputes such as the status of Jerusalem, which both peoples claim
as their capital, Jewish settlements and permanent borders.
	   The current peace accords expire in May 1999, when the
Palestinians had hoped to declare independence. However, Netanyahu
opposes Palestinian statehood and the two sides have been haggling
for more than 18 months over a further Israeli troop redeployment
from West Bank areas, which Israel committed to in a previous
accord.
	   Zvi Hendel, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing coalition
government said Tuesday that Netanyahu had promised to annex large
chunks of West Bank land should Arafat declare statehood. But
Netanyahu's aide, David Bar-Illan said that that was not Israel's
policy. He reiterated however warnings that Israel would counter
such a declaration with unspecified unilateral actions of its own.
	   Israeli officials said the only thing holding up a deal now is
Palestinian agreement to a set of detailed steps to take in
fighting Islamic militants.
	   Arafat's aide, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians had not been
shown Israel's maps for the proposed pullback. ``I think if there
is a sticking point, that is that Mr. Netanyahu refuses the concept
of reciprocity.''
	   Erekat met with Israeli negotiators to work on unresolved
aspects of the deal while Arafat held talks with CIA
representatives in Gaza.
	   The United States has proposed Israel withdraw from 13 percent
of the area, and after months of negotiating, both sides seem ready
to accept the deal with certain conditions. Israel wants security
guarantees from the Palestinians to strike at Islamic militants who
threaten peace.

Guyanese government dumps dlrs 15 million into market to bolster
</HEADLINE>
currency &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's central bank has dumped more
than dlrs 15 million into local markets to stop a slide in the
country's dollar, a top finance official said Tuesday.
	   Gobind Ganga, director of research for the Bank of Guyana, said
authorities eased funds into the markets late Monday in an attempt
to ease an 8 percent slump caused mainly by a lack of new foreign
investment and declining revenues from rice, sugar, gold timber and
bauxite.
	   ``Yes, we have intervened,'' Ganga said. ``We don't know how
long a way this will go, but we are monitoring the situation.''
	   The bank hinted last week that it might move to shore up the
currency if the exchange rate continued to worsen. The move
followed intense lobbying from businesses.
	   The injection resulted in a drop in the daily exchange rate.
Licensed currency exchange centers and banks bought the U.S. dollar
for 150 Guyanese dollars, down from about 162 last week.
	   Ganga said the bank is trying to stabilize the exchange rate
until revenues from rice and sugar exports begin to arrive later
this month.
	   The government has blamed street violence following December
elections for scaring away many investors. A deal with a Canadian
company to sell the country's electric utility also fell through
because of the unrest.
	   Falling rice prices and a drought earlier this year caused by
the El Nino weather phenomenon devastated the agricultural sector.
The drought also hurt gold production as rivers used to ship
materials to small-scale mines dried up.
	   Timber exports to Asia have also dropped off because of economic
problems in the Far East. Stacks of fresh lumber now sit unsold on
piers and in warehouses, and timber companies from Malaysia, South
Korea and China are asking for tax breaks to stay afloat.
	   The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained last
week that foreign suppliers are now demanding payment in cash
rather than by line of credit because they are losing faith in the
currency's strength.

Swissair working on further compensation for Flight 111 families
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three grafs at the end to add context about
liability limits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking at
making payments of up to dlrs 137,000 to families of those killed
in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a spokesman for the airline
said Tuesday.
	   The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability
under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any
responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.
	   No date could be given for payments, which would be deductible
from a future settlement, he added. Exact entitlements have yet to
be established.
	   All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York to
Geneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea off
Peggy's Cove. The causes of the crash have not been determined.
	   Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families an
immediate dlrs 20,000 payment to cover their expenses. More than
130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.
	   Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years have
opted out of a dlrs 75,000 liability cap for people killed or
injured during international flights.
	   The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been served
with a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former U.S. boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiring
problems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ a possible cause of
the accident _ and did little to correct them.
	   Both Swissair and its partner, Delta Air Lines, agreed just a
few years ago to lift the limit on compensation for people killed
or injured during international flights.
	   Without that voluntary action, a cap of dlrs 75,000 per
passenger would apply under a 1966 international treaty, unless the
victim's family could prove in court that the airline was guilty of
willful misconduct _ such as poor maintenance or breached security.
	   In the case of Swissair Flight 111, the victims were from 15
countries, so the liability limits will be decided based on the
laws of those 15 countries.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors warned Tuesday
that they may never know if Iraq has completely rid itself of
weapons of mass destruction because of Baghdad's decision to halt
cooperation with inspectors.
	   But the inspectors disputed a proposal by the U.N. chief to end
the current impasse. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed
making inspectors responsible for proving that Iraq still has
weapons of mass destruction.
	   The proposal, which Iraq has long demanded, would reverse the
burden of disclosure that was placed on Baghdad by the Security
Council in its resolutions, the inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission argued in a major six-month review of their work.
	   Annan had floated the idea in an effort to persuade Iraq to
reverse its decision to stop cooperation with inspectors.
	   The Aug. 5 decision has essentially stopped spot inspections of
suspected weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied
by Iraqi escorts.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has been in New York for
over a week to discuss Annan's proposal for a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's seven-year effort to rid itself of its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   On Tuesday, Aziz told reporters that he hadn't yet received the
necessary guarantees he needed to move forward with the
comprehensive review, indicating that Baghdad was not yet prepared
to reverse its decision and allow inspectors to resume their work.
	   ``There are some games of procrastination, and those elements
are of course disturbing,'' Aziz said.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   A review of Iraq's progress, according to Annan's proposal,
would clearly state what information the council needs in order to
declare Iraq free of its weapons of mass destruction _ and when
Iraq could expect that declaration.
	   Annan clearly stated that inspectors, and not Iraq, should
provide evidence to back up their allegations that Iraq still has
proscribed weapons.
	   In their report, U.N. inspectors noted that because of Iraq's
decision to halt cooperation, they had been unable to conduct spot
searches for two full months _ a third of the period under review.
	   Because of Iraq's defiance, ``the council may need to consider,
at some stage, that the effect of these actions by Iraq may prove
that the commission is obliged to conclude that it is unable to
provide 100 percent verification,'' that Iraq has destroyed all its
banned weapons, the inspectors said.
	   They repeated previous statements that they were close to
declaring that Iraq had complied with resolutions regarding its
chemical weapons and missiles, though they noted that they are
still awaiting final results of tests looking for the deadly nerve
agent VX on Iraqi missile warheads.
	   In addition, questions remained as to Iraq's biological weapons
program, the report says, in urging that Iraq make a full
disclosure about its weapons.
	   The report cites the biological problem as the reason why Iraq
and not inspectors should still be responsible for making
disclosures about proscribed weapons.
	   For nearly four years, Iraq failed to tell inspectors that it
had a biological weapons program, the inspectors said. Baghdad
finally did so when forced to, but its reports since then have been
``neither credible nor verifiable.''
	   How then could inspectors be asked to prove what Iraq has
refused to divulge, the inspectors asked in their report. Iraq
should continue to be responsible for providing all information
about its banned weapons programs, as called for by U.N.
resolutions, the inspectors argued.

Lawyer says Chretien, Suharto should testify at APEC inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien
and deposed Indonesian leader Suharto should be required to testify
at an inquiry into police suppression of protests at an
Asia-Pacific summit, a lawyer said Tuesday.
	   Joe Arvay, lawyer for a student protester who was detained
during last year's summit in Vancouver, said Chretien doesn't merit
special treatment that would allow him to avoid testifying about
police handling of the demonstrators.
	   A three-member inquiry commission plans to hear from more than
120 witnesses over the next six months as it seeks to determine
whether the Royal Canadian Mounted Police acted appropriately when
officers pepper-sprayed and arrested dozens of protesters during
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last November.
	   Suharto, who earlier this year was forced from office, was the
protesters' main target because of his questionable human rights
record. He reportedly had sought assurances from the Canadian
government that protests against him would be curtailed.
	   Chretien has denied exerting any improper influence on police to
suppress protests or to shield Suharto from embarrassment. He has
indicated he would resist testifying before the inquiry panel,
although two of his top aides will appear.
	   ``For some reason, we're treating the prime minister with kid
gloves,'' Arvay said. ``He's not entitled to any special
treatment.''
	   The inquiry panel has said it would considering issuing a
summons to Chretien later if it decides he has crucial evidence to
offer.

FDA panel backs hepatitis B pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Government advisers recommended approval
Tuesday of the first oral therapy for liver-destroying hepatitis B
_ a drug now used to fight AIDS.
	   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously
that Epivir, better known as 3TC, can help protect patients' livers
from the hepatitis B virus.
	   But hepatitis patients need to take lower doses of Epivir than
patients who have the HIV virus that causes AIDS. If the FDA
approves the drug's new use, Glaxo Wellcome Inc. would sell the
appropriate dose under the brand name Epivir HBV.
	   The FDA is not bound by advisory committee recommendations, but
usually follows them.
	   But the advisory committee cautioned that no one yet knows how
long hepatitis patients should take the drug, which was studied for
just a year, or whether it helps patients with advanced hepatitis.
	   Epivir cannot cure hepatitis B, a virus that infects an
estimated 1 million Americans. But it appears to target an enzyme
important for the virus's reproduction, lowering the amount of
hepatitis in patients' blood and improving the liver's health.
	   The only current FDA-approved treatment for hepatitis B is
injected interferon.
	   In one study of Americans with mild to moderate infection, 55
percent who took Epivir showed improvement when doctors took liver
biopsies, vs. 25 percent of patients who took a dummy pill.
	   Doctors would have to test hepatitis patients for HIV before
prescribing the drug, because patients with double infections would
need the higher HIV dose, said FDA's Dr. Heidi Jolson. Also, no one
is sure whether stopping Epivir could cause a dangerous hepatitis
flare-up, she said.

Players plead their case: `We're not on strike'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ On the day National Basketball
Association training camps were supposed to open, dozens of players
around the country took their case to the public Tuesday with a
simple message: We are not to blame.
	   ``We're here to show the public that we, as players, want to
play,'' union president Patrick Ewing said. ``We just want
everybody to know that the players want the season to start on
time.''
	   Ewing spoke in a parking lot outside the New York Knicks'
practice facility _ which was indeed locked _ as part of a media
blitz that was unprecedented for a union that historically has been
considered disorganized and weak.
	   In all, players appeared at 14 training camp sites and NBA
arenas in an attempt to influence public opinion over a labor
battle that has grown increasingly acrimonious since the lockout
began July 1 when the collective bargaining agreement expired.
	   Talks are scheduled to resume Thursday, and an agreement must be
reached in a few days to prevent the cancellation of regular-season
games for the first time in league history. The NBA already has
canceled the entire exhibition season.
	   ``They locked us out. It's not like we're on strike,'' said
Rockets free agent Mario Elie, one of several players who have been
working out together at Houston's Westside Tennis Club.
``Everybody's got to get that corrected. It's not on us. The onus
is on them. They're the ones that closed us down.''
	   Seattle center Jim McIlvaine spoke outside the Bucks' locked
practice facility in Racine, Wis., where players stood in the rain.
	   ``I was more optimistic than pessimistic over the summer, but
lately that's turned around,'' he said. ``This Thursday's meeting
will be big. The only way we're going to get the season started on
time.''
	   But such a dramatic turn seems highly unlikely with the sides
far apart on the main economic issues. In a league with almost dlrs
2 billion in annual revenues, the owners want to install a ``hard''
salary cap system with an absolute limit on how much money is paid
to players.
	   The players, meanwhile, want to keep as much of the old system
intact as possible, including the so-called ``Larry Bird
exception'' that allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain
their own free agents. Such a rule allowed Michael Jordan to make
dlrs 33 million last season when the cap was dlrs 26.9 million.
	   The NBA did not immediately comment.
	   ``We're battling an enormous P.R. machine,'' said free agent
Steve Kerr, one of only two members of the defending champion
Chicago Bulls to appear at Berto Center in suburban Deerfield,
Illinois, where the Bulls practice.
	   ``I don't expect any sympathy at all from anybody,'' Kerr said.
``The fact is, though, we're the 400 top people in our profession
in the entire world and we're in a billion-dollar industry. There
is no reason why we should be restricted in what we're making while
the owners are cashing in.''

Agassi wins, Korda loses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Agassi-Federer match &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi gave
17-year-old Swiss star Roger Federer a tennis lesson on Tuesday,
brushing aside the Wimbledon junior champion in the first round of
the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors 6-3, 6-2.
	   Australian Open champion Petr Korda was less successful,
becoming the only seeded casualty of the opening day, losing 6-2,
6-4 to Germany's Nicolas Kiefer.
	   Agassi, who won each of his four titles this year without
dropping a set, needed just 55 minutes to dispose of the U.S. Open
junior finalist, breaking Federer's opening serve in each set.
	   ``I took control of the match, and stayed in control,'' said
Agassi, who lost to Marcelo Rios in the finals at Munich last
weekend. ``I got a little careless and he broke back but then I got
it together again.
	   ``It was nice to get that first match in to get used to the
court. From here I intend to step it up as the tournament goes
on.''
	   A good result at the tournament could cement Agassi's place
among the top-eight in the ATP standings, and get the American a
berth in the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany, next
month.
	   Kiefer next will play lucky-loser Jeff Tarango of the United
States, who beat France's Nicolas Escude 6-3, 6-3.
	   In other first-round play, fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia defeated Sweden's Magnus Norman 7-5, 6-3.
	   Sixth-seed Tim Henman recorded a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over
Australian Jason Stoltenberg, preserving his chances for a berth in
Hanover.
	   Hometown favorite Marc Rosset defeated Germany's Tommy Haas 7-6
(7-3), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4).

Claims of common graves fuel debate over hurricane toll in
</HEADLINE>
Dominican &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSE MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Authorities were
investigating claims Tuesday that at least 21 hurricane victims _
possibly many more _ were buried in common graves in a
flood-ravaged western Dominican town.
	   Bienvenido Mascaro, president of a neighborhood association in
San Juan de la Maguana, said he had buried 21 bodies in a common
grave after Hurricane Georges flooded the town on Sept. 22, the
Listin Diario newspaper reported.
	   ``There are other common graves, but we don't know where they
are,'' Mascaro said.
	   A government disaster commission was investigating Mascaro's
claims.
	   Georges killed at least 76 people in San Juan de la Maguana, a
farming town of 20,000 about 75 miles (125 kilometers) west of
Santo Domingo. Nationwide, the official death toll stood at 267
Tuesday, with about 100 missing.
	   Some San Juan residents say the government's number of missing
is too low, and relief workers suspect more victims are buried
under mud, rocks and debris. Flooding prevented rescuers from
reaching San Juan de la Maguana by land for six days after the
storm.
	   The Dominican army said Monday it would conduct a census of the
town's residents to get a more precise count of the number of
victims.
	   More than 100,000 Dominicans remained homeless Tuesday.
	   The United States and other nations have shipped tons of
emergency supplies to the Caribbean nation. Some of those supplies
were being stored in warehouses in Santo Domingo because damaged
roads and a shortage of trucks slowed distribution, said social
services director Emigdio Sosa.
	   Hurricane Georges swept over the Dominican Republic on its way
to Cuba and the United States. The storm killed at least 430 people
in the Caribbean.

Cone is Yankees' comeback kid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone usually has the biggest crowds in
front of his locker in the Yankees' clubhouse.
	   Always glib, even after a loss, Cone often is asked to describe
what is running through his teammates' minds.
	   Before the opener of the American League championship series,
with talk of revenge on the airwaves and the back pages, he thought
back to last year's first-round loss and explained New York's
motivation:
	   ``If we had gotten by Cleveland, maybe we could have gotten to
the World Series and we'd be thinking about three in a row,'' he
said. ``Maybe it's the reason we won 114 games and we're in the
position we are in now. Maybe it was a slap in the face.''
	   Yet, he overlooked one major factor: himself.
	   The David Cone of 1998 is far superior to the David Cone of
1997, chased by Cleveland after just 3 1-3 innings of the
postseason opener. A few weeks later, he had shoulder surgery for
the second time in 18 months.
	   This year, Cone won 20 games for the first time since 1988 with
the Mets, the longest gap ever between 20-win seasons in the major
leagues. He is a leader, on and off the field, for the team that
set an American League record with 114 wins.
	   ``He is a gamer,'' said David Wells, who started Tuesday night's
opener. ``I think you can learn a lot from a veteran pitcher like
him.''
	   Last Friday, Cone won the first-round clincher against Texas,
allowing just two hits in 5 2-3 shutout innings before the 3-hour
rain delay. Yankees manager Joe Torre then decided to flip flop
Cone and Andy Pettitte in the rotation, starting Cone on Wednesday
night in Game 2 against Cleveland.
	   ``If we get to Game 6, he would pitch with an extra day, which
we have had good luck with,'' Torre said. ``And the fact that if it
is cold here, it is going to be colder in Cleveland. Even though he
doesn't think that is a problem for him.''
	   Both before and after he had an aneurysm in his right shoulder
repaired in May 1996, Cone felt tingling in his fingers, especially
in cold weather.
	   While young guns such as Pettitte throw hard between starts,
Cone babies his 35-year-old right arm, the one that struck out 209
batters in 207 2-3 innings.
	   In the twilight Wednesday _ the game is scheduled for 4:08 p.m.
_ his fastball and splitter should be especially effective.
	   ``I'm saving every bullet I've got,'' he said.

	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ The Green Bay Packers, humbled by
the Minnesota Vikings in their own backyard, limp into their bye
week with bruised egos and battered bodies, courtesy of the new
kings of the NFC Central.
	   ``Whenever you lose going into the bye week it's a bad thing,
because you have so much time to think about it,'' defensive tackle
Santana Dotson said.
	   At least they've got extra time to recover physically and
regroup from the psychological pain of their 37-24 whipping at the
hands of the Minnesota Vikings.
	   Coach Mike Holmgren is giving his players four days off. They'll
return Sunday to begin preparing for a Thursday night game at
Detroit, where they never seem to play well.
	   And they sorely need the time off.
	   The list of casualties from Monday night's loss that snapped
their 29-game home winning streak includes wide receiver Derrick
Mayes, who tore ligaments in his right knee returning a punt late
in the game.
	   Mayes was in because Roell Preston had cramps. It was a curious
call by Holmgren, what with flanker Robert Brooks hurting. Brooks
hasn't practiced in three weeks and is limited in games because of
soreness in his post-operative back. Now, Bill Schroeder is the No.
3 receiver.
	   The Packers also lost their backup quarterback, Doug Pederson,
for six weeks with a broken jaw, courtesy of cornerback Corey
Fuller, who blitzed with under a minute left and the Vikings up by
20.
	   He smashed Pederson on the chin with his helmet as the
quarterback released a touchdown pass. The Packers expect Fuller to
be fined by the NFL.
	   Linebacker George Koonce sustained a severe hamstring pull,
tight end Jeff Thomason got a concussion, safety LeRoy Butler
sprained an ankle and was walking with a crutch on Monday.
	   ``It always seems like when you lose big, you lose players,
too,'' said safety Pat Terrell, who bruised his ribs.
	   ``Yeah, we lost all the way around,'' receiver Antonio Freeman
said.
	   And how will the Pack recover from what backup quarterback
Randall Cunningham called ``the greatest night in my football
career?''
	   ``We have to bounce back, we can't play like this anymore,''
Reggie White declared.
	   The ineptitude wasn't limited to the defense.
	   The Packers failed to convert a fourth-and-inches for the third
time in two weeks, and Brett Favre threw three interceptions for
the second straight week.
	   ``Well, he hasn't had to bounce back too much the last few
years,'' Holmgren said. ``He's a tough guy mentally. He's going to
be fine. The team's going to be fine. Last night, we just got it
taken to us pretty good.''
	   The Packers were torched by the lethal combination of no pass
rush and a suspect secondary. That allowed Cris Carter, Randy Moss
and Jake Reed to combine for 17 receptions for 398 yards and three
long touchdowns.
	   The defense, which prided itself on not allowing big plays, gave
up six receptions of 30 yards or more, including touchdowns of 56,
52 and 44 yards to go along with a 24-yard score on a screen pass.

Cunningham carries Vikings to 5-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARGARET TAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minnesota (AP) _ Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis
Green swears that Brad Johnson's job is safe _ no matter how many
touchdown passes Randall Cunningham throws.
	   In the Vikings' biggest game this season, a Monday night matchup
with fellow unbeaten Green Bay, Cunningham threw for 442 yards and
four touchdowns in a 37-24 victory.
	   The 35-year-old backup was named NFC offensive player of the
week for the second straight week. He's thrown 10 touchdowns
without an interception since taking over for Johnson, who broke a
bone in his lower right leg Sept. 13 against St. Louis.
	   Despite Cunningham's success _ he's the leading passer in the
National Football League with a 127.8 rating and just the third
quarterback in team history to throw for four touchdowns in
consecutive games _ Green said Cunningham has chosen his role as a
backup.
	   ``Randall Cunningham has already been to the top of the
mountain,'' Green said. ``This kind of accolade and this type of
publicity he's getting is nothing new to Randall Cunningham. How
he's handling it, he feels, is what's new.''
	   At his weekly news conference at the Vikings' training facility,
Green tried to head off any question of who the No. 1 quarterback
is.
	   ``He had a choice to make two times, not once. He made a choice
in 1997 and he had a chance to make another choice in 1998 on the
role that he played for the Minnesota Vikings,'' Green said,
referring to Cunningham signing with the team.
	   ``The role he chose was to be a backup quarterback and play when
needed and help us to win.''
	   Johnson may get his walking cast off this week and might be back
for the Oct. 25 game against Detroit, Green said. The Vikings (5-0)
are off this weekend and then play Oct. 18 at home against
Washington.
	   The Vikings didn't miss Johnson against Green Bay, a game in
which the Vikings badly needed to mount a strong passing attack,
Green said.
	   ``We were hoping that we could throw the ball simply because of
their style of defense: physical, big,'' he said. ``It's very
difficult to run against the Green Bay Packers and you're not going
to have a lot of success.''
	   Rookie Randy Moss caught five passes for 190 yards and two
touchdowns, the third highest yardage total in team history. He
leads the NFL with 463 receiving yards and leads the NFC in
touchdowns with six.
	   Minnesota is one of only three unbeatens left in the league.
Green rates his club and Jacksonville (4-0) a notch below Denver
(5-0), the defending Super Bowl champions.
	   ``Denver right now is clearly ... playing with about as much
confidence as any team I've seen in a while,'' he said.
	   ``And I think Jacksonville has not been as clean with their 4-0
record, but they're very confident and very gritty. I think we
probably resemble more Jacksonville than Denver right now in that
Denver has had very smooth sailing, just rolling over everybody,
and Jacksonville has had to fight, claw for everything they're
getting. And that's the way we've been.''
	   ``We like the 5-0, but it's not been an easy 5-0.''
	   Several Vikings sustained minor injuries Monday night, but Green
said none were expected to miss the Redskins game.

Shell series off to wonderful start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Throughout the years, the concept has
never changed: two great players, one unforgettable course and an
intriguing story. With that, Shell's Wonderful World of Golf gets
off to a good start in its fifth year of the modern era.
	   The series began Tuesday night on ESPN with Fred Couples against
Ernie Els, the two players whose attitudes are as smooth and easy
as their swings.
	   ``When I look at him, I see a lot of myself,'' Couples said.
	   And if that's not enough, how about a possible preview of the
Presidents Cup?
	   This is what executive producer Terry Jastrow, a seven-time Emmy
Award winner, had in mind when he ran into Shell executives in 1993
and bounced around the idea of bringing the series back to life.
	   ``It was completely off the cuff,'' Jastrow recalled.
	   The original series, taped between 1961-70, contained 92 games
in 58 countries featuring the best of golf, from Ben Hogan and Sam
Snead to Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. The series was relaunched
in 1994 with three matches, followed by five matches each of the
next four years for a total of 115 episodes.
	   ``I don't know how some guys cannot want to be a part of a
Shell's match,'' Couples said. ``Thirty years from now, they'll
make such a huge impact.''
	   And who knows? Maybe 30 years from now, Couples will still be
undefeated.
	   He already has beaten Raymond Floyd, Greg Norman and Tom Watson.
His match against Els took place on the Nicklaus North course in
Whistler, British Columbia. ``The greatest place I've been to play
golf,'' Couples said.
	   He finally put Els away with a 5-iron on the 225-yard 17th hole
that rolled by the hole and stopped 2 feet (0.6 meters) away.
	   Other matches on tap this year are Davis Love III and Justin
Leonard at Winged Foot, a replay of the final round of the 1997 PGA
Championship; Tom Lehman against Phil Mickelson; and Payne Stewart
vs. Nick Price.
	   It concludes with Jack Nicklaus squaring off against Gary
Player, a match that will be played this month at the World Golf
Village.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BACK TO SCHOOL: &LR;  Her brilliant amateur career is fast being
forgotten. So are the comparisons to Tiger Woods.
	   Kelli Kuehne was billed as the female Tiger when she won
back-to-back U.S. Amateur titles and signed a Nike deal even before
she qualified for the LPGA Tour. But her rookie reason was
unremarkable _ she never finished better than 20th in a tournament
and wound up 124th on the money list with dlrs 39,831.
	   ``I got knocked off my horse pretty early in the season,''
Keuhne said.
	   She'll try to get back on this week in the final stage of
Q-school on the LPGA International Course, one of 130 players
trying to get an estimated 25 full-exempt cards.
	   Others going for full-exempt status are three-time All-American
and former NCAA champion Maris Baena, 1997 NCAA champion Heather
Bowie and Silvia Cavalleri, who won the 1997 U.S. Women's Amateur.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CVS RETURN: &LR;  New England won't have a PGA Tour event next year,
but golf is still in the picture. Favorite sons Billy Andrade and
Brad Faxon will be hosts of a dlrs 1 million, 36-hole team event
that will be played the first week of August at Rhode Island
Country Club.
	   The name should sound familiar _ the CVS Charity Classic.
	   The Classic was dumped as a tour event after 30 years when a new
agreement on dates couldn't be reached.
	   ``We've been working on this for about five months,'' said Tom
Ryan, president and CEO of CVS. ``We brought the idea to Brad and
Billy and they were excited about it because they were concerned
that we wouldn't have any golf in New England.''
	   The two-man teams will be composed of players from the PGA and
Senior tours, along with international players. Invitations will go
out in November and December.
	   ``Billy and I have made such great friendships on the tour and
significant dollars are involved,'' Faxon said. ``I don't think
there's any way guys are going to refuse.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CASEY UPDATE: &LR;  Casey Martin faces another tough road: finishing
in the top 15 on the Nike Tour money list to get his PGA Tour card
for next year.
	   Martin continued his free fall in San Jose, Calif., last week
with a tie for 45th. He now is 27th on the money list and probably
will need to win once or finish in the top three in the two
remaining tournaments.
	   That looks doubtful considering his recent play. Since winning
in Lakeland, Fla., to start the year, Martin has been in the top 10
just twice and has either missed the cut or been outside the top 20
in 12 of his last 19 Nike events.
	   Making it even more difficult is that Martin is having to play
five straight weeks to make up ground, a burden on his weakened
right leg.
	   ``I suppose I'm trying too hard,'' Martin said. ``I really want
it to happen. Since I won the first tournament of the year, I don't
want to blow it.''
	   If he fails to finish in the top 15 on the money list, Martin
says he will return to Q-school.

Trial begins for Brazilian police officer videotaped beating and
</HEADLINE>
shooting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A former police officer caught on
amateur videotape last year beating and shooting at motorists has
pleaded innocent to murder charges.
	   Otavio Lourenco Gambra told the court Tuesday that while he
fired the fatal shot that killed Mario Jose Josinho, he did not
mean to hit him.
	   ``I only wanted to fire a warning shot, but without the least
intention of killing Josinho,'' Gambra said.
	   This is the second trial for Gambra, nicknamed Rambo, who was
convicted in a special military court in August and sentenced to
three years and eight months for abuse of authority and infliction
of bodily harm. The current trial, before a civilian court, is
expected to conclude Thursday.
	   In March 1997, the nation was shocked by images of Gambra and
seven other police officers torturing and extorting money from
drivers at a roadblock on the outskirts of Sao Paulo.
	   Footage showed police striking one man's feet and back with
nightsticks for three minutes before letting him and two others
return to their car.
	   As the car pulls away, Gambra can be seen in the videotape
firing two shots. One of those shots allegedly killed Mario Jose
Josinho, a 27-year-old mechanic in the back seat.

Leewards defeats U.S. in Red Stripe opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Leeward Islands made a rousing start in
the defense of their Red Stripe Bowl cricket crown with a 242-run
win Tuesday over minnows the United States in the opening Group B
at Kensington Park.
	   The Leewards, bolstered by a strong first wicket stand between
debutant Wilden Cornwall and captain Stuart Williams, posted a
record 330 for four wickets in their 50 overs.
	   Their fearsome pace attack, spearheaded by fastbowler Anthony
Lake, then destroyed the American batting for a mere 88 in 28
overs.
	   Lake finished with five wickets for 41 runs from overs. Only
Wayne Headley made any score for the U.S., leading the way with 29.
	   The Leewards stroked their way to the highest total in a
regional one-day game thanks to superb batting from Cornwall who
cracked 126 and Williams who hit a sparkling 82 in an opening stand
of 187.
	   The pair plundered the tame American bowling and were separated
in the 30th over when Williams was caught off fastbowler Richard
Lewis. The Nevisian's enterprising innings came off only 90
deliveries and included eight boundaries.
	   Cornwall, from Antigua, was also in attacking mood, belting 14
boundaries and two sixes off only 122 balls. In all, he batted for
155 minutes.
	   West Indies discard Keith Arthurton, who made 38, and Sylvester
Joseph who finished unbeaten on 29, also got among the runs.
	   Action in Group B continues Wednesday with hosts Jamaica playing
the USA.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. envoy failed again
Tuesday to convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept
international demands to end the crackdown in Kosovo, raising the
prospects of NATO airstrikes.

Neither U.S. nor Yugoslav officials issued any detailed statement
about the talks.
	   But a diplomatic source familiar with the deliberations said
there was ``no change'' in Milosevic's stand.
	   ``Kosovo is more important to him than Bosnia,'' the source said
on condition of anonymity. ``The American people do not understand
that because Bosnia was so much bloodier.''

Diamond in the rough? Greg Norman testifies he was ripped off by
</HEADLINE>
jeweler &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Golfer Greg Norman was reportedly
tricked by a friend into buying junk jewelry for his wife worth
only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he paid, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the poor quality trinkets included a
Valentine's Day diamond bracelet and a brooch in the shape of his
trademark, the Great White Shark.
	   ``The probably more emotionally killed me than anything else
because I spent a lot of time designing it,'' Norman testified in a
Florida court.
	   The two pieces were among six presents Norman gave his wife
Laura, which cost him more than 500,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 290,000), the paper said.
	   It said an independent assayer reported the jewelry contained
``diamonds of poor quality and lower weights, irradiated or painted
to change colors, drilled and filled to disguise flaws.''
	   Norman's comments came in a testimony contained in pre-trial
court papers released in Florida on Tuesday, the paper said.
	   The evidence was taken in a 60 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 35 million) lawsuit by Detroit television station owner Aben
Johson against Florida jeweler Jack Hasson, who is known as diamond
dealer to the stars.
	   His clients include film producer Steven Spielberg and golfer
Jack Nicklaus, and many corporate clients.
	   Norman has no ongoing legal action against Hasson, and was
deposed for evidence in Johnson's civil suit

	   The source said Holbrooke was expected to meet Milosevic again
Wednesday in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to avoid a
NATO attack. The United States has threatened military action
unless Milosevic calls off his bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian
rebels seeking independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 peace agreement which ended
the Bosnian conflict, met the Yugoslav president after a visit to
Kosovo. Following a meeting with ethnic Albanian leaders, Holbrooke
said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong presence,
despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict
and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters in the Kosovo capital Pristina.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Moving closer to NATO airstrikes,
the United States told Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
he has failed to show the West he really means to end his harsh
crackdown in Kosovo province. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met
Milosevic for the second day Tuesday after visiting the southern
Serbian province, where Yugoslav forces were battling ethnic
Albanian rebels seeking independence. In Washington, U.S. President
Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was telling the Yugoslav leader that
NATO is prepared to act if Milosevic fails to honor U.N.
resolutions ordering him to withdraw from areas of conflict and
allow a political settlement. He warned that, unchecked, Serb
violence in the province could lead to instability throughout the
region. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton urged world economic
powers Tuesday to take ``urgent steps'' to limit the turmoil that
has roiled global markets. He said the violence of boom-and-bust
cycles must be contained. Addressing financial officials from 182
countries at the International Monetary Fund's annual meetings,
Clinton used his strongest language yet to describe the need for
all countries to do their part to calm an economic crisis that has
sent U.S. stock prices plummeting and pushed one-third of the world
into recession. Behind the scenes, Clinton administration officials
worked feverishly on a number of fronts. The White House confirmed
that preliminary discussions were under way on an emergency
economic summit in London next month, suggested by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged Russians to
remain calm during the country's economic crisis, assuring them
there would no shortage of basic foods and that wages and pensions
would be paid. ``The populace will be fully provided with
vegetables, fruit and potatoes,'' Primakov said in an appeal
broadcast on Russian television the night before nationwide
protests scheduled for Wednesday. Primakov's statement came
Tuesday, hours after a top official delivered a litany of
depressing economic predictions, telling Russians already
discouraged by high prices and shortages that they could face
higher inflation and a sharp drop in imports this year.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
says he will wait to appoint a successor to ousted Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month. Last week,
Mahathir, 72, said he could ``drop dead'' at any time, fueling
speculation that he was about to announce a deputy. A former
heir-apparent to Mahathir, Anwar was fired Sept. 2, accused of
being morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy was a threat
to his 17-year rule. Anwar was arrested after two weeks of
nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and
Mahathir's resignation. ``We decided not to fill the vacancy until
the next election,'' Mahathir said early Wednesday after a meeting
of United Malays National Organization Party leaders.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   KENEMA, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Government-allied fighters clad in
dresses and women's wigs ambushed barefooted rebels in densely
forested eastern Sierra Leone, killing at least 52 renegades and
wounding many others, militia officers said. Kamajor soldiers laid
a trap for the rebels late Monday on a road near Mandekelema
village, 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the Liberian border, staff
officer Francis Silikie said Tuesday. The Kamajors, volunteer
fighters ranging in age from 8 to 60, have declared a ``patriotic
war'' against the rebels in this West African country. Dozens of
Kamajor battalions have begun massing at headquarters in the
eastern town of Kenema for a collective drive against the rebels.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks escaped with a small gain, but
most stocks turned lower Tuesday after a morning rally as investors
remained skeptical about this week's multinational talks on healing
the global economy. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 16.74 points _ or by 0.2 percent _ at 7,742.98 after
shedding an early 154-point gain and briefly dipping into negative
territory. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that the
worldwide financial crisis can be resolved with concerted global
action, but cautioned that the turmoil could spread unless urgent
steps are taken. ``I am confident that if we act together we can
end the present crisis,'' the president told a joint meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. ``We must take
urgent steps to help those who have been hurt by it, to limit the
reach of it and to restore confidence in the global economy.'' He
said cycles of boom and bust in the global marketplace must be
contained, in part by more openness among governments and a
willingness by developing nations to act swiftly to reform their
economies. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem said Tuesday
that he expects international lenders to complete a dlrs 30 billion
loan package for Brazil by next week. He also said that the package
would be expanded to include credit lines for other Latin American
nations feeling the effects of the global financial crisis. Brazil,
Latin America's largest economy, is the latest country to come
under siege from panicky international investors. A severe economic
crisis would hit neighboring Argentina hard because Brazil is its
biggest trading partner. (IMF-ARGENTINA)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing conservative
government claimed credit Tuesday for the lowest jobless figure in
nearly two years. But the incoming center-left coalition said the
figure _ 3.96 million _ was still too high. Unemployment nationwide
now averages 10.3 percent, compared to 11.2 percent this time last
year, the Federal Labor Office said. In a familiar pattern since
Germany was unified in 1990, joblessness in the former communist
East Germany _ a whopping 16.3 percent _ dragged up the figure
across the country. Unemployment in the former West Germany was 8.8
percent. Joblessness, stuck above 4 million since November 1996,
was a key reason for the defeat of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
national elections last week, won by the Social Democrats on
promises to put Germans back to work. (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Carlson Cos. plans to merge its leisure
travel business in the United Kingdom with Thomas Cook's worldwide
leisure travel and financial services business, the companies said
Tuesday. The merged company would operate 32 airplanes and carry
more than 2.5 million leisure travelers annually on packaged tours.
Its services would be sold through a network of 800 travel
agencies. Westdeutsche Landesbank, Thomas Cook's parent company,
would own a majority share in the merged company, co-owned by
Carlson and operating under the name Thomas Cook. Both companies
are privately held. (US-THOMAS COOK-CARLSON)
	   PARIS (AP) _ France Telecom and IBM will develop a new machine
that seeks to combine the best features of the PC and the Minitel
to allow improved access to the Internet, the companies said
Tuesday. The Minitel, a screen and keyboard console linked to the
telephone, has since 1983 given users access to a variety of
information services in France. But its Internet access has been
limited to E-mail messages. About 15 million people use more than 6
million Minitel terminals, which can be rented for as little as 22
francs (dlrs 5.60) a month. Users won't be able to access the
Internet via the current Minitels, but the new computer, to be
tested next year, will offer the best features of both, the
companies said. (FRANCE-MINITEL)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange closed sharply higher Tuesday, rebounding a day after the
bourse's sharpest plunge in a year and a half. The 27-share AEX
index closed up 48.87 points, or 5.9 percent, to 878.18 after
soaring in the late afternoon on the back of a strong opening on
Wall Street. Tuesday's best performer was Dutch-Belgian financial
services group Fortis. Its shares jumped 15 percent after an
announcement late Monday that it was canceling a planned 4 billion
guilder (dlrs 2 billion) stock issue. (NETHERLANDS-STOCKS)

	   Hours after Holbrooke returned to Belgrade, reporters saw about
100 Yugoslav security vehicles of all sorts _ ranging from armored
personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops _ moving outside
Kosovo.
	   It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance with
international demands that his forces pull far back from front-line
areas.
	   Additionally, state-run Serbian TV claimed that all Serbian
special police units, on the forefront of strikes against Kosovo
Albanian militants, were pulled out of the province. Their pullback
was one of the key international demands.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some form of
``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told the Associated Press Television News that the complete
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
	   ``Is there a country in the world that would do so, especially
with an armed rebellion in their hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   The Canadian government announced it was flying out nonessential
diplomatic personnel and their families from Yugoslavia. Other
countries were expected to follow suit.
	   In Jerusalem, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
that because Milosevic continued to resist ``sustainable and
irreversible compliance with the demands of the international
community ... NATO military preparations and discussions and
decision-making continue on a fast track.''
	   Holbrooke was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to be a last-chance effort to persuade Milosevic to
halt his crackdown and enter meaningful talks with ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   But there was no sign of the diplomatic deadlock ending.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve air strikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was set to take up Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch air strikes within
hours of receiving an order to attack. No final decision is
expected until Thursday, when ambassadors of the allied countries
gather for a NATO Council meeting in Brussels.
	   Chirac insisted that the Security Council must authorize any
military intervention, but indicated that the human suffering going
on might be the loophole NATO needs to go in, and that France would
go along with that.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls' former chauffeur has lots of
``tittle-tattle'' for a book and went to court Tuesday seeking
permission to write one.
	   Paul Attridge asked a judge to overturn a gag order granted the
girl group in June. The Spice Girls got the order after a newspaper
story in which Attridge speculated about the reasons for Ginger
Spice Geri Halliwell's departure.
	   Attridge was ordered not to disclose any information about the
Spice Girls' love lives, business affairs or spending habits.
	   The Spice Girls and Halliwell have sought jail time for
Attridge, claiming he violated the order by failing to hand over
confidential material in his possession.
	   Attridge's lawyer, Kevin Garnett, said Attridge has only
``tittle-tattle'' and trivia about the women.
	   There was no word on when a ruling will be issued.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ With a knack for reinventing himself to suit the
times, David Bowie topped the Beatles as the most important music
star of the past 30 years in a poll of his British contemporaries.
	   The London magazine Time Out surveyed pop stars, musicians,
critics and industry figures. Among them: Culture Club's Boy George
and Mick Hucknall of Simply Red. The magazine didn't say how many
people were polled.
	   Bowie, 51, released his first album 31 years ago and has been at
the forefront of glam rock, '70s soul and '80s funk.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Bruce Springsteen took on a British music company
in court Tuesday, seeking to prevent the release of songs from his
early years.
	   Springsteen, who showed up for court in a charcoal gray suit and
dark blue tie, wants an order barring Masquerade Music from putting
out the previously unreleased collection he recorded in 1972.
	   Masquerade said it has rights to the songs through an agreement
with a New York company with whom Springsteen previously had a
relationship. It wants to release the collection on a CD titled
``Before the Fame.''
	   The rocker's lawyer, Nigel Davis, told the court that
Springsteen left most of the songs behind because they didn't meet
his standards.
	   ``This was a matter of tremendous importance to Mr. Springsteen,
and it matters enormously to him that he should retain control of
his artistic output,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The house where Noel Coward lived and wrote much
of his finest work has been designated a place of special
architectural and historic interest.
	   The playwright lived in one of two apartments at 17 Gerald Rd.
in London's chic Chelsea district from 1930 to 1956, when he left
England for tax exile in Bermuda, Switzerland and Jamaica.
	   Coward, who died in 1973, built a stage for rehearsal and put in
paneling, wrought ironwork and a staircase.
	   The house's owner sought the listing, announced Tuesday by Arts
Minister Alan Howarth. It means that any alterations would require
special approval.
	   Coward wrote 50 plays, 25 films and hundreds of songs, poems and
stories. His works include ``Private Lives.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Riccardo Muti was back at the podium
directing the Philadelphia Orchestra five years after his abrupt
departure as music director.
	   In a one-time-only guest appearance, Muti conducted a benefit
concert Monday night for the orchestra's pension fund. He was
greeted with thunderous applause and a standing ovation.
	   From the beginning of his tenure in 1980, Muti seemed ambivalent
about Philadelphia. He never moved to the city and was frustrated
about lack of progress on a new concert hall. He once scolded an
audience for applauding in the wrong spot. He was upset about the
attention lavished on his long black hair.
	   On Saturday, some of the musicians avoided a lunch with Muti,
recalling the slights before his departure _ the canceled concerts
and the long hiatus when he had been expected to serve as conductor
laureate.
	   Muti did not comment on that and said his return was definitely
not for good.
	   ``No _ a position, no, because I am very much involved with La
Scala'' in Milan, he said. ``But what I can do _ because I am part
of the history of this institution for so many years _ anything I
can do to help, I will be ready. Because this orchestra, this city,
is part of my life.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's government will donate
pajamas, fashion accessories and fine suits of former Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to a rural leper colony, a government
official said Tuesday.
	   Mihai Nica said 35 victims of leprosy will also get fur hats,
purses and pullovers that belonged to Ceausescu and his wife Elena,
who were executed in December 1989 after a bloody revolution
toppled them from power.
	   The government plans to auction off other valuable items,
including exotic furs, art objects and a silver medallion with twin
portraits of Elena Ceausescu and Imelda Marcos, the widow of former
Filipino leader Ferdinand Marcos.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: Milosevic's stand.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``Kosovo is more important to him than Bosnia,'' the source said
on condition of anonymity. ``The American people do not understand
that because Bosnia was so much bloodier.''
	   The source said Holbrooke was expected to meet Milosevic again
Wednesday to try again to avoid a NATO attack. The United States
has threatened military action unless Milosevic calls off his
bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence
from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic's seven-month crackdown against the secessionists has
killed hundreds, left tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
homeless and led to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the
bloodshed by striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 peace agreement which ended
the Bosnian conflict, met the Yugoslav president after a visit to
Kosovo. Following a meeting with ethnic Albanian leaders, Holbrooke
said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong presence,
despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict
and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters in the Kosovo capital, Pristina.

Right Livelihood: the other idealistic Swedish prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Awards to be announced at 0800 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ He was wealthy, Swedish and idealistic
_ a close parallel to Alfred Nobel. But Jakob von Uexkull thought
the Nobel Prizes had lost their way, so he decided to found his
own.
	   Now, the Right Livelihood awards _ commonly called the
``alternative Nobels'' _ are gaining some of the respect and notice
given to the Nobels themselves. They are eagerly reported by news
media and presented in a ceremony in the Swedish Parliament. This
year's recipients are to be announced Wednesday.
	   Von Uexkull, a stamp dealer, sold his collection for about dlrs
1 million and started the awards in 1980 to recognize work that he
believed the Nobel Prizes were ignoring. At first the prizes were
regarded as an eccentric fancy, and even subversive, von Uexkull
said.
	   The first year, a major Swedish newspaper speculated on
``whether this was a CIA or a KGB plot to discredit the Nobel
Prizes,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
	   In fact, he said, he first wanted to help the Nobels rather than
found his own prizes.
	   He said he got the idea when he was at a philatelists' meeting
when he was in his 30s and found himself sitting between a very
young dealer and a very old one _ an image of where he had been and
where he was going.
	   ``I hadn't really intended on becoming an old stamp dealer,'' he
said. ``I'd always felt the stamp business was a means to an end.''
	   Noting that the Nobel Foundation had agreed to found the
economics prize, which wasn't specified in Nobel's will, he said he
approached the group with an offer to fund another prize. ``Can I
give them a million dollars and then get on with my life?'' is how
he characterized his thinking at the time.
	   But his idea was turned down and he felt compelled to go it
alone.
	   Since 1980, the awards have recognized a wide range of activists
and alternative scientists, ranging from American anti-chemicals
activist Cindy Duehring _ who's confined to her North Dakota home
because of severe chemical sensitivity _ to the Committee of
Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, the Indian group Science Writers'
Forum of Kerala and Greek homeopathic physician George Vithoulkas.
	   The awards usually go to four recipients a year, dividing up a
prize pool that this year is worth 1.8 million kronor (dlrs
234,000). The winners are chosen by a jury that this year includes
von Uexkull, Richard Jolly of the United Nations Development
Program and Sweden's ambassador to Zambia, Kristina Svensson.
	   The awards aren't given in specific categories. What the winners
have in common is that ``we go more to the root of the problem''
than the Nobel Prizes, which von Uexkull said emphasize the top end
of hierarchies: achievements in conventional science and political
thought.
	   The Nobel Prizes, with their idealistic goals and international
perspective, were revolutionary for Nobel's day, von Uexkull said.
But he thinks they lost some of that vision as they became
world-renowned.
	   In Nobel's time, ``science was unquestioned ... we don't have
that same faith in science'' as a cure for all problems, he said.
	   While the Nobels have become weighted down in ostentatious
banquets and stuffy formality, von Uexkull keeps his Right
Livelihood operation relaxed and frugal.
	   Coming to Stockholm from London, where he now lives _ an
expatriate as Nobel was _ von Uexkull stayed away from the
sprawling Grand Hotel where the Nobel laureates stay, choosing an
obscure hotel with a lobby big enough for only four chairs and a
table.
	   ``I'm not somebody ascetic. I enjoy the good life,'' he said.
	   But he holds back on self-indulgence, remembering that his award
winners are ``people risking much more than I have ever risked.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Belgrade, reporters saw
about 100 Yugoslav military vehicles _ ranging from armored
personnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops _ moving outside
Kosovo. It was an apparent show of Milosevic's compliance with
international demands that his forces pull far back from front-line
areas.
	   Additionally, state-run Serbian television claimed that all
Serbian special police units, on the forefront of strikes against
Kosovo Albanian militants, were pulled out of the province.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Holbrooke was
telling the Yugoslav leader ``what he must do and to make clear
that NATO is prepared to act if President Milosevic fails to honor
the United Nations resolutions.''
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Congress a
pullback of troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward
off NATO attacks. Any such air strikes might be followed by some
form of ``international presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   Cohen justified the prospective use of air power. ``He
(Milosevic) stands to lose a substantial portion of his military
capability ... There is a lot that can and will be done by air,''
Cohen said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province as demanded,
NATO intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President
Jacques Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told Associated Press Television News that a complete withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops is out of question.
	   ``Who in the right mind would do so? Is there a country in the
world that would do so, especially with an armed rebellion in their
hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to be a last-chance diplomatic effort.
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes. No
decision is expected until Thursday, when NATO ambassadors meet in
Brussels.
	   Albania's foreign minister said Tuesday that his country has
offered its ports and airports to NATO for use in any military
operation against neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   ``Albania has offered its support for such actions in Bosnia and
will do so to support NATO's actions in Kosovo,'' Foreign Minister
Paskal Milo told reporters in Albania's capital, Tirana.
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which was to discuss Kosovo later Tuesday.
	   The Canadian government announced Tuesday that it was flying out
nonessential diplomatic personnel and their families from
Yugoslavia. Other countries were expected to follow suit.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic, and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism
Milosevic would adhere to any such plan.
	   ``We are dealing with someone we never trusted,'' Albright said
en route from Washington to Jerusalem, where she was on a Mideast
peace initiative.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose attacks on Serb police
prompted the crackdown, has rejected any peace formula short of
full independence. The KLA has urged NATO to attack.
	   ``The Serbian war machine and its military and political
structure must be destroyed,'' said Adem Demaci, a politician who
speaks for the rebels.

Hungarians hope to be in new government
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The former Communists have dropped
their refusal to cooperate with an ethnic Hungarian party in a
future government, improving the chances for a multiparty coalition
to rule Slovakia for the next four years.
	   Last Friday, the Party of the Democratic Left suddenly announced
it would not enter into a coalition with the Hungarians following
last month's parliamentary elections, in which the combined
opposition won a sufficient majority to form a government and
change the constitution.
	   Reacting to the move, Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian
Coalition Party which represents Slovakia's 550,000 ethnic
Hungarians, threatened to join the opposition if left out of the
coalition.
	   On Monday, however, Bugar said that ``the Party of the
Democratic Left changed its mind, probably because they want to
improve their position in the government.''
	   Jozef Migas, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left,
confirmed Tuesday it no longer opposed an alliance with the
Hungarians.
	   Without the Hungarians, the opposition coalition would hold only
78 seats in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament, far short of the 90
votes needed to make changes to the constitution.
	   Amending the charter was the main objective of all opposition
parties in the campaign leading up to the elections.
	   The Democratic Left's reluctance to cooperate with the
Hungarians was prompted by fears that they might seek regional
autonomy and challenge the validity of the so-called Benes decrees.
	   Under the decrees bearing the name of former President Eduard
Benes, up to 60,000 Hungarians _ alongside millions of ethnic
Germans _ were deported from the territory of Czechoslovakia after
1945 as enemies of the Czech and Slovak people and their property
was confiscated by the state.
	   Bugar said his party did not bring up the Benes' decrees at the
negotiations.
	   ``We want to form a government for four years, and as soon as we
can,'' Migas said. ``We do not want to go back to these questions
when we are in the government,'
	   The negotiations of the four opposition parties will continue on
Thursday when they are to discuss a coalition agreement.

Aziz: No necessary guarantees for comprehensive review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said that it hadn't yet gotten
satisfactory guarantees that the Security Council would conduct an
honest review of U.N. sanctions if Baghdad resumes cooperation with
arms inspectors.
	   Without mentioning Washington by name, Aziz said Tuesday that
the ``disturbing'' statements made by some council members this
week were to blame for the as-yet unresolved dispute.
	   Aziz said that after speaking to 14 of the 15 council members _
the United States excluded _ he had the sense that they were
willing to conduct an honest review.
	   ``But that's not yet unanimous,'' he said. As a result, he told
reporters after meeting with the council president, Jeremy
Greenstock of Britain, Iraq hasn't received the ``complete,
satisfactory guarantees,'' required to move forward.
	   Aziz has been in New York for over a week to try to work out a
deal with the U.N. chief in which Baghdad would reverse its Aug. 5
decision to suspend cooperation with inspectors and in return get a
``comprehensive review'' of its seven-year effort to disarm itself.
	   The review could force the council to recognize Iraq's progress
in destroying its weapons of mass destruction while building
momentum among some council members to ease sanctions on Iraq,
which have deprived it of its most valuable commodity, oil, for
eight years.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan outlined his proposal for a
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance on Monday, and it
appeared to take into account several of Baghdad's key demands.
	   The United States, however, raised objections to several of the
ideas and has noted that the council wasn't obligated to use the
U.N. chief's proposal at all.
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and Britain, in particular, weren't prepared to give
Iraq any details of how a review would be carried out until Iraq
reverses its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with arms
inspectors.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by
Iraqis.
	   Butler issued a six-month report Monday on the progress of U.N.
arms inspections, and warned that because of Iraq's continued
defiance, the council may have to soon acknowledge that it may
never know if Iraq has completely rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   But Butler disputed part of the U.N. chief's proposal to end the
impasse.
	   Annan has proposed making inspectors responsible for proving
that Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the report, Butler said the proposal, which Iraq has long
demanded, would reverse the burden of disclosure that was placed on
Baghdad by the Security Council in its original resolutions.
	   The report cites the still uncertain status of Iraq's biological
program as the reason why Baghdad and not inspectors should still
be responsible for making disclosures about proscribed weapons.
	   For nearly four years, Iraq failed to tell inspectors that it
even had a biological weapons program, the inspectors said. Baghdad
finally did so when shown evidence to the contrary, but its reports
since then have been ``neither credible nor verifiable,'' the
report says.
	   How then could inspectors be asked to prove what Iraq has
refused to divulge, the inspectors asked in their report. Iraq
should continue to be responsible for providing all information
about its banned weapons programs, as called for by U.N.
resolutions, the inspectors argued.

Diamond in the rough? Greg Norman testifies he was ripped off by

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Golfer Greg Norman was reportedly
tricked by a friend into buying junk jewelry for his wife worth
only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he paid, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the poor quality trinkets included a
Valentine's Day diamond bracelet and a brooch in the shape of his
trademark, the Great White Shark.
	   ``That probably more emotionally killed me than anything else
because I spent a lot of time designing it,'' Norman testified in a
Florida court.
	   The two pieces were among six presents Norman gave his wife
Laura, which cost him more than 500,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 290,000), the paper said.
	   It said an independent assayer reported the jewelry contained
``diamonds of poor quality and lower weights, irradiated or painted
to change colors, drilled and filled to disguise flaws.''
	   Norman's comments came in a testimony contained in pre-trial
court papers released in Florida on Tuesday, the paper said.
	   The evidence was taken in a 60 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 35 million) lawsuit by Detroit television station owner Aben
Johson against Florida jeweler Jack Hasson, who is known as diamond
dealer to the stars.
	   His clients include film producer Steven Spielberg and golfer
Jack Nicklaus, and many corporate clients.
	   Norman has no ongoing legal action against Hasson, and was
deposed for evidence in Johnson's civil suit

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocatepetl volcano southeast of Mexico
City showed a slight increase in activity Tuesday after a mild
eruption spit out glowing rock fragments, federal disaster
officials said.
	   The eruption late Monday night lasted about 2 minutes, followed
by a 30-minute-long exhalation which sent up a
5-kilometer-(3-mile)-high plume of gas and ash, the National Center
for Disaster Prevention said in a report carried by the
government's Notimex news agency.
	   The center advised people to avoid going within 5 kilometers (3
miles) of the crater.
	   Popocatepetl is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of
Mexico City. About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slopes.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban Defense Minister Raul Castro said in a
speech published Tuesday that his communist nation's military
remains vigilant against attack by the United States despite the
end of the Cold War.
	   ``The real danger of a military conflict still exists,'' Castro
said in a speech to the military council of Cuba's Eastern Army.
``The enemy is powerful and continues modernizing its armaments, as
in the days of the Cold War.''
	   News of the speech, carried Tuesday by Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency and the Communist Party daily Granma, was monitored in
Mexico City.
	   Raul Castro is the younger brother of President Fidel Castro and
the No. 2 man in the Cuban government.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan judge sentenced a man to 20
years in prison for killing a Belgian priest during a 1994 robbery.
	   Judge Horacio Castillo Cermeno made the ruling Monday against
Jose Alfredo Chavez Jimenez, a 35-year-old native of El Salvador.
	   Chavez was convicted of shooting to death 60-year-old priest
Alfonso Stessel Fons on Dec. 19, 1994, near the city of Chinautla,
north of the capital, to steal his tape recorder.
	   The judge sentenced a woman who tried to sell the tape recorder
to three years in prison. But since she has already served nearly
three years, she could be freed later this month.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Workers at Hondutel walked off
their jobs Tuesday to demand job security and share-participation
once the state telephone communications monopoly is privatized.
	   Service was not affected by the strike involving around 5,000
workers, who picketed Hondutel's main office in Tegucigalpa.
Management employees kept essential telephone, telegraph and other
communication links going.
	   Sara Ponce, a union spokeswoman, told The Associated Press ``the
strike will continue until we achieve our objectives,'' which she
listed as preventing mass dismissals by the new owners and a 4
percent share of the stock once Hondutel is privatized.
	   The government said it will not negotiate until the strike ends.
It said the strike is causing Hondutel dlrs 180,000 a day in
losses.
	   Empresa Hondurena de Telecomunicaciones, as Hondutel is formally
known, provides telephone, telegraph, satellite transmission and
Iternet services and allocates radio and television frequencies.
	    &UR; ___
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The amount of cocaine arriving in
the United States via Haiti has more than doubled in a year and is
now about 15 percent of the total, the chief of U.S. anti-drug
efforts said Tuesday.
	   Estimates of shipments in 1997 ranged as high as 20 metric tons,
and reports this year indicate as much 45 metric tons may move
through the country in 1998, said Barry McCaffrey, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's adviser on anti-drug policy.
	   Traffickers have shifted routes to Haiti and the Dominican
Republic because of increased patrols in nearby Puerto Rico, he
said.
	   McCaffrey made the comments while in Haiti on a two-day visit to
reinforce bilateral cooperation before the Oct. 14-16 anti-drug
conference of the 15-member Caribbean Community in Miami.
	   For many years, the Haitian military had monopolized the illegal
narcotics trade. When the army was dissolved following U.S.
intervention in 1994, independent smugglers took over and drug
traffic grew alarmingly.
	   In October 1997, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
President Rene Preval signed a treaty allowing U.S. ships and
aircraft to pursue suspected drug traffickers into Haitian waters
and airspace.
	   U.S. intelligence now tracks ships and planes near Haiti while
U.S. Navy and Coast Guard officers direct as many as a dozen ships
swarming around Hispaniola _ American, Dominican, and occasionally
British.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Federal Liberals spent almost as much effort
maligning the messenger as they did refuting the message Tuesday as
eavesdropped comments by Solicitor General Andy Scott turned into a
full-blown Parliamentary battle.
	   Prime Minister Jean Chretien chided New Democrat MP Dick Proctor
in the Commons and turned aside calls from NDP Leader Alexa
McDonough for Scott's resignation.
	   Scott said the contretemps was based upon ``tidbits of words
floating around in a noisy aircraft and unworthy of this place.''
	   At issue are alleged comments by Scott on the likely outcome of
an inquiry by the RCMP Public Complaints Commission into police
conduct at last year's APEC summit in Vancouver.
	   The source is Proctor, who says he overheard a private
conversation between Scott and lawyer Frederick Toole of Saint
John, New Brunswick, last Thursday on a flight from Ottawa to
Fredericton.
	   Toole and Scott insist nothing controversial was said.

	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Federal officials were sensitive to Indonesia's
concerns that President Suharto would be embarrassed by
demonstrators at last year's APEC summit, documents tabled at an
inquiry Tuesday indicate.
	   In meetings and correspondence, Indonesian officials urged
Canada repeatedly to ensure Suharto would not be confronted by
angry protesters or embarrassing signs.
	   Without such assurances, Suharto might not attend the
high-profile gathering of 18 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   In a meeting with the Canada's ambassador Sept. 19, 1997,
Indonesian officials said Suharto didn't fear ``physical harm _ he
is a soldier and would more readily accept a physical threat,
including death _ but (he needs) to avoid embarrassment or
humiliation.''

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Air pollution and global warming kill about 16,000
Canadians a year, say scientists who suggest one in 13 deaths is
caused by environmental problems .
	   A report released Tuesday and commissioned by the David Suzuki
Foundation says the toll could rise if the problems are ignored,
and predicts that by 2020, about 700,000 people worldwide will die
prematurely each year from air pollution.
	   ``These people are dying, and it's directly attributable to the
burning of fossil fuels,'' said Jim Fulton, executive director of
the foundation.
	   The report included work by two doctors who study the incidence
and distribution of diseases and another who is an expert on air
pollution.
	   About eight per cent of non-traumatic deaths in Canadian cities
are related to air pollution, the scientists say.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The leaders of the four opposition parties put
down their sticks and stones Tuesday to join forces in a rare
united front to stop the Liberal government from raiding the
employment insurance surplus.
	   Calling the Liberals thieves and defenders of the rich, leaders
of Reform, Bloc, NDP and Tories said they would use every
parliamentary tactic in the book to prevent the Liberals from
amending legislation that would give Ottawa unfettered access to
the EI surplus, predicted to reach $20 billion by year's end.
	   Preston Manning, Gilles Duceppe, Alexa McDonough and Elsie Wayne
were joined by union leaders in calling for an independent
commission made up of worker and employer representatives to
oversee the fund.
	   A commission already looks after EI, but the opposition parties
say it's stacked in favor of the government and merely
rubber-stamps whatever Ottawa dictates.
	   ---
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An Ontario decision to allow 29 students who
failed their bar exams to become lawyers has resulted in a furor
but is part of a plan to make the legal profession more accessible
for the disadvantaged.
	   ``It's been played in the press as `You passed because you're
aboriginal,' so it looks like they get different standards, but
that wasn't what happened,'' says Harriet Sachs, chairwoman of the
Law Society of Upper Canada's admissions and equity committee.
	   ``They got passed because, for one reason or another, their
performance on our tests was not an accurate reflection of their
competence to practice law.''
	   A law society task force probing why many law school graduates
were failing the tests interviewed 42 of the 49 failing students
from the 1996 and '97 programs.
	   Interviews by a four-member panel concluded many of the students
showed ``courage and tenacity and intelligence'' and the failing
exam grades weren't indicative of their ability to practice law.
	   ---
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Key flight information normally available in
modern aircraft investigations is missing for a Labrador helicopter
crash inquiry, increasing the possibility the cause of the recent
tragedy in Marsoui, Quebec, may never be known.
	   The aging military chopper, acquired in 1963, had no so-called
black boxes to record cockpit conversations and aircraft systems
because they were too expensive to install, investigators said
Tuesday.
	   And one of the best sources _ a survivor who can tell
investigators what happened during the flight _ isn't available
because all six crew died Friday when the chopper slammed into a
mountain near the shore of the St. Lawrence River.

Japan's Tosa fighting dogs go for the throat in canine sumo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KATSURAHAMA, Japan (AP) _ The contenders were itching for a
fight. They bolted up the path to the ring, snarled at each other
with teeth bared, bristled against the grip of their trainers.
	   Then the bell rang _ and they lunged at each other's throats.
	   This was no fight between ordinary heavyweights. It was a
no-holds barred brawl in a cherished Japanese tradition, endorsed
by no less than the emperor himself: dog fighting.
	   At the center of the sport is the feared Tosa, a mixture of
Japanese and foreign breeds such as bulldogs and great danes _ an
animal so powerful and relentless it's banned in some places.
	   Animal lovers might balk at the violent, often bloody tradition,
but fans of the Tosa _ an official National Treasure _ gush about
its fighting prowess in terms usually reserved for thoroughbreds or
fine wine.
	   ``A good dog is very special, maybe only one in a thousand,''
said Masaru Hirose, owner of the Tosa Fighting Dog Center in
Katsurahama, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Dog fighting in Japan goes back to the 14th century, but the
Tosa was bred to its current form _ with vice-grip jaws, a powerful
chest and a nasty temper _ in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
	   The dogs are impressive. With a short brown coat, full jowls and
a stout, muscled physique, the dogs can reach 90 kilograms (200
pounds) and a height of 65 centimeters (26 inches).
	   The rare canine is prized as strong, loyal guards by dog-lovers
in the United States, where Tosa sell for about dlrs 3,000 and fans
have formed the International Tosa-ken Association.
	   But the Tosa is also a dangerous fighting machine.
	   ``Clearly it is a dog for only very experienced dog-handlers,''
reads a description put out by WorldClassDogs Inc., adding that the
breed is banned in Britain. ``It is powerful, stoic and
relentless.''
	   The Japanese government has tightly controlled the fighting
tradition. Gambling is now banned, and Hirose's dog center along
the rocky south coast of Shikoku Island is the country's only
licensed fighting center.
	   Periodic title matches, however, can be held elsewhere, and Tosa
owners are all over the country. Top fighters are ranked like
venerated sumo wrestlers, with grand champions called ``yokozuna.''
	   In a match put on at Hirose's center for a couple of reporters,
the dogs bolted across a bloodstained canvas and attacked each
other at the throat, standing up on their hind legs.
	   The dogs _ scarred on face and legs from earlier matches _
growled and salivated as they sank their teeth into the loose,
almost elastic folds of fur around each other's necks.
	   At periodic title matches _ held at makeshift rings around the
country _ more than 100 owners and trainers watch as top Tosas duke
it out in bouts that can run as long as 30 minutes. Judges are on
hand to declare winners and hand out rankings.
	   Though dogs are often hurt, owners say they don't let the fights
get out of hand. With good reason: The dogs are so expensive to
buy, keep and train that their masters are eager to protect their
investments. A dog loses when it yelps or tries to flee from an
opponent, and officials at the dog center say they've never heard
of a Tosa being killed in a match.
	   But pulling apart the fiery canines can be a delicate operation.
At the end of the match at Hirose's center, two trainers leaped
into the ring and grabbed the dogs by the tail as a third trainer
jutted a flaming torch at the fighters' faces to pry them apart.
	   The isolation of the sport on Shikoku has kept it off the radar
of Japan's tiny animal rights movement.
	   ``It's only held in a limited, regional area, and people _
especially young people _ don't really know about it,'' said Taki
Hiramatsu, at Animal Refuge Kansai in Osaka.
	   Despite the gambling ban, Tosa fighting can involve big money.
Leading fighters, considered trophies by organized crime bosses,
can sell for millions of yen (tens of thousands of dollars).
Hirose's center displays an ornate, palanquin-style dog house built
for the 1989 visit of Emperor Akihito _ at the cost of dlrs 1
million.
	   The center, which also houses rows of gift shops and a museum,
is a popular stop for sightseeing buses on tours of the scenic
coastline. Five-minute fights for tourists are held every day as
long as at least 21 customers show up.
	   Visitors are treated to the sight of a ``yokozuna'' fighter in
full regalia, his body draped with elaborately quilted cloths and a
thick white rope tied around his neck. The short brawl between two
other dogs follows.
	   The center apparently saves the best fighters for title bouts,
however. At a recent match put on for tourists, one of the dogs
barely fought back, despite high-pitched cheers from two children
on tour with their mother.
	   ``It was OK,'' said Shinsuke Konno, 26, who drove six hours from
Kyoto to see the coast and watch a match. ``I thought the fight
would be more violent.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. envoy has failed again
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
crackdown in Kosovo, a source said, raising the prospects of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met Milosevic late Tuesday for a second day,
warning that time is running out to resolve the seven-month crisis.
Neither U.S. nor Yugoslav officials issued any detailed statement
about the talks, but a diplomatic source familiar with the
deliberations said there was ``no change'' in Milosevic's stand.
	   ``Kosovo is more important to him than Bosnia,'' the source said
on condition of anonymity. ``The American people do not understand
that because Bosnia was so much bloodier.''
	   The Bosnian war ended in 1995 when Milosevic accepted a peace
agreement Holbrooke negotiated. Holbrooke was dispatched to the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance
diplomatic effort to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   The source said Holbrooke was expected to meet Milosevic again
Wednesday.
	   The United States has threatened military action unless
Milosevic calls off his bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke met the Yugoslav president after a visit to Kosovo.
Following a meeting with ethnic Albanian leaders, the U.S. envoy
said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong presence,
despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of conflict
and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters in the Kosovo capital, Pristina.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against the secessionists has killed
hundreds, left tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians homeless and
led to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop the bloodshed by
striking Yugoslav army targets if necessary.
	   Hours after Holbrooke returned to Belgrade, reporters saw about
100 Yugoslav security vehicles _ from armored personnel carriers to
trucks loaded with troops _ moving outside Kosovo in an apparent
show of Milosevic's compliance with international demands.
	   Additionally, state-run Serbian TV claimed that all Serbian
special police units, on the forefront of strikes against Kosovo
Albanian militants, were pulled out of the province.
	   Ethnic Albanians constitute 90 percent of the 2 million people
in Kosovo. Most ethnic Albanians favor self-rule.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that
unchecked, Serb violence in the province could lead to instability
throughout the region.
	   ``The stakes are high,'' Clinton said. ``The time is now to end
the violence in Kosovo.''
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told Congress a pullback of
troops in Kosovo by Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Airstrikes might be followed by some ``international
presence'' on the ground, he said.
	   If more Serb forces don't pull out of the province, NATO
intervention ``will become inevitable,'' French President Jacques
Chirac said.
	   However, Yugoslav deputy Information Secretary Miodrag Popovic
told Associated Press Television News that the complete withdrawal
of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
	   ``Is there a country in the world that would do so, especially
with an armed rebellion in their hands?'' Popovic asked.
	   Milosevic told Holbrooke in talks Monday night that his
government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
crisis. But he also called the NATO threats against his country ``a
criminal act.''
	   NATO officials say they are ready to launch airstrikes. No
decision is expected until Thursday, when NATO ambassadors meet in
Brussels, Belgium.
	   Albania on Tuesday offered its airports and sea ports to NATO
for use in any military operation against neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Canada said Tuesday it had evacuated all nonessential diplomatic
staff and their families from its Belgrade embassy. Other countries
were expected to follow suit.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the Interfax news
agency that Russia, a staunch ally of Serbia, would use its veto to
stop any move to approve airstrikes on Yugoslavia by the U.N.
Security Council, which held discussions on the Kosovo crisis
Tuesday.
	   The United States is trying to get Milosevic and the ethnic
Albanians to agree on a deal that would defer for two or three
years a decision on whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia. But
the ethnic Albanians have refused to negotiate with Milosevic.

Ex-rebels struggling to lead quiet lives in Peru

<TEXT>
	   SAUCE, Peru (AP) _ Sistero Garcia used to terrorize the
countryside as a rebel commander. Today he raises chickens, and
instead of an assault rifle he carries a briefcase.
	   Holding a baby chick in his hand at his two-acre (0.8-hectare)
farm on the sloping shores of a jungle-ringed lake, he's the
picture of a gentle man.
	   But his neighbors have not forgotten his past.
	   ``Everyone wonders why Sistero is here if the whole town has
rejected him because of what he has done,'' says the deputy mayor,
Edvar Rodriguez, who left Sauce during the worst years of violence.
	   Garcia is working hard to bury the memories of his days as the
feared leader of 700 leftist guerrillas who controlled a large
swath of countryside in northern Peru in the early 1990s.
	   Once a month, the former village school teacher must check in
with police in Tarapoto, the region's largest town, two hours away
over a gut-wrenching road with ruts 2 feet (more than half a meter)
deep.
	   ``I really regret the time lost in the armed struggle,'' he says
as he fills feed bins in his chicken coop. ``All my youth has gone
into this. I'm 39 and I've sacrificed so much to have ended up with
nothing.''
	   Peru's leftist insurgencies have lost steam in recent years, and
6,000 rebels have laid down their arms and received pardons under a
government amnesty program begun in the 1990s.
	   But it's been a struggle for the former fighters to remake their
lives after years of guerrilla warfare. As with many other rebels
who surrendered, the government has not kept its promises to Garcia
to change his identity, move him to a new area and help him find
work.
	   ``I lost my family. I've not seen my children grow up. I'm
beginning from zero without a decent home, without a wife, with a
record, and rejected by society,'' Garcia says. ``But I give thanks
for my freedom.''
	   Garcia is one of 400 former rebels in Peru's northern San Martin
department who surrendered and received pardons. They were all
members of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
	   Tupac Amaru rebels focused their campaign in the jungle-cloaked
mountains of San Martin, extorting money from businessmen,
attacking police stations and seizing and looting small towns.
	   Written off after the capture of its top leaders in 1992, the
Tupac Amaru grabbed the spotlight again in December 1996 when 14
rebels seized hundreds of hostages at the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima. Soldiers stormed the building after a four-month
standoff and killed all the rebels.
	   The attack on the residence opened old wounds in the communities
where Garcia and his old comrades are trying to make new lives,
reviving fears about their intentions.
	   ``It's natural to be suspicious,'' says Lincoln Rojas, director
of a Roman Catholic social agency in Tarapoto. ``People worry about
just how much a person can change. It's the same with a criminal
who has been released from prison.''
	   Rojas' agency is helping two dozen former rebels with loans to
start small businesses that include honey production, carpentry and
a shrimp farm. But he says the program is too small to make much of
an impact.
	   ``A high percentage of these young men have no jobs. That
worries us,'' he says. ``We're trying to help them so that they
don't become resentful toward society and at some point return to
the jungle and take up arms again.''
	   In Sauce, a hamlet of grassy lanes and palm-thatched cottages on
the shores of Laguna Azul, a deep-blue, 3-mile-long
(5-kilometer-long) lake that once drew vacationers, villagers are
clearly wary of the ex-rebels in their midst. None is held in
greater suspicion than Garcia.
	   ``He spends most of his time with relatives. He doesn't talk
much with other people,'' says Rodriguez, the deputy mayor.
	   Garcia hopes his efforts to restart his life here will win over
his neighbors little by little.
	   In 1996, after surrendering and receiving a pardon, Garcia got a
dlrs 1,500 (4,500 nuevo soles) loan from a rural co-op in Tarapoto
to start his chicken business. He had grown up in Sauce and taught
the fifth and sixth grades in its school until joining the rebels
in 1983.
	   ``I am demonstrating that I work hard. I offer ideas for the
progress and development of the community. I don't hurt anyone,''
he says.
	   Sauce's 2,500 inhabitants don't forget easily.
	   Oswaldo Vargas, a 28-year-old coffee grower who was one of
Garcia's pupils, recalls how Garcia used the classroom to preach
against capitalism and turn his students against the government.
	   ``He was a good teacher, but he would disappear for months,''
Vargas says. ``They said he had been bitten by a snake, that he was
ill. He deceived everyone. He was in the jungle.''
	   He says few people in Sauce trust Garcia. ``I certainly don't.''
	   Among other things, villagers resent the rebels because they
enticed several dozen poor teen-agers into their ranks with false
promises of good pay.
	   It's common to see small boys playing in the dusty streets with
toy rifles whittled from wood. Not many years ago, youngsters
always wanted to play the role of guerrillas.
	   But things have changed in Peru. These days, Vargas says while
watching his own son in mock battle, ``they all pretend to be
soldiers.''

Church seeks to heal Guatemala's wounds with account of atrocities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY312-313, Graphic SANTA CRUZ DEL QUICHE &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA WIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CRUZ DEL QUICHE, Guatemala (AP) _ Beneath the words
``never again,'' Indian villagers solemnly ascend the altar steps
to receive copies of the Roman Catholic Church's report on wartime
atrocities.
	   Women in traditional bright-hued dress and men in T-shirts and
rubber work boots leave the special mass carefully cradling the
report's four volumes.
	   Here in the western highlands province of Quiche, where the most
human rights abuses were committed during Guatemala's 36-year civil
war, the report receives the same reverence given holy scripture.
	   Its pages tell, in terrible detail, of atrocities in this
predominantly Indian region during the war that ended in late 1996.
It names all the people and villages targeted in the battle between
the army and leftist guerrillas.
	   Because of the report, relatives and neighbors who died will not
be forgotten. Villages burned to the ground during the government's
scorched earth campaigns of the early 1980s will be remembered.
	   And perhaps, the church hopes, people on both sides of the
conflict will learn to understand and forgive each other.
	   ``We don't want it to be just something sad,'' says the Rev.
Julio Sabagh, a priest in Santa Cruz del Quiche. ``We want to
remember the bravery of the people who sought life, who did not
leave their work.''
	   More than three-fifths of the 55,021 dead listed in the church's
``Restoration of Historical Memory Report'' lived in Quiche
province. The report says 253 of the 424 documented massacres
occurred in that region, and blames most of them on the military or
its civilian patrols.
	   International attention was focused on the report in April after
Bishop Juan Gerardi was murdered just two days after presenting it
publicly.
	   Long accustomed to government violence, many Guatemalans
immediately assumed Gerardi was slain by current or former military
operatives angered by the report's findings.
	   Prosecutors now say the bishop was killed by a fellow priest in
a dispute that had nothing to do with the report. But some
activists still believe that current or former military agents
killed Gerardi over his accounting of wartime abuses.
	   Considered the most comprehensive record of Guatemalan rights
abuses to date, the report compiles more than 6,000 interviews
conducted in Spanish and 15 Indian languages over three years.
	   But fear of reprisals kept some communities silent.
	   ``The army tried to keep people from talking,'' says the Rev.
Axel Mencos, the only Catholic priest in Quiche province who did
not flee during the worst of the army's anti-rebel campaigns in
1980-82.
	   ``They told the people if they talked the terrible time could
happen again,'' Mencos says. ``But we insisted the only way to
ensure it never happened again was to talk about what happened.''
	   The first step towards breaking the silence began three years
ago, before government and guerrilla leaders signed a peace accord
in December 1996. In war-affected areas, the church trained
community members from 175 parishes in interview techniques and
history writing.
	   Now, the most difficult and important task is distributing the
report to the communities where the information was collected, says
Edgar Gutierrez, the report coordinator. The hope is the
information will spark communication between former antagonists
and, eventually, reconciliation.
	   Many villages have begun community discussions. ``For the first
time people are explaining why they acted the way did during the
conflict,'' Gutierrez says.
	   Manuel Mejia, who lost an uncle, brother and cousin during the
war, says the report is the only project in Guatemala that is
encouraging reconciliation at the local level.
	   ``They talk about a firm and lasting peace, but that is very
global,'' Mejia says. ``Here, within the communities, the rancor
continues.''
	   Still, church officials and villagers concede the report is just
a start.
	   ``Real change will depend on whether the peace accords are
enforced,'' says Mejia. ``The people's basic needs are what caused
the conflict. If they are not completed, it could happen again.''

Southeast Asian exports to Japan decline as its economy sags
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations' exports to
Japan have fallen sharply as the Japanese economy has slipped into
recession, according to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi.
	   However, Supachai said he expects Japan to recover from its
worst recession in 50 years and register an economic growth of 1
percent to 2 percent after a year, which could reverse the export
decline.
	   ``It will take some time because the loss of confidence in Japan
is quite deep-seated,'' he said late Tuesday. ``By next year, we
should be doing far better in terms of our exports to Japan.''
	   Japan announced Tuesday that its economy will likely shrink for
a second straight year this year. Its forecast of a 1.8 percent
contraction reversed a previous forecast of 1.9 percent growth.
	   Supachai, who is also Thailand's minister of commerce, is in
Manila to attend a conference of trade ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   He was unable to give exact figures on the region's overall
export decline but said Thailand's exports to Japan shrank by 16
percent to 17 percent during the first half of 1998.
	   Japan's economic troubles and the export decline were discussed
by ASEAN officials Tuesday. The ASEAN countries were discussing the
drop in exports with Japan individually, Supachai said.
	   ASEAN trade officials agreed Tuesday to hasten plans to demolish
trade barriers in the region to encourage business and investment
and help Asia recover from a continuing financial crisis.

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ European fishing companies want to begin
working the South Pacific tuna fishing grounds, a region long
dominated by Asian and U.S. fishing ships.
	   The European Union has asked the Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency,
representing 17 Pacific nations, for licenses to allow 20 large
purse seine fishing ships, mostly Spanish, to operate in the
region, the agency said Wednesday.
	   France is separately seeking licenses for French vessels to
operate around New Caledonia, a French territory.
	   Negotiations are in progress with the European Community in
Brussels, the FFA confirmed.
	   Forum Fisheries Agency countries together control fishing in
their 200-nautical-mile (370-km) exclusive economic zones around
their territories, covering more than 11.6 million square miles (30
million sq. km.) of the south and central Pacific.
	   The region currently yields over half the world's canned tuna
supply, the agency said.
	   In 1997, the FFA licensed 1,210 mainly Japanese, South Korean,
Taiwanese and Chinese fishing vessels and about 35 U.S. purse
seiners to operate in the region.
	   The move by the European fleet to enter the South Pacific
follows the collapse of major Atlantic fishers due to
over-exploitation.
	   The Pacific Community, a New Caledonia-based technical agency
with a large fishery research division, said Pacific skipjack,
yellowfin and albacore tuna fisheries are in good shape and can
stand heavier fishing.
	   But the Forum Fisheries Agency has just reported that there is
now ``doubt'' about one high-value species, big eye tuna, which
deserves ``close attention'' since a growing portion of catches of
juvenile tuna suggests the adult population is being over-fished.

Diamond in the rough? Greg Norman testifies he was ripped off by
</HEADLINE>
jeweler
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name in last graf to `Johson.' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Golfer Greg Norman was reportedly
tricked by a friend into buying junk jewelry for his wife worth
only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he paid, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the poor quality trinkets included a
Valentine's Day diamond bracelet and a brooch in the shape of his
trademark, the Great White Shark.
	   ``That probably more emotionally killed me than anything else
because I spent a lot of time designing it,'' Norman testified in a
Florida court.
	   The two pieces were among six presents Norman gave his wife
Laura, which cost him more than 500,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 290,000), the paper said.
	   It said an independent assayer reported the jewelry contained
``diamonds of poor quality and lower weights, irradiated or painted
to change colors, drilled and filled to disguise flaws.''
	   Norman's comments came in a testimony contained in pre-trial
court papers released in Florida on Tuesday, the paper said.
	   The evidence was taken in a 60 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 35 million) lawsuit by Detroit television station owner Aben
Johson against Florida jeweler Jack Hasson, who is known as diamond
dealer to the stars.
	   His clients include film producer Steven Spielberg and golfer
Jack Nicklaus, and many corporate clients.
	   Norman has no ongoing legal action against Hasson, and was
deposed for evidence in Johson's civil suit

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stocks rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar was sharply lower against the yen in
early trading Wednesday as the Japanese currency was buoyed by
optimism Japan is moving ahead with plans to repair its ailing
banks and boost economic growth. Tokyo stocks rose.
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 129.76 yen, down 3.10 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late-afternoon New York level
of 130.85 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
285.91 points, or 2.20 percent, in early trading to 13,307.55. The
average gained 73.52 points, or 0.57 percent, on Tuesday.
	   The dollar weakened after Japan's ruling party promised to push
for expansion and early passage of an economic stimulus package
first announced in August.
	   The original package called for a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 54
billion) tax cut and a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 77 billion) public
spending program.
	   There was also growing optimism the government would move
quickly to enact a plan to use public money to shore up ailing
banks, traders said.
	   On the stock market, bank shares were among the biggest gainers
on optimism that a law to allow the government to use public funds
to recapitalize weak but viable banks will be approved during the
current parliamentary session.
	   The ruling party was set to submit a bill to Parliament on
Wednesday that incorporated many of the political opposition's
proposals, making quick passage likely, news reports said.
	   Real estate and steel stocks also rose on expectations for fresh
economic stimulus measures from the government.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 17.24 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,014.19. On
Tuesday, the TOPIX edged up 0.26 points, or 0.03 percent.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
16.74 points _ or 0.2 percent _ to 7,742.98 after shedding an early
154-point gain and briefly dipping into negative territory.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.755 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.725 percent,
driving its price down to 109.43 yen from 109.73 yen.

Germany's incoming government warns of looming budget deficit

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Charging Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government with manipulating the books for next year's budget,
Germany's incoming center-left government warned against
expectations of big new programs after it takes office.
	   Coalition talks between Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democrats and the small Greens party were resuming
Wednesday, focusing on the budget and unemployment.
	   But Social Democrat finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier warned
``there isn't a lot of room for big election presents'' because of
tight finances.
	   On Tuesday, budget experts from both parties said their review
of government finances found revenues next year will be 20 billion
marks (dlrs 12 billion) less than calculated by Kohl's outgoing
government.
	   Another 20 billion marks is at risk in the coming years due to
over-generous economic growth forecasts, the Greens' Fritz Kuhn
said after Tuesday's meeting.
	   Kohl's parliamentary faction leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, denied
any gap in the 1999 budget presented by Finance Minister Theo
Waigel last month.
	   Matthaeus-Maier said the Social Democrats remained committed to
reversing cuts in retirement benefits passed by Kohl's government
that were to take effect Jan. 1.
	   The parties already have committed themselves to quickly put in
place a jobs program to fight unemployment among young people.
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end. But a Greens leader said Tuesday her
party expects at least two posts in Schroeder's Cabinet.
	   Juergen Trittin will become Environment Minister, and Joschka
Fischer will take over the Foreign Ministry, said Gunda Roestel,
who co-chairs the Greens party with Trittin.
	   Roestel said the party had proposed two female candidates as
justice minister, adding that the talks were ``sharpening.''
	   The Greens said Sunday they wanted to name four ministers, at
least two of whom should be women.
	   Social Democratic lawmaker Ulla Schmidt on Tuesday also called
on Schroeder to appoint women to at least 40 percent of the top
jobs in his government.

Campaigning winds down, Greece makes final bid for council seat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With just two days to go to the vote,
Greece made a final bid Tuesday to join the Security Council,
arguing that it was only fair that Greece be allowed to assume one
of the nonpermanent seats up for grabs this year.
	   ``Greece would not do better than any other country in the
Security Council but it would certainly not do worse than any other
country, and I think it has to be given this chance,'' the deputy
Greek foreign minister, Yannos Kranidiotis told reporters.
	   Greece is competing with Canada and the Netheralands for the two
seats allotted this year to the regional group that encompasses
Western Europe and North America. The 185-member General Assembly
votes on Thursday.
	   Kranidiotis said Greece's strategic position, the fact that it
has only been on the council once before, and its record of
contributing both money and resources to the United Nations makes
it the perfect candidate.
	   There are 10 nonpermanent seats on the council and five
permanent ones: the United States, Britain, China, France and
Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats come up for
election to a two-year term.
	   The three other seats that are vacant for 1999-2000 are going
uncontested: Malaysia representing Asia, Namibia for Africa and
Argentina representing Latin America.
	   The campaign for the two seats in the Western Europe/North
America group caught some attention over the summer after Greece
invited U.N. delegates for a weeklong Aegean visit. Greece denied
the trip _ dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get
votes _ was related to the council bid.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, the last one being
1983-84.
	   Some believe Canada and the Netherlands have the best shot at
landing seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the Mediterranean
island divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Having Greece on
the council could further politicize the issue at the United
Nations.
	   Others cite the prominent Dutch and Canadian presence on
peacekeeping forces as well as the continued Dutch influence over
its former colonies who will be voting on Thursday.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. envoy has failed again
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
crackdown in Kosovo, a source said, raising the prospects of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met Milosevic late Tuesday for a second day,
warning that time is running out to resolve the seven-month crisis.
Neither U.S. nor Yugoslav officials issued any detailed statement
about the talks, but a diplomatic source familiar with the
deliberations said there was ``no change'' in Milosevic's stand.
	   Returning to his hotel after Tuesday's talks, Holbrooke said
only that he had been conferring by telephone with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and that he would meet Milosevic again
Wednesday evening.
	   The fact that the two had agreed to a third meeting indicated
that there was still a chance for an agreement.
	   But so far Milosevic has remained defiant throughout the
meetings, during which Holbrooke has sought to convince him that
Washington is equally firm in demanding that he comply with U.N.
resolutions or face military action.
	   ``Kosovo is more important to him than Bosnia,'' the source said
on condition of anonymity. ``The American people do not understand
that because Bosnia was so much bloodier.''
	   The Bosnian war ended in 1995 when Milosevic accepted a peace
agreement Holbrooke negotiated. Holbrooke was dispatched to the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-chance
diplomatic effort to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   The United States has threatened military action unless
Milosevic calls off his bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels
seeking independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke met the Yugoslav president Tuesday after a visit to
Kosovo. Following a meeting with ethnic Albanian leaders, the U.S.
envoy said that Serbian security forces still maintain a strong
presence, despite U.N. demands for them to withdraw from areas of
conflict and allow political settlement.
	   ``U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrific job bringing us
information, and the information they're bringing is not good,''
Holbrooke told reporters in the Kosovo capital, Pristina.
	   Later, he told CNN International that ``right now, we are in the
countdown to a decisive moment in the history of the Balkans.''

Saatchi brothers to open branch in Fiji
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ International advertising firm M and C Saatchi
will open a branch in Fiji in collaboration with local interests,
the company announced Wednesday.
	   John Dery, Saatchi Asia Pacific's executive chairman, said the
new branch, to be opened in the Fijian capital of Suva, was part of
the company's expansion in the region.
	   Formation of the new branch follows the collapse in August of
Wilson Addison Associates Ltd., Fiji's only large local agency
business, which closed with debts exceeding Fiji dollars one
million (U.S. dlrs 500,000).
	   Local partners are Sundip Patel, of importer and agency for
retail consumer goods C.J. Patel Ltd., and former Wilson Addison
executive John Ross.
	   M and C Saatchi is a London-based company formed by Maurice and
Charles Saatchi after the breakup of the former Saatchi and Saatchi
advertising empire, once the largest in the world.
	   M and C Saatchi retains some of the former empire's key clients,
and also advises corporations on sports sponsorship.

US Treasury secretary says U.N. must shoulder burden of financial
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations can play a key role in
preventing future global financial meltdowns, and will be forced to
shoulder some of the burden of the current crisis, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said Tuesday.
	   Following a 45-minute meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, Rubin said U.S. support for the U.N. was ``enormously in our
self interest.'' He took the occasion to make a pitch for Congress
to pay past U.N. dues, as well as the dlrs 18 billion supplemental
International Monetary Fund package held up in Congress.
	   Rubin was in New York to brief Annan on the annual meeting of
the I.M.F. earlier in Washington.
	   ``I don't think there's any question that the more serious the
crisis becomes in certain other parts of the world, the more
seriously it can affect us,'' Rubin said. ``That's why it seems to
me it's important that we support institutions like the United
Nations.''
	   Through its ongoing development programs, the United Nations
plays a key role in helping build infrastructures in developing
countries, efforts that can prevent future economic meltdowns,
Rubin said.
	   At the same time, though, the U.N. humanitarian assistance
programs are likely to be tested in the face of the current global
turmoil.
	   ``The United Nations is going to have an added burden to bear
now ... because, tragically, this crisis is going to create more
poverty in the world and create more need for the kind of
humanitarian assistance that the United Nations is so central to,''
Rubin said.
	   During their meeting, Annan urged Rubin to focus on the problems
facing heavily indebted poor countries.
	   Annan also urged Rubin to resist attempts to divert World Bank
resources dedicted to developing countries to the global liquidity
problem.
	   Those funds should be dedicated to ``stitching together,'' the
safety net for poorer coutries, Annan said.

Aziz: No necessary guarantees for comprehensive review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS dropped graf 8 with Annan meeting Aziz on Wednesday. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said that it hadn't yet gotten
satisfactory guarantees that the Security Council would conduct an
honest review of U.N. sanctions if Baghdad resumes cooperation with
arms inspectors.
	   Without mentioning Washington by name, Aziz said Tuesday that
the ``disturbing'' statements made by some council members this
week were to blame for the as-yet unresolved dispute.
	   Aziz said that after speaking to 14 of the 15 council members _
the United States excluded _ he had the sense that they were
willing to conduct an honest review.
	   ``But that's not yet unanimous,'' he said. As a result, he told
reporters after meeting with the council president, Jeremy
Greenstock of Britain, Iraq hasn't received the ``complete,
satisfactory guarantees,'' required to move forward.
	   Aziz has been in New York for over a week to try to work out a
deal with the U.N. chief in which Baghdad would reverse its Aug. 5
decision to suspend cooperation with inspectors and in return get a
``comprehensive review'' of its seven-year effort to disarm itself.
	   The review could force the council to recognize Iraq's progress
in destroying its weapons of massere to meet for a fourth time Wednesday.
	   The United States, however, raised objections to several of the
ideas and has noted that the council wasn't obligated to use the
U.N. chief's proposal at all.
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States and Britain, in particular, weren't prepared to give
Iraq any details of how a review would be carried out until Iraq
reverses its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with arms
inspectors.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching
off the Gulf war.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 it was ending cooperation with inspectors
because the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move has essentially stopped spot inspections of suspected
weapons sites because U.N. inspectors must be accompanied by
Iraqis.
	   Butler issued a six-month report Monday on the progress of U.N.
arms inspections, and warned that because of Iraq's continued
defiance, the council may have to soon acknowledge that it may
never know if Iraq has completely rid itself of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   But Butler disputed part of the U.N. chief's proposal to end the
impasse.
	   Annan has proposed making inspectors responsible for proving
that Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the report, Butler said the proposal, which Iraq has long
demanded, would reverse the burden of disclosure that was placed on
Baghdad by the Security Council in its original resolutions.
	   The report cites the still uncertain status of Iraq's biological
program as the reason why Baghdad and not inspectors should still
be responsible for making disclosures about proscribed weapons.
	   For nearly four years, Iraq failed to tell inspectors that it
even had a biological weapons program, the inspectors said. Baghdad
finally did so when shown evidence to the contrary, but its reports
since then have been ``neither credible nor verifiable,'' the
report says.
	   How then could inspectors be asked to prove what Iraq has
refused to divulge, the inspectors asked in their report. Iraq
should continue to be responsible for providing all information
about its banned weapons programs, as called for by U.N.
resolutions, the inspectors argued.

Italy's premier takes case to save government to Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Arguing Italy needs stability, Premier Romano Prodi
hoped to win over just a few, wavering lawmakers Wednesday to
ensure survival of a government that already is Italy's second-most
enduring in a half-century.
	   Prodi decided to appeal to Parliament Wednesday on behalf of his
center-left government, which was threatened with collapse by the
defection of its far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party.
	   The left Prodi's government, Italy's second-longest since World
War II, facing an expected vote of confidence on Friday that will
test whether he can still command a majority in Parliament.
	   It was stability that allowed Italy to qualify for participation
in Europe's common currency during his 2 1/2-year-old government,
Prodi said at a news conference Tuesday after a summit with French
leaders in Florence.
	   That vital stability now ``is at risk,'' he said, arguing other
economic reforms were at risk as well.
	   The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by
withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not
vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget.
	   But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.
Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party
president Monday, saying the party's hard-line stance was ``wrong
and dangerous.''
	   Prodi was hoping to profit from the break, picking up the few
more votes he needs to command a majority in the 630-seat Chamber
of Deputies. As of Monday, he was thought to be just barely shy of
the needed total, at 312.
	   The premier told reporters in Rome late Tuesday that he was
getting ample messages of support from ordinary Italians. ``It's a
shame that faxes aren't votes in Parliament,'' he added.
	   Prodi says he will quit if he loses a vote of confidence. That
would leave President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the choice of
asking him or someone else to try to form a new government or
calling early parliamentary elections.
	   The center-right opposition led by ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi
declared Tuesday that early elections were Italy's only proper
course now _ but his is about the only faction in that wants to go
that route.
	   Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3 1/2
years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to forge an agreement for an Israeli
pullback from the West Bank, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has set up a three-way meeting with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders.
	   Albright arranged Wednesday's meeting after a day of
inconclusive talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Jerusalem and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at his West Bank
headquarters in Jericho.
	   Albright said the two sides have failed to make the ``tough
choices'' needed to conclude a deal. Unless they do so, she warned,
Mideast peacemaking could fall apart.
	   Her tough words seemed designed to spur the leaders to tackle
their differences.
	   The three-way meeting was scheduled late Wednesday morning at
the Erez checkpoint on the border between Israel and
Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
	   ``Time is not on our side,'' Albright said Tuesday, standing
alongside Arafat in Jericho. ``If we don't move quickly, we may
find ourselves without a process of peacemaking, without an
agreement, and without the hope of achieving an Israeli-Palestinian
peace.''
	   The key challenge appeared to be settling on security
arrangements that would enable Netanyahu to approve a pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians already control about
one-quarter of the West Bank.
	   Wednesday's talks were to be aimed at overcoming bureaucratic
deadlocks, as well as more substantive issues: The Palestinians
complain that they have yet to see the Israeli maps detailing the
troop withdrawal; the Israelis want to know details of Palestinian
pledges to contain Islamic militant groups.
	   Arafat declined to be drawn out on the security issue. ``Peace
means security, peace means freedom,'' he said.
	   The territorial issue _ the terms of Israel's pullback _ was
``largely resolved,'' said State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin. But dozens of other issues remain unresolved, he said.
	   Whatever Albright may accomplish here, there will be no
agreement before President Bill Clinton hosts a Washington summit
with Arafat and Netanyahu, he added.
	   ``I think we envisage the summit as a multi-day exercise where
some heavy lifting is going to be required,'' he said. ``We do not
envisage it as a photo-op in which everything is pre-cooked.''
	   The summit's exact date and site are in flux. The likely startup
is Oct. 15 or Oct. 20, and the location could be outside
Washington.
	   After Albright leaves the Middle East, probably later Wednesday,
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin
Indyk will remain for further talks with Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
	   ``We recognize there are tough choices that have to be made by
both sides as we approach the Washington summit,'' said Albright.
	   Earlier, in Jerusalem, there also was no report of progress in
Albright's meeting with Netanyahu.
	   ``We're standing at the possibility of completing a political
process with agreements that were difficult from our point of view,
we know that,'' Netanyahu later told members of his Likud party.
	   ``But along with that, we said that we'll respect them on the
basis of two principles: One is guaranteeing security and the
second is achieving reciprocity.''

	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ European fishing companies want to begin
working the South Pacific's tuna fishing grounds, a region long
dominated by Asian and U.S. fishing ships.
	   The European Union has asked the Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency,
representing 17 Pacific nations, for licenses to allow 20 large
purse seine fishing ships, mostly Spanish, to operate in the
region, the agency said Wednesday.
	   France is separately seeking licenses for French vessels to
operate around New Caledonia, a French territory.
	   Negotiations are in progress with the European Community in
Brussels, the FFA confirmed.
	   Forum Fisheries Agency countries together control fishing in
their 200-nautical-mile (370-km) exclusive economic zones around
their territories, covering more than 11.6 million square miles (30
million sq. km.) of the south and central Pacific.
	   The region currently yields over half the world's canned tuna
supply, the agency said.
	   In 1997, the FFA licensed 1,210 mainly Japanese, South Korean,
Taiwanese and Chinese fishing vessels and about 35 U.S. purse
seiners to operate in the region.
	   Purse seiners drag huge purse-shaped nets through a school of
tuna and then hoist them aboard.
	   The move by the European fleet to enter the South Pacific
follows the collapse of major Atlantic fishers due to
over-exploitation.
	   The Pacific Community, a New Caledonia-based technical agency
with a large fishery research division, said Pacific skipjack,
yellowfin and albacore tuna fisheries are in good shape and can
stand heavier fishing.
	   But the Forum Fisheries Agency has just reported that there is
now ``doubt'' about one high-value species, big eye tuna, which
deserves ``close attention'' since a growing portion of catches of
juvenile tuna suggests the adult population is being over-fished.

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mark Belanger, one of the best fielding
shortstops of his generation and a key figure in the baseball
players' union, died of lung cancer Tuesday at 54.
	   A heavy smoker until he quit around 1990, he was diagnosed with
the disease about a year ago.
	   Belanger won eight Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles, his
team from 1965-81, and six of them were consecutive, 1973-78.
Brooks Robinson, with 16 Gold Gloves, is the only Orioles player to
have more.
	   Belanger, who ended his career in 1982 with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, had a lifetime batting average of only .228, but his weak
hitting was more than offset by his glove. Nicknamed Blade, he had
a lifetime .977 fielding percentage, eighth among shortstops.
	   Belanger played on Baltimore's 1970 World Series championship
team and on four pennant winners and six division champions.
	   He was a union representative as a player and after he retired
he became a key figure in the Major League Baseball Players
Association as the longtime assistant to union head Donald Fehr.
	   ``He paved the way for all the contracts and all the rights
players have today,'' said pitcher David Cone, the New York
Yankees' player representative. ``He was tough, no nonsense,
stepped on some toes along the way and also made friends along the
way. He will be dearly missed.''
	   Belanger helped keep players united during a two-day strike in
1985, a 32-day lockout in 1990 and a 230-day strike that wiped out
the end of the 1994 season, the entire postseason and the first
three weeks of the 1995 schedule.
	   ``Players who shared the field with Mark and those who have come
along since owe a debt of gratitude to him,'' Fehr said. ``I
personally miss the wisdom and insight he provided on virtually
every important decision the MLBPA has made over the last three
decades.
	   Former teammate Eddie Murray said he was privileged to have
worked with Belanger, calling him ``special.''
	   Terry Crowley, another former teammate, said everyone knew
Belanger as a great infielder, but that he was also a good friend.
	   ``Even more important than that, he was a wonderful father,''
said Crowley, a hitting coach with the Minnesota Twins for the past
eight seasons who was appointed to the same position with the
Orioles on Tuesday. ``Our sons played baseball together and he
coached basketball during the winter.''
	   Belanger is survived by his wife, Virginia; sons Robert and
Richard; his parents; a brother; and two sisters.

Cal Ripken Sr. has lung cancer, family says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Cal Ripken Sr., a former manager and longtime
coach of the Baltimore Orioles and father of baseball iron man Cal
Ripken Jr., is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer,
his family said.
	   Vi Ripken told The (Baltimore) Sun that her husband was
diagnosed last week at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Ripken, 62, began
treatment several days ago.
	   ``Doctors found a tumor on Calvin's lung, came up with a plan
and started the wheels moving,'' Vi Ripken said Monday. ``The team
of specialists seems very optimistic that this treatment will take
care of the problem.''
	   She said doctors hope medication will shrink the tumor.
	   ``It's not going to be easy, but they seem sure that this will
be a success,'' she said. ``It's a positive outlook, and we're
pleased with the evaluation.''
	   Ripken, a catcher, signed with Baltimore in 1957 but soon turned
to managing, spending 14 years in the minors.
	   His teams finished first or second on seven occasions, and he
joined the Orioles' coaching staff in 1976.
	   He was named manager in 1987, taking over a last-place team. He
was fired in 1988 after an 0-6 start.
	   Ripken was the first in the majors to manage two of his sons,
Cal, the third baseman, and Billy, the second baseman. The three
Ripkens appeared on the cover of ``Sports Illustrated'' in 1987.
	   That year, Ripken removed his son late in a game, ending Cal
Jr.'s streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Ripken eventually
went on to set baseball's consecutive games record, ending the
streak in the final week of this season at 2,632.
	   Ripken Sr. was rehired as Orioles third base coach in 1989, but
was dismissed at the end of the 1992 season.

Bangkok tops region in vacant office space
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a telltale sign of the hard times
hitting Southeast Asia, Thailand's capital leads the
recession-plagued region in vacant office space, an international
property consultant said Wednesday.
	   In Bangkok's central business district, 22 percent of offices
are vacant, compared with 15.6 percent in Jakarta, 11 percent in
Kuala Lumpur and just 4 percent in Manila, according to a report
released by Jones Lang Wootton.
	   The consulting firm said that with several new office buildings
nearing completion, the vacancy rate in Bangkok may reach 40
percent by the end of the year.
	   Because of the oversupply, however, prices per square meter are
about 30 percent cheaper than in other regional capitals.
	   Massive overbuilding in the real estate sector helped spark
Thailand's economic and financial crises.
	   Banks and finance companies lent huge amounts of money to
developers who overbuilt, couldn't sell their projects and then
defaulted on loans.

Judge bars WBA from sanctioning Pestrayev-Page welterweight bout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY GOLD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ A state judge will not allow the WBA
to award its vacant welterweight title to the winner of the
upcoming bout between its No. 1 and No. 3 contenders.
	   The ruling came after the WBA's No. 2 contender, Jose Luis
Lopez, challenged the sanctioning, saying the WBA was obligated to
let him fight for the title.
	   State Superior Court Judge Amos C. Saunders agreed, and ordered
that the WBA must let promoters bid on a fight between Lopez and
the No. 1 contender, Andrey Pestrayev of Russia.
	   The Oct. 10 undercard fight between Pestrayev and No. 3 James
Page, to be broadcast on Showtime, can continue.
	   Main Events promoter Lou Duva, co-manager of Lopez, praised the
decision and criticized Page's promoter Don King for arranging the
Pestrayev match.
	   ``It's just another case of King trying to ram something down
the throat of boxing,'' Duva said Tuesday.
	   Duva wants to bid on a Pestrayev-Lopez bout, said Main Events
publicist Donald A. Tremblay.
	   Main Events lawyer Patrick C. English said it was highly unusual
for the No. 2 contender to be excluded from a title fight when the
title is vacant.
	   ``When there is a vacant championship, the requirement is that
the two leading contenders fight for it,'' English said.
	   WBA lawyer James J. Binns did not immediately return a message
Tuesday seeking comment.
	   Don King Productions said it was following WBA regulations, said
Rachel Wilkinson, who works with a Las Vegas firm that handles
King's public relations.
	   The ruling from Saunders came Monday following a hearing in his
Passaic courtroom.
	   The WBA welterweight crown was vacated by Ike Quartey of Ghana
for a shot at the WBC welterweight belt Nov. 21 against Oscar De La
Hoya. Lopez fought Quartey to a 12-round draw in October.

Dollar falls against yen, Tokyo stocks rise in morning trading

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond,
quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in morning
trading Wednesday on optimism Japan was moving ahead with plans to
address its ailing banking system and boost economic growth. Tokyo
stocks surged.
	   The dollar bought 130.20 yen, down 2.66 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late overnight level of 130.85 yen in New
York.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
341.37 points, or 2.62 percent, to 13,363.01 at the end of the
morning session. The average gained 73.52 points, or 0.57 percent,
on Tuesday.
	   Making a rare comment on the foreign exchange market, Japan's
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he was closely watching current
dollar-yen exchange-rate movements.
	   ``If a stronger yen means Japan's fundamentals are being
positively evaluated, that's good news, but if it's speculation it
is a problem. I'm watching it closely,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Finance Ministry's
international bureau, praised what he called a correction in the
yen's weakness.
	   ``A correction to excessive yen weakness is welcome. It will
continue,'' he told reporters at the ministry.
	   The dollar weakened after Japan's ruling party promised to push
for expansion and early passage of an economic stimulus package
first announced in August.
	   The original package called for a 7 trillion yen (dlrs 54
billion) tax cut and a 10 trillion yen (dlrs 77 billion) public
spending program.
	   Market players were also encouraged by growing optimism the
government would move quickly to enact a plan to use public money
to shore up ailing banks.
	   Also affecting the dollar was speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve may move to cut interest rates further in line with
imminent moves by European central banks, traders said.
	   On the stock market, bank shares were among the biggest gainers
in morning trading amid prospects that legislation to allow the
government to use public funds to recapitalize weak but viable
banks will be approved during the current extended parliamentary
session.
	   The ruling party was set to submit a bill to Parliament on
Wednesday that incorporated many of the political opposition's
proposals, making quick passage likely, news reports said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 21.67 points, or 2.17 percent, to 1,018.62. On
Tuesday, the TOPIX edged up 0.26 points, or 0.03 percent.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
16.74 points _ or 0.2 percent _ to 7,742.98 after shedding an early
154-point gain and briefly dipping into negative territory.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.700 percent from Tuesday's close of 0.725
percent, driving its price up to 109.97 yen from 109.73 yen.

Security Council declares no compliance with Kosovo resolutions

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council declared that
combatants have not complied fully with U.N. resolutions demanding
a cease-fire in Kosovo and special Serb police units have failed to
withdraw from the separatist province.
	   Although it doesn't carry any legal weight, the declaration of
noncompliance could fuel calls for military intervention. Council
president, British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, read the statement
late Tuesday to reporters hours after senior U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke apparently failed again to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end the crackdown in Kosovo, raising the
prospects of NATO airstrikes.
	   The council noted that military activity in the southern Serb
province had appeared to wind down in recent days. But Greenstock
said Belgrade's armed presence in Kosovo ``remained significant''
and the operations of the special police continued even after the
council's latest demands for a cease-fire.
	   ``Council members agreed that there had yet to be full
compliance with all the requirements'' of U.N. resolutions on
Kosovo, Greenstock said.
	   The council met for close to seven hours to discuss a report
from the U.N. chief on the situation in Kosovo, where Milosevic's
Serb forces are trying to crush an independence movement by the
province's ethnic Albanian majority _most of whom seek independence
from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb crackdown launched in February has left hundreds dead
and forced more than 270,000 people to flee their homes to avoid
Serb attacks in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   It was unclear what, if any further action would come from the
15-member council, which is divided as to whether to use force to
end the Serb attacks and whether NATO needs any more council
authority to initiate such force.
	   Russia, a veto-holding council member, said Tuesday it was
likely to veto any resolution specifically authorizing the use of
force, and China _ which also holds a veto _ said it also opposed
military intervention.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
cease-fire and the withdrawal of special Yugoslav forces. Refugees
must be allowed to return home safely, it said, and humanitarian
agencies must have access to them. The council demanded both sides
work toward finding a political solution and threatened unspecified
action if both sides failed to comply.
	   The council specifically asked the U.N. chief to report back on
whether both sides had complied.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported Monday that Serb forces
intensified their attacks on ethnic Albanians even after the
council's Sept. 23 resolution.
	   But Annan said he couldn't specifically determine Serb
compliance with U.N. resolutions because the United Nations doesn't
have the presence in Kosovo to confirm reports of atrocities _ only
the humanitarian situation. His report, however, listed several
apparent violations of the Sept. 23 resolution.
	   In the statement, the council asked Annan to consider how he
could ensure that the United Nations had first-hand accounts to
assess developments on the ground.
	   The council also backed the U.N. chief's call for an
investigation into the atrocities and urged the U.N. tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia to extend its investigation to cover those
crimes.
	   The council insisted on the need for an early resumption of
negotiations to settle the dispute and called on the international
community to take urgent steps to prevent a humanitarian disaster.

South Korean president arrives in Tokyo for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung arrived in
Tokyo Wednesday to begin four days of talks on new economic aid,
North Korea's missile program and how to ease lingering animosities
over Japan's brutal rule of Korea more than 50 years ago.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was expected to offer a
dlrs 3 billion package of loans to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid package for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   Obuchi's talks with Kim will also touch on the more symbolic but
sensitive issue of Tokyo's occupation of the Korean Peninsula from
1910-1945.
	   Japanese leaders want to offer a formal apology that is sincere
enough to appease smoldering Korean resentment without offending
conservatives in Japan.
	   The issue has come up during each of the nine previous visits by
Korean presidents since the war.
	   But it has a new urgency now as Tokyo hopes to pave the way for
Emperor Akihito to attend ceremonies in South Korea when the two
nations jointly host the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. No
Japanese emperor has visited South Korea.
	   Kim was to meet Akihito shortly after his arrival Wednesday, and
security in Tokyo was tight. Some 16,000 police officers were
mobilized in the Tokyo area for the visit.
	   According to Japan's Yomiuri newspaper, Kim and Obuchi will
endorse guidelines for a ``new partnership,'' which will include a
strong apology by Tokyo for the Japanese colonization.
	   The guidelines are also expected to include a promise by Kim to
lift restrictions on Japanese culture in South Korea, where
Japanese movies are still banned.
	   ``As co-travelers of the 21st century, the two countries must
work closely together for peace in Asia and the world,'' Kim said
before boarding a special plane at Seoul's Sungnam airport.
	   The two leaders will also discuss last month's rocket launch by
North Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the
North has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   On Thursday, Kim and Obuchi are expected to sign a number of
agreements, including one promising the new loans by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan to help small businesses in South
Korea.
	   In May, the government-run bank lent dlrs 1 billion to South
Korean companies. Seoul is currently struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.

Flames, Sharks not happy about trip to Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ The San Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames
open the National Hockey League regular season in Japan, and many
of the players are unhappy about it.
	   ``Ridiculous,'' said Sharks center Bernie Nicholls. ``Absolutely
ridiculous.
	   ``A fast start is so important to having a good year, and we're
traveling what, 10-11 hours, flying across the world, to play two
games in a city that we'll never, ever see again? You tell me this
makes any sense.''
	   Nicholls is not the only player disturbed about the NHL's plan
to help sell hockey overseas by scheduling games Friday and
Saturday in Tokyo.
	   ``The standard rule is that for every hour time change it takes
one day for your body to recover,'' said Calgary's Theoren Fleury.
``Well, the difference between here and Tokyo is 15 hours, or
around two weeks of recovery time.
	   ``Those are two weeks we can't afford to lose.''
	   Nicholls, who worries the trip will hurt the Sharks' chances of
getting into the playoffs, was even more bitter.
	   ``Just another example of western teams getting shafted. They
say that one day we'll see two New York teams going over there to
play ... yeah, sure, not in my lifetime. Us and Calgary and L.A.
and Anaheim and Edmonton and Vancouver, we get the tough travel all
season and then they throw this at us on top of that.
	   ``It's a joke.''
	   If it wasn't rigorous enough for the teams to spend a week in
Tokyo to start the season, both fly home for a single game and then
take to the road again _ the Sharks for three games, Flames four.
	   Flames defenseman Tommy Albelin, who played for Sweden at the
Olympics, also understands the demands of the time change on the
body's physical and emotional clocks.
	   ``Oh, it'll take 10 or 11 days to readjust,'' he warned. ``By
the time we get used to the time change, here to Japan, we'll be
flying home. You'll find yourself waking up at 3 a.m. and not being
able to get back to sleep. It really does mess you up for a
while.''
	   From all reports, the Japanese aren't exactly giddy with
excitement, either, with a top ticket price of $170 and a
nose-diving economy.
	   A year ago, when the Japanese games featured the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks and Canucks, hockey fans in the Far East got a glimpse of
stars Mark Messier, Pavel Bure and Teemu Selanne.
	   This season ... well, there's Fleury.
	   ``That's what I don't understand,'' Albelin added. ``If they
want to send teams, why not well-known ones, like the Rangers or
Red Wings or Maple Leafs? Gretzky or the Stanley Cup champions? I
mean, everyone in Japan has heard of New York.''

Yankees 7, Indians 2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Wells and the Yankees made sure payback
was swift and brutal.
	   A five-run first inning blew Jaret Wright right out of the game,
leaving the Indians with shocked, blank expressions.
	   Wells then stifled Cleveland with eight shutout innings before
faltering in the ninth, and New York began its revenge for last
year's playoff loss with a 7-2 victory Tuesday night in the opener
of the American League championship series.
	   Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada and Scott Brosius
all hit run-scoring singles in the first off Wright, who beat the
Yankees twice in Cleveland's five-game victory last fall.
	   Posada added a sixth-inning homer off Chad Ogea, and Williams
hit a run-scoring double in the seventh as the Yankees won their
fourth straight postseason game and their season-high 11th straight
overall.
	   With their 118th win this year, the Yankees matched the major
league record set by the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who won 116 in the
regular season and two more in the World Series.
	   New York, which had 11 hits, also set a team record with 21
consecutive shutout innings in the postseason, surpassing its 20
scoreless innings against the New York Giants in the 1921 World
Series. The Yankees, who swept Texas in the first round, have
outscored opponents 16-3 so far in the playoffs.
	   David Cone will try to extend the domination Wednesday in Game
2, pitching against Charles Nagy in Yankee Stadium's famous October
twilight shadows.
	   A year ago, the Yankees also won the first game against
Cleveland. But it was hardly dominating, with New York overcoming a
5-0 deficit to win 8-6. This time, the cheers started when Charisse
Strawberry, the wife of stricken outfielder Darryl Strawberry,
threw out the ceremonial first pitch and they didn't stop.
	   The Yankees, still angered that Wright hit Luis Sojo with a
pitch during spring training, fracturing a bone in the infielder's
left hand, made sure right away that the Indians lost the opener of
a postseason series for the eighth consecutive time.
	   Wells, 10-1 at Yankee Stadium during the regular season, may be
funky off the field, but on the mound he's strictly business. He
struck out seven and walked one, leaving after Manny Ramirez hit a
two-run homer with one out in the ninth, just the fifth hit for
Cleveland. He retired 11 in a row at one stretch and 15 of 16.
	   His five-hitter last year gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the
series, and New York was four outs away from beating the Indians in
Game 4 before Sandy Alomar's tying eighth-inning homer off Mariano
Rivera. Cleveland went on win the series and came within two outs
of beating Florida in the World Series.
	   New York, which hasn't trailed in any postseason game this year,
pounced on Wright with four straight singles leading off the first.
	   First, Chuck Knoblauch, then Derek Jeter, then an RBI single by
O'Neill. Pitching coach Mark Wiley came to the mound, trying to
settle the 22-year-old right-hander.
	   Wright, chased by two three-run homers in the first-round opener
against Boston last week, then gave up another RBI single, this
time to Williams.
	   All were hit hard. Just four batters in and Ogea already was
warming up in the bullpen. Whatever magic Wright possessed over New
York last fall was gone.
	   Tino Martinez bounced into a fielder's choice and Tim Raines
struck out, but Wright made it even worse with a wild pitch to
Shane Spencer that allowed O'Neill to score from third.
	   The hot rookie walked and Posada finished off Wright with
another RBI single. Of Wright's 36 pitches, just 18 were strikes.
	   Ogea gave up an RBI single to Brosius, then held the Yankees
until Posada homered leading off the sixth. O'Neill and Williams
chased Ogea with consecutive doubles opening the seventh.

Philippines' Cardinal Sin hospitalized with internal infection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's politically active Roman
Catholic archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, has been hospitalized with
an internal infection, officials said Wednesday.
	   Sin's condition is improving but is still delicate, hospital
officials said.
	   Catholic groups around the country were asked to pray for the
health of the 70-year-old prelate.
	   ``I am recovering pretty well,'' Sin said in a statement.
Jokingly referring to recent problems with Manila's aging water
system, he said his internal ``pipes'' were also old and needed
repair.
	   ``Some of my hydraulic tubes got some bacteria and caused me
some discomforts,'' he said. ``My body tubes are now all right.''
	   Sin must regularly undergo kidney dialysis because of renal
problems. News reports say his overall health has deteriorated in
recent months.
	   Church officials said Sin has an infected peritoneum, the
membrane lining the abdominal cavity that also surrounds internal
organs such as the liver and kidneys. They said Sin had responded
very well to antibiotics.
	   ``It is very unfortunate, so let us all pray for his speedy
recovery,'' President Joseph Estrada said.
	   Sin helped prompt the ouster of strongman Ferdinand Marcos in
1986 when he called for citizens to support a military revolt
against the president. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in
the streets, forcing Marcos from power.
	   He has continued to be heavily involved in political and social
issues. He has opposed efforts by the government to encourage birth
control to reduce the country's rapid population growth rate.
	   Last year Sin led a movement against efforts by supporters of
then President Fidel Ramos to amend the constitution so Ramos could
serve a second term.
	   This year, he urged church members to vote against Estrada in
elections in May, saying he was morally unfit to lead the country
because of a history of heavy drinking and womanizing. Estrada won
the election with a large plurality.
	   The Philippines is Asia's only predominately Catholic country.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A senior U.S. envoy has failed again
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
crackdown in Kosovo, a source said, raising the prospects of NATO
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met Milosevic late Tuesday for a second day,
warning that time is running out to resolve the seven-month crisis.
Neither U.S. nor Yugoslav officials issued any detailed statement
about the talks, but a diplomatic source familiar with the
deliberations said there was ``no change'' in Milosevic's stand.
	   Later Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council declared that the
combatants in the Serbian province had not yet fully complied with
U.N. resolutions demanding a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
special Serb police units. While carrying no legal weight, the
action could fuel calls for military intervention.
