ANKARA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and nine
others wounded Tuesday when a bomb exploded in southeast Turkey,
local Show TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the explosion occurred at noon in the front of
a market in the town of Lice in southeastern Turkey, killing a
young woman and injuring nine people including a soldier.
</P>
<P>
Officials suspected that the young woman, at 18, might be a
Kurdish suicide bomber, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Glass windows of some nearby working places were smashed in the
explosion, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion was not known. The semi-official
news agency Anatolia quoted a wounded as saying that "we saw
flames and smoke coming from the market" as the blast happened.
</P>
<P>
It said an investigation into the explosion is under way.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds have been waging a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey since 1984, and about 37,000 people have been killed in the
conflicts.

<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Central Bank Chairman Viktor

<P>
Geraschenko also said that bank asset shortage at the start

or 38.5 percent of the total assets.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russian banks lost about a third of their

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. gymnast Dominique
Moceanu obtained a protective order against her father Monday,
amid allegations that he was following her and hired a private
investigator to document her moves "down to what I wear each
day."
</P>
<P>
"I'm in fear," Dominique told the press. "He was stalking me
from my school. He bugged my phone. Who knows what he's capable
of? I've lived with him for 17 years. I've seen how violent he
can be."
</P>
<P>
Dominique, who is in hiding in a Houston hotel with her agent
Janey Miller, went to the Houston courts in October to gain her
independence.
</P>
<P>
Her father resisted before granting it to his 17-year-old
daughter. Now, Dominique said her father, Dumitru, attempted to
hire someone to kill her coach Luminita Miscenco, and one of her
friends, Brian Huggins.
</P>
<P>
The father's lawyer said the allegations are false. Dumitru
was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
Houston police spokesman Robert Hurst said an investigation
was conducted into threats by "certain parties" involved in
Dominique's earlier successful attempt to become a legal adult.
</P>
<P>
Hurst wouldn't say who was investigated, because no arrests
were made.
</P>
<P>
There will be a hearing on December 9 to determine if the
order will be made permanent. The order forbids Dumitru from
communicating with his daughter except through his attorney.
</P>
<P>
A violation of the order could lead to the father's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Dominique was a member of the U.S. winning team at the 1996
Olympics and the winner of the all-around event at the Goodwill
Games this year.
</P>
<P>
She said she endured physical and verbal abuse while growing
up. "I used to get hit. Most of the time. My mother hit me
too."

The court, without comment, upheld an arbitrator's ruling that
instead of receiving "special events" compensation because the

umpires were entitled only to that portion of pool payments

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) has appointed John G. Heimann as the first
chairman of the Financial Stability Institute of the BIS, the bank
announced Tuesday in the northern Swiss city of Basle.
</P>
<P>
Heimann will take office on February 1, 1999. He is at present
the chairman of the Global Financial Institutions at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co., Inc., and a member of the firm's Executive Management
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Frederik C. Musch is appointed as the institute's associate
director with immediate effect. He has until now been Secretary
General of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, a position
held since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Stability Institute is a joint initiative of the
BIS and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and was set up
in response to the need to strengthen financial systems worldwide.
Its early focus will be to promote better and more independent
banking, capital market and insurance supervision based on further
implementation of the ore Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Interaction between the private sector, central banks and
supervisory authorities will play an important role in the
institute's activities.
</P>
<P>
Close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and with the Toronto International Leadership Center
for Financial Sector Supervision is envisaged.
</P>
<P>
The BIS hopes that the institute will over time broaden its
coverage to other areas bearing on financial system stability,
including the implementation of core principles currently under
development by international securities, insurance and payment
system regulators.

ALMA ATA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Four men including President
Nursultan Nazarbayev will appear on the election ballot as
candidates for the next president of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The election is scheduled for January 10, 1999, said the
Kazakhstan Central Election Committee (KCEC).
</P>
<P>
The other three are the Communist Party candidate Serikbolsyn
Abdildin, Kazakhstan Customs Committee Chairman Kasymov
Esengelgynovich and upper house member Gabbasov Gabbasovich.
</P>
<P>
From November 10-30, the KCEC examined the qualifications of
eight registered politicians. Four of them including former Prime
Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin and anti-nuclear leader Asilbek
Amantay failed to become legal candidates because they did not
"meet the demands of the Central Election Committee." said the
KCEC.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kazakhstan election law, a presidential candidate
should pass a Kazak language test, get the signatures of at least
170,000 voters from 11 states, and pay 30,000 U.S. dollars in
election funds.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Non-Proliferation to Top Sharif's Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif is to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington Wednesday with the issue of nuclear non-proliferation
expected to top the agenda of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is undertaking what the media here described as "a
crucial visit" to Washington in the "peculiar circumstances," and
the scheduled meeting between Sharif and Clinton is the first
formal one between the two after Pakistan's nuclear tests in May
this year.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Washington's priority agenda during
Sharif's visit is nuclear non-proliferation. The visit was
preceded by several rounds of official and expert-level talks both
in Islamabad and Washington on nuclear-related issues.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue has progressed well," Sharif said in a departure
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's U.S. trip comes in the midst of allegations by Islamic
groups that he will "sell out Pakistan's nuclear capability to the
United States."
</P>
<P>
Qazi Hussain, head of the influential Jamat-e-Islami, has
warned the government against signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) and vowed to foil "all conspiracies against the
national nuclear program."
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, who has
been holding talks with the U.S. on the non-proliferation issue,
said: "the speculation that the prime minister will sign CTBT in
Washington is totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
"We have not and will not barter away our security for economic
gains. There is no question of any compromise on Pakistan's
strategic nuclear and missile programs," Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Clinton had offered Pakistan the
much-needed economic assistance provided it did not respond to
India's nuclear tests in May. However, Pakistan refused to listen
to the U.S. advice, triggering economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Unlike India, Pakistan, whose economy depends largely on
foreign aids, could not sustain the impact of the sanctions and
has agreed to adhere to CTBT by its cutoff date in September 1999
provided "the atmosphere of coercion" is cleared.
</P>
<P>
On November 1, Clinton ordered a partial lifting of some
sanctions against Pakistan which had been in place since 1990. The
U.S. decision also signaled that the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank would revive their over one billion U.S. dollar
assistance program to save this South Asian nation from economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said recently that he wanted to revive the Pakistan-U.S.
relations to a level in the 1960s "when there were no unnecessary
pressure and sanctions against Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan took the nuclear road after India's detonation of a
nuclear device in 1974. When it achieved nuclear capability
despite the West's ban on export of related technology, the U.S.
stopped all military cooperation with Pakistan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Sharif will urge the Clinton
administration to remove all sanctions against Pakistan because
they eroded Pakistan's conventional capability vis-a-vis its rival
neighbor of India and created a "strategic imbalance" in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Islamabad expects progress in four issues
at the Sharif-Clinton talks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hopes Washington would make available some economic
packages to help its efforts at economic recovery and that
military sanctions imposed under the 1990 Pressler Amendment would
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad also wants the U.S. to show high interest and get
involved in the settlement of the Kashmir Issue, which Pakistan
regards as the "core issue" between its relations with India, and
to offer an acceptable solution to the F-16 issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had paid 658 million dollars for 26 F-16 aircraft, but
in October 1990 the U.S. slapped sanctions over Pakistan's alleged
nuclear program and the planes were never delivered while the
first batch was ready in 1993.
</P>
<P>
For Pakistan, an acceptable solution to the protracted F-16
issue is either the return of the money or delivery of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The News, a major English daily, said editorially that "the
people will expect the Prime Minister to deal with all the
critical issues in a manner which adds to the strength, stability
and welfare of the country."
</P>
<P>
"Realism should be the watchword during this crucial visit, but
no decision should be taken under pressure," it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Republicans Seek to Expand Probe to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday opened a hearing on
perjury, while Democrats complained that the Republicans's abrupt
expansion of an impeachment probe against President Bill Clinton
lacked any legitimate purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Campaign finance has no relationship" to the sex-and-lies
report submitted to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
said Representative John Conyers, the ranking member of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, the committee chairman, Representative
Henry Hyde, did not address the abrupt decision to seek to
subpoena secret Clinton administration memos urging Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate the president's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The committee has received information which suggests that the
campaign finance abuse memos may contain allegations of criminal
wrongdoing by the president," Paul McNulty, a spokesman for
Republicans on the panel, said Monday. "The committee is
duty-bound to investigate that information."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart questioned Republicans'
motives.
</P>
<P>
"The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and the Republicans
in the House have finally come clean about what they're up to," he
said. "They have, despite all the protestations that this a
narrow, narrowly focused process looking at what was in the
referral, what it really is is a partisan process designed to
damage the president and investigate the president on any subject
that they see fit to go after."
</P>
<P>
Democrats said the move was proof of Republican desperation.
</P>
<P>
Hyde has "worked totally unilaterally, so it's very clear that
this is a partisan witch hunt that he's determined to ram through
as quickly as he can," Conyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Conyers spoke just after Republicans, who control the Judiciary
Committee 21-16, prepared to subpoena FBI Director Louis Freeh and
federal prosecutor Charles LaBella and gain access to their secret
memos laying out Clinton's alleged fund-raising irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Hyde and other Republicans planned to seek subpoenas in closed
session after the perjury hearing.
</P>
<P>
Republicans had intended for Tuesday's hearing on "the
consequences of perjury and related crimes" to underscore
Clinton's refusal to admit he lied about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The committee's agenda included testimony from legal experts
and military officials, and two witnesses punished for lying about
sex in civil lawsuits.

<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The French bio-pharmaceutical
group Rhone-Poulenc and its German counterpart Hoechst Tuesday
said they will merge the life science part of their groups into a
new company called Aventis.
</P>

<P>
Aventis, which will be incorporated in France and based in
Strasbourg, will be the world's number two life sciences producers
after the Swiss Novartis, after the merger is completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Both Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst will hold half of the new

It said that with an annual research budget of 3 billion U.S.
dollars, Aventis will have one of the best innovative capabilities
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
No plan to lay off employees was announced in the communique.
</P>
<P>
The merger between Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst has become a part
of the wave of mergers engulfing international corporations around
the world.

<P>
Of all the 474 million dollars, 135 million dollars would come
directly from the IMF and the rest of it would be from other
countries in the program.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent released here said Thailand will nearly
double its budget deficit to 5 percent of the GDP in an effort to
help ease the liquidity crunch. Tarin said the new agreement
allows the government to inject 250 billion baht (6.9 billion
dollars), the equivalent of 5 percent of GDP, into the economy.
</P>
<P>
The document said the country is likely to record 7-8 percent
economic contraction this year while it will record 1 percent
growth next year. The foreign reserves were expected to rise to
32-34 billion dollars at the end of 1999 from the current 28.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has suffered its worst-ever economic slump in decades
after the collapse of its financial system. The country
depreciated the baht in July 1997 and entered the IMF program in
August the same year. So far 12 billion dollars has been
disbursed.

<HEADLINE> Albright Calls for Justice for Holocaust Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright called on an international conference on the
fate of Nazi-looted art and property Tuesday to seek justice for
the victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal must be justice," Albright told the conference, which
opened on Monday night at the Holocaust Museum in Washington. The
meeting was attended by more than 40 countries and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference is sponsored by the Museum and the U.S.
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Albright called on all archives around the world to be fully
open to researchers. She didn't mention any country by name nor
did she cite the Vatican, which has refused to open its files.
</P>
<P>
"We must dig to find the truth," she said. "Only by knowing and
being honest about the past can we gain peace in the present and
confidence in the future," she told conference delegates.
</P>
<P>
"Remaining Holocaust survivors have reached an advance stage in
life," said she, stressing the urgency of the problems.
</P>
<P>
Albright recalled that she learned only last year that her
Czech grandparents and other relatives had been killed by Nazi
Germany during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the conference is both about material and moral
matters and she urged delegates to reach consensus on making
restitution for Nazi- looted goods and on educating the public.
</P>
<P>
"It is about much more than gold and art and insurance," she
said. "It's about remembering that no one's blood is less or more
precious than our own."
</P>
<P>
Delegates are dealing with material and moral questions from a
period in which Nazi Germany killed six million Jews and looted
billions of dollars in gold, art and private and communal property
across Europe.

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil giants Exxon and
Mobil announced here on Tuesday that they agreed to a 77.2 billion
U.S. dollar merger deal, the largest industrial merger case
leading to the creation of the world's number one energy company.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two companies said: "This merger will
enhance our ability to be an effective global competitor in a
volatile world economy and in an industry that is more and more
competitive."
</P>
<P>
Exxon and Mobil have a market value of 177 billion U.S. dollars
and 61 billion dollars respectively. Their combined market value
will be well above that of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, currently the
world's largest oil and gas company.
</P>
<P>
Exxon and Mobil have a total of over 120,000 employees and a
revenue of 200 billion dollars in 1997, involving in oil and
natural gas exploration, extraction, refining, chemicals
production and retailing in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement came four days after the two companies
confirmed that their merger talks were continuing. The action was
taken under the worsening situation of low oil prices amid low
demand as a result of the contagion of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Exxon and Mobil, forecast to face a drastic fall in their
earnings this year, are trying to save costs through the
combination.
</P>
<P>
The deal, under which Exxon will acquire Mobil, tops British
Petroleum's planned 58.5 billion dollar purchase of U.S. Amoco as
the largest industrial merger.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move would herald similar acquisitions in the
oil industry and would change the scenario of the world energy
industry.

<HEADLINE> 270,000 Angolans HIV Positive: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- There are 270,000 HIV positive
people in Angola, Angolan Deputy Health Minister Teresa Cohen
said here Tuesday, on the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
"The figure shows how serious the situation is in Angola" with
a population of 10 million people, said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
Cohen stressed that the level of people's living and education
is greatly linked with their sufferings from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
She called upon the Angolan government to go all out to put
people's education on AIDS prevention as priority.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister announced that from Tuesday on, people can
call "111", a special telephone number in the country to acquire
knowledge of AIDS for consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Cohen noted the theme of this year's World AIDS Day -- "young
people -- a new force in the fight against AIDS."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that young people aged from 10 to 20 years
account for 30 percent of the total population in underdeveloped
countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the deputy minister called upon the Angolan youths
to respect the status of AIDS patients and the HIV positive
people in both families and the society and their rights to work,
and to help them fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Cohen quoted a document from the United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as saying that there are now 33.4 million
people who have been infected with HIV/AIDS, and 70 percent of
them are living in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS document added that AIDS is killing people at the
rate of 11 per minute, or 16,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) also said that so far in
1998, 2.5 million people have been killed by AIDS, and 83 percent
of the victims were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
December 1 was set as the World AIDS Day at the International
Conference on AIDS in London in 1988.

<HEADLINE> France to Join U.S. Mars Exploration Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- France will join the U.S. project
exploring the Mars by sending an orbiter to the red planet in
2005, said French Minister of National Education and Science
Research Claude Allegre on Monday.
</P>
<P>
France will spend 2.5 billion francs (420 million U.S. dollars)
in the program to cooperate with the United States in the
exploration, the daily Le Monde Tuesday quoted Allegre as saying.
</P>
<P>
France and the United States will sign a memorandum of
understanding on the sending by France of an orbiter with the
Ariane rocket to the Mars in 2005, in order to bring back to earth
soil samples from the planet.
</P>
<P>
An American landing machine and an American robot will be flown
on the orbiter to the Mars. The robot will collect the samples.
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA),
Daniel Goldin, asked France to provide an Ariane-5 rocket in the
Martial exploration when he visited France in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The French National Center of Space Study (CNES) agreed to the
U.S. request because it now has a budget for its 2000-2005 working
plan and beyond, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The United States is spending 11 billion francs (1.8 billion
U.S.dollars) on the Mars exploration plan.
</P>
<P>
France joined the U.S.-Russian joined space exploration by
sending two astronauts to the ``Mir'' space station by U.S. space
aircraft in 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges Assistance to Nations Fighting AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
marked World AIDS Day Tuesday by pledging a package of assistance
to nations to fight against the spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced 10 million U.S. dollars in grants for
the care of AIDS orphans and a 30 percent increase in funding to
the National Institutes of Health for research on HIV prevention
and treatment around the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assistance will largely go to Africa, where the United
Nations AIDS program estimates that nearly eight million children
have been orphaned by AIDS and at least one million children are
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is sending his AIDS policy adviser, Sandy Thurman, to
southern Africa to gather facts about AIDS orphans to see what the
United States will do to respond to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Agency for International Development projects that as many
as 40 million children will be orphaned by AIDS by 2010, with 90
percent of them in developing countries that lack the resources to
care for them. In the United States alone, about 80,000 children
have lost a parent to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The grants, administered by USAID, will be used to provide
training for foster families, schooling for orphans, vocational
training and other assistance. Also, USAID will work on improving
medical care given children infected with HIV, and preventing the
transfer of the virus from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
For AIDS in the United States, Vice President Al Gore was to
announce 200 million dollars for housing assistance for AIDS
patients and their families. And Clinton was highlighting an
earlier announcement of 156 million dollars toward fighting AIDS
among U.S. minorities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress also has approved a funding increase of 315
million dollars for a range of HIV/AIDS programs.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against Turkish Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Tuesday protested
against new violations of its air space by Turkish fighters.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Cyprus' permanent representative to the U.N. Sotos Zackheos
condemned the violations of its air space on November 19, 20 and
21 by Turkish warplanes .
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot diplomat termed the Turkish violations as
"provocative" and "against the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the frequency and intensity of these airspace
violations are a further reminder of Turkey's offensive disregard
of international law, the U.N. Charter and all relevant decisions
of the organization on the question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Zackheos also stressed that "these continuing overflights by
the Turkish Air Force, as well as the presence of the Turkish
military occupation forces on the island, constitute the
underlying causes of tension in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Namibian
opposition leader Mishake Muyongo and 103 other Namibians have
appeared briefly before a Botswanan magistrate's court, Southern
African Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo and his countrymen, who crossed into Botswana last
month from northeastern Namibia, claimed that they were being
harassed by the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
They have not been asked to plead and the case has been
adjourned to give the police more time to carry out tests on
weapons seized from some of the Namibians. Their cases have been
postponed till December 11, SABA said.
</P>
<P>
At least 718 Namibians were reported to have crossed into
Botswana from Caprivi, Namibia, since early last month.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is negotiating
with Botswanan authorities to verify if they are genuine
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said last week that Muyongo and
his companions were guilty of murder and treason.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has sent a strong signal to Botswana, saying that
Namibia expects the group to be deported to stand trial in
Namibia.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's Prince
Khuzulwandle has accused South Africa of refusing to cooperate
with his government in resolving a border dispute between the two
countries, South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland was reportedly claiming vast areas of land in South
Africa's Mpumalanga Province, and Ingwavuma in Northern KwaZulu
Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The claim, pursued by the late Swazi King Subhuza II during
his 62-year reign and since pursued by King Mswati III, refers to
former Swazi territory annexed by and given to South Africa
during the colonial era when Swaziland was a British
protectorate.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Premier of
Mpumalanga Province Mathews Phosa said last month that Swaziland
must forget its land claims.
</P>
<P>
However, Khuzulwandle, also chairman of Swaziland's Border
Adjustment Committee, said Swaziland would persist until the land
was returned.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's entire agricultural
sector is estimated to grow by 3.2 percent this year with most
crops registering reduced yields because of the initial
uncertainty over the impact of the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Tuesday said in its annual report
that maize output is estimated at 1.46 million tons this year, a
decrease of 19.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year's cotton crop is estimated at 300,000 tons, an
increase of 11.1 percent but prices are still below farmers'
expectations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco, the country's biggest foreign currency earner, has
been low despite the generally better quality crop of 210 million
kilograms, a 7.7 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
The importance of horticulture as a foreign currency earner
had been growing rapidly and 10,951 tons of cut flowers were
exported during the 1997/98 season, generating 50 million U.S.
Dollars. Exports of other horticultural produce realized 23
million Dollars, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Sudan Discuss Cooperation in Judicial Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Justice
Farouk Seif el-Nasr held talks Tuesday with his Sudanese
counterpart Ali Osman Yassin on cooperation in the legal and
judicial areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, the Sudanese official
said that Egypt has expressed readiness to extend assistance to
Sudan in training judicial personnel.
</P>
<P>
Yassin underlined Sudan's keenness on promoting cooperation
with Egypt in various domains.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
against President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants who
began a violent campaign in 1992 to topple Mubarak's secular
government and install a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
A thaw in the bilateral ties seems to have set in in
recent years after the two neighbors expressed readiness to
improve their relations and exchanged visits by officials.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held earlier in the day, Yassin said that
his country is committed to the Arab anti-terrorism agreement,
which it has signed.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Sudan's willingness to cooperate with all other Arab
countries in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries signed their first ever joint anti-terrorism
agreement last April, under which the signatories should exchange
information about terrorist acts and extradite terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opposes any possible attempts by the signatory
parties to organize, finance, commit or take part in terrorist
acts against any other party in any way.
</P>
<P>
Yassin arrived here during the weekend for the two-day 14th
session of the Arab Justice Ministers Council opening Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 76 Rwanda Genocide Suspects Freed: RNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-six genocide suspects
were released from Rilima Prison, south of capital Kigali, for
lack of enough evidence for charges or incomplete files, Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those freed are among the first of 10,000 genocide suspects
the current Rwandan government has decided to set free on similar
grounds.
</P>
<P>
For May this year, the local criminal court of Nyamata had
registered 138 detainees without files, but 62 of them were later
completed.
</P>
<P>
Rilima Prison hosts 7,604 inmates, 273 of whom are former
Rwandan government soldiers, charged with involvement in killing
more than 500,000 people in 1994 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 125,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons and communal lock-ups, waiting for trial, RNA
said, in a special dispatch to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The recent decision by the government to release 10,000
suspects without complete files had raised temper among
organizations catering for genocide survivors who claim that they
have been betrayed, and that there is no fair justice.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan authorities have reassured them by saying
that the release is not definite since if enough evidence is
produced against them by their neighbors, they could be thrown
back into jail again and punished.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Fugitive former Zimbabwean
President Canaan Banana will be brought back to the country if he
is located in South Africa where he was reportedly seen Monday, a
senior government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official who refused to be named, said the Zimbabwean
police and Interpol have already been informed of Banana's
presence in South Africa, and efforts are being made to bring him
back to Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Banana is believed to have crossed into South Africa from
neighboring Botswana where he hid before his conviction last week
by the Zimbabwean high court on all the sodomy, attempted sodomy
and indecent assault charges brought against him.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwean police and Interpol are working together to
bring Banana back to the country as soon as possible and they
will not give him the chance to fly to south America as rumored,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The former president, who was head of state since independence
in 1980 up to 1987, skipped bail.
</P>
<P>
On allegations that the state let Banana run away, the
official said it was false, adding that if he was brought back,
he would be sentenced just like any other offender.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is above the law and justice should prevail in a
democratic country despite one's social status," said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Tackle Trade Deficit With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will try its best to
deal with its trade deficit issue with Japan, a senior government
official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus saw its imports from Japan this year stand at about 100
million Cyprus pounds (about 200 million U.S. dollars), but its
exports to Japan only around 500,000 pounds (about one million
dollars), said Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos
Rolandis after meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Cyprus Kazuo
Matsumoto.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis is expected to visit Japan next June, during which he
will discuss with Japanese officials trade issues, as well as more
Japanese investments in Cyprus' industrial, high technology and
service fields.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he would seek ways to attract more Japanese
tourists to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Rolandis also raised the issue of second-hand
Japanese cars exported to Cyprus and asked for clarifications as
to whether they are up to European Union (EU) standards.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there has been a sharp increase in the
number of Japanese second-hand cars exported to Cyprus as they are
cheaper than others, especially than those from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said that in the future all exports to Cyprus must be
of European standards.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in July 1990 and started its
accession talks with the EU last March.

<HEADLINE> Steps to Restore Confidence in Economy Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National Chamber
of Commerce Tuesday urged the government to take immediate
measures to restore confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said in a statement released here that a repeat of
this year's negative developments will turn the country into a
haven for social and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
It said the government must make public how it was funding its
involvement in the Democratic Republic of Congo and ensure that
the intervention does not severely impact on budgetary targets.
</P>
<P>
It urged the government to implement land reforms as agreed by
all stake-holders at the land donor conference in September.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, investigations into widespread corruption within
the national oil company should be stepped up and the findings
made public," the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up efforts to recover millions of Dollars looted from
the War Victims Compensation Fund and the National Housing Fund
would also help rebuild business confidence, the business
organization said.
</P>
<P>
"All those who looted from the funds, including government
ministers, should be prosecuted," it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the minister of finance and the governor of the
Reserve Bank should make regular statements to the nation on the
performance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The government has already received similar demands from the
labor movement which has threatened to defy the presidential ban
of mass job stay-aways if negotiation between the government,
labor and private sector fail.

<HEADLINE> ZCCM Makes Profit of $15M in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) said Tuesday that it has made an operating profit of
29.3 billion Kwacha or 15 million U.S. Dollars for the third
quarter ending September 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, ZCCM, one
of the world's largest copper conglomerates, recorded an
operating loss of 42.6 billion Kwacha (about 22 million Dollars),
the company announced in a statement issued in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambia News Agency ZANA, the statement attributed
the profit during the reporting period to higher cobalt sales
volumes and to lower unit operating costs.
</P>
<P>
However, the group's copper production in the period under
review was 64,171 tons, which was lower than the 80,677 tons
recorded in the corresponding quarter of the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
The statement explained that the shortfall in the copper
production was mainly attributed to the exclusion of two
newly-privatized mines of the conglomerate, which is facing
complete privatization.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Activists Clash with Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of an Israeli peace
group Tuesday clashed with the police in the controversial Har
Homa construction area in east Jerusalem as they tried to halt a
bidding tour on the site.
</P>
<P>
The clashed took place as several Israeli contractors
interested in Har Homa building project toured the site in a
convoy of cars, reported the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Peace Now Movement members protesting against the
construction plan tried to approach the site but were stopped by
the police.
</P>
<P>
Three Peace Now members were then detained during their clashes
with the police.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government planned to build 6,500 houses for Jews
at Har Homa in the traditionally Arab east Jerusalem captured by
Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The move was regarded provocative by the Palestinians, who want
to establish an independent state in the future with east
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It was the Israeli decision to break ground at Har Homa for
Jewish settlement expansion in March 1997 that brought the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process to a 19-month deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Israeli National Infrastructure Ministry announced on Tuesday
that it has authorized the construction of 480 housing units in
the Jewish settlement of Kohav Yaacov, northwest of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Palestinian Council Speaker Abu Ala Tuesday called
on all the Palestinians to join the struggle against Jewish
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Greece Dismisses Turkish Accusation Over Kurdish Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday dismissed
Turkey's accusation against Athens over the country's stance on
the Kurdish problem and Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Ankara's accusation against Greece did
not help Turkey itself, which remained trapped in its own foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Monday attacked the recent
statements made by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis concerning
the Kurdish problem. The Premier rejected the Turkish claim that
the Kurdish problem was a one-sided "terrorist" problem.
</P>
<P>
Reppas pointed out that the Kurdish problem was primarily a
political issue which Turkey should resolve by political means.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Italian government's handling of the Ocalan
issue as "very responsible," he said that the Italians must be
encouraged to help them find the correct solution.
</P>
<P>
A Rome court has refused a Turkish request for Ocalan's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Greece supported Italy to extend the
political asylum to Ocalan who is currently under house arrest in
Italy after his arrival in Rome some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Greece has recently been in touch with other European Union
(EU) countries on the Ocalan issue with a view to holding a
meeting on the Kurdish problem.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Proposes Two-tier EU Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said on Tuesday that he thought a two-tier structure
for the European Commission would solve the problem of too many
European Commissioners after EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Cook Proposed that the new structure should take a copy of the
the British government, which has a Secretary of State and a
Minister of State, effectively second in command, at most
departments.
</P>
<P>
"One way to proceed would be for some of the commissioners to
have a higher status with some operating, as in the British
system, as a Minister of State," he told the parliamentary Foreign
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be negotiated very delicately so they were
not seen as inferior or superior positions."
</P>
<P>
There are currently 20 commissioners in the European
Commission, with all EU member states having at least one
commissioner and larger countries two.
</P>
<P>
In the first wave of the commission's enlargement, six
countries are being considered for the new membership. That might
make the commission too large.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Youth Hold Key to Curbing HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- With HIV/AIDS still
spreading like wildfire in the developing world, governments and
communities need to recognize that young people are the key to
containing the disease, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the World AIDS Day, December 1, Carol Bellamy,
Executive Director of UNICEF, said that "the future course of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic lies in the hands of young people."
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely vital that we do everything necessary to arm
them with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and their
communities," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released last week by the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), of the 6 million people
newly infected this year with virus that causes AIDS, half are
between the ages of 15 and 24 -- the equivalent of nearly five
young men and women every minute.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said HIV/AIDS was "well on its way to wiping out the
substantial reductions in child mortality that were achieved in
the 1980s and in the first part of this decade," adding that "the
disease seems all but certain to produce 40 million new orphans by
early in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the spread of HIV/AIDS in the developing world is
a medical and social emergency that grows out of a wholesale
violation of the fundamental rights of young people and children.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said vulnerable countries need assistance and resources
to build health system capable of coping with the effects of the
disease, including measures that will help reduce the risk that
mothers already infected with the virus will transmit it to their
infants.
</P>
<P>
"Poor countries need more than encouragement. They need income
support, debt relief and strong social safety nets," she said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS, Poor Health Care Service Disastrous to Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nafis Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), on Tuesday
called for urgent attention to the unmet need for reproductive
health care among the largest-ever generations of young people.
</P>
<P>
Those in the age brackets of 15 to 24 years old make up one
half of the 5.8 million people infected in 1998 with HIV, the
virus causes AIDS, the executive director said, adding that in
sub-saharan Africa, where the epidemic is wiping out decades of
development gains, about 5,500 persons succumb to AIDS every day.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the UNFPA chief coincided with the World AIDS
Day, which falls on Tuesday, whose theme this year is "Youth:
Force for Change."
</P>
<P>
"Half of all new HIV infections are of young people between the
ages of 15 and 24," Sadik said, "This in itself underlines the
urgency of this year's theme."
</P>
<P>
While young people's efforts are crucial to stopping the spread
of HIV, they shoulder the bulk of the effect of the increasingly
unmet need for reproductive health care services and education in
life skills, she said. "Reproductive health programs have a
crucial role to play in HIV/AIDS prevention."
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the United Nations Population Fund is that
while the HIV/AIDS problem inflicts a heavy toll on young people.
they are at the same time very much part of the solution to the
epidemic," she said, "Educating young people before they put
themselves at risk is the only way to promote safer sexual
practices, including voluntary abstinence, before it is too late."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, UNFPA supported HIV/AIDS prevention activities in 132
countries, compared to 124 in 1996 and 41 in 1991. The Fund's
spending on these activities increased to an estimated 22 million
U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA-backed programs in most countries in 1997 targeted young
people. No fewer than 96 countries received support for HIV/AIDS
prevention activities for this group. Activities for young people
included integration of HIV/AIDS prevention modules into in-school
and out-of-school education programs.

BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
meet a delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) on Wednesday to talk about issues on Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Saddam's Deputy Appears Before Foreign Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- In his first appearance before
foreign media since last month's assassination attempt, Iraq's
No. 2 figure, Izzat Ibrahim, laid a wreath to the Martyr's
Monument here Tuesday on behalf of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, vice chairman of the powerful Revolutionary Command
Council, did not speak to reporters at the ceremony marking the
Martyr's Day.
</P>
<P>
As Saddam's deputy, Ibrahim narrowly escaped an assassination
attempt against him late last month in Karbala, a holy shrine of
the Shiite Muslim some 50 kilometers south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, a Sunni himself, was attending a religious ceremony on
behalf of Saddam when two hand grenades were thrown toward him. He
was unhurt, but his body guards and some people nearby were
injured.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt coincided with a meeting of 16 Iraqi
opposition groups in London, in which British and U.S. officials
pledged support for their struggle to topple Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
The Martyr's Day on December 1 is dedicated to those who lost
their lives in the eight years of war with neighboring Iran in the
1980s. The ceremony was attended by Iraqi leaders, ministers and
foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Iraqi News Agency reported that
President Saddam chaired a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the ruling Baath Party Tuesday to discuss the
current situation and the country's major tasks.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not give any details of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Defends Military Presence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Minister for Defense
Steven Kavuma reaffirmed Tuesday afternoon that his country's
military presence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) is to guarantee national security.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Kavuma said the Ugandan
troops are also there to prevent the occurence of genocide.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will pull out of DRC as soon as its security concerns
are properly addressed and it is assured that no genocide is to
occur there, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a mutual understanding between the governments of
Uganda and Congo (k), Uganda began to send troops to eastern DRC
one year before the August 2 rebellion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Zairean leader Mobutu Sese Seko supported and trained
rebels who fought against the Ugandan government. That is why
Uganda hoped that DRC President Laurent Kabila can solve the
border security issue when he, with the help of Uganda and
Rwanda, came to power in May 1997, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted recent reports that the Ugandan army recruited
street children, saying the report is laughable and explained
that it is against Uganda's policy to recruit soldiers against
their will.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the minister asserted, Uganda has enough
mature soldiers, so it does not need to use street children who
do not have much fighting capacity.
</P>
<P>
When asked if they will fight Zimbabwean troops in DRC, he
said: "We have no intention to fight against our brothers in
Zimbabwe, but we will defend if attacked."
</P>
<P>
"We have the will, means, capacity to defend Uganda from
aggression. If anyone makes the mistake of attacking us, we will
deal with them," the Ugandan minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma also revealed that infrastructure in northern Uganda is
being improved and the army is being equipped for the purpose of
dealing with the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
Since the Tutsi rebellion in early August, Kabila has accused
Uganda of fomenting and backing the rebels who fought to topple
his government and of invading his country, a charge Kampala
immediately denied.
</P>
<P>
Kabila deems Uganda and Rwanda as aggressors and asks them to
leave his country while the latter demand all foreign troops,
including the allied forces who are fighting alongside Kabila's
army, to withdraw from of the country at the same time because
the DRC crisis is an internal issue.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Girls More Vulnerable to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Lady Janet
Museveni said Tuesday that girls in the country are more
vulnerable to HIV and AIDS and therefore need more care in this
aspect.
</P>
<P>
Janet Museveni made the remarks at a function held here in the
capital to mark the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of girls get pregnant before their 18th
birthday, she said, adding that girls' infections with AIDS
double those of their male counterparts, but she did not
elaborate on the causes for that.
</P>
<P>
She called for non-governmental organizations and the
international community to do more to eliminate the epidemic from
the world and said the function is aimed to sensitize people
about the dangers of the pandemic and to find remedies.
</P>
<P>
Without youth, the most productive age group, there will be no
hope for Uganda, she said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Health Phillip Byaruhanga reaffirmed the
government's political and financial commitments to the fight
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was discovered in Uganda in 1982, and
500,000 people in the country, most of them young
people, have died of the disease up to now.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for World AIDS Day is focused on the youth.
Globally, 7,000 young people aged between 10 and 24 are infected
with HIV every day.

<HEADLINE> AL Renews Call for Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tensions in south
Lebanon, Arab League Tuesday renewed its call for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal as a way to realize peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made here by the organization's Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid in a meeting with outgoing Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
His call came as Israeli military brass and cabinet members are
threatening to strike Lebanon's infrastructures in retaliation for
the recent killings of seven Israeli soldiers by resistance
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the roadside bomb attacks. The latest
casualties brought the death toll of Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon to 23 since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said the situation in south Lebanon is very dangerous,
and called Israel's self-styled security zone there "a zone
without security."
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the border strip in 1985 after two invasions,
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance spearheaded by Hezbollah has
been fighting against Israeli forces and its Lebanese allies.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that Israel's unconditional withdrawal from
Lebanon, as called for by the international community, is urgently
needed.
</P>
<P>
Israel offered in April to withdraw from south Lebanon on
condition that Lebanon makes arrangements to guarantee the
security Israel's north territory.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the "conditional" proposal, demanding that
Israel leave the country without any preconditions, as stipulated
in the U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Meguid arrived here Monday night on a personal visit to launch
his book "the Age of Defeat and Victory" published by a Lebanese
newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Justice Minister Shabib
al-Maliki Tuesday termed as "successful" the 14th session of the
Arab Justice Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving here for Baghdad,
al-Maliki said the outcome of the session reflected Arab
countries' keenness on maintaining cooperation in the legal and
judicial fields.
</P>
<P>
The Arab council, which ended its two-day annual session
Monday, discussed the drafting of an agreement for fighting
organized crimes across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
As a major achievement of the session, the participating
countries agreed to set up a committee for promoting the
implementation of an Arab anti-terrorism agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries which have not signed the agreement were
urged to do so as soon as possible, al-Maliki added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached last April at a joint meeting of the
councils of Arab justice ministers and interior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the signatories are required to exchange
information about terrorist activities and extradite terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opposes any possible attempts of the signatory
parties to organize, finance, commit or take part in terrorist
acts against any other party in any way.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki, who arrived here on Saturday for the meeting, said
that during his stay in Cairo, he also discussed with his Egyptian
counterpart Farouk Seif al-Nasr issues related to an agreement on
bilateral cooperation in the judicial field.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Judiciary Committee Approves New Subpoenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
representatives' Judiciary Committee voted on Tuesday to expand
its impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton by issuing
subpoenas for two Justice Department memos on the White House
campaign fund-raising irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The committee also voted to subpoena the authors of the two
memos, FBI Director Louis Freeh and former head of the campaign
finance investigative task force Charles LaBella, to testify in
closed-door depositions.
</P>
<P>
In addition the committee approved a subpoena requiring
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to furnish all the documents and
evidence related to the campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
The subpoenas were made in the midst of a hearing planned to
underscore the seriousness of perjury. The Judiciary Committee
voted 20-15 along party lines.
</P>
<P>
"It's my worry that this is becoming an impeachment inquiry in
search of a high crime," said the panel's senior Democrat, John
Conyers.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, said he still hoped to wrap
up the inquiry by the end of the month but felt "duty bound" to
explore "anything else that comes to our attention."
</P>
<P>
Republicans on the committee said they believed the campaign
finance memos, long sought by Congress, might contain evidence of
illegal acts by Clinton during his 1996 re-election campaign, but
Democrats charged it was a desperate act to reinvigorate a failing
impeachment drive.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan's Oil Output Sets Record This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) - Turkmenistan's oil output in the
year is expected to exceed five million tones, breaking a record
over the past seven years, the Ministry for Oil and Gas Industry
and Mineral Resources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, oil output of
Turkmenneft's state oil company in January-November 1998 averaged
about 17,500 tons each day. Before the end of the year the overall
output will be 5.5 million tones.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the production volumes of foreign
companies, a total of 6,5 million tons of oil will be produced on
Turkmen territory this year, the Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen oil industry is going through a revival, said the
Ministry. The production volume in the past two years has been
rising by about 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The start of this decade marked a crisis for Turkmenistan's oil
sector. Production volumes fell to a little more than four million
tons each year.
</P>
<P>
In opinion of Deputy Prime Minister Batyr Sardzhayev, in charge of
the oil and gas sector, the country's oil output will grow to 50
million tons in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan's oil reserves, including the Caspian offshore
fields, are estimated at 12 billion tons, he said.

<HEADLINE> Annual AIDS Infections in EU Around 30,000, Says EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- European epidemiologists
estimate the annual number of new AIDS infections within the
European Union (EU) to be around 30,000, said European
Commissioner Padraig Flynn on the occasion of World AIDS Day,
December 1.
</P>
<P>
This figure, he said, has not fallen over the last two years,
indicating that efforts at prevention is taking time.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 500,000 people in the European Union have
the HIV virus, Flynn said. Since the epidemic began, nearly
200,000 cases of AIDS have been declared within the Union, 60
percent of whom are known to have died.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the incidence of AIDS has steadily declined in all
the EU member states thanks to the availability of new
anti-retroviral treatment which prevent or delay the onset of the
disease among the HIV-positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
When recalling the EU's commitment to combat AIDS, Flynn said
"we must continue our efforts unremittingly, coordinating
activities under different policies and bringing together all the
players involved: the health professionals, patients'
associations, the authorities, and non-governmental and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU' executive body, has provided
so far this year financial support totaling 10 million European
currency units (about 11 million US dollars) to some 40 projects
or European networks under a five-year program for prevention of
AIDS and other communicable diseases, according to Flynn.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday in his message to U.S. President Bill Clinton praised
efforts made by the international community to promote the Middle
East peace process and development.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's message reads that "Assistance to the economic and
social development of the Palestinian autonomy boosts the
negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president praised the contributions made by the
United States, the European Union and other large donors to the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We will energetically support the implementation of the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements and the upcoming talks of extreme
importance on determining the status of the Palestinian
territories," Yeltsin said in his message.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed readiness for "effectively using the
mechanisms of the Russian-U.S. co-sponsorship at this highly
important stage in the Middle Eastern settlement."
</P>
<P>
The president Tuesday also sent a message to the conference in
support of the Middle East peace process and development.
</P>
<P>
Greeting the participants in the forum which was convened after
signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Memorandum in Washington,

He noted that now as never before "there is a need for joint
efforts to consolidate positive changes and implement the
agreements."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Release Pinochet-related Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday it will declassify and make public documents relating to
human rights abuses during the rule of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"The administration is conducting a review of documents in its
possession that may shed light on human rights abuses during the
Pinochet era," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told a news briefing that "We will declassify and make
public as much information as possible consistent" with U.S. laws
and law enforcement needs.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups have been pressing the United States to
take a stand on the case of Pinochet who was arrested in London on
October 16 following a request from a Spanish judge who wants him
to face charges of murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
They have also called for the United States to release
documents pertaining to the period when the former leader ruled
Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration still did not have an opinion on the
merits of the case, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman stressed that the United States has a
record of strongly condemning abuses that occurred during
Pinochet's rule.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also reiterated that the views of a democratic country
like Chile in this case must be given "respect." Chile is trying
to persuade Britain not to extradite Pinochet to Spain.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Follows Wall Street Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets saw the
biggest slide for some weeks Tuesday following a decline in the
value of shares on Wall Street and many Asian markets overnight.
</P>
<P>
London's leading shares suffered their third biggest ever
points fall as 36.1 billion pounds was wiped off the value of the
FTSE-100 Index.
</P>
<P>
The 3.6 percent fall -- of 206.4 to 5,537.5 -- was the biggest
percentage loss this year and came as a result of two gloomy
surveys and a huge bout of profit taking.
</P>
<P>
After Monday's close -- down more than 100 points -- the index
was further worried by slides in foreign stock markets and fresh
research showing manufacturing output falling.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe a fall on Wall Street and a wave of profit
warnings and redundancy announcements compounded the problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new poll from the Confederation of British
Industry showed recessionary fears spreading and confidence
falling in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
A further weakening of the dollar, a driving force behind the
German market's rally last week, sent shares diving through key
support levels.
</P>
<P>
The leading Dax index closed down 241 points at 4,782 while the
later-trading Xetra Dax was down 244 points at the same level late
in trade.
</P>
<P>
French shares tumbled as a weaker dollar against European
currencies and overnight falls on U.S. and Asian stock markets
bruised sentiment across European equity markets.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index closed down 155 points at 3,688.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Marking the 11th World AIDS
Day here Tuesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a range of
measures to cut the spread of AIDS and slow the growing world
population of children orphaned by the disease.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced that it would devote 10 million U.S.
Dollars to help orphans stay in school, assisting them with food
and job-training, and prepare people in their communities to
become foster parents.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. estimates, nearly 8 million children have
been orphaned by AIDS and at least 1 million children are infected
with the virus. 90 percent of them are now living in southern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agency for International Development projects that as
many as 40 million children worldwide will become orphans by 2010
as AIDS claims their parents. Sandra Thurman, the White House AIDS
policy adviser, will lead a U.S. delegation to southern Africa to
evaluate the situation there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. National Institutes of Health will create
an international network to share information about research on
how to control the spread of HIV among adults and from mothers
to newborns.
</P>
<P>
At home, NIH plans to spend an added 47 million U.S. Dollars
on efforts to develop AIDS vaccines, thus bring NIH's total
investment on such research to 200 million U.S. Dollars. Vice
President Al Gore announced 200 million U.S. Dollars for housing
assistance for AIDS patients and their families. Besides these
efforts, U.S. Congress has approved funding increases for a
range of HIV/AIDS programs.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Iraq's Oil Industry in Tatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIRKUK, NORTHERN IRAQ, December 2 (Xinhua) -- With more than
1,000 oil wells and high yield of crude, Kirkuk, some 300
kilometers north of capital Baghdad, once earned its name of a
city "floating on the sea of oil."
</P>
<P>
But it no longer is. Past glories of the important oil city are
nowhere to be found. What often meet the eye are dilapidated
installations, poorly-maintained wells and rusty pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago as the Gulf War was waged to end Iraqi
occupation of neighboring Kuwait, the city and its oil fields were
the main targets of air strikes of the U.S.-led allied forces.
Most of the facilities fell victim to the showers of bombs in the
"Desert Storm," said Ashur Talal, general manager of Kirkuk-based
Iraq North Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
After the war ended, Kirkuk's suffering was prolonged by the
ensuing U.N. sanctions, which became eight years old earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Talal told Xinhua that the lack of spare parts is the major
problem facing the country and his company, and many oil wells had
to be shut for this reason.
</P>
<P>
"we need at least 100 million U.S. dollars to innovate our
facilities, but many of our contracts signed with foreign
companies have not been approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee,"
he complained.
</P>
<P>
A blanket trade embargo was slapped on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. made an exception by allowing
Baghdad to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months since December 1996 to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling was raised to 5.2 billion dollars in the fourth
phase, which expired on December 25, and a fifth phase has been
extended.
</P>
<P>
But the ruined oil installations made Iraq virtually impossible
to produce that much. In the fourth phase, the country had to
settle for only 3.3 billion dollars in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council decided in June to allow Iraq to
import 300 million dollars worth of direly-needed spare parts to
revamp its oil installations.
</P>
<P>
But so far, only a batch of spare parts have arrived. And the
managers of oil refineries complained that they could not find
anything useful for them in the shipments because the spare parts
were only for oil production, not refining.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's daily oil output has dwindled to today's 2.6 million
barrels from 3.2 million prior to the sanctions, while its daily
exports dropped to 1.7 million barrels from 2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Iraq exports its crude largely through two pipelines linking
Kirkuk and Turkey, which were reopened in December 1996 after six
years of suspension under the sanctions. But their transfer
capacity has sharply declined for lack of spare parts and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions not only damaged Iraq's oil production and
exports, but also weakened its refining capacity. Such vicious
circle would surely destroy Iraq's economic lifeline - oil
industry," Talal said.

Commerce (ICC), Tung said: "As a staunch supporter of free market
and free trade, Hong Kong fully shares the Chamber's objective to
promote market economy and the free flow of trade in goods and
services in the world economy."

Business Council will give the Hong Kong business community a
voice in global trade policy debate.

<P>
The Chief Executive said the establishment of the business
council would promote Hong Kong's business interest overseas and
foster business relations with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed Council has 46 members, including companies,
associations and chambers of commerce in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S. for Operation Plan 5027 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) condemned "Operation Plan 5027" on
Tuesday, which it said was revealed by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK criticized the plan as an attempt to "launch a second
Korean war."
</P>
<P>
The United States has been loudly proclaiming the idea that
"tensions have been heightened," attributing the cause to the
DPRK's "underground nuclear facility," which in fact does not
exist, said a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean
People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking a pretext to ignite the war
against the DPRK based on the five-stage "Operation Plan 5027, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has always held to the position of averting a war
while making full preparations for a possible conflict, he
said. "We neither want nor avoid a war. If a war is imposed, we
will never miss the opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman threatened the DPRK will answer the planned
U.S. attack by launching an unlimited strike against
"U.S. aggression forces," "South Korean puppets" and targets in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There is no limit to the strike of our people's army
and that on this planet there is no room for escaping the strike."

<HEADLINE> Gregory Not to Gamble on Merson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Aston Villa manager John Gregory will resist the temptation to
gamble a half fit Paul Merson in a Premiership clash with
Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Gregory is awaiting the results of Merson's visit to a
specialist to determine the extent of a back problem which first
flared up during England's build-up to the double Euro header
with Bulgaria and Luxembourg in October.
</P>
<P>
Merson has already been advised by the England doctors to rest
for three weeks. He was in so much discomfort that he had to be
substituted at half-time against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive influence Merson has had on the side since
his 6.75 million pounds move from Middlesbrough, Gregory will
only play him against the Red Devils if he has made a significant
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "We are hoping that nothing is seriously damaged
and it could be just a back spasm.
</P>
<P>
"He could come in on Friday and say he feels okay so we are
not ruling him totally out of Saturday's match - but there is
obviously something that is not quite right.
</P>
<P>
"Paul has had a problem for a while and it would be unfair to
think about playing him against United if he is only half fit.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to think of is that Paul is only 30 and still
has many more years as a player in front of him and we don't want
him to do any lasting damage, " he added.

<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Arabian mining company, known as "Maadin,"
was granted a license to prospect for precious metals in the Al
Duweihi region, southeast of Zolm which falls within the Mecca
emirate (western Saudi Arabia), reported the Arab daily Al Hayat
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prospective gold ore in the area is estimated at 14,000
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's exports of shoes and leather goods to the six
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states amounted to 25 million
Egyptian pounds (7.35 million U.S. dollars), of which
over 65 percent is consumed by Saudi Arabia alone.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Egypt's exports of shoes and leather goods to the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) stood at 700,000 pounds (206,000
dollars) a year, a modest figure in terms of Egypt's potential
production and exports.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa has
decided to extend three soft loans of 26.7 million U.S. dollars to
finance development projects in Botswana, Benin and Ghana, the
Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SALALAH -- With the inauguration of Raysut port here on
Tuesday, Oman added a new container transfer hub to the
Asian-European maritime route which has been booming over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
The port will mainly serve as a transit trade hub between the Gulf
region and Asian, European and African countries, reported the
Arab daily Al Hayat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The construction costs of the first phase of the port amounted
to about 135 million U.S. dollars, borne by the Omani
government. And the second phase will be financed by private
sectors, covering the purchase of necessary equipment and
appliances at a cost of 120 million to 140 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the four-dock port stands at some 2 million
containers a year in 1999 and will rise to 15 million a year after
construction completion.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia Needs IMF Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to reach an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to receive
10.3 billion U.S. dollars in new credit, Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Federation Council (the upper chamber), Primakov
said, "We are interested in reaching an agreement with the IMF
since otherwise we cannot reschedule our debts at the Paris Club,
cannot receive new credits, including the united loan from Japan
worth 800 million dollars."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister Wednesday met with the IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus, who arrived here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Primakov said relations with the IMF are of great
importance and have good prospects for development.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Camdessus knows the situation in Russia very well
and has shown understanding for state participation during the
existing economic processes.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF head cautioned against state participation
that may go beyond certain boundaries and thwart the country's
progress to the market economy, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Camdessus said Primakov's practical attitude toward
the economy has paved the way for Russia's further cooperation
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
According to Camdessus, during his talk with the prime
minister, the two sides did not discuss fiscal issues in
detail. He warned that the country needs to exercise strict budget
discipline and tight fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
He said steps taken by the Russian government are correct and
the IMF expects more details on this work before another IMF
mission arrives in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The IMF will send a mission to Russia next January to discuss
further cooperation with the country, Camdessus said.

<HEADLINE> Blair's New Bid to Break Peace Deadlock in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is to make a visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday
afternoon to seek a breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair's surprise trip, the second within two weeks, has
hightened speculation that an announcement of substantial progress
is imminent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is anxious to resolve the impasse in
Northern Ireland's politics, brought about by arguments over the
balance of new bodies established in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern may join Blair for the latest
round of top-level talks in Belfast, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
In an historic speech to both house of the Irish Parliament
last week, Blair appealed to both sides in Northern Ireland to
reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is time now I believe for all the parties to live
up to all their commitment, time for north-south bodies to be set
up, time to set up the institutions for a new government, time for
the gun to be taken out of politics once and for all.
</P>
<P>
"I am not asking anyone to surrender, I am asking everyone to
declare the victory of peace."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon warned
the entire peace process would collapse unless a deal was struck
on the composition of the new institutions within days.
</P>
<P>
That deadline, like a number of others recently, has passed
without progress.
</P>
<P>
But Mallon said on Wednesday he was "still confident that
before the end of the week we will have a resolution to this
matter".
</P>
<P>
The deputy first minister was speaking during talks with First
Minister David Trimble, who talked to Blair on Tuesday by
telephone.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Appeals for Joint Efforts for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus House of Representatives
(parliament) President Spyros Kyprianou on Wednesday called for
joint efforts of all parties concerned to work for the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Palestine National Council President Salim
Zanoun, Kyprianou said "the prospect of peace in the area dictates
that all countries make their own contribution to the cause of
peace and work collectively in this direction."
</P>
<P>
The peoples of Palestine and Cyprus have a lot in common and
share the same vision of peace and stability in the "sensitive
region of the Mediterranean basin," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Wye agreement between the Palestinians
and Israel "paved the way for an ultimate peaceful solution and
created a prospect of stability and security, assuring social and
economic development in the region."
</P>
<P>
Under the interim peace deal, inked in Washington on October
23, Israel should pull out from another 13 percent of the West
Bank in return for tougher Palestinian crackdown on anti-Israeli
militants.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou underlined that stability will benefit every country
in the region, and reassured that the Cyprus parliament "endorses
all initiatives aiming at promoting peace, democracy and the rule
of law."
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou also expressed the desire to promote relations and
cooperation with the Palestine National Council.

WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House Judiciary Committee Republicans Tuesday opened a
new front in their impeachment inquiry against President Clinton,
voting in a rancorous session to examine allegations of Democratic
fund-raising even as Democrats assailed the move as an
eleventh-hour "fishing expedition."
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told an
international conference Tuesday that the quest for belated
justice for Holocaust victims "requires that painful memories be
revisited, easy evasions confronted and inconvenient questions
asked and answered."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States will declassify some documents on the
killings and torture conducted during the dictatorship of the
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq began answering questions posed by arms inspectors over
the last year, in a flurry of letters to the United Nations, but
officials said that they found little new in the responses.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Defense Department expects by early next year to
unveil rules that will make it easier for foreign companies to
acquire U.S. defense concerns, the Pentagon's acquisition chief
said.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraqi opposition leaders are resisting the latest U.S. push
to help them overthrow Saddam Hussein as some dissidents doubt the
U.S. is serious and some don't want to be publicly associated with
Washington.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Lee Dixon and Ray Parlour are
facing at least one-match bans from UEFA for incidents during

Parlour was sent off for violent conduct towards the end of

And UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body have decided that
Dixon will also be suspended "for an elbow strike in the back of
an opponent" after studying reports from Swedish referee Anders
Frisk and UEFA delegate Sandor Berzi.

A final decision about the total number of matches Parlour and
Dixon will be banned for will be taken at the next meeting of

Cathay Pacific officially informed PAL of its position in a

its intention to pursue "future cooperation" in other areas of
mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Japanese Youth Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua)-- Chairman Li Peng of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress met
with a Japanese youth delegation here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of members of the House of
Representatives and delegates from about 30 youth societies, is
here to mark the 20th anniversary of the China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty, at the invitation of the All-China Youth
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Li said the celebration to mark the occasion, and further
exploration of ways to expand and deepen contacts between young
people of the two countries, will play an active role in
stimulating bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of relations between China and Japan,
together with the signing of the peace and friendship treaty,
opened up a new era in bilateral relations, Li said. President
Jiang Zemin's recent state visit to Japan, an important event in
bilateral ties at this trans-century juncture, is significant for
the development of long-term friendly cooperation oriented to the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled that when he was visiting Japan in 1989, Okazaki
Kaheita, a long-time friend of China, accompanied him on his visit
to Okayama despite his venerable age, and today his son is a
member of the delegation. This shows that friendship between the
two countries is a matter concerning to all generations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In developing bilateral relations, Li pointed out, there are
three basic points to be taken into consideration. First, a
correct attitude towards history should be adopted; second, broad
communication should be carried out; and third, the hopes for
future bilateral relations lie in the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
At this juncture of inheriting the past and ushering in the
future, the youth of both countries shoulder important
responsibilities for passing on this friendship, he
said. Therefore, he expressed the hope that young parliament
members of both countries will increase their contact, and the
All-China Youth Federation will expand relations with Japanese
youth societies to contribute to lasting friendship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Syozo, deputy secretary-general of Japan's Liberal Party
and also a member of the House of Representatives, said the
delegates share the common goal of developing long-term
Japan-China friendship, and although they have different
professions and are from diverse backgrounds, they are all
determined to further friendship programs and contribute to better
bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> EU to Form Independent Anti-Fraud Investigation Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
form an independent investigation office to strengthen its
anti-fraud task force, the European Commission said here Wednesday
after adopting a proposal for a regulation to create such a body.
</P>
<P>
The office will be responsible solely for investigations on
suspected fraud or corruption and will be wholly independent of
the commission, the EU's executive agency.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the office is to carry out enquiries both
externally in the EU member states and internally inside all
institutions of the European Union, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The move is in line with the commission's commitment to
protect the European taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the EU is of firm conviction that this
proposal will form a good basis for discussion between the
institutions on how to further strengthen the fight against fraud
and corruption harmful to the European taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
Under European Union treaties, the commission has the right of
initiative in respect of legislation, the coordination of anti-fraud
activities with the member states and the launching of both internal
and external investigations.

<HEADLINE> Batty Move on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- England midfielder David Batty
has returned to train with Newcastle after his prospective return
to Leeds was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
The clubs are as much as two million pounds apart in their
valuation of the player, who turns 30 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leeds have already made a bid of around four million but
Newcastle apparently want as much as six million, although this
valuation may be designed to simply squeeze a little more cash
out of Leeds.
</P>
<P>
It is thought that should they go up their offer to 4.5
million it would clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
Batty's personal terms are apparently a formality and he is
said to be prepared to waive an 800,000 pounds payment to secure
his return to West Yorkshire, where he still lives with his
family.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd, who never wanted to sell
the player in the first place, is refusing to let him go at a
knock-down price.
</P>
<P>
"Without revealing how much we think he is worth, I would say
4 million is nowhere near enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
Batty says he has no quarrel with his current club, although
he submitted a transfer request to Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He has never made any secret of the fact that he did not want
to leave Leeds back in 1994 when he was sold to Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
Even though other clubs are interested, it is unlikely that he
would go anywhere but Elland Road.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle's insistence that Leeds manager David O'Leary pay
more for the player could hold things up, but it would be a
surprise if the move does not go through at some stage.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Initiates Fund Guaranteeing Small-Enterprise Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal authorities
today established a special 100-million-yuan fund (about 12
million U.S. dollars) for guaranteeing the financing of small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized businesses have been playing an ever
greater role in the economic life of the city in recent years,
local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the output value of these enterprises
accounted for 60 percent of Beijing's total in 1997. In addition,
they provided 75 percent of the city's job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
However, because of their relatively small size and limited
capital, they often find it difficult to secure bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The new fund, set up by the local government and two investment
companies, will guarantee one billion yuan in loans for these
enterprises, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Any promising enterprise which complies with the state's
industrial development policy and has good market prospects
can obtain support from this fund.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Rejects Philippines' Claim on Sabah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sabah State
Chief Minister Bernard Dompok Wednesday brushed aside the
Philippines' claim on Sabah, saying the issue was resolved a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
The people of Sabah have expressed their loyalty to Malaysia,
which means further discussion on this issue is not necessary,
Dompok told reporters after the weekly state cabinet meeting in
Kota Kinabalu, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
Two Philippine newspapers reported recently that the Philippine
government has not given up its claim on Sabah, according to
Malaysia's state news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the Manila Bulletin and the Philippine Daily
Inquirer quoted Philippine presidential spokesman Fernado Barican
as saying that the claim had only been frozen under Fidel Ramos'
administration and it had not been dropped.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted Dompok as saying that, "We don't recognize
it. It is a closed file. It is water under the bridge. It is gone."
</P>
<P>
Hishammudin Tun Hussein, acting youth chief of Malaysia's
ruling party United Malays National Organization (UMNO), said
earlier that the Philippines' claim on Sabah was a clear
infringement on Malaysia's sovereign integrity.

JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Group is
confident of doubling its business in south Africa by 2003,
Wednesday's Business Day daily quoted a senior official of the
group as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international seminar on African trade and
investment in Cape Town, Don Knauss, one of presidents of the
Coca-Cola Group responsible for southern Africa, said that of the
nearly 200 countries where Coca-Cola runs business, South Africa
is its 10th largest market.
</P>
<P>
"Still, we believe we're just getting started. In this
country, carbonated soft drinks account for only five percent of
commercial beverage consumption... only one out of 20 drinks,"
Knauss said.
</P>
<P>
He said his group is planning to invest 750 million Rand
(about 125 million U.S. Dollars) to promote the Coca-Cola
business in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Starting in South Africa next year, we are planning to launch
a 'people's Coke', an affordable, single serve 350 returnable
bottle at 1.5 Rand (one U.S. Dollar equals to about six Rand)...
a price we want to maintain for several years," Knauss said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Marks 1st Anniversary of Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh observed the first
anniversary of the signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)
peace agreement between the government and the tribal rebels on
Wednesday with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League (AL) held various activities to
celebrate the occasion, tribal leaders voiced dissatisfaction over
the slow implementation of the accord, while the opposition is
still opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
The AL held a discussion here hailing the accord, which the
government signed on December 2, 1997 with the Parbattaya
Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the political wing of the
pro-independence armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party also organized processions and rallies at the
hill district headquarters on Wednesday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the accord has been hailed by many as an "historic
event," which ended over two decades of armed conflict in the
country's three southeastern hill districts, it has also aroused
mixed reactions among Bangladeshi people, particularly people from
different strata in the hill districts with regard to what the
peace accord has actually brought about in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS organized rallies to voice its dissatisfaction over
the delay in implementing the accord.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that the peace accord is not being implemented,
but the progress is very slow," said Shantu Larma,
chairman-designate of the CHT regional council to be established
under the accord, and president of the PCJSS.
</P>
<P>
"A particular quarter in the government is involved in...
delaying implementation of the peace accord," he said, adding: "We
will continue non-violent means to press home our demand."
</P>
<P>
"The implementation process of the accord has slowed down. No
significant progress was visible from the government side,"
another PCJSS leader said, urging the government to expedite the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"People are breathing in a peaceful atmosphere. Tribal refugees
have come back. Their rehabilitation has started. Everywhere there
is a symbol of solidarity. It's the main achievement of the
agreement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
however, has opposed the CHT peace accord from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday to mark the anniversary of the
peace deal, BNP General Secretary Mannan Bhuiyan said government
leaders would have to "stand public trial" for signing the
"anti-state" accord with the tribals.
</P>
<P>
"December 2 is a black day as the government, on this day in
1997, signed such an accord as it runs counter to the Constitution
as well as country's sovereignty and integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League-dominated parliament passed three bills in May
this year giving legal effect to the accord, but the full
implementation of the deal remains an uphill task for the
government, considering the present political confrontation
between the ruling party and the opposition, and the disputes
between the government and the PCJSS.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Pleads with Kidd to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Blackburn refused to admit
defeat in their bid to enlist Brian Kidd as their new manager -
despite being warned off by Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC on Wednesday, Kidd, who is right-hand man
to United manager Alex Ferguson, has emerged as Blackburn's chief
target to replace Roy Hodgson, who was sacked last month.
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson himself is keen to hang onto his loyal
lieutenant: "We do not want to lose Brian. He is very important
to United," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have built up an excellent staff and Brian has been a key
part."
</P>
<P>
United have rejected Rovers' approach for Kidd, who has been
Ferguson's right-hand man for almost eight years now.
</P>
<P>
But Old Trafford chairman Martin Edwards admitted he could be
powerless to stop Kidd being tempted to take the step up to
managerial level at Ewood Park.
</P>
<P>
Edwards said: "There is a lot of thinking to be done on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
"I have told Brian about Blackburn's approach and that we have
turned it down. That's all I can do.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to see that stance changing. It is up to
Brian now. We will have to see what happens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kidd has long been tipped, along with Middlesbrough boss Bryan
Robson, as a possible successor to Ferguson when the United
manager decides to retire.

<HEADLINE> Responsibility System to Hold Leadership Accountable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce a
responsibility system which holds leading officials in government
departments and Party organizations accountable for corrupt acts
committed by subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the nation's cabinet, and the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, jointly issued a
circular today calling for implementing the system at the central
and local levels.
</P>
<P>
The system outlined in the Regulation on Practicing
Responsibility System for Building Clean Government and a Good
Party Work Style requires leaders of Party and government
departments to adopt effective management and supervision
mechanisms to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
The system is designed to eliminate fraud involved in appointing
and promoting officials.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that leading officials must resign or
will otherwise be removed from their official posts if serious
cases of corruption in their jurisdiction result in major losses
of state or personal property, loss of life or serious damage to
the image of either the Party or government.
</P>
<P>
The regulation applies to judicial departments, social
organizations and state enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, a member of the
Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, said today that the CPC will
further strengthen friendship and cooperation with the Cameroun

<HEADLINE> WB Backs Reintegration, Development in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank said
Wednesday that it has approved a credit of over five million U.S.
Dollars to Rwanda for a community reintegration and development
to promote community participation in development.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here by the World Bank Africa regional
office said that after coming to power in July 1994, and
particularly since the massive return of refugees in 1996/97, the
Rwandan government of national unity has been facing regional
security issues that have hindered peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
The news release noted that to build trust and dismantle
Rwanda's legacy of centralized decision-making, the government
has initiated an inclusive, community-level approach to
development.
</P>
<P>
"This approach aims to involve Rwandans closely in the
management of their own affairs and make the local administrative
structures primarily responsible for development activities," it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The community reintegration and development project will
assist war-affected communities to strengthen their capacity and
administration at the local and national levels for the
implementation of development projects.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credit is on standard terms of 40 years
maturity, including 10 years grace period, and 0.75 percent
service charge.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the balance of the
5.27-million-U.S.-Dollar project financing will come from the
government of Rwanda and local beneficiaries.

JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian man was
stabbed to death Wednesday morning in East Jerusalem and initial
police investigations indicate that it was a politically-motivated
murder.
</P>
<P>
A 41-year old Palestinian man was stabbed to death early
Wednesday by an Israeli Jew in the Old City of Jerusalem. The
police said the attacker wanted to create political problem in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Usamah Mousa Al-Natsheh and father
of six children. He was a worker of the Jerusalem Municipality and
stabbed to death while on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert strongly condemned the attack,
saying such killings can not be tolerated no mater the victim was
a Jew or a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strengthened its security measures in East Jerusalem
after the Wye peace accord was signed between the Palestinian and
Israeli leaders in October in Washington, but it failed to prevent
bombings and killings in the city committed by both Palestinians
and Jews.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's veteran politician
Salim Hoss was named Wednesday by President Emile Lahoud as the
next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The nomination came after Lahoud completed a two-day mandatory
consulations with the Parliament, in which 95 members in the
128-seat parliament voted to recommend Hoss.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, 69, a Doctor of Economics, has held the premiership on
three previous occasions. He was widely respected in Lebanon's
fractious politics for his reputation as an honest lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Ever since he became a parliament member in 1992, Hoss has been
a prime critic of outgoing Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's economic
and social policies. His criticism has been characterized as
"constructive."
</P>
<P>
Like every prime minister under Lebanon's power-sharing
arrangement, Hoss is a Sunni Muslim. According to the arrangement,
the president is a Maronite Catholic and the Parliament speaker is
a Shiite Muslim.
</P>
<P>
After being sworn-in on November 24, Lahoud had asked Hariri to form
a new government. But the latter rejected his request.
</P>
<P>
The billionaire construction tycoon Hariri, who took office six
years ago, launched a multibillion dollar reconstruction drive to
rebuild Lebanon from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
But during his six-year tenure, the country sank deep into debt
and ordinary Lebanese complained that the benefits of the
reconstruction did not filter down to them.
</P>
<P>
Press reports predicted the new cabinet, which will not exceed
16 ministers, will be announced at the weekend. Economic
development and government reform will be the major challenges of
the new government, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> W. Bank Urges Vietnam to Accelerate Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- If Vietnam is to restore its
momentum of  growth, it must continue to accelerate the pace of
its economic reforms, said a report released here Wednesday by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation is quite serious for Vietnam,
threatening to undermine and reverse the remarkable progress in
poverty reduction that has been achieved over the past decade,"
said the World Bank's annual report on Vietnam's economy.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated Vietnam's growth of real GDP this year at
3.5 to 4 percent, around half the rate recorded in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
This estimate is lower than the government's estimate of 6
percent mainly due to differences in industrial and service sector
growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The current slowdown has important implications for Vietnam's
investment program in infrastructure, said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Though the challenges Vietnam faces are daunting, the current
difficulties also offer an opportunity for action, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the challenge is for Vietnam to "set its sails"
in a manner that its economy and society is strengthened rather
than weakened as it navigates through the current difficult
waters.

the final-status talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 400 to 500 Gesher members will be registered as
Likud Central Committee members and the state budget will provide
funding for the social concerns that prompted Levy's resignation
from the government in January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has some trouble within his coalition because the
National Religous party (NRP) openly rejected the Wye peace
accord signed last month in Washington with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Two ministers of the NRP voted against the accord while
several NRP Knesset members threatened to join the oppostion in
the Knesset to bring the government down. Without Gesher, the
coalition only has 61 seats in the 120-member Kennset.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud members have voiced their objection to Levy's return
and the promise that so much Gesher members will be allowed to join
the Likud's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Levy's brother, Maxim Levy, a Knesset
member, is also opposed to Geshe's merger with the Likud.
</P>
<P>
He said he has nothing against David Levy entering the
government again and picking up a minister portfolio as he
likes, but the merging with the Likud is something else and
Gesher should maintain its independence.

serious peril to the public health of Iraq because of the lethal
effects of this weapon.

Sabri was speaking at the opening session of an international
symposium on the use of depleted uranium (DU) and its impact on

suffering from a unnamed disease which is commonly referred to as
Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>

extreme fatigue, frequency in passing water, all sorts of problems
with the bowel as well as depression and anxiety.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans Laws on Environmental Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government would
soon promulgate some laws aimed at providing an avenue for
victims of environmental damages to seek redress, a senior
environmental official has said.
</P>
<P>
R.O. Adewoye, the Director General of the Federal Environment
Protection Agency (FEPA) made the disclosure at a recent
international seminar on petroleum industry and environment in
Abuja, the Nigerian capital, according to Wednesday's Daily Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The official said the laws of response, compensation and
liability for environmental damage are coming on the heels of
draft national guidelines for solid waste management, water and
air quality, registration of green technology and environmental
management system being prepared by the FEPA.
</P>
<P>
He said the new laws would reduce further degradation of the
environment and provide a way of insulating the environment as an
issue from politics and ethnic struggles.
</P>
<P>
Environment pollutions in oil-producing areas have always been
a source of social unrest in Nigeria, which depends on oil export
for more than 90 percent of its hard currency incomes.
</P>
<P>
Aggrieved victims in the oil-producing communities have
repeatedly resorted to hostage taking and other violent means to
seek justice for oil companies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Newspaper Blames US for Iraqi Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- In a rare move, an official
Egyptian newspaper Wednesday accused the United States of
inventing excuses for keeping intact economic sanctions on Iraq
for its own interests.
</P>
<P>
Once the Iraqis have "a hope that their ordeal would come to an
end, the U.S. hurries to shatter the hope and fabricates fresh
pretexts to tighten the noose around them," the Egyptian Gazette
said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The current standoff, triggered by UNSCOM chief Richard
Butler's demand for more documents of Iraq's weapons programs, has
demonstrated the U.S. approach to the Iraqi crisis, the
English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which can not be lifted until
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) led by Butler certifies that
Iraq has destroyed the weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The paper maintains that the U.S. is attempting to "add fuel to
the flames and keep the Gulf volatile" for "more money to flow
into its coffers."
</P>
<P>
It cited the recent effort of U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen to tout the establishment of a U.S.-made sophisticated
missile system to the Gulf Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"Not unrelated is the eagerness of Washington to keep presence
in the region" to secure its interests, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed sympathy for the "hapless Iraqis who continue to
pay dearly" for the U.S. drama which the paper said is "no longer
exciting, let alone humane."
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a close ally of Washington, receives over 2 billion
U.S. dollars in economic and military aid from the U.S. every
year. Its official newspapers usually keep mute over the U.S.
policy on issues in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Release Convicted Coup Plotters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Special
Rapporteur, Soli Sorabjee, has called on the Nigerian government
to release convicted coup plotters including former Chief of
General Staff General Oladjpo Diya, The Punch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official told a press briefing Tuesday that the
judicial process which tried them had been identified to be
faulty, and the government should release all of them without
exception.
</P>
<P>
Sorabjee who rounded off his week-long investigations of the
human rights situation in Nigeria said that the human rights
situation in the country had improved, compared with what it was
during the regime of the late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Following his investigations and interaction with human rights
bodies in the country, he noted that the transition program on
course in the west African country is credible.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, the May 29, 1999 handover date must be
kept, as the contrary would attract international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The India-born attorney said that he was returning to his home
country of India to prepare, analyze, evaluate and arrive at
conclusions on his investigations for presentation before the
U.N. Human Rights Convention to be held in Geneva in the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
In April this year when the convention was held, Sorabjee
condemned the General Abacha regime for its serious human rights
abuse and political repression.

MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has urged leaders of electronics and semi-conductor
industries in the Philippines to bring in new technologies and
create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Tuesday night at a meeting with a Philippine
semi-conductor and electronics company here, Estrada pledged the
government's full support for the growth of the domestic
semi-conductor and electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that their continued development is vital to the
national economy, since they account for more than 60 percent of
the country's total exports and employ about 200,000 engineers and
technical workers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada urged leaders in the sector to take advantage of the
improving economy by inviting global players to relocate in the
country as a way to bring in new technologies and create more
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports from the semi-conductor and electronics
industries reached 15 billion U.S. dollars last year, and is

<HEADLINE> Corruption in Africa Turns off U.S. Firms: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Corruption remained one
of the greatest obstacles to U.S. investment in Africa despite
the continent's achievements in economic and political reforms,
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley has warned.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a high-level southern Africa trade and investment
summit in Cape Town Tuesday, Daley said although Africa has made
positive moves toward economic reform, political freedom and a
more prosperous consumer, corruption was still a major stumbling
block for U.S. companies doing business here.
</P>
<P>
Failure to respect intellectual property rights was also an
obstacle to attracting offshore investment, especially if Africa
wanted to attract hi-tech companies, Business Day paper Wednesday
quoted Daley as saying.
</P>
<P>
Daley, leading a trade delegation of 15 U.S. business leaders
to the region, said trade between Africa and the United States
had lagged considerably behind U.S. trade with other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
In effect, if trade had grown between Africa and the United
States as it did between the United States and other developing
countries in the northern hemisphere, it would be 50 percent more
today, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa was the most important U.S. trading partner
in Africa, it ranked only 33rd on the country's list of largest
trading partners, Daley said at the meeting, sponsored by the
International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
He said potential business investors also cared about
infrastructure, tax and investment incentives, privatization
plans and other fundamentals of government policies in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Daley said there was an urgent need to speed up regional
integration if Africa wanted to be on the global stage.
</P>
<P>
"For Africa to be on a global stage, it cannot be small
disconnected markets, it must be regional markets... I believe
you need to reduce the trade barriers with your neighbors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Daley warned that the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) was not moving fast enough to implement its 1996 agreement
to create a free trade zone within eight years.
</P>
<P>
So far only five of the SADC's 14 member countries have
ratified the trade protocol, a first step toward free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Daley said only 13 percent African trade is with other African
countries whereas two thirds of Europe's trade is with other
European nations and 30 percent Asia's trade is within that
continent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Daley, accompanied by U.S. executives from
AT&AMP;T, the telecommunications group, Coca-Cola and Cargill, signed
an agreement with South African Trade Minister Alec Erwin to
promote investment between U.S. and South African companies.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told the summit
that Africa struggled to attract investment because of an image
associated with coups and instability.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said a key objective was to achieve regional economic
integration. "All of us know we will only grow when we have
closer integration in the region," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Group in Maputo to Check Aquatic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A three-member European Union
(EU) group arrived in Maputo Tuesday to have a on-the-spot
investigation for the evaluation of Mozambique's measure on its
marine products for European market.
</P>
<P>
The group started a series of meetings with Mozambican
authorities Tuesday and will conduct examination on fishing
vessels and fish-processing facilities, among others.
</P>
<P>
EU suspended its sea food import from Mozambique at the end of
last year after cholera erupted in some areas in the country,
fearing that the country's sea food was also contaminated and the
sea food processing and freezing were not up to the EU health
standard.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government had asked EU representatives to come
to the country for an on-the-spot examination thereafter and
issued regulations on the supervision of exported fish.
</P>
<P>
Sea food, especially prawns, is one of Mozambique's major
exports, with sea food export earning about 99 million U.S.
Dollars in 1997, about 44 percent of all its export value.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Mozambique's sea food is exported to
European countries.

NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister George
Fernandes Wednesday said that India's surface-to-surface missile
"Prithvi" with 150 km range and one ton warhead has been inducted
into the army.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to questions of the ongoing session of the
Upper House of Parliament here, he said that development work on
the air force version of "Prithvi" missile has been completed and
the naval version of the missile is at an advanced stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
"Based on threat perception", the government has already
approved development of a longer range missile "Agni" using the
"state-of-the-art technology", he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the United States and other interlocutors during
which "India has explained to them its security concerns" have not
led to any change in the plan of "Agni" missile program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Indo-Russian relations, he said that India and
Russia have agreed in principle to extend the existing long-term
program of military technical cooperation accord between the two

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Calls for Meeting With Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is calling for a meeting with prospective investors of
Philippine Airlines (PAL) to make sure the nation's flag carrier
remains on air.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday night, President Estrada said that the
meeting will include PAL chairman Lucio Tan and officials of Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I have to talk to them. I have not talked to Cathay
officials or with Mr. Tan, and this time I will see to it that I
will call for them and have a meeting with them," he said in the
interview, which was published by the presidential office
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he wants PAL to continue flying as many
businesses and sectors will suffer once it closes down.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated his promise to PAL employees that he
will do everything to protect their jobs as long as he is
president.
</P>
<P>
PAL has yet to reach a deal with Cathay, one of at least two
major foreign airlines interested in buying into the Philippine
flag carrier. The Other is U.S.-based Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that talks between PAL and Cathay recently
hit a snag due to the alleged plan of Cathay to retrench PAL
employees.
</P>
<P>
But Cathay has since denied having imposed such condition for
its entry into the financially troubled airline.
</P>
<P>
PAL closed down on September 23 after talks between its
management and workers collapsed, and resumed operation early
October after President Estrada managed to convince the workers to
accept the management's offer of 20 percent equity and three board
seats in the airline, in return for a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges People to Watch Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Wednesday told the people to stay vigilant against
anarchists and nihilists who sow destruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I dare convey this message to the people to increase their
vigilance. Leave out all negative thinking and prejudices," the
president told members of the Union of Youths Continuing the
Struggle of the Republic of Indonesia, whom he received at the
presidential office here.
</P>
<P>
The president called for a stop to the destruction of houses of
worship, schools and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Indonesian culture tolerates diversity,
including in the practice of religion.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Habibie condemned the burning and ransacking of
mosques and churches in Ketapang, Central Jakarta, and Kupang,
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the act, whether it is a church or a mosque or a
temple. We condemn it because it is against the values of our
culture, against the universal values of human rights," the
president said when opening the fourth national workshop on human
rights at the State Palace.
</P>
<P>
he added: "We should not tolerate discrimination in whatever
form, be it racial or ethnic. Indonesia is not a secular state,
not is it a state based upon one religion."
</P>
<P>
National Police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi Tuesday told
reporters that the violence in Kupang Monday was a direct
retaliation against the burning of churches in Jakarta on November
22. Fourteen people were killed and 22 churches and five schools
were burned or vandalized during the clash in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar M. Sianipar said rioters burned
four mosques, two houses, two shops, three restaurants and two
cars in Kupang. At least 17 people were injured during the riot.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that unrest spread to Banjarsari town, 250
kilometers southwest of Jakarta, Tuesday. Muslim crowds torched
two homes used for Christian worship as well as a shop and a
cinema in the town.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of different religions had reiterated their
condemnation and concern over the incident and urged people to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is 90 percent Muslim and is the world's most populous
Islamic nation. However, some islands in the archipelago have
Christian majorities.
</P>
<P>
Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in
the national ideology Pancasila (the five basic principles of the
Republic of Indonesia), adopted when Indonesia declared
independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Grows 5% in Year to September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia recorded an
astounding growth rate of five percent in the 12 months to
September in the face of Asian economic crisis, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the bureau
Wednesday showed growth in the September quarter was driven by
strong domestic demand with increases in private consumption and
business investment.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed seasonally adjusted GDP rose by 1.0 percent
in the three months to September, resulting in an annual growth
rate of 5.0 percent, a figure much better than most people
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the growth figures showed the continued
momentum and resilience of the local economy and highlighted an
enviable combination of strong growth and low inflation, which has
been well below 2 percent during the past year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian economic crisis and close trade link with
Asia, Australia's exports of goods and services in the past
financial year ending on June 30, 1998, grew by 8.2 percent over
the previous year, thanks to good growth in exports to the United
States and Europe and some emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Su-Lin Ong, an economist with RBC DS Global Markets, said low
interest rates and accommodative monetary policy, low inflation
and continued employment and wages growth have been important in
underpinning domestic demand and overall growth.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates, including banks' lending interest rates, home
loan interest rates, are the lowest for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
But two hours before the bureau released the figures, the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the country's central bank,
announced a reduction in the cash rate to 4.75 percent from 5.00
percent, citing an expected slowdown in growth next year and low
inflation as reasons for the move.
</P>
<P>
A fall in cash rate, the interest rate on overnight loans made
between institutions in the money market, would lead to cuts in
other interest rates, including banks' lending interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Australia's economy grew by 3.9 percent during the financial
year of 1997-1998, ending on June 30, 1998, and the federal
government predicted in September that the growth rate for the
current financial year would be 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With a significant decline in world growth predicted by most
forecasters, it is still likely that growth in Australia will
slow, at least temporarily, during 1999," said Ian Macfarlane,
governor of the central bank.

<HEADLINE> Police Put on High Alert for Turkish-Italian Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government has called
on over 22,000 policemen to protect the security for the
politically tinged European Champions' League match on Wednesday
between Turkish champion Galatasaray and Italy's Juventus in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas was quoted by local
press as saying that "We will do our best to start and finish the
game without any incidents."
</P>
<P>
The tight security measures were guarantees requested by
Juventus and UEFA to protect the Italian side from any possible
acts of violence by Turkish fans angry at Italy's refusal to
extradite Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against
troublemakers, warning that "whoever gets involved in provocative
acts will be severely punished."
</P>
<P>
Security officials said that police motorcades will escort the
Italian team from Ataturk International Airport to its hotel and
to Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Helmeted anti-riot police with batons and shields will be
stationed in and around the stadium to make certain that the
match is carried out in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that police will search spectators entering the
stadium for knives and clubs, banners and fireworks will also be
banned and roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned
off.
</P>
<P>
The game is expected to be played after a one-week
postponement by UEFA for security concerns on the wake of the
anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over Romes' failure to extradite
Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher After Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar bounced
higher Wednesday, defying the early pressure of a cut in interest
rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to gain two thirds
of a U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
With lower rates usually a negative for the local currency, the
market focused instead on the small size of the monetary policy
easing with the RBA taking the rare step of reducing rates by only
25 basis points.
</P>
<P>
"It was a positive view taken by the currency market," said
Scott Young, foreign exchange dealer at Arab Bank.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug to Cost Bezeq 54 Million U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bezeq, Israel's largest
telephone company, will spend at least 54 million U.S. dollars to
prepare its computer system for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its third-quarter financial report released on Wednesday,
Bezeq said the money will be used for conversion and necessary
upgrading of engineering systems, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the report said there are still potential cost that can not
be estimated at the current stage, such as the employment of extra
manpower needed in the project.
</P>
<P>
The company has just begun work on conversion. Industry sources
say that the longer the company waits, the higher the conversion
cost is likely to be, because it will have to pay higher prices to
get the work done in shorter time.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem of computer, which is also called
computer millennium bug, dates back to the early days of computer
programming when only the last two numbers of the year were used
in most softwares.
</P>
<P>
Some computers will read 2000 as 1900 and shut off the computer
systems or give wrong answers when the new century starts.
</P>
<P>
Experts around the world are sparing no efforts to solve the
glitches, but no breakthrough has been reported so far.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Prices Mixed Amid High Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan tea prices at this
week's auction in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa were mixed
amid good demand, traders have said.
</P>
<P>
"There was good demand but at irregular rates," Norman Wilson,
managing director of Africa Tea Brokers (ATB), was quoted by
Wednesday's Daily Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Best Pekoes Ones (BP1s) of all categories were
lower, undermined by less demand from Sudan, Yemen and other
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
But other categories were a strong feature and ended often
dearer, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Best Pekoes Ones of all categories sold at irregularly lower
rates, with some withdrawals. Older invoices of brighter and
medium Pekoes Fannings were irregular but on balance sold at
around last auction's rates," he said in an ATB report.
</P>
<P>
"Fresher teas appreciated by five and 15 U.S. cents," the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan packers and traders lent the market good support
while Britain was more active, although it bought selectively in
line with quality, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There was also improved inquiry from Egypt for Pekoes Dusts
and Dust Ones.
</P>
<P>
Among the broken teas, or the lower end of the market, Yemen,
Sudan and other Middle East buyers were not very active, which
resulted in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that the market had already taken into account
record Kenyan tea output of around 280 million kg this year
compared with 220 million kg in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He added that the only worry now was a possible crop level
beyond the forecast figure, which could trigger a drop in prices.
</P>
<P>
Exports of tea, coffee and horticultural produce are the main
source of foreign exchange earnings for Kenya following the
recession of the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
They are also responsible for the stable trading of the
Shillings in the money market.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the weekly tea auction held on every Monday are
done in U.S. Dollars ensuring a constant flow of Dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Judicial System Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to comprehensively
restructure its judicial system during 1999 by further opening
courtrooms to the general public, increasing independent trial
responsibility of judges and establishing a people's jury system.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC),
outlined the reform plan today at a national conference of
presidents of higher people's courts at the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"Judicial reform is part of ongoing political restructuring in
China," said Xiao, adding that the goal of the reform is to ensure
justice throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
Open court trials represent a constitutional principle
contained in the nation's criminal, civil and administrative
procedures laws. However, various factors have precluded vigorous
implementation of the principle, including the proficiency levels
of judges.
</P>
<P>
Members of the general public are sometimes refused entry to a
public hearing due to the "lack of seating."
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that all court trials procedures must be open to the
public beginning next year, including the presentation,
deliberation and verification of evidence, as well as legal
arguments and the announcement of verdicts.
</P>
<P>
"Verdicts must be made public in a timely manner in order to
avoid under-the-table deals," said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Reform will also focus on the form of verdicts, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"Current verdicts are rendered in similar simplistic wording,
with no explanation concerning the confirmation of evidence and
application of the law" said Xiao. He added that verdicts fail to
cite grounds for conclusions reached by judges.
</P>
<P>
"Verdicts should help the general public understand the legal
system and ensure the authority of the courts," according to
Xiao.

anniversary of the convening of the third plenary session of the
11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, which kicked off the policy
of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPC International Department should make
profound studies of and carry out Deng Xiaoping's theory of
diplomacy and the foreign policy set at the CPC's 15th National
Congress so as to improve the party's relations with foreign
parties in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that the 3rd plenary session marks the beginning of
a fundamental change in the guiding theory, aims, policy and
principles of the Party's foreign relations work.
</P>
<P>
"The past two decades have witnessed a remarkable rise of
CPC's international status and influence as well as a vigorous
expansion of CPC's foreign relations," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the communist movement suffered severe
setbacks internationally and the world situation has changed
dramatically over the past 20 years, the foreign relations of the
CPC has experienced a vigorous growth rather than shrinking.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Judicial System Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reform will also focus on strengthening the role judges play in
independent trials. Xiao said all cases will be handled by
judicial panels free of interference from above, with the
exception of difficult major cases which will be decided by
judicial committees.
</P>
<P>
Existing procedures require that court officials at different
levels ratify court judgements prior to pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that the nominal "people's jury system" is seldom
used because of numerous unresolved issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the SPC and National People's Congress Standing
Committee are currently discussing laws governing the
qualifications, selection, rights and duties and qualifications of
jurors.
</P>
<P>
A system allowing courts to invite specialists and experts with
appropriate expertise to serve as jurors in cases involving
specialized industries and knowledge, said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
He urged local courts to experiment with reform in line with
the Constitution and related laws.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 Beijing courts above the county level and 57 at the
township level have opened courtrooms to public hearings, with
members of the general public required to present a valid ID to
gain admittance.
</P>
<P>
The "open trial" movement is in fact being carried out across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Xiao also addressed judicial work for the coming year and noted
that courts must adhere to the political orientation based on
safeguarding the nation's reform, development and stability, as
well as improving both internal and external checks and balances
ensuring justice.
</P>
<P>
Information released during today's conference revealed that
Chinese courts at all levels have concluded 3.82 million of 4.33
million cases of first instance during the first ten months. Said
figures represent respective 2.67 percent and 0.93 percent
increases on the 1997 period.

<P>
HARARE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- South African police have
intensified the search for fugitive former Zimbabwean President
Canaan Banana, now believed to be in that country after fleeing
from Zimbabwe, the Daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted by the high court in absentia on 11 counts of
sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri Tuesday
confirmed that the South African police were now helping in the
search of the former president who first slipped into Botswana
before entering South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Banana's photographs have already been sent to that country to
assist the South Africans, most of whom do not know him, in
identifying him.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri said although Banana's presence in South Africa had
not yet been confirmed, there were strong indications that he was
now in that country.
</P>
<P>
Once located, he would be sent back home. It is believed that
one of Banana's sons, who is said to be working for South African
Airways, might be assisting his father to escape.
</P>
<P>
However, officials in the ministries of foreign affairs and
justice in South Africa Tuesday could not confirm Banana's
presence in that country, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
They said they had learned through the South African media
that he was likely to be in that country but nothing official had
been communicated to any of the ministries.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Oil And Gas Development In Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China's largest offshore oil
production area in the Bohai Sea expects to have 60 million tons
of verified oil reserves and 10 billion cu.m. of natural gas this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corp (COOBC), Bohai has an annual oil output of 2.2 million
tons and gas output of 370 million cubic meters. He said China is
speeding up efforts to explore two large oilfields there to add 4
million tons of crude annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil from the Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2
oilfields will be piped inland through the port of Jingtang in
Hebei province. Qinhuangdao 32-6, 100 kilometers east of Tianjin,
has 170 million tons of proven oil reserves. Eleven wells have
been drilled there.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2, some 20 kilometers south of Tangshan, has proven
reserves of 70 million tons. Four test wells have been
drilled. Nanbao's reserves have been estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The distance between the two oilfields is just 20 kilometers,
making joint development in a 70-sq.km. area possible.
</P>
<P>
Seven standard platforms will be put up in the two oilfields
and two pipelines laid to transport oil inland. Terminals will
also be built at the port of Jingtang, with 650 meters of the
coast used for oil transport berths. The construction work is
expected to cost 7.29 billion yuan.

In a memorandum sent to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav

<HEADLINE> Police Put on High Alert for Turkish-Italian Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government has called
on over 22,000 policemen to protect the security for the
politically tinged European Champions' League match on Wednesday
between Turkish champion Galatasaray and Italy's Juventus in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas was quoted by local
press as saying that "We will do our best to start and finish the
game without any incidents."
</P>
<P>
The tight security measures were guarantees requested by
Juventus and UEFA to protect the Italian side from any possible
acts of violence by Turkish fans angry at Italy's refusal to
extradite Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Aktas said that police will use a heavy hand against
troublemakers, warning that "whoever gets involved in provocative
acts will be severely punished."
</P>
<P>
Security officials said that police motorcades will escort the
Italian team from Ataturk International Airport to its hotel and
to Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Helmeted anti-riot police with batons and shields will be
stationed in and around the stadium to make certain that the
match is carried out in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that police will search spectators entering the
stadium for knives and clubs, banners and fireworks will also be
banned and roads to be used by Juventus players will be cordoned
off.
</P>
<P>
The game is expected to be played after a one-week
postponement by UEFA for security concerns on the wake of the
anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey over Romes' failure to extradite
Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Airports Target 8 Million Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan airports are expected
to handle eight million passengers in the next five years, while
profits are expected to double by 2000, the Kenya Airport
Authority (KAA) officials say.
</P>
<P>
Janet Ongera, KAA's Managing Director, said that through
aggressive marketing and other measures, KAA plans to increase
the number of passengers handled in Kenyan airports from the
current four million.
</P>
<P>
"KAA recognizes the need to promote good international trade
ties and that is why we are prepared to double our services for
the collection of national revenue," Ongera was quoted by
Wednesday's East African Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said that another objective to meet the challenges of the
next millennium is to increase the freight handled through Kenyan
airports from the current 800,000 tons to two million tons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a meeting on the review of the civil aviation
policy, Ongera proposed that to achieve the goals, KAA should
improve the standards of customer service to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
She said that insecurity both in air and at the airports have
been the major bottleneck to Kenya's tourism trade and asked the
government to "be thorough" in guaranteeing safety.
</P>
<P>
She also called for the full use of all airstrips in Kenya,
saying that many airstrips receive very low traffic mainly for
administrative purpose and are not viable to operate.
</P>
<P>
"Only about seven airstrips -- Musiara, Keekorok, Mara Serena,
Nanyuki, Mandera, Lokichogio and Amboseli -- are commercially
viable," she said.

<HEADLINE> Curio Industry in Zambia Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian curio industry has
collapsed because of the failure by local artists to formulate
means and ways of making it a major foreign exchange earner,
Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Webster Kalati, managing director of Webb
Craft, a Botswana-based curio company, as saying that the Zambian
government should also have a hand in the development of the
country's curio industry by sponsoring workshops for local
artists to help them learn how best to market their products.
</P>
<P>
He said the local curio industry had been besieged by foreign
dealers who had blocked the development of the Zambian culture.
</P>
<P>
"The development and preservation of the Zambian culture has
been overshadowed by the influx of foreign artists who are
promoting their own cultural values," said Kalati who came to
Zambia to place orders for local curios.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that there was no curio industry in Zambia to
talk about today because of lack of support from interested
parties, especially the government.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian artists have a lot of potential but lack
direction, financial and material support to uplift their
standards, said the government-owned paper.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted Venus Muwanza, Zam-Curio company's proprietor,
as saying that local curio industry had no future because it had
been static for a long time.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Wednesday following losses over the previous three trading days,
but the overall gains were limited by a lack of buying incentives.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 151.21 points, or 1.02
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 14,986.62.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, added 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,147.15.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on major sections dropped to an estimated 311 million
shares from 393.42 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 743 to 418, with 135 issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The market's concern about further deterioration of the economy
made players hesitant to buy shares aggressively, while they
remained reluctant to sell them as Japan's financial system has
gradually regained stability, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Traders, who are now focusing on the course of coalition talks
between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Liberal Party,
say the market is seeking stronger political leadership to pull
the economy out of the current slump.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government to Offer Farmers More Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said
that it has temporarily suspended the new agricultural policy and
will not leave the agriculture sector completely in private
hands.
</P>
<P>
Acting Agriculture Minister Suresh Desai told parliament
Tuesday that there is need for a strong government involvement in
agriculture especially at the transitional level of the new
policy, Wednesday's Times of Zambia quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new policy under which the government has completely
withdrawn from the delivery of inputs, credit provision and
marketing of produce has created problems in the agricultural
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there will be more direct involvement in the sector
from government wings such as the Food Reserve Agency from now
onwards.
</P>
<P>
He said that "economic survival for the country lies in
farming. Unless government runs away from a liberalized
agriculture, we will be doomed. We will be entering the next
millennium begging for food."

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Ethiopia to Beef Up Border Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan and Ethiopian
governments have resolved to beef up security on their common
border where bandits swept across from Ethiopia into northeastern
Kenya in October.
</P>
<P>
The two governments reached agreement Tuesday to increase
entry points along their common borders to effectively monitor
and maintain laws and order there, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They also said in a joint communique that there was need for
regular exchange of security information at the border points.
</P>
<P>
About 140 people were killed, 52 villagers kidnaped and about
17,500 head of cattle were stolen in Kenya's Wajir District
during the October attack by some 500 Oromo bandits from
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at the end of three days of peace talks
between top security officials from the two sides in Masinga,
northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Northeastern Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu
led the Kenyan delegation while the 18-member Ethiopian team was
led by the deputy commissioner of the federal police, Major
Alemseged G.Yohannes.
</P>
<P>
The delegates proposed that similar talks be held twice a year
and fixed the next-meeting for April next year in Bahr-Dar in
Ethiopia.

CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organizers
(SOCOG) unveiled an environmental blueprint in Sydney on
Wednesday to deal with waste to be generated by the 2000 Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney 2000 Integrated Waste Management Solution aims to
minimize waste by using materials that can be reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney 2000 Games environmental protection policy could be
followed by future games, Minister for the Olympics Michael
Knight said.
</P>
<P>
The innovative program is based on the total management --
from design, manufacturing and use of materials right through to
their disposal -- of a large amount of waste during the 16-day
event.
</P>
<P>
Knight said SOCOG will be entitled to dictate which materials
are acceptable. Materials such as paper and fiber will be popular
because they could be disposed easily.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Currency Reserves Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's foreign currency
reserves in November rised to 22.479 billion U.S. dollars,
crossing the mark of 22 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
figures released by the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The November figure is 565 million higher than that of October.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel, the country's central bank, attributed the
increase mainly to the receipt of the annual civilian aid package
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
In November, the volume of public foreign currency transactions
fell signigficantly to 13.41 billion U.S. dollars, compared with
19.35 billion U.S. dollars in October, the bank said
</P>
<P>
The October volume was unusually high, due to Israel's
currency the shekel's rapid depreciation during that month. In
September, trading volume was similar to November's level, at
13.16 Billion U.S. dolllars.
</P>
<P>
The daily average of foreign currency transactions was 639
million U.S. dollars in November, down from 968 million in
october, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the central bank's currency transactions with
the commercial banks also returned to normal in November,
totalling 1.753 billion U.S. dollars. The daily average of these
deals was 83 million, down from 150 million U.S. dollars in
October.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said that the shekel gained against both
the dollar and the currency basket in November. During the month,
the currency basket fell 2.5 percent, to 4.5537 shekels, and the
dollar fell 1.39 percent, to 4.1910 shekels a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, however, the currency basket
has risen 22.35 percent against the shekel, in annual terms,
while the dollar has risen 20.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Israel's foreign currency reserves was
20.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Continue To Drop Through Historic Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices continued
to fall through historic lows Tuesday on U.S. market as world oil
producers were unable to reach an agreement to cut supplies.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the New York Mercantile Exchange show that crude
oil for delivery in January fell nine cents to 11.13 U.S. dollars
a barrel, setting a new historic low for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, January crude oil finished at 11.22 dollars a
barrel, when adjusted for inflation, hitting a record low point
since 1959, when the U.S. government started tracking oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Traders said oil markets were handing down their verdict on the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for its
inability to cut on supplies at last week's meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said supplies must be cut by 1-1.5 million barrels per
day to stabilize prices at the 12-13 dollars range. Now 75 million
barrels are out daily, with OPEC members accounting for 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Traders said there could be a scrap for market share among the
OPEC members, rather than another round of the supply cuts agreed
earlier in the year. That could point to single-digit oil prices
in coming weeks or months.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Information Industry Propels Chinese Economy (1) by Correspondent Liu Dongkai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of this
year, the information industry has emerged a major driving force
behind China's economy in spite of unprecedented difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic growth rate hit 7.2 percent for the
January-October period. while the posts and telecommunications
sector one, chalked up a 36.5 percent increase in its turnover,
thus becoming one of the nation's fastest growing industries.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Information Industry (MII) projects
infrastructure investment in the sector during 1998 at 160
billion yuan, up 30 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Estimates call for the nationwide growth rate for investments
in infrastructure to hit 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output value for the electronics manufacturing industry,
including the computer and integrated circuit sectors, shot up by
31.8 percent for the first 10 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
China's information technology (IT) companies, including the
Legend Group and Datang Telecom Technology, have received banks
loans totaling billions of yuan. The IT service industry has also
witnessed accelerated growth during the year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists noted that the information industry has
emerged as a new growth area which has had an increasingly
significant impact on China's shift to a market economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
Extensive efforts of both the government and the business
community to promote infrastructure investments and upgrade
technology have created great demand for IT products.
</P>
<P>
MII statistics for the January-October period show that
increased capital investments in electronic equipment raised the
output value of related products by more than 46 percent on the
1997 period.
</P>
<P>
China ranked second in the world in terms of the network size
with a total of over a million kilometers of fiber optic cables
and 126 million telephone lines by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Economists note that scientific and technological innovations
related to information technology will be a cornerstone for
China's future economic system.
</P>
<P>
The IT products market continued to expand rapidly in sharp
contrast to the sluggish consumer market. China added more than 23
million telephone subscribers between January and October, or
substantially more than the total number for 35 years between
1949-1994.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Summit Supports Efforts to Develop Holy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the World
Buddhist Summit in Lumbini Wednesday expressed their commitment to
and support for efforts to develop the holy place in southern
Nepal as the fountain of world peace and the holiest pilgrimage
center of Buddhists and peace-lovers.
</P>
<P>
In the Lumbini Declaration adopted at the end of the two-day
meeting, about 400 participants from 16 countries said that they
welcome, support and appreciate the laudable step taken by the
Nepali government to recognize, declare and develop Lumbini as the
fountain of world peace and the holiest pilgrimage center of the
Buddhists and peace-loving people of the world.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the initiative of Nepal was unanimously
endorsed by the World Fellowship of Buddhists at its 20th general
conference held in October/November 1998 in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the participants are committed to
urging their governments and donors in their countries to take
note of the growing need for financial support to carry out the
work of the Lumbini Development Trust of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the international community to disseminate
information on spiritual and developmental activities of Lumbini,
where Lord Buddha was born 2,621 years ago.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the Nepali government and especially the
Lumbini Development Trust to review the present system and
procedures and consider the creation of an international advisory
body with a view to ensuring systematic and orderly progress
toward early completion of a reviewed master plan.
</P>
<P>
They also requested the Nepali government to make the Lumbini
Development Trust a permanent and autonomous body and the United
Nations to review the U.N. Lumbini Development Committee.
</P>
<P>
The participants, mainly monks, nuns and scholars, suggested a
feasibility study of the proposal to establish an International
Buddhist University in Lumbini and recommended that a suitable
institution be proposed to function as an associate center of the
World Buddhist University to be established in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They also requested the government of Nepal to declare
Baishakha Purnima (full moon day of May) as the Lumbini Day and
organize appropriate spiritual and cultural activities to increase
the awareness of the significance of the holy site.
</P>
<P>
They also committed themselves to deriving inspiration and
lessons for action from the rich and varied teachings of Buddha to
mediate for the purpose of attaining peace within themselves and
mediate at every level to resolve conflicts and counter evils.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their hope that similar summit meetings be held
regularly in Lumbini once every two years.
</P>
<P>
The summit was organized by the Nepali government with a view
to attracting the world's attention to Lumbini, preserving and
protecting it and materializing the peace concepts of Buddha --
loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity -- for
the prosperity of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The birthplace of Lord Buddha was included in the World
Heritage List late last year.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work is now underway for the construction of an
international airport there.

<TEXT>
<P>
With over 110 million telephone subscribers, including 23
million mobile telephone users, China ranks third in
the world in terms of cellular telephone customers.
</P>
<P>
The nation's computer output jumped by over 100 percent on last
year's same period, with the output of integrated circuits rising
by 34 percent. Increases have also been recorded in the output of
color TV sets, program controlled switchboards and telephones sets.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources note that the information sector has created
enormous wealth and numerous job opportunities which have promoted
economic development.
</P>
<P>
MII forecasts for the year call for China's software market
to grow from 11 billion yuan in 1997 to over 15 billion yuan this
year, up four billion yuan (480 million US dollars). Statistics
from the U.S.-based Business Software Alliance show that every 480
million US dollars added to China's software market yields 820
million US dollars in other economic areas, creates over 13,000
new jobs and increases tax revenues by 77 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
MII projects that China's computer related market, including
software, will grow by 35 billion yuan to 165 billion yuan for
1998.
</P>
<P>
Rapid expansion of the information industry has led to an
increase in the Chinese companies with copyrighted technology and
increased their competitive edge over foreign rivals. Related
companies include Giant Dragon, Datang Telecom Technology,
Zhongxing Telecom and Huawei Technologies.
</P>
<P>
The companies recorded breakthroughs in the development and
manufacturing of high-capacity program controlled telephone
switchboards in 1996, and have scored related achievements in
terms of mobile communications equipment during 1998, with related
products gaining a major share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
One MII official predicts that the information industry will
maintain its investment and growth momentum over the next two
years. Infrastructure investments in the telecommunications sector
are expected to exceed 160 billion yuan in 1999, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
He said completion of the framework for a nationwide
information superhighway in the year 2000 will have an even
greater influence on the future economic growth of the information
industry.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Affirms Achievements of 1998 APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has affirmed the achievements of the APEC leaders' informal
meeting in Kuala Lumpur last month, saying "leaders of 21 regional
economies affirmed their commitment to the APEC process and
introduced new initiatives to its work program".
</P>
<P>
In a statement the New Zealand APEC Task Force (ATF) said
Wednesday that the key outcome of the 1998 APEC leaders' informal
meeting was the "refusal of the leaders to embrace protectionist
responses to the economic crisis. Instead all 21 regional
economies reaffirmed their commitment to the APEC process and its
vision of free and open trade and investment".
</P>
<P>
The ATF, a body organized by the New Zealand government to
prepare for the 1999 APEC meetings in the country, noted that
Japan's decision not to commit to firm deadlines on removal of
trade barriers in fish and forestry "was wrongly interpreted as a
failure for APEC, reflecting general misunderstandings about the
process and its potential".
</P>
<P>
"In fact, good progress was made on the Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) program. Tariff removal dates of
December 2004 for forestry and December 2005 for fish, introduced
by ministers in Kuching this year, were confirmed by leaders in
Kuala Lumpur. All 16 economies participating in EVSL, including
Japan, endorsed these dates," it said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
With regard to financial issues, it added, there had been
concerns before the meeting that the pressures created by the
economic crisis would cause some member economies to pull back
from the APEC goals and seek to return to protectionist
responses.
</P>
<P>
In the event this did not happen. The Leaders' Declaration
reaffirmed APEC's fundamental goals, including its vision of free
and open trade and investment by 2010/2020. The Declaration
emphasized prudent growth-oriented macroeconomic policies,
strengthened financial institutions and markets, trade and
investment liberalization and capacity building, ATF said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, ATF said the task of accommodating visitors
at next September's APEC 1999 leaders' informal meeting in
Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, is well underway.
</P>
<P>
On the accommodation front, planning began in January this year
and all is running to schedule, it said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Proceed with Leasing of F16 Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has decided not to buy a third frigate from Australia, but would
"proceed with leasing 28 eight-year-old F16 aircraft from the
United States to replace the 19 aging Skyhawks", the Evening Post
Wednesday quoted New Zealand Defense Minister Max Bradford as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The deal will avoid the need to spend 54 million NZ dollars
(28.6 million U.S. dollars) upgrading the Skyhawk fleet which is
due to be replaced in 2007, and save New Zealand 431 million NZ
dollars (228 million U.S. dollars) over the life of the American
jets compared with purchasing new aircraft next century," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The government would also proceed with a 500 million NZ dollar
(265 million U.S. dollar) re-equipment program for the New Zealand
Army, which would grow by 500 soldiers with the addition of two
rifle companies, Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
"The total package will add not one NZ dollar to the defense
re-equipment capital plan announced in October, nor will it take
one NZ dollar away," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These decisions prove that we are committed to maintaining a
credible defense force in order to pull our weight with our close
friends and allies," the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper also quoted New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley as saying the offer of the F16s, which
"ideally suit New Zealand's needs", is "overwhelmingly
advantageous" and will not be repeated in the future.
</P>
<P>
While politics and public attitude to a third frigate purchase
have been factors, the Cabinet has put the greatest emphasis on
keeping within budget and sticking to the priorities identified in
 last year's Defense Assessment, she said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand "Emerging from Recession": Economic Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will record
negative economic growth of 0.9 percent for the year to March
1999, instead of 1.5 percent contraction predicted earlier, and
is already emerging from its recession, according to Deutsche
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic forecasts out Wednesday, the bank said
New Zealand will notch two quarters of positive growth in the
second half of this year, with the recovery projected to gather
pace in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Official figures, which were released earlier, showed the
country's gross domestic product decreased by 0.8 percent in the
second quarter of this year following one percent fall in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank forecast growth rates of 0.2 percent and 0.4
percent for the third and fourth quarters respectively. It also
sees growth of 2.6 percent in the year to March 2000, accelerating
to 4 percent in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
"That will be based on a consolidating international growth
outlook, as well as significant domestic policy stimulus," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecast the unemployment rate in New Zealand will
peak at 8.5 percent in mid-1999 and inflation at 2.2 percent in
late 1999.

MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Merchandise export receipts in

percent from a year ago, perhaps the highest export growth in
Asia, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here, the office said that total
year-to-date merchandise export receipts grew by 17.9 percent in
the first 10 months of the year to 24.387 billion U.S. dollars

The office said that revenues from electronics accounted for
56.2 percent of the total receipts for October.

<P>
The second top earner in the month consisted of articles of
apparel and clothing accessories, with sales amounting to 165.03
million dollars, or a 1.4 percent fall from last year, it said.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Eyes China's Highway Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) - Chinese highway companies listed
on the Hong Kong stock exchange will benefit most from
the government policy to increase investments in infrastructure
in order to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
H-share prices are still relatively low in spite of recent
substantial increases in the value of H-shares. Companies with
profitable highway projects, healthy financial resources and high
capitalization are expected to enjoy excellent performance,
according to a recent investment report released by Merrill Lynch
of the United States, one of the world's leading investment banks.
</P>
<P>
The Merrill Lynch report recommends three related stocks --
Yuexiu Transportation, Shenzhen Highway and Jiangsu Highway.
</P>
<P>
China has revised its highway investment plan on two separate
occasions during the year, with planned investments raised from
120 billion to 160 billion yuan in June and even further to 180
billion yuan two months later. The latest target calls for
total investments to exceed last year's figure by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has also issued 200 billion yuan in special government
bonds to increase investments in infrastructure, with the majority
of funds earmarked for highway projects.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch notes that China will quite likely invest even
more in highway construction since this year's total will
be far less than planned. Actual investments on related projects
stood at 120 billion yuan by the end of September, or some 65
percent of the annual target.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and highway companies indicate that
investments in infrastructure will grow rapidly during 1999,
according to Merrill Lynch.

<HEADLINE> Skirts Becoming Popular In Winter In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Skirts in various styles have
become increasingly popular in Beijing, in spite of the fact that
it is winter.
</P>
<P>
Fashionable stores say that they can sell more than ten skirts
a day, even at prices above 200 yuan (24 U.S. dollars), either
long or short skirts.
</P>
<P>
One young lady, Miss Liu Yuhong, who was wearing a skirt while
shopping, said she thinks the reason many women like them even on
cold days is that most want to be different from others and to
show their own taste. Skirts also make them prettier, she says.
</P>
<P>
Long skirts can be comparatively convenient for women who go to
work by bus, but those who are lucky enough to have their own car
can dress in short skirts and boots.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yan of the China Fashion Designers' Association explains
that it has become much easier for women in Beijing to accept
fashions from European countries and that people nowadays are more
open-minded.
</P>
<P>
Elegant and exquisite dresses and skirts with dark and bright
colors, blue especially, are quite popular this winter, many in a
design influenced greatly by the Japanese.

<HEADLINE> Spain Reiterates Respect for British Decision on Pinochet </HEADLINE>

<P>
MADRID, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar told visiting Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza Tuesday that his government will respect Britain's
forthcoming decision on the extradition of Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said the Spanish government believed right from the
beginning that the Pinochet issue should be decided by the justice
department. His government will adhere to this position and
respect the decision of judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
Insulza, who arrived here from London Monday, had talks with
Aznar, his Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes, Defense Minister
Eduardo Serra Rexach and other Spanish government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied with his trip to Madrid, noting that
after his talks in Madrid there have appeared "optimistic signs"
that will help settle the Pinochet issue. But he refused to
explain what these signs were.
</P>
<P>
He also said he neither made nor received any commitment on the
Pinochet issue.
</P>
<P>
Insulza flew back to his country Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Chilean former president Pinochet, who was arrested on October
16 in Britain at the request of a Spanish judge, is currently
under police guard in London while awaiting a decision on whether
Britain would extradite him to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon has blamed Pinochet for the death
or disappearance of more than 3,000 people, including Spanish
immigrants, during his 1973-1990 rule of Chile.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Switzerland to Cooperate on Salinas Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Swiss authorities will give
their Mexican counterparts the results of their three-year
investigation of Raul Salinas, brother of former Mexican president
Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo,
visiting Swiss Attorney General Carla del Ponte said on Tuesday
that investigators would give Mexicans evidence that Raul Salinas
accepted protection money from drug lords.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte arrived in Mexico on Monday from Brazil to meet with
Madrazo and organize the transfer of documents gathered by Swiss
investigators until October 20.
</P>
<P>
The documents reportedly proved that Raul used his influence
during his brother's 1988-1994 term to launder drug money.
</P>
<P>
Swiss authorities accused Salinas of money laundering based on
the testimonies of Drug Enforcement Administration witnesses under
a U.S. protection program. The Swiss seized over 114 million
U.S. dollars in bank accounts opened by Salinas.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report quoted Valentin Roschacher, chief of
Switzerland's anti-drug police, as saying investigators concluded
that Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican
traffickers paid Raul Salinas at least 500 million dollars over 10
years to protect drug shipments through Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up Industrial Park in Chittagong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- An industrial park involving 540
million U.S. dollars is to be set up in Bangladesh's second
largest city of Chittagong, 224 kilometers southeast of here,
early next year by a local private firm.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Chittagong Industrial Park Ltd., the second of its
kind in the private sector, has already obtained approval from a
high-powered cell at the prime minister's office, The Financial
Express Wednesday quoted the park's chairman, Quayum Chowdhury, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The park, which will be built for setting up 100-percent
export-oriented industries owned by both local and foreign
investors, will be developed on 42.6 hectares of land in Rangunia,
30 kilometers from the Chittagong port, with an estimated
investment of 120 million U.S. dollars, the park chief said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now conducting contour and topographic surveys in the
area, and the main work of developing infrastructure will begin in
April 1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
The park will have 400 industrial plots and facilities for
housing and recreation of the workers and employees, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The area would later be expanded to 300 hectares with further
investment, he said, adding that negotiation was going on with
several foreign investors for the expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Youngone company was the first to initiate such a
venture in the private sector following the country's enactment of
the Private Export Processing Act in 1996 that paved the way for
private investment in industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Work on the park developed by the Youngone company in
Chittagong with an estimated investment of 200 million dollars is
still going on, and the park will have 200 industrial plots and
other facilities when finished.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Calls for Coordinated Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Federal Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo Tuesday called for concerted international
efforts against narcotics, citing that growing sophistication of
drug smugglers made it impossible for a single country to fight
them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Mexico-Spain seminar on the role of the mass media
in anti-drug campaigns, Jorge Madrazo said that drug cartels do
not feel limited by borders, ignoring the concepts of sovereignty,
the rule of law and the institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexican drug traffickers routinely commit other crimes
such as money laundering and arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said that the traffickers also spread corruption and
committed homicides with the "truly infernal" capacity for
violence.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico supported the creation in the short term of a
multi-country evaluation mechanism for drugs in the Organization
of American States, rejecting the annual certification of the
United States on other countries' anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo said that such certification comes from "unilateral,
partial and biased evaluations" based on "internal political games
which have nothing to do with us."

<HEADLINE> India Increases Imports of Edible Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- With the steady increase in
imports of edible oil since the 1992-93 season, the rate of
self-sufficiency in edible oil in India has fallen sharply to 77
percent in the 1997-98 season from the peak level of 97 percent in
1997-98, official sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-98 season, self-sufficiency rate in production
of edible oil declined to 77 percent from 81 percent in 1996-97.
Production of oilseeds during 1997-98 fell sharply to 23.69
million tons from 24.96 million tons in 1996-97. Similarly,
domestic edible oil availability in the 1997-98 season also
declined to 7 million tons from 7.42 million tons in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, imports of edible oil into the country
touched an all time high of 2.083 million tons during 1997-98,
surpassing the earlier peak level of 1.82 million tons during
1987-88.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good sign for the country's oilseed economy and
its farmers and is leading to stagnancy in oilseeds production,"
said Ajay Tandon, president of Solvent Extractors' Association.

<HEADLINE> Workshop on ASEAN Mining Sector Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A workshop is being held here to
 promote investment and protect the environment in the mining
sector of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, which began on Tuesday, was jointly
sponsored by the Metal Mining Agency of Japan, the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization, Investment Promotion Service
Tokyo, the Japanese Overseas Development Corporation, Bangkok and
the Myanmar Ministry of Mines(MMM).
</P>
<P>
A total of over 150 officials from the ministries concerned,
resource persons of ASEAN countries and personnel of joint-venture
with MMM are attending the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is aimed at producing suggestions and approaches
for enhancing mineral exploration in the Asian region without
causing harm to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Mining Law was enacted in 1994 which allowed
foreign entrepreneurs to engage in prospecting and production of
mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The MMM has been cooperating with foreign firms to conduct
prospecting and exploration for gold and copper in the country
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the agreements for prospecting and exploration,
eight foreign firms have also formed joint ventures with the
departments and enterprises under the MMM.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than a dozen foreign companies including
those from Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand
and the United States have been participating in mineral
extraction in Myanmar, with Canadian companies specializing in
copper mining.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in
Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 501.36 million U.S. dollars in
43 related projects at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also show that the output value of
Myanmar's mining sector rose 1.5 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal
year which ended in March as compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in October, a national workshop, organized by the
Myanmar National Commission for Environmental Affairs and the
Hanns Seidel Foundation of Germany, was held here to propose a
national framework environmental legislation and an environmental
impact assessment legislation for Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Burden of Drug Elimination Heavy: Myanmar Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is determined and
committed to entirely eliminate drug menace to mankind as its
national and international duty, said Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
"The burden of this task is indeed heavy and we are doing
mostly on our own resources," Khin Nyunt, who is First Secretary
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, complained at
a ceremony Monday marking the beginning of commercial production
of buckwheat, a kind of opium-substitute crop, in Kokang's Ta Shwe
Tang area, northern Shan state of the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, however, welcomes the participation of international
community and organizations to facilitate the task and reach the
common goal of total eradication of narcotic drugs, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The buckwheat production pilot project began in 1996 when Japan
proposed the growing of buckwheat as a substitute crop for poppy
production, reaching a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar on
buying all the buckwheat produced.
</P>
<P>
The project in the Ta Shwe Tang area proved highly successful
with more than 93 hectares of the crops harvested and the
initiation of the commercial production stands as a landmark for
the people of the area in their fight against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary pointed out that the project has an impact not
only on the area but also on the country as a whole, saying that
the efforts for crops substitution is part of the overall endeavor
of the government to combat the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimation, in the 1998-99 fiscal year
which began in April, a total of over 5,898 hectares could be
placed under poppy substitution crops including paddy, corn,
sugarcane and Japanese buckwheat.
</P>
<P>
The estimation added that in 1999 and 2000, it is targeted that
a total of 4,916 hectares could also be put under paddy, wheat,
coffee seedlings and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out a plan for total elimination of narcotic
drugs within 15 years, initiating the move in 48 townships in the
country which cover those in Shan, Kachin, Kayah and Chin states
after successful transformation of eastern Shan state's Mongla
region into an opium-free zone in April 1997.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns Countries Contacting Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday condemned
certain countries for contacting the "Kosovo Liberation Army," an
illegal armed group of ethnic Albanian separatists fighting for
independence of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum sent to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav
Jovanovic described the contacts as the application of "double
standards" on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The contacts were "part of the double-standard policy that aims
to support the terrorist organization in Kosovo and legalize it
gradually," Jovanovic said in the memorandum sent to Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, who country holds the rotating
presidency of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions are in violation of basic principles of
international law" and "are to the detriment of the political
process of settling the Kosovo issue by peaceful means,"
Yugoslavia's news agency Tanjug quoted the memorandum as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the news agency did not specify any countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke in October, a
2,000-strong OSCE mission force will be deployed in Kosovo to
verify the compliance by the conflicting sides with the
U.N. resolutions on Kosovo, which include the withdrawal of Serb
troops and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Part of the OSCE mission force is already in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, the Yugoslav foreign minister also listed a
number of recent attacked staged by the separatists on Yugoslav
police and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Between October 13 and November 30, the separatists mounted 310
attacks and provocative operations, killing nine policemen and
wounding 30 others, according to the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
It said the separatists kidnapped three policemen and killed
two of them. Six civilians were also killed in these attacks and
provocative operations, it added.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's GDP to Shrink 1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) will shrink by 1 percent this year with an inflation
rate between 30 and 32 percent, Finance Minister Maritza Izaguirre
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Izaguirre said that the decrease was due to an oil price slump
which led to a shortfall of seven billion U.S. dollars in crude
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Venezuelan economy was boosted by soaring crude
prices of over 16.3 dollars per barrel and by a flow of foreign
investments, registering a 1.5-percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Izaguirre said that she expected a 3-percent growth in 1999,
while annual inflation was going to go down to between 25 and 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
She said that the projected growth was based on higher oil
prices reaching 11.5 dollars per barrel and a crude output of over
three million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Izaguirre also said that the government was considering
imposing a tax on the consumption of luxury products and liquor.
</P>
<P>
Oil makes up 70 percent of Venezuela's exports and provides
more than 50 percent of the revenue in the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela produces over three million barrels of crude oil per
day.

</P>
<P>
He noted that this meeting, being held before an EU summit next

adopting any resolution.
</P>

Agenda of the meeting includes debates on parliament-government
relationship and parliaments' contribution to European integration.
</P>
<P>
Austria currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima told the meeting that
parliaments were playing an increasingly important role in
Europe's integration process after the conclusion of the Amsterdam
Treaty in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Center-Left Bloc Leads in Italy's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy's center-left bloc emerged
victorious in provincial and municipal elections, preliminary
results showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local elections, which started on Sunday, involve more than
15,000 residents in four provinces and 58 towns.
</P>
<P>
The center-left's win was confirmed in provincial councils of
Massa Carrara in central Italy, and Foggia and Benvento in the
south.
</P>
<P>
In the province of Rome, no candidate has obtained more than
half of the votes, but the center-left candidate was ahead of its
main opponent by 4 percentage points. The two will compete after
two weeks in a run-off ballot.
</P>
<P>
Results from municipal elections in the 58 towns produced only
21 outright winners. Of the 21 elected mayors, 14 were supported
by the center-left, six by the center-right and one by the
Northern league.
</P>
<P>
Run-off votes of municipal elections will be held in 36 other
large towns and cities in two weeks. In almost all cases the
run-off will be between the center-left and center-right.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said
the results of local elections were a "sign of stability" for the
country's political scene.
</P>
<P>
Nearly seven million Italians were eligible to vote for the
local elections in what was billed as a first test for the new
center-left government of D'Alema, who rose to power in October.

<HEADLINE> Cleaner Fuel Essential for Emission Controls In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Specialists say that the wider
use of clean fuels is the major way to control auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
General Motors' China branch began a clean fuel drive in
Shanghai this week by bringing together Chinese and international
automobile manufacturing, petroleum, auto service and
environmental protection regulators.
</P>
<P>
Early next year, Beijing and Shanghai will adopt stricter auto
emission standards and China will have similar standards by the
year 2000. Chinese automobile manufacturers are developing
emission controls like electronic fuel injection and catalytic
converters to meet these standards.
</P>
<P>
GM announced recently that it will only bring cars with
catalytic converter into China from now on, and its joint venture
in Shanghai will only produce Buicks with emission controls that
meet the future requirements.
</P>
<P>
Auto industry analysts say that fuel problems in China have
affected the use of new environmental control technology. Zhang
Binyou, of China's biggest auto-manufacturer, the FAW Group, says
that China's oil refineries have yet to produce detergent fuel
additives.
</P>
<P>
China will ban the use of leaded fuel in 2000, but analysts say
that quality standards of unleaded fuel in China are different
from international ones and the difference may hinder the use of
catalytic converters and other devices.
</P>
<P>
An official at a vehicle inspection center in eastern China
says that this lack of quality will cause engines to malfunction,
increasing emission.
</P>
<P>
Du Fangci, of the State Administration of Machine-building
Industry, said that clean fuel is the first step in controlling
car emissions. This means new technology for car manufacturers,
but also the widespread use of cleaner fuels. He said that the
fuel distribution system in China must be reformed to guarantee
quality.
</P>
<P>
According to an international agreement, by 2010 China is
expected to hold the air pollution level to that of Western
countries, and it has adopted a plan to check car emissions at the
1990 level in Europe by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection study has shown that half of
Beijing's air pollution comes from car emissions.

<HEADLINE> Sir Lanka's Supreme Court Finds Election Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Supreme Court has
found the government's proposed bill to fix new dates for five
Provincial Council elections inconsistent with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper The Island reported Wednesday that the court
has ruled that the bill could be passed only with a special
two-third majority prescribed by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry into the constitutionality of the bill by the
Supreme Court followed hearings of applications filed by four
political parties challenging the legislation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The elections, which were scheduled to be held on August 28 for
five Provincial Councils, were postponed indefinitely by the
government for security reasons on August 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new bill was proposed to enable the Commissioner of
Elections to fix new dates for the elections and to allow the
secretaries of political parties or leaders of independent groups
who have already handed over nominations for the elections to
substitute any names appearing in their respective nomination
papers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has determined that both these provisions
were inconsistent with the Constitution, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Forms Fisheries Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar formed a fisheries
federation here Tuesday at national level to represent the country
in ASEAN Fishery Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Fisheries Federation (MFF), reformed from the
original Myanmar Aquaculture and Fisheries Association (MAFA),
will cooperate with fellow members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) in fishery resources protection, exchanging
information on the sector, finding new markets for the business
and increasing production and consumption, Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the State Peace and Development Council,
said at the reformation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The fishery sector is the third largest foreign exchange earner
after agriculture and forestry, gaining 167 million U.S. dollars
in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in March, by exporting
over 74,000 tons, up from only 15 million dollars in 1989-90 with
over 9,000 tons of exports, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He called for endeavors to protect fresh water and sea water
resources to ensure domestic sufficiency and to extend exports and
earn more foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The MAFA was first formed in 1989 as the Fisheries Technicians
Association, but was renamed as the MAFA in 1994 for wider
participation by entrepreneurs and companies.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in both fresh water and sea fishery resources
with 8 million hectares of water such as lakes, rivers and
reservoirs, producing more than 240,000 tons of fresh water prawn
and fish annually.

ROME, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Iran will continue to
strengthen their political, cultural and economic relations,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and his visiting Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi agreed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on Islam and Christianity held in
Italy's northern city Turin, Dini said the two countries shared a

</P>
<P>
Kharrazi spoke highly of the good relations between Iran and
Italy, voicing the hope that bilateral ties would develop the
potential of both nations.

A new phase in Rome-Tehran relations opened at the end of June
this year when the then Italian prime minister Romano Prodi became
the first Western leader to visit Tehran since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's historic visit came after the European Union (EU)
lifted a ban on ministerial contact with Tehran, which was imposed
following a freeze of more than a year on EU-Iranian "critical
dialogue" in protest against Iran's alleged support for
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Tries to Reduce Impact of Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis,
which has gripped the region for more than a year, has brought
about a rise in commodity prices, devaluation of local currency, a
drop in investment and close-down of a number of foreign and local
enterprises in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, which stood at 16.2 percent before the
outbreak of the crisis in July 1997, increased sharply to 29.5
percent shortly after the outbreak. As a result, the value of the
Myanmar Kyat against the U.S. dollar fell from 160 per dollar at
the beginning of the crisis to 350 now.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in 1997 fell to 1.3 billion dollars from 2.3
billion dollar in 1996, and investment in the first six months of
this year were only 222 million dollars, according to official
statistics,
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that at least 65 companies have been
forced to close down since the outbreak of the crisis, out of
which 26 are foreign ones mainly from the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Japan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has hindered Myanmar's endeavors to achieve the
targeted growth of 6.4 percent in gross domestic product (GDP) in
fiscal 1997-98 ending in March, which only saw a GDP growth of 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the impact of the crisis on Myanmar is not seen as
serious as that on some other Southeast Asian countries which are
directly hit by the crisis, the government has taken measures to
prevent it from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
The government has called for boosting production in goods and
services, taking austere measures by cutting state expenses and
promoting export through production of import substitute goods and
export items to ensure hard currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, priority is being given to the building of mills
and factories which manufacture the designated goods for export.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumers in the country have also been urged
to use more home-made goods instead of foreign goods in face of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Like some other member states of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) which are adopting a "sell more, buy less"
formula, Myanmar also called for importing less and exporting
more, and has shifted the priority tag from luxury items to more
essential ones.
</P>
<P>
The government has implemented a more efficient taxation system
and restricted import of certain categories of consumer goods,
especially non-essential imports, in an effort to prevent foreign
exchange reserves from draining.
</P>
<P>
To save its dwindling foreign exchange reserves, which stood
around 200 million dollars, Myanmar began controlling foreign
exchange payments from August 1997, limiting the payments for
imports, foreign remittances and overseas loans to 50,000 dollars
per month.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the inflation rate, the central bank and
private banks have raised the annual interest rate from 12 percent
to 16 percent on bank savings and from 18 percent to 20 percent on
loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is trying to improve its investment
environment in order to attract more investors. It has approved
more projects, including those of industrial zones, for investors.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 17 industrial zones have been established in Myanmar
 including five in Yangon, with investment mainly from foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, on the other hand, is also trying to promote its
foreign trade, especially border trade by applying regular trade
procedures based on the U.S. dollar in place of local currencies.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate border trade, it has opened more trade points
with neighboring China and Thailand, increasing the number of such
points with China to six and with Thailand to five. More similar
points are expected to be added along the borders with Bangladesh
and India.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering granting special privileges to
local and foreign entrepreneurs who export goods worth 2 million
dollars or above through seaborne trade in the 1997-98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
To promote trade activities, Myanmar has simplified its trade
formalities. Export and import licenses are issued within 48 hours
to traders instead of one week to one month.
</P>
<P>
The country promulgated in April this year new regulations for
import and export, designating 22 items of goods as priorities for
import.
</P>
<P>
To promote export, Myanmar has held various trade fairs in some
countries such as the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and the
Philippines to exhibit its products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also held seminars with foreign trade organizations
including the Singapore Trade Development Board to find means for
export market development.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also accelerating its privatization process as an
effort to reduce the impact of the regional financial crisis. The
privatization of state-owned economic enterprises (SEEs) is being
carried out in two phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, which is the privatization of all small-scale
SEEs, has been completed and the second phase, which deals with
about 1,760 medium- and larger-scale SEEs, is underway.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has said that it is ready to cooperate with other ASEAN
member states in resolving the regional financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Inflation Rate to Ease to 3.5 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation rate next
year will ease to 3.5 percent compared with 8.1 percent this year,
the Commerce Ministry forecast.
</P>
<P>
The forecast implied that Thailand would continue to experience
tight-money conditions in 1999, according to the ministry's
Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
While an inflation rate of 3.5 percent was appropriate under
normal economic conditions, during a recession it merely reflected
declining purchasing power, Nateetip Tongkoa-on, director of the
department's trade and economic index division, was quoted
Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials said inflation would decline steadily during the
first half of 1999, after which it would increase slightly.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 percent inflation forecast, which corresponded with one
made by the International Monetary Fund, was based on a number of
key assumptions. They included the baht stabilizing at 37 to the
U.S. dollar, interest rates remaining in the 13-14 percent range,
stable wages, and declining world oil prices, Nateetip said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the
first 11 months of this year rose by 8.4 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
But the year-on-year increase for November was just 4.7
percent. Compared with October, the rate declined by 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> 2 U.K. Firms Withdraw From Chilean Fair Over Pinochet Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Two leading British companies
were conspicuously absent from Tuesday's opening of Chile's first
international naval fair for fear of retaliation by supporters of
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, now detained in London.
</P>
<P>
The Smith Industries and British Aerospace, which withdrew from
the Exponaval '98, are developing a mini-satellite with the
Chilean Air Force, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's frigate HMS Sutherland sailed back home last weekend
on warnings from the Chilean navy that it could not guarantee the
safety of the ship or her crew following a British court ruling
that denied Pinochet immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The former Chilean leader was put under house arrest in a
London clinic last month after a Spanish judge demanded his
extradition to Madrid to face charges of genocide, torture and
terrorism during his 14-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The incident fueled tensions in Chile's relations with Britain
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
However, eight other British companies are taking part in the
fair, along with Spain's Bazan firm, which is building a
Scorpene-type submarine for Chile with the French company DCN.
</P>
<P>
One billion U.S. dollars worth of business deals are expected
to be signed during the five-day fair, opened by Chilean President
Eduardo Frei in the port city of Valparaiso, 120 kilometers west
of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 companies from 15 countries are taking part in
the fair, including Aerospatiale, Eurocopter, Boston Whaler,
Sippican, Bazan, DCN, Raython, SIMA and the Chilean firm Asmar.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France are the main participants, while China,
Mexico and five other Latin American countries have been invited
as observers.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Opposition Slammed for Pro-Rebels Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar slammed the main opposition United Nation
Party (UNP) for its members' pro-rebels remarks, parliamentary
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar Tuesday evening told the Parliament that the UNP was
representing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in
the Parliament, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The UNP had said that the LTTE was an invincible organization.
The UNP's arguments were almost for the LTTE and they were trying
to show how nice and brave the Tamil rebels were, Kadirgamar was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the United States has declared the LTTE as a
terrorist organization because it is in fact a terrorist outfit
and not a liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 15-year war against the government
for a separate Tamil state in the country. More than 55,000 people
have been reportedly killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The government could not forgive the LTTE rebels for what they
were doing to their own people but the UNP MPs, in particular
Anura Bandaranaike and A.C.S. Hameed, were saying they should rush
to negotiations with "a pack of murderers," the sources quoted
Kadiragamar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government would negotiate with the LTTE in
the context of recent LTTE statements that it was ready for talks,
the minister declined to answer at the moment, the sources said.

<P>
ROME, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Inter Milan coach Gigi
Simoni slammed the club's executives for giving him the sack on
Tuesday, according to reports from Milan.
</P>
<P>
Simoni was dismissed after he coached the Inter side to snatch
two consecutive wins, including a 3-1 victory over the European

</P>
<P>
He said he was in a fog why he was sacked after he helped the

</P>
<P>
Simoni vented his dissatisfaction in the wake of the new Inter
coach Romanian Mircea Lucescu promised a new bright future for
the club.
</P>
<P>
To sweep rumours in some reports, Simoni claimed that he
always had good relations with club president Massimo Moratti.
</P>
<P>
"You have written 1,000 times that there had been arguments
between me and the president, but I've never had anything like
that," Simoni said. "If anything , I've always had an excellent
rapport with him."
</P>
<P>
As for his future, Simoni said he didn't want to end coaching
career despite he still favored the Inter players and its
faithful fans.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players, Owners to Meet Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- With time running out, NBA
owners and the players' union today agreed to hold a bargaining
session Thursday that could save the season -- or cancel it.
</P>
<P>
Having apparently mended the hard feelings that forced them to
cancel Saturday's session, a league spokesman said negotiators of
owners and players will meet again, still far apart on the major
issues of revenue distribution, cost certainty and the timing
issues on the signing of free agents.
</P>
<P>
With the lockout in its 154th day, the sides have very little
time to reach an agreement and play an abbreviated season of
55-60 games. Although NBA commissioner David Stern has yet to
target a date on which the season would have to be canceled, many
believe the sides have just 10 days or so to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't have an agreement within the next two weeks,
the season's over," said one agent, whose clients include two
player representatives.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting was canceled as the union claimed the league
was "playing mind games" and the NBA accused the union of making
"a mockery" of collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was a tremendous setback because the previous
session on November 20 had produced the most progress.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Palestinian Commission Convenes First Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Tuesday
opened the first meeting of a joint commission similar to those
set up for state-to-state contacts.
</P>
<P>
Albright told the commission that the United States and the
Palestinian Authority should expand trade through a plan to allow
duty-free access for Palestinian goods, a U.S. official said
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the commission met
for about an hour on subjects including trade development,
assistance projects, cultural and scientific exchanges, and
programs to develop good governance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insists that it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians
to agree on the future status of the Palestinian territories,
which now have internal autonomy under a strict Israeli control of
all the borders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want an independent state, which is opposed by
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
According to Rubin, the U.S.-Palestinian joint commission could
also help promote private-sector investment in the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed to meet again some time in January but did not
fix the venue or date, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission grew out of the Wye River agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians, which was signed in Washington on
October 23 under U.S. auspices.
</P>
<P>
"It is what it is.... It is designed to build stronger ties
between the Palestinian Authority and the U.S. government," said
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin criticized Arafat for his latest statements on declaring
an independent Palestinian state in May next year.
</P>
<P>
"It has been our position and remains our position that
unilateral actions or unilateral statements of that kind are not
helpful," he told a daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
At a donors' conference in Washington on Monday, the
U.S. promised the Palestinian Authority an extra 400 million
U.S. dollars on top of a regular grant of about 100 million
dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Buy 4 U.S. Missile Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that Greece has asked it to sell four surplus Kidd-class
guided-missile destroyers and associated weapons to the Greek Navy
for an estimated 742 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sale, which will have to be approved by Congress, would be
the latest in a series of U.S. military sales to both Greece and
Turkey amid continuing tensions between the two countries over the
disputed island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The package would include a possible combined lease-sale
arrangement for the used U.S. Navy vessels, which carry
sophisticated "Standard" anti-aircraft missiles, "Harpoon"
anti-ship cruise missiles and torpedos.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, the Pentagon said the sale "will not affect
the basic military balance in the region."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Pentagon made a similar statement in announcing
the sale of 11 smaller surplus naval frigates to Turkey for 205
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Washington has sold sophisticated arms to both Greece and
Turkey over the past year despite the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Changing Clan-Chief System of the Shui People (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series-Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: Following is the
second of a series of stories featuring the fast-changing life and
culture of China's Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Shui and seven other main
ethnic groups in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
which will mark its 40th founding anniversary on December 11:
</P>
<P>
The old clan-chief system that is still practised by the more
than 300,000 members of the Shui ethnic group has begun taking on
a modern look. The Shui are one of 11 ethnic groups who have
inhabited Guangxi for generations.
</P>
<P>
The clan chief of Longtou Township is 80-year-old Peng Ruiyu.
He said that he was elected fifth clan chief of his village 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the customs, when the chief is in poor health or
dies, a new one is elected, Peng explained. "Everyone from the
Shui ethnic group will come for the election, during which a
candidate is named. If there is no objection, people will
shout 'yes' several times. No ballot is need, or a single hand
raised."
</P>
<P>
Longtou Township has about 400 Shui people with the surname
"Peng" who are believed to come from the same ancestor, who came
from neighboring Guangdong Province, according to the chief. They
also have their own language, but it has no written form.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of New China in 1949, the Shui people
practised collective-gathering and equal distribution, legacies of
a primitive society.
</P>
<P>
Peng explained that the primary duty of a clan chief is to help
bring clan members in resolving disputes within the clan or with
neighboring ethnic groups, to live together harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
Another task is to pass on the history of the Shui to younger
generations and to sort out the clan genealogy.
</P>
<P>
Peng has a primary school education. His grandson is a
university student majoring in electronics.

</P>
<P>
With the great changes in recent years, the work of the clan
chief has also been changing. The use of a village committee has
broken the monopoly in decision making held by the chief. But,
according to Peng, the village committee talks every important
decision over with him first.
</P>
<P>
When differences arise, the committee will consider the
decision and then discuss it again with the chief. "The principle
is to take the interests of the majority into consideration," Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most of his time was spent resolving clan matters,
but now he deals with affairs of the whole village. In the past, old
clan rules were something to stick to. Now legislation and the
spirit of the age are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
A young member of the clan with the surname Peng fell in love
with a girl also surnamed Peng, but from another village.
According to the old rules, people with the same surname could not
marry. But, the chief asked, "Are you confident about marrying
each other? If so, just go ahead with it."
</P>
<P>
At the chief's home, there is a television set and a set of
couplets he wrote to mark the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But, when asked to comment on the recently introduced ballot
system to elect village officials, the chief said, "The system is
good in the modern sense, of course. But the choice of clan chief
is different from the method for village officials."
</P>
<P>
Peng was appointed a member of the county committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference a few years
ago. When asked to comment on the possibility that the clan-chief
system may eventually vanish, he said, "It doesn't matter if there
is no clan chief, just as long as there are honest and upright
people who can help mediate disputes."
</P>
<P>
In any case, the eight Communist party members and village
officials all respect the clan chief, because they know the system
is an ethnic custom.

<HEADLINE> Albania Warns of Possible Rapid Spread of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Health Minister Leonard
Solis warned here Tuesday that AIDS could spread rapidly in the
country unless affective precautions were taken.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on World AIDS Day, the official said Albania was
facing a danger of rapid spread of AIDS due to a lack of
information on this disease, the great mobility of the population,
the large number of refugees abroad, rising prostitution and drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 38 AIDS cases have been detected and
officially registered since the first AIDS case was reported in
1993 and most of them had died, adding that the actual number of
AIDS patients is likely to be between 10 to 100 times the reported
figure, according to an estimate by experts.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged Albanians to fight AIDS, called on the
government to work out a complete anti-AIDS program and strengthen
the education so that each citizen would get to know how to avoid
HIV-inspection and fight drug taking.
</P>
<P>
Solis also called for equal treatment of AIDS victims,
maintaining secrecy for them, providing them with medical aid and
preventing them from intentionally spreading the disease.

ZHENGZHOU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade companies in
Zhengzhou, the capital of central China's Henan Province, are
importing and exporting goods more efficiently via the port of
Qingdao in Shandong Province, thanks to more coordinated rail and
ocean transport.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou can now move goods by way of Qingdao without stopping
and foreign trade companies can directly handle imports and
exports in Zhengzhou, according to a new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Zhengzhou East Railway Cargo Transportation Port of entry,
which was designated as a category-one port of entry by the State
Council late last year, handles the same customs business as
Qingdao does.
</P>
<P>
The coordinated operation not only saves time and money but
also allows companies to compete with cities in coastal provinces
more fairly.

<HEADLINE> 500 Overseas Filipino Workers Die in January-September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 overseas Filipino
workers died between January and September this year and 936 are
being held in jails, the Manila Times newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad, mainly as
housemaids, entertainers and construction workers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Alarilla, a Foreign Affairs Department official, was
quoted by the paper as saying that accidents, crimes and health
problems caused most of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 576 Filipino workers died abroad, including 156
women.
</P>
<P>
Alarilla said the government has restricted the deployment of
housemaids in some Middle East countries, where many cases of
abuses have been reported in the past.
</P>
<P>
Under the restrictions, maids can work only for diplomats and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The government also requires maids and most other women workers
applying for work abroad to be at least 25 years old to ensure
that they are mature enough to handle difficult workplace
situations.
</P>
<P>
Of the jailed Filipino workers, Alarilla said, 356 are in the
Middle East and Africa, 359 in Pacific rim countries, 172 in
Central and South America, and 49 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
More than 260 of those jailed in the Middle East are in Saudi
Arabia, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, remittances by overseas Filipino
workers average 6 billion U.S. dollars annually in the past five
years. The earnings by the overseas workers have been one of the
main sources of the nation's foreign exchange revenues.

<HEADLINE> Commission Says Clinton, Dole Should Return Taxpayer Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Election
Commission (FEC) recommended on Tuesday that President Bill
Clinton repay seven million U.S. dollars in taxpayer assistance in
the 1996 election, while his Republican challenger Bob Dole should
repay 17.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
FEC auditors alleged both candidates' campaigns illegally
coordinated and benefited from issue ads run by their political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The FEC auditors' findings, which have already prompted a
separate Justice Department investigation into the legality of the
ads, must still be reviewed by the six-member commission on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commission, made up of three Democratic and Republican
appointees, can accept, reject or alter the repayment figures.
</P>
<P>
The staff auditors said they concluded that Clinton and Dole
illegally coordinated supposedly independent ads run by their
parties during the 1996 campaign and in so doing exceeded the
spending limits the two candidates agreed to when they accepted
taxpayer assistance for the election.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is currently in the midst of a 90-day
inquiry into whether the FEC allegations warrant the appointment
of an independent counsel to investigate the Clinton campaign. A
decision on the recommendation is due next week.

<HEADLINE> Maonan People: an Ethnic Group with a Population of 70,000 (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: Starting from
today, we'll release a series of stories featuring the
rapidly-changing life and culture of the 11 ethnic groups,
including Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Maonan and Gin, living in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which will mark its 40th
founding anniversary on December 11. This is the first of the
serial stories:
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to China's 1.2 billion people of the Han
nationality, the Maonan nationality, an ethnic group with a
population of only 70,000, remains unknown to many in the country.
</P>
<P>
"While everybody in our county knows the Han people, many of
our Han compatriots in Beijing may have no idea of who we are,"
said Tan Sanchuan, magistrate of Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous
County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. "This can but only
enhance the awareness of our own existence."
</P>
<P>
Huanjiang County is the only Maonan autonomous county in the
country, where over 50,000 Maonan people live.
</P>
<P>
However, when in the county town, visitors find architecture
and dressing style identical to those in any town in south
China. Due to the strong influence of the Han culture, Maonan
people even use Han names.
</P>
<P>
"It's an imperative task to preserve our own tradition and
culture. Otherwise you may not be able to find any Maonan people
when revisiting our county," said Meng Guorong, a Maonan writer.
</P>
<P>
Meng, 58, has spent 20 years to collate and collect the folk
songs, anecdotes, and customs and habits of the Maonan people. One
of his books, describing the promise-fulfilling ritual of the
Maonan people, was recently collected by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The ritual is held by the Maonan people for thanking the favor
given by divinities. During the ceremony, a sacrificial altar is
put up and the local people, dressed up as divinities, are singing
and dancing in accompany of different musical instruments for
three days and two nights.

It is said only 60 to 70 percent of the Maonan customs and

Lei is of the She ethnic group while her husband is
Maonan."Since we have to speak mandarin at home, it affects the
child's command of the Maonan language," Lei said.
</P>
<P>
Tan Song, a Maonan boy, said that classes in his primary school
are taught in Maonan.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin Shengmin, an ethnology scholar, the awakening
of the ethnic consciousness has become a world phenomenon. In
China, the introduction of market economy has enhanced such
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
"Without a strong sense of identity, an ethnic group will not
be able to compete with its counterparts and develop itself," Qin
said.
</P>
<P>
In Huanjiang County's Xianan Township, there is a huge group of
ancient tombs accommodating hundreds of outstanding ancestors of
the Maonan people, where memorial ceremonies are often held.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the township raised money for the maintenance of the
tombs and designated them a historical site under special
protection.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the township has built mineral ore plants and
developed beef cattle breeding in its bid to boost the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
"An ethnic group has to rely on a strong economy to invigorate
itself. Without adequate financial strength, how can we be capable
to preserve our culture?" said Tan Feng, a township official.
</P>
<P>
"If it were twenty years ago, when the Maonan people could
hardly feed themselves, nothing was possible," said writer Meng
Guorong.
</P>
<P>
According to Meng, at that time, the promise-fulfilling ritual
was labelled as a "feudalist superstition" and banned.
</P>
<P>
In its support to develop the ethnic economy and culture, the
central government has listed a program to collect and collate the
Maonan cultural legacy as a key State project.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also decided to provide financial
aids in the building of the first museum of the Maonan nationality.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has found that
the Chinese are paying more attention to ideological strength while
trying to make money.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people at the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on
Gele Mountain in the city of Chongqing recently were a part of a
3-day study by the cemetery's administration and the Department of
Journalism at Southwest University of Political Science and Law.
</P>
<P>
They found that 83.3 percent of the visitors made the special
trip to pay their respects to the martyrs for their sacrifice for
China's future and found it "very moving"; 93.3 percent said that
it helped purify their minds and caused them to think; and 79.3
percent answered 'yes' when asked whether they "still need this
idealism in the market economy".
</P>
<P>
The cemetery in the northwestern suburbs of Chongqing,
commemorates 300 people who were massacred by Kuomintang
reactionaries before New China was founded in 1949. A popular
novel "The Red Crag" is based on their struggle and sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the spirit of the martyrs in sacrificing
their lives for mankind's future should be honored under the
socialist market economy, according to Li Hua, the director of the
Cemetery.

The 2002 World Cup finals, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea,
may be three days shorter than this year's 33-day soccer gala in
France, Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that 30-day World Cup competition would be OK
because the first phase will be played in two countries.
</P>
<P>
If reschedule the traditional June-July dates, the World Cup
finals may avoid the rainy season in June-July in the two
co-hosting countries, Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Tuesday, Blatter said he would endeavour to make the first World
Cup in the new millennium a big success.
</P>
<P>
There was no predecessor that FIFA awarded a World Cup to two
countries, so FIFA is faced with a difficult task, Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
The co-hosting Japan and South Korea and 1998 World Cup
champion France will gain berth automatically. FIFA must
re-allocate the remaining number of qualifying positions from the
six confederations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, this will be decided by the FIFA
executive committee in Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said FIFA would discuss the possibility that the
Democratic People's Repubic of Korea may host some games, howeve
r, it depends on the political situation.
</P>
<P>
Blatter arrived in Japan on Monday after ending a two-day
visit to South Korea. He visited the two countries for the first
time since he was elected the head of the world soccer governing
body, succeeding former president Havelange who had been in

SANYA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The coral souvenirs that used to
be so popular with tourists on China's island province of Hainan
are hardly seen any longer thanks to provincial efforts to protect
the coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
The city of Sanya attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors
each year. But, the coral reefs around the island has been
seriously affected over the past 30 years. Recent statistics show
that the reefs have shrunk to 480 kilometers in length from 1,200
kilometers in the 1960s. And, the area covered by coral has
declined by 50 percent to about 22,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Hainan took action to save the coral in August, closing down
130 coral lime kilns and 4 workshops processing coral crafts.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials say that they have had some success since
the rules on protecting of coral reefs were adopted in Hainan, but
local protectionism and some profit-motivated people are still a
problem in enforcing the rules.

On Monday, the hospital announced that Pinochet did not need

<HEADLINE> Australia Lowers Cash Rate by 0.25 Percentage Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA), the country's central bank, announced Wednesday that it had
eased monetary policy, reducing the cash rate by 25 basis points
to 4.75 percent in a bid to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
A fall in cash rate, the interest rate on overnight loans made
between institutions in the money market, would lead to cuts in
other interest rates, including banks' lending interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the move, Ian Macfarlane, governor of the central
bank, said the past year had seen an unusual degree of turmoil in
international financial markets, but the underlying trend in the
international economy had been towards lower growth, lower
inflation and lower world interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Australia's economy grew by 3.9 percent during the financial
year of 1997-1998, which ended on June 30, 1998, and the federal
government predicted that the growth rate for the current
financial year would be 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With a significant decline in world growth predicted by most
forecasters, it is still likely that growth in Australia will
slow, at least temporarily, during 1999," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
"In the medium term, Australian monetary policy aims to achieve
an average inflation rate of somewhere between 2 and 3 percent.
Inflation has recently been running below 2 percent, but our
forecasts point to some further pick-up."
</P>
<P>
The rate cut brought Australia's interest rate into line with
other countries which recently eased monetary policy, including
the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last reduced interest rates by half a percentage point
to 5 percent on July 30, 1997.

<P>
JINAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong Province has put
221 billion yuan (26.7 billion ) into fixed assets investment this
year, an increase of 23 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The investment helped the province's economy grow 10.5 percent
in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Weak exports caused by the Asian financial crisis as well as
sluggish market demand put greater pressure on Shandong's
economy. To offset these negative factors and maintain steady
growth, the local government decided to add another 15 billion
yuan in fixed asset investment to the original 206 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment will mainly go into water
conservation, transportation, environmental protection, and
housing, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, Shandong completed some 31.1 billion
yuan worth of infrastructure construction, up 19.2 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and agricultural development in Shandong grew
steadily in the first three quarters. The primary industry grew 4
percent, the secondary industry by 11.6 percent, and tertiary
industry by 11.7 percent.

MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the lingering regional
financial crisis, at least 1.8 billion U.S. dollars are expected
to be infused into the Philippine economy in the fourth quarter of

</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star Wednesday quoted Bienvenido Laguesma,
secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, as saying
that remittances peak twice a year, in June, when schools open in

He said that for the past five years, remittances by 4.5
million overseas Filipino workers average 6 billion dollars

CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The first significant shift in the Senate tax battle came
Tuesday when the Australian Democrats moved away from their
hardline opposition to the goods and services tax on food.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- A record spending spree by Australian shoppers -- 11.7
billion Australian dollars (7.37 billion U.S. dollars) in one
month -- is helping fireproof the economy and pointing to a bumper
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- An ambitious plan for Australia to help rebuild the
Indonesian economy is being mounted by influential business,
military and government figures. Backed by many of Australia's
most successful companies, the effort could involve
across-the-board assistance to rebuild and reform Indonesia's
economic, political and defense institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Howard government has given battlers a big tax reprieve

<HEADLINE> Euro-Zone Annual Inflation Stable: EU Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate for
the euro-zone remained stable at one percent between September and
October this year, compared with 1.5 percent a year earlier, the
European Union (EU) said in a report released here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the 15 EU countries' annual inflation
rate, which had stood at 1.7 percent a year earlier, fell from 1.2
percent in September to 1.1 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate in the United States remained at
1.5 percent, fell to zero in Switzerland and rose to 0.2 percent
in Japan. But the report said that these indices are not strictly
comparable with the European harmonized indices.
</P>
<P>
The overall picture indicates healthy economic fundamentals in
the 11-nation euro-zone for introducing the single currency on
January 1 next year, which is on a 31-day countdown from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EU is making final preparations in its third
stage of economic monetary union by implementing harmonized
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The member states are also working to bring down the average
budget deficit from around 5.5 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) to around 2.5 percent during a period of relatively
slack economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Grain Base </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, a leading
grain producer in northeastern China, harvested 25 billion kg of
grain this year, an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The region suffered heavily from this summer's flooding. Some
600,000 of its 4 million ha. of farmland were inundated by
floodwaters. More than 200,000 ha. were said to be complete losses.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official attributes the good harvest to
the increased use of technology.
</P>
<P>
The city of Tianjin, in spite of drought and pest problems,
reaped 2.1 billion kg of grain this year, another record.
</P>
<P>
Rural Tianjin had grain crops on 446,000 ha. of land, 6,000
ha. more than for last year. Because of a decrease in rainfall and
a long dry spell, the city cut the acreage of paddy rice and
expanded the area sown in corn.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has allocated 10 million yuan to
assist the anti-drought effort, and has developed water-saving
irrigation and the use of better strains of grain.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson admitted he lost
his temper following a traffic accident and the former
heavyweight champion faces up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Tyson pleaded no contest today to charges he assaulted two
men. Although the plea is not an admission of guilt, he still is
likely to be sentenced 10 years on each count.
</P>
<P>
"He admits to losing his temper on the side of the road,"
Tyson attorney Paul Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson told Judge Steven Johnson in Maryland that he was not
promised leniency and does not expect preferential treatment in
sentencing. He also said he was aware his plea could affect his
probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
"The state was prepared to present the facts in the case,"
said Assistant State's Attorney Carol Crawford, objecting to
Johnson acceptance of the plea.
</P>
<P>
Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick said Tyson kicked and
punched them following the accident on August 31 in suburban
Washington, D.C. They have reached an out-of-court settlement with
 Tyson to avoid a civil suit in the case.
</P>
<P>
"The complainants will testify at sentencing that this is the
appropriate plea," Kemp said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Indonesia's Quake Hits 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the
powerful earthquake that rocked remote islands in Indonesia's
Maluku and North Sulawesi provinces climbed to at least 32 on
Tuesday as rescuers continued searching for more dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
Reports of more deaths and destruction came in from the western
side of Mangole island, Maluku province, and from Manado, capital
of North Sulawesi province.
</P>
<P>
Officials said 25 of the dead were found in Mangole, a
timber-producing island of 17,000 people that bore the brunt of
Sunday night's quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said another seven people had died in
Manado.
</P>
<P>
"We are still looking for more victims", Sumadi, an official
with the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in Jakarta, was quoted
by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Strong aftershocks continued to rock Mangole island on Tuesday,
hampering rescue efforts and frightening villagers.
</P>
<P>
Afraid that aftershocks might bring down their damaged homes,
about 7,000 people in Mangole slept in tents or in the open.
</P>
<P>
Local government official Wahab Konoras told reporters that at
least eight villagers were still missing on Tuesday. "Rescue teams
are looking for more possible victims in remote areas. The toll
could rise further," he added.
</P>
<P>
Widespread damage was also reported on neighboring Taliabu
island, but there were no reports of deaths there.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said over 150 people were injured and more
than 858 homes, churches, mosques and other buildings were damaged
on both islands. Mangole's main government buildings were
flattened.
</P>
<P>
Some houses slid into the sea. Roads were cut and bridges
destroyed, hampering search and rescue efforts, officials added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimmer Gary Hall Allowed to Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalist Gary
Hall was allowed to swim in an international meet despite a
marijuana-related suspension through December 12.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Roger Strand, who issued a temporary
restraining order Monday allowing Hall to compete, stuck by his
earlier ruling, according to a report here.
</P>
<P>
FINA, internatinal swimming governing body, siad the
federation would not appeal. "We can do nothing more other than
obey the order," FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said today by phone.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is only valid in the United States. Hall is
still suspended in the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Hall won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle
and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Olympics. He also won
silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to compete in today's World Cup competition
and later this week in the U.S. Open competition.
</P>
<P>
Hall was temporarily suspended in July after FINA said he
tested positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition. During
a November 6 hearing, Hall received his three-month suspension
from FINA's drug panel. FINA then deducted two of the three
months already served by Hall during the temporary suspension,
which left him with 30 more days to serve.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A business venture in Tibet has
announced that it is investing in battery-operated cars using a
new curved surface lead-acid storage battery.
</P>
<P>
Gao Xiang, chairman of the board of the Hebang New Power
Technology Research Institute, says that his company and Sichuan
Hebang Power Investment Corporation will put 250 million yuan (30
million U.S. dollars) into 2 production centers for the new
batteries to be built in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and Chengdu,
the capital of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
He says the battery-operated cars are expected to put on the
market within three years. A car that seats 4 people can go at a
speed of 100 kilometers per hour. The service life of the storage
battery is two years.
</P>
<P>
He says the retail price is expected to be less than 200,000
yuan, or 50,000 yuan more than for a gas-powered motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that the new battery recently obtained provincial level
appraisal and a patent on a recharge device has been applied for
in the United States and 8 other countries.

<HEADLINE> Batty Pleads for Common Sense to Prevail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Wantaway midfielder David Batty
demanded "common sense" from Leeds and Newcastle in a bid to end
his transfer torment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A frustrated Batty is currently in limbo as he anxiously waits
for the two clubs to reach a compromise on what he is worth, and
despite interest from several other Premiership clubs Batty has
made it clear it's Leeds or no one.
</P>
<P>
Elland Road chairman Peter Ridsdale has already bid four
million pounds for the England international, but the Magpies are
looking for another two million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Batty's decision to waive 800,000 pounds in signing-on bonuses
to rush through the move, money agreed when he recently signed a
new five-year deal, has cut little ice with the St James' Park
board.
</P>
<P>
With both clubs digging their heels in, the impasse could drag
on to the annoyance of Batty, who was hoping to have been back at
Leeds in time to celebrate his 30th birthday on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he turned up at Newcastle's Chester-le-Street
training headquarters on Tuesday morning, while advisor Hayden
Evans - who had cancelled all business appointments throughout
the last two days - waited for news.
</P>
<P>
But Evans said: "It has been very frustrating, but there's
nothing we can do. David has done all he can. He has gone public
with his transfer request and made his intentions perfectly
clear. You could say he has put his money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the two clubs are a bit apart in their valuations
and David is just hoping for a degree of common sense as both
clubs know exactly what he wants. I'm optimistic there is middle
ground. When you're a football agent you have to be an eternal
optimist. Hopefully there will be a compromise," he added.

OTTAWA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Olympic
Association (COA) announced Tuesday that Vancouver will be its
candidate to bid for the 2010 winter Olympic games.
</P>

COA delegates made their choice in a vote on November 21, but
chose to disclose its results until Tuesday so as not to

</P>
<P>
Vancouver beat both Calgary and Quebec City in its efforts to
be Canada's official candidate city for the games.
</P>
<P>
Calgary was believed to have little chance to win the 2010 bid
internationally, since it had held the 1988 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Quebec City was dropped because of the province's uncertain
political climate, reports said. It was Canada's official
candidate for the 2002 Games, but it lost to Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Improper Diet Affecting Chinese Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Although China has successfully
provided most of its 1.2 billion people with adequate food,
improper diet in both urban and rural areas is affecting people's
health, said a nutritionist here today.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of meat in cities has sharply increased over
the past two decades, while fewer grains and vegetables are being
consumed, said Chen Chunming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"A diet high in fat and caloric content causes cardiovascular
diseases and diabetes," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the incidence of high blood pressure among
Chinese adults has increased from 7.7 percent 20 years ago to
nearly 10 percent today, and the figure in large cities such as
Beijing is as high as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over 14 percent of Chinese urbanites over the age of 20 suffer
from obesity, according Chen.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that Chinese spent 41.9 billion yuan
(about five billion U.S. dollars) to treat diseases related to
improper diet, including cardiovascular diseases and obesity, in
1994. This figure is increasing at a rate of 17.7 percent, and is
projected to reach 126.1 billion yuan (15 billion dollars) in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that malnutrition is very common among
Chinese village residents because of a lack of nutrition
information. About 13 million children under the age of six are
underweight and 24 million are below the standard height.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese nutritionists have recently published a diet
guidebook, and they say China should hasten the development of the
soybean industry to produce bean products with a high protein
content as a daily food for Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Chinese per capita milk consumption is only 6.4 percent of the
world average, and this low intake of calcium leads to high
incidence of rickets among infants, and osteoporosis among the
aged. Chinese should drink more milk and increase the variety of
milk products, say the nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
They also advise Chinese to eat less pork, which currently
accounts for 70 percent of all meat consumption, and eat more
chicken.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Waives Some Sanctions on Pakistan, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday he had waived until October 21, 1999, certain
sanctions against India and Pakistan imposed after they conducted
a series of nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of a visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
to the U.S., the White House released a letter from Clinton
ordering that the sanctions, which affect lending by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the
Trade and Development Agency, be waived.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. officials announced Clinton planned to take
the step, which will also allow U.S. banks to resume lending to
Pakistan and India because of progress in talks with the two
countries on arms issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also
paves the way for international financial agencies to lend
Pakistan money to support an assistance program that it is
negotiating with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The move will also allow military officers from the two

<HEADLINE> British Farm Incomes to Fall by 33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- British farm incomes are
expected to go down by 33 percent this year, compared with 1997, a
government statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in incomes during 1998 is due mainly to the fall in
prices for most major commodities," Farm Minister Nick Brown said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Farm incomes can be cyclical. Indeed they rose by 90 percent
between 1990 and 1995. It is now our task to work together towards
a sustainable, competitive and profitable industry," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The 33 percent fall represented a 35 percent fall in real terms
and was the second substantial fall in successive years, according
to the figures showed in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Total incomes from farming had fallen by 63 percent in real
terms over the past two years, although from an historically high
level, the statement said.

<P>
JINAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province, a major grain
producer in east China, plans to invest 14.86 billion yuan in
water conservation projects to deal with its severe water shortage
and stabilize grain production.
</P>
<P>
These are projects backed by local funds instead of others
invested by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, Shandong has constructed many
water conservation projects and has controlled soil erosion over
an area of more than 30,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has 4.66 million hectares of irrigated
farmland including over 3.33 million hectares able to produce good
harvests under all weather conditions, and grain production
capacity there now exceeds 40 billion kilos.
</P>
<P>
The province still faces severe water shortages, as its
per-capita water resource is only one-sixth of the national
average.

<HEADLINE> Over 1 Million Iraqi Students Fail to Enroll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 1 million Iraqi students,
or 20 percent of the total number of students expected to attend
schools, have failed to enroll in 1998, said Iraqi Education
Minister Fahad al-Shokrah on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly 200,000 school dropouts were recorded this
year, most of whom are primary and secondary students, al-Shokrah
said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of school dropouts worsened due to the
impact of the U.N. embargo on Iraqi people's income as well as the
people's weakened belief in the benefits of education, another
effect of the prolonged sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that before the U.N. sanctions, the Iraqi
government provided students with all the necessary requirements
for education, such as books, stationery and scientific equipment
and laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions brought about acute shortage of stationery in
Iraq's primary and secondary schools. For example, the country
needs a total of 75 million notebooks for its students, but only
25 million are available, he said.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program which
expired a week ago, Iraq was allowed to export 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shokrah said that of the 5.2 billion dollars, 38 million
dollars were allocated for the education sector, which means less
than two dollars for each student per month.
</P>
<P>
Before the U.N. sanctions, however, 500 million dollars were
allocated for the education sector every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,100 schools were destroyed during the 1991 Gulf War, and
rebuilding these schools requires millions of dollars, said
al-Shokrah.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's population have increased, but no new schools have been
built, therefore all the schools are over-crowded, and this will
inevitably affect the quality of education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was awarded an international trophy, before the sanction,
for its efforts in eradicating illiteracy, Al-Shokrah noted, but
illiteracy is making a rapid comeback in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The number of teaching staff is dropping at an average rate of
10 percent a year after the imposition of U.N. sanctions, as a
result, illiteracy rate is increasing at an average rate of about
5 percent every year," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The monthly salary of a primary school teacher is 3,500 Iraq
dinars, or less than three U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the U.N. trade embargo is lifted one day, its
influence will remain for the many generations to come," he
added.

<HEADLINE> German-French Summit disagrees on EU Farm And Bonn Rebate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of France and Germany
ended a two-day summit Tuesday with discord over trimming costly
European Union farm subsidies and German demands for a EU budget
rebate.
</P>
<P>
But "the differences of opinion are small", said French
President Jacques Chirac at a joint press conference with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroede after the summit, seeking to play down
disagreement between Bonn and Paris over how to cut EU agriculture
spending which gobbles half of the bloc's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Germany wants a major cut in its EU membership bill through
shifting responsibility for farm subsidies to individual member
states. France opposes this.
</P>
<P>
France is also a major beneficiary of agriculture subsidies
from EU, according to DPA.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is by far the EU's biggest paymaster with annual net
contributions of over 12.4 billion dollars, compared with just
0.47 billion dollars for France.
</P>
<P>
Both Schroeder and Chirac underscored their caution on swift EU
expansion into the former East Bloc.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly true, this process will take longer than
planned," said Chirac. Bonn and Paris agreed the EU would have to
reform its own institutions before taking in new members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder agreed: "It is difficult to set a date" for
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also stressed that reforming EU before enlargement
would be "difficult" given sharp disagreement over how to downsize
the European Commission and shift from the current voting system -
which allows one member to block decisions - to majority voting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he predicted reform issues linked to the
so-called Agenda 2000 - reforming farm subsidies, the E.U. budget
and structural aid policies - would be hammered out by a special
summit to be held in Germany next March.
</P>
<P>
Both Schroeder and Chirac agreed also EU unemployment should be
fought with "binding" employment targets and called on the
15-nation Union to approve an "employment pact" at its December
11-12 Vienna summit.
</P>
<P>
On NATO, Schroeder told reporters that Germany would remain a
firm member of the alliance regardless of how a debate was
resolved on whether to retain the possible first-use of nuclear
weapons as part of NATO strategy.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer has called for
NATO to eliminate any first-use option for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Potsdam summit was also attended by French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and some 20 cabinet ministers from both nations. The
semi-annual meeting has been a cornerstone of the Franco-German
axis since the 1960s.

The much humidity and little sun-shine combined to contribute
toward a lower-than-usual temperature in the three months,
according to meteorologists at the institute.
</P>
<P>
The average minimum temperature of this period was 0.7 degrees
Celsius as against the previous reading of 3.5 degrees; the
average mean temperature was 3.7 degrees compared with the
previous reading of 6.6 degrees, while the average maximum
temperature was 6.6 degrees, 2.3 degrees lower than than the
previous reading.
</P>
<P>
This past autumn, therefore, has been registered as the fourth
most humid and least sunny season in the country's history ever
since the royal meteorological institute started recording weather
conditions in 1833.
</P>
<P>
With a rainfall of 411 millimeters, the autumn of 1974 is the
most humid autumn in Belgium while the least sun-shined autumn was
recorded in 1887 when sun-shine totaled only 194 hours in three
months.
</P>
<P>
The unusual rainfall this past autumn caused some flooding in
eastern and northeastern Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Maintaining Good Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Tuesday called for maintaining good relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the appeal while meeting with a visiting Chinese
press delegation, which arrived here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed China one of the cradles of thoughts and
civilizations in the world, saying that "China is one of the
countries for dialog among civilizations and today we need the
thought and talent of Confucius," the Chinese philosopher in the
6th century BC.
</P>
<P>
Iran and China, as two big countries with ancient
civilizations, may exchange their experiences in various fields,
said Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani when meeting with the nine-member delegation on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We consider Tehran-Beijing relations as a strategic one,
and the two countries can expand their cooperation in political,
economic and cultural fields in line with their good relations,"
the Iranian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and China can renew their agreements to boost cultural
cooperation between governmental and non-governmental
institutions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Annual AIDS Infections in EU Around 30,000, Says EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 1 (Xinhua) -- European epidemiologists
estimate the annual number of new AIDS infections within the
European Union (EU) to be around 30,000, said European
Commissioner Padraig Flynn on the occasion of World AIDS Day,
December 1.
</P>
<P>
This figure, he said, has not fallen over the last two years,
indicating that efforts at prevention are taking time.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 500,000 people in the European Union have
the HIV virus, Flynn said. Since the epidemic began, nearly
200,000 cases of AIDS have been declared within the Union, 60
percent of whom are known to have died.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the incidence of AIDS has steadily declined in all
the EU member states thanks to the availability of new
anti-retroviral treatment which prevents or delays the onset of
the disease among the HIV-positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
When recalling the EU's commitment to combat AIDS, Flynn said
"We must continue our efforts unremittingly, coordinating
activities under different policies and bringing together all the
players involved: the health professionals, patients'
associations, the authorities, and non-governmental and
international organizations."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU' executive body, has provided
so far this year financial support totalling 10 million European
currency units (about 11 million U.S. dollars) to some 40 projects
or European networks under a five-year program for prevention of
AIDS and other communicable diseases, according to Flynn.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Funding Provisions for Anti-Disease Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
members' 35 animal disease eradication programs will be
co-financed at the rate of 50 percent by the EU with a total
budget of 50.75 million European currency units, the EU said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These funding provisions are included in two EU decisions which
have been adopted by the European Commission, the EU's executive
body.
</P>
<P>
The diseases targeted by the EU's 1999 animal disease
eradication program have implications for both human and animal
health or cause serious losses in livestock farming, thus
constituting barriers to intra-EU or international trade in
animals and animal products, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The main diseases covered by the program are brucellosis in
sheep and cattle, leucosis in cattle, tuberculosis and rabies,
among 14 diseases cited by different EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The funding available under most programs will be concentrated
on compensating farmers for the slaughter of infected animals, the
EU said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Firearms Control Law Comes Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- All the firearms buyers have
to wait for the background checks before they purchase handguns
or other firearms, according to a new U.S. federal system that came
into effect Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new system is required under the Brady Act, which
established federal background checks for handgun purchasers
almost five years ago. Now people buying rifles and shotguns must
submit to checks, too.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12.4 million firearms are sold each year in the
United States. All will be covered by background checks, as will
an additional 2.5 million annual transactions when an owner
retrieves a firearm from a pawn shop.
</P>
<P>
U.S. federal law bans gun purchases by people convicted or
under indictment on felony charges, fugitives, the mentally ill,
those with dishonorable military discharges, those who have
renounced U.S. citizenship, illegal aliens, illegal drug users and
those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or under
domestic violence restraining orders.
</P>
<P>
States had the option of running the system themselves, or
having the federal government do it for free. Sixteen states chose
to do it themselves; 10 others will run their own handgun checks
and let the FBI handle other purchases.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has given states 200 million U.S.
dollars in the past few years to help them computerize their
records.
</P>
<P>
The gun control system aroused debate among groups. The
National Rifle Association filed suit in U.S. District Court in
Washington Friday contending a decision by the Justice Department
to maintain a list of all people who apply to buy guns violates
federal law.
</P>
<P>
But groups supporting firearms control say the new law is too
lax because it decreases the time officials have to research a
potential buyer. Under the old law, they had as long as five days
if they needed it. But under the new law, they have three.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall to New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- World oil markets on Tuesday
recorded fresh lows, as London's benchmark Brent closed at $10.21
a barrel, down 25 cents, after touching a new 12-year low of
$10.06.
</P>
<P>
Average prices for the year to date, at $13.60 a barrel, are
the lowest since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Dealers now fear that the reopening of old OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) rivalries at rancorous talks in
Vienna could signal a scrap for market share among the group's
biggest producers, rather than another round of the supply cuts
agreed earlier in the year, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil companies reacted to the price crash with a
series of deals which culminated on Tuesday with the biggest
industrial merger ever between U.S. Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
OPEC does not meet again until March by which time it will have
to have patched up some glaring differences if it wants to add to
the 2.6 million barrels daily of output cuts it made earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The alternative, warn analysts, could be a lengthy period of
single-digit oil prices.
</P>
<P>
A basket of seven OPEC crudes was valued at $9.89 a barrel on
Monday, dipping into single digits for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Prices have also been hit in recent weeks by a slowdown in
global oil demand which in October was estimated running 1.5
million barrels a day lower than in the same month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's best hope now, said analysts, would appear to be some
behind-the-scenes discussion of strategy and a cold winter in the
United States, the world's biggest importer, according to Reuters.

<HEADLINE> Effective Steps Urged to Curb AIDS Diseases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Speaker
of the House of People's Representative, Petros Olango, Tuesday
stressed the need to take effective measures to curb AIDS diseases in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering here to mark this year's World AIDS
Day, Petros said half a million children in the country have lost
their parents to HIV/AIDS, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that intensive sensitizatlion programs should be
launched to bring about behavioral change among the general
public.
</P>
<P>
Petros added that another 620,000 children will lose their
parents to the lethal disease after two years.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,000,000 HIV carriers and 400,000 AIDS
patients in the country, he said, adding that a recent study
conducted in some towns indicated that 12 to 18 percent of
pregnant women are infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
Petros called upon governmental and non-governmental
organizations, religious institutions as well as the public at
large to join hands in the fight against the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Ethiopian Health Minister Adem
Ibrahim said preparations are underway to launch a national
campaign against the pestilence.
</P>
<P>
This year's World AIDS Day is observed all over the world
Tuesday under a theme that calls for increased attention for the
youth, the prime victims of the AIDS disease.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho to Launch Interim Authority Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Interim
Political Authority (IPA), tasked to prepare the country for
fresh elections, will be sworn in next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili made the
announcement at the end of a two-hour meeting of political party
leaders on Tuesday to consider the inauguration of the IPA, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili said South African President Nelson Mandela, who is
chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
will then arrange for the holding of the inaugural meeting of the
transitional body.
</P>
<P>
He said the Basutholand Congress Party (BCP) was the only one
of the 12 parties which participated in the May general elections
that had not yet submitted the names of their representatives on
the IPA.
</P>
<P>
The BCP leadership said the names of their nominees would be
forwarded to the minister of law by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The IPA is supposed to be composed of two representatives from
each and every party.
</P>
<P>
The swearing in of the body had been delayed by the death of
the leader of the Basotho National Party (BNP), Everestus
Sekhonyana, who will be buried this week.
</P>
<P>
The BCP, the BNP and Marematlou Freedom Party are three major
opposition parties in the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the IPA was agreed upon by government and
opposition in mid-October following an agreement that new
elections would be held in 15 to 18 months' time.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won the May
elections, but opposition parties claimed that they were rigged.
Protests began in the beginning of August and went out of control
in September, prompting military intervention by the SADC.

<HEADLINE> Youth Accounts for Over Half of New AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Over half of new AIDS
infections in the world occur among young people because they are
an age group with special vulnerability to the fatal killer.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the national function which was held here
Tuesday to mark the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
The documents distributed by Uganda AIDS Commission showed
that of all those infected after infancy, at least half are young
people. The 10 to 24 age group accounts for more than 30 percent
of all people in the developing world where the epidemic is
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
The documents attributed this high infection rate among young
people to inadequate education about sexuality issues, unsafe
sexual practices, existence of customary laws and practices such
as forced marriages, unsafe circumcision, substance abuse like
alcohol consumption and others.
</P>
<P>
Young women are biologically and socially more vulnerable to
HIV than young men because their reproductive tract is more
susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
They also face the problem of unwanted sex ranging from social
pressure, coercion by older men in authority or outright
violence.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in Uganda, the HIV infection in girls of 15 to 19
years is six times higher than in boys of the same age group.
</P>
<P>
Boys under the age of 18 are not protected by the laws of
sexual offences yet it is known that a number of them are sexually
abused by older women and men.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol consumption affects sexual behavior which increases
young people's vulnerability to HIV, the documents said.
</P>
<P>
Africa is the continent which suffers most from the pandemic.
Over 83 percent of deaths caused by AIDS is from sub-Sahara
Africa and 80 percent of new infections among children is in this
region.
</P>
<P>
With the tireless efforts by the government and
non-governmental organizations in this field, Uganda's infection
rate has dropped from 30 percent to 15 percent. Even this rate
is still unacceptably high.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing all it can to reduce the rate to a new
low and to find new remedies for the problem.
