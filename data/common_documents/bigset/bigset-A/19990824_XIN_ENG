<HEADLINE> Victims Friendly Courts Proving Effective in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Victims Friendly Courts (VFC)
 introduced in Zimbabwe six years ago have proven an effective
method in dealing with problems faced by vulnerable groups when
their cases came up for trial.
</P>
<P>
VFC National Chairman David Mangota Monday told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that changes in investigation and social welfare
intervention had contributed a lot to the success of the system.
</P>
<P>
"The multi-sectoral cooperation has made it so easy for
officers to cope with changes which have made the court system
accessible to children," said Mangota.
</P>
<P>
He said non-governmental organizations were instrumental in
providing expertise to officers directly involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
Advantages associated with the system were that children no
longer faced the accused in court and suffered no trauma from
harsh cross examination, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Begins First Day in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Together with his Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer and other cabinet members, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder formally began to govern the country in Berlin
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Returning from Italy after a summer holiday, Schroeder said it
was a "historical day" that Germany's political center had moved
to its old capital from the small city of Bonn beside the Rhine
River.
</P>
<P>
"I am lucky to be able to live in Berlin," he said in a
television interview.
</P>
<P>
Again, Schroeder thanked those who had made contributions to
German reunification that made its possible for him to live in
Berlin. The people he mentioned including the then French
President Francois Mitterrand, the then U.S. President George
Bush, and especially Schroeder's predecessor, then Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years after reunification and eight years after the
German parliament passed the bill of relocating its capital, most
parts of the country's ruling machine have found their sites in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The parliament and seven federal ministries, namely foreign,
transport, interior, justice, health, finance, and environment,
have begun their operations in succession. The other seven
ministries, the Defense Ministry being the most important among
them, will be left in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But without a Chancellory in the capital, Schroeder will have
to locate his temporary residence in the building of former East
Germany's State Council until year 2000, with Fischer as the
neighbor. A new Chancellory, costing 465 million marks (252
million U.S. dollars), is now under construction near the famous
Reichstag building.

<HEADLINE> Research Work on Female Genital Mutilation to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- There is need to intensify
research work on female genital mutilation (FGM) in Africa to help
abolish the inhuman practice, a professor said Monday in Ghana's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Ghana News Agency reported that professor Patrick Twumasi said
this at the opening ceremony of the three-day regional steering
group meeting on prevention of FGM, the first of its kind
organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration
with Ghana's Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to identify the best practice for preventing
FGM, integrate them into national FGM prevention and management
programs and stimulate the formation of regional steering groups.
</P>
<P>
The practice of FGM is an obstacle to the attainment of good
health, development and human rights not only for its victims but
for all members of society, Twumasi said.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been estimated that more than 130 million girls
and women have undergone genital mutilation world-wide with two
million more at risk every year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Concerned at Humanitarian Crisis in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday voiced its concerns about "the deteriorating humanitarian
situation" in Angola and called on the warring Angolan factions to
provide relief access to the internally displaced persons (IDPs)
in the southwestern African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said, "Members of the
council remained extremely concerned about the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Angola."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the council expressed concern at the low level of
response by donors to the humanitarian appeal for Angola," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the U.N. Security Council met in a
closed-door session to be briefed by Hedi Annabi, U.N. assistant
secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, Sergio Vieira de
Mello, undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Catherine
Bertini, director of the World Food Program, and Carol Bellamy,
executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
"They commended the efforts of the humanitarian agencies
operating in Angola in assisting the Angolan government to meet
the needs of IDPs," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the council welcomed the announcement by the
government of Angola for an Emergency Plan for Humanitarian
Assistance," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They called on the government of Angola and in particular
UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola)
to provide access to the internally displaced persons," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 2 million Angolans are living a precarious
existence, another 3 million completely inaccessible, with scarce
food and shelter, and large numbers of children at risk of death
if hostilities continue, a U.N. spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is planning to open a liaison office in
Angola to explore ways to restore peace in the country, six months
after the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from the southwestern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has agreed to allow the new U.N.
office, which will set up links with security and civilian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian operations have continued to be conducted in
the African country since the departure of the peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations spent 10 years and millions of U.S. dollars
trying to bring peace to the African nation, where civil war broke
out soon after its 1975 independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
At present, fighting, population displacement, drought and
disease have wrought "exceptional food emergencies" in 16 African
countries with Angola hit hardest, the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization said in early August.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- T. Eaton Co. Ltd. suffered a drop
of 49 cents (about 0.33 U.S. dollars) to 36.5 cents (about 0.24
U.S. dollars) each share early Monday, CTV reported.
</P>
<P>
The once retailing icon of Canada announced Friday that it
plans to file for protection from its creditors Monday under the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
</P>
<P>
Key lenders of Canada's oldest institution of more than 130
years are negotiating to sell their debt of 170 million Canadian
dollars (about 114 million U.S. dollars) while the collapsing
retailer prepares to liquidate its 64-store chain's inventory this
week.
</P>
<P>
GE Capital Corp and two other U.S. finance companies are owed
the money by Eaton's, which has 30 days to come up with a plan to
carve up its assets and distribute the proceeds to its creditors,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 million Canadian dollars (about 33 million U.S.
dollars) were reported to be owed by such unsecured creditors as
clothing manufacturers, which are expected to receive little from
the remains of the money-losing retailer.

<HEADLINE> Rain Adds Misery to Quake-Hit Turks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ozek family, which lost two
members in the killer quake last Tuesday, was subjected to more
miseries as a sudden downpour Monday battered their makeshift
tents on a lawn.
</P>
<P>
The 12 survivors of the family have been accommodated in four
small tents on a lawn about 100 meters from their crushed home in
the Guney Mahalle Tuprid Street in the hardest-hit Izmit, 70
kilometers southeast of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The tents became more crowed as the family had to move some of
what they thought valuable possessions, including a television and
a tape-recorder, into the tents.
</P>
<P>
A few pieces of wooden furniture, some kitchen utensils, a
cauldron of onions, two buckets of drinking water and a small gas
stove distributed by government relief workers had to be left in
the rain.
</P>
<P>
The Ozeks had to shift the doors of the tents to the lower side
of the sloping lawn so as to keep water outside.
</P>
<P>
The Ozeks were seen approaching a car stopping at the nearby
street to receive medicines and most needed items.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Nazmi, one of the personnel distributing aid items
around the car, said that they were from public hospitals in Izmit
and Istanbul and volunteers in the "Can I Help You" action for
distributing medicines and offering medical aid to victims.
</P>
<P>
The action involves 40 doctors and 10 cars, Nazmi said, adding
that they had been working on sites since Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Such medical teams from local hospitals and foreign countries
are travelling in the quake-hit areas to provide medical aid to
victims in tents
</P>
<P>
A powerful quake, measured at 7.4 degrees on the Richter
scale, hit western Turkey last Tuesday, killing at least 1,2134
people and injuring 33,000 others, with thousands more still
buried under the tangled concrete.
</P>
<P>
Monday's rain has posed another disaster for the quake
victims. Though it eased the choking dust and scorching heat that
dominated in the last few days, health experts fear that it might
help the spread of diseases. The possibility of an outbreak of
epidemic has been one of the major concerns for the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Health official are grappling with ways to curb possible
spread of diseases like typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Officials were spraying disinfectant over stricken areas where
stench of corpses can be smelt in dust. They have also started
spreading purifying lime on rubble, roads and cemeteries. Water
purification tablets were being distributed in some regions.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people were left homeless and had to stay in
makeshift tents for the time being. As tents were not enough, some
rendered homeless still had to sleep in the open air. Seeking
shelters in the torrential rain, which is expected to last through
the coming days, is an even daunting task for them.

<HEADLINE> Leader Stresses Importance of Military Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Monday stressed the importance of military
modernization, but reiterated that the country will find a
peaceful solution to the dispute with Iran over the three Gulf
islands.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic position occupied by the UAE and the changes
taking place in the region and around the world have prompted the
country to modernize its armed forces and enhance their level of
preparedness," said Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin
Zayed Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa, the deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces,
made the remarks on the occasion of the graduation of a group of
students from the Command and Staff College, the Emirates News
Agency (WAM) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces have to be equipped with the latest
technology to enable them to face the challenges of the 21st
century and to protect the country and its achievements for
future generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated the UAE's position of finding a
peaceful solution to the dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands
of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, which are located near strategic shipping
lanes in the Gulf, are claimed by both countries, but controlled
by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE accuses Iran of not responding actively to its calls
for dialogs on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The dispute should be solved "either through serious bilateral
talks or by referring the issue to the International Court of
Justice and we declare in advance that we will abide by the
decision of the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that resolving the issue of the islands would
contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in the
region and pave the way for the establishing of security,
economic and political cooperation in the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Egypt Sign Deal on Industrial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Egypt signed a deal
here on Monday on boosting industrial and trade cooperation
between the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The deal was inked by Iraqi Industry Minister Adnan
Abdul-Majeed and visiting Egyptian Industry Minister Soleiman
Redha, who arrived here last Friday at the head of a 80-person
delegation representing 40 Egyptian companies, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will establish
industrial bases in both countries and Egypt will provide Iraq
with industrial equipment and goods within the framework of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between Iraq and Egypt have greatly developed
under the oil-food program though the two Arab countries have not
restored full diplomatic ties cut off following the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi Trade Ministry, Iraqi imports from
Egypt totaled 550 million U.S. dollars in the first five phases
of the oil-for-food deal, making Egypt the country's number one
trading partner in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to export
5.26 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24
million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has already signed 75 million dollars worth of
contracts with Egyptian companies under the current sixth phase
of the deal which started last May, according to the Iraqi
Trade Ministry.

<HEADLINE> EU to Discuss Test Extension on Belgian Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgian exports of beef may
have to be submitted to extended mandatory dioxin tests should
European Union veterinary experts decide to do so this week.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said Monday that a two-day meeting, slated for
Wednesday and Thursday, by the union's standing veterinary
committee would consider whether or not to omit from compulsory
tests Belgian exports of beef.
</P>
<P>
The tests are aimed to detect highly toxic dioxins.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has stated that there is no dioxin risk in beef and has
agreed to put only poultry and pork under the tests.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials said that Belgium may have to continue testing
beef until mid-September. The standing veterinary committee
originally set an end-of-August deadline for testing Belgian beef.
</P>
<P>
Dioxins entered the food chain in Belgium from contaminated
animal feed. Scientific tests are designed to detect high levels
of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chemicals which in turn
indicate dioxin contamination.
</P>
<P>
A PCB level of 200 nanograms per gram of animal fat was set by
the standing veterinary committee as the danger level.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs to Import Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Food crisis in the forthcoming
commercial year 1999/2000 will make it necessary for Angola to
import 505,000 tons of grain, Angolan Minister of Agriculture and
Rural Development said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 325,000 tons will depend on commercial import
while the rest 180,000 tons will be covered by food assistance,
said agriculture minister Gilberto Lutukuta.
</P>
<P>
According to Lutukuta, Angola's domestic grain output in 1999
will be 562,000 tons, down 5.4 percent, or 32,000 tons, from the
output in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the sharp decline in the petroleum price,
the economic situation in Angola considerably aggravated in the
commercial year 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the drop of grain production to the endless
civil war, which has caused serious economic problems in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Britons Turning to Alternative Cures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of people using
complementary and alternative medicines in Britain has doubled
over the past six years, with herbal medicine and acupuncture
becoming increasingly popular, according to a survey published by
the BBC Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,200 people found that one in five Britons was now
opting for such therapies, spending almost 15 pounds a month on
average.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 78 percent of those surveyed believe
alternative or complementary health treatments will become
increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that 21 percent have used a complementary
medicine or therapy in the last year, double the number found to
be using them in a similar survey six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed men were less likely than women to turn to
a therapist, but that two of the most popular treatments, herbal
medicine and acupuncture, were used more by men than women.
</P>
<P>
The majority of people surveyed said the main reason they used
alternative medicine was because it worked for them, but other
reasons given included that it was relaxing and that it helped
prevent illness.
</P>
<P>
One in 10 people was referred to an alternative therapist by
their doctor, but an equal number referred themselves because they
said they did not believe in conventional medicine, according to
the poll. Others said they went to a complementary practitioner
because they could not obtain the treatment they wanted on the NHS
(National Health Service).
</P>
<P>
The poll also revealed that the shift towards alternative
therapies may be saving the NHS money.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Groups Call for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Fatah movement
of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and an opposition
group ended on Monday with both sides calling for national unity
ahead of the final status negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Fatah led by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Syria-based
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) headed by
Nayef Hawatmeh also agreed to speed up preparations to declare a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with Arab
East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
"The dangers and the challenges of the final status
negotiations (with Israel) demand coherence and the putting aside
of the disagreements over the Oslo agreement," the two sides said in
a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting between Arafat and Hawatmeh was their first
since 1993 when the PLO signed the Oslo accord with the Israeli
government. The DFLP and seven other Syria-based groups reject the
accord.
</P>
<P>
The talks were aimed at ending rivalry within Palestinian
groups and unifying Palestinian ranks before the start of
negotiations with Israel on the final status of a Palestinian
entity, East Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two groups called for a national dialog among all
Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
"Our success in holding a comprehensive dialog will mark an
outstanding achievement," Hawatmeh said after his talks with
Arafat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the formation of a coalition of all Palestinian
factions to direct the negotiations with Israel. Arafat is
currently directing such talks.
</P>
<P>
The final communique said the PLO's Executive Committee would
supervise the negotiations with Israel since it is the sole
representative of the Palestinian people. The DFLP is represented
on the committee.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP secretary general said his group and Fatah have agreed
to hold more talks in the near future and that he hoped other
factions would join in.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Fatah delegation, Salim Zaanoun, head of the
Palestinian National Council, told reporters that "we are in a
period in which the Palestinian National Authority should not be
left alone to face the final status questions."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Assault on Militants in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops continued their
strikes on Islamic militants in its Daghestan republic Monday as
President Boris Yeltsin described the operation as the "number one
priority."
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said Monday that federal troops had killed
140 Islamic gunmen in bombing raids on rebel strongholds Sunday, a
figure which it said brought total rebel deaths to more than 600
since the start of fighting two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Russian warplanes carried out 36 bombing raids on rebel
positions Sunday alone.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was shown on television meeting Daghestan's regional
leader, Magomedali Magomedov. Pounding his fingers on a table,
Yeltsin said, "Daghestan is now our number one priority. Be aware
of that."
</P>
<P>
The new Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, vowed on August
10 to put down the revolt in two weeks. The deadline expires on
Tuesday and so far the situation in Daghestan, which borders the
breakaway Chechen republic, has been tense.
</P>
<P>
Russian military officials say they want to cripple the rebels
with artillery and air power before trying to storm their
positions in order to minimize their troops casualties.
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment they are blockaded, held in a
semi-circle. They cannot escape, and our intention is to destroy
them completely," Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo told RTR
state television Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, the rebels, led by Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev,
said they had quit a district of Daghestan where they had been
holding several villages in the two-week standoff with federal
troops.
</P>
<P>
But a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying
in the Daghestani regional capital Makhachkala that the reported
withdrawal of rebels was "blatant, unprincipled, unpardonable
lies aimed at confusing and misinforming the mass media."
</P>
<P>
He said federal troops still had about 100 rebel fighters
surrounded in Tando, a tiny but strategically important hamlet
that has been the scene of fierce fighting over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials say federal troops have cut off all escape
routes for the rebels in Tando.

<HEADLINE> Work-Related Illness to Rise: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The amount of work-related
illness is likely to soar over the next 10 years, according to
research conducted in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by Norwich Union Healthcare in Britain,
found that far from improving the working environment, the march
of new technology could lead to an epidemic of sickness-related
industrial claims.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three-quarters of GPs (General Practitioner) surveyed in
Britain predicted that the number of patients suffering from
work-related illness would rise over the coming decade, according
to a BBC report on the research, which was based on responses from
100 GPs and 100 personnel directors.
</P>
<P>
Personnel directors took an equally gloomy view. Nearly half
admitted that technological advances in the workplace were
creating new complaints, while 68 percent said companies needed to
re-think their approach to occupational health.
</P>
<P>
Among the complaints which are set to become commonplace are
repetitive strain injury (RSI), bad backs and eye strain.
</P>
<P>
Sue Summers, Norwich Union Healthcare spokesperson, was quoted
by BBC as saying, "Managers will face all sorts of challenges in
the new millennium, not least the possibility of increased staff
absence resulting from today's office environment."
</P>
<P>
"Our research shows that companies need to start thinking about
re-evaluating the way in which they look after the health of their
employees, in order to ensure their workplace is a safe and
healthy environment," Sue Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Get Extra 3 Billion Dollars in Oil Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran is expected to gain more
than 3 billion U.S. dollars in additional oil revenue this year
as a result of the current oil price recovery, according to the
official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Quoting a projection made by a global energy studies center,
IRNA said Iran's windfall is the second highest among members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest producer in OPEC, with a daily yield
of about 3.6 million barrels. The number one producer, Saudi
Arabia, is likely to gain an extra oil revenue of 8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The center warned that oil price rises also bring undesirables
too, namely higher global inflation, more non-OPEC output and
lower demand growth.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices skyrocketed from about 12 dollars a barrel at the
beginning of this year to over 19 dollars a barrel at present,
because of output cuts by 11 members of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The center warned against further oil price hiking, which
it said would harm producers and consumers alike.
</P>
<P>
It urged OPEC to stem the price rises by taking the
opportunity at next month's ministerial meeting to clarify plans
to boost production according to market condition.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Increase Aid to Quake-Hit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Monday decided to
provide more medical equipment for Turkey and help re-construct
its communications network severely damaged in a devastating
earthquake last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it has decided to
dispatch two cargo planes to transport medicine and medical
equipment to Turkey in response to a request from the Turkish Red
Crescent.
</P>
<P>
Other measures included providing assistance in restoring
Turkey's battered communications network and organizing special
seminars both in Israel and Turkey to give advice on public
health and community development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Besides emergency supplies, Israel has sent more than 380
rescue workers and doctors to Turkey, a close ally of Israel in
the region, to help in the search and care for the survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli rescue team, still staying in Turkey after most
foreign rescue teams have left, Monday pulled a three-year-old boy
alive from the ruins of collapsed buildings in the city of
Cinarcik, 50 kilometers south of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-medical team, which has set up the largest field
hospital equipped with an intensive-care unit and a 100-bed ward,
will stay in Turkey for about a month, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
A committee headed by director-generals of the Prime
Minister's Office and the Defense Ministry visited Turkey Monday
to discuss what additional assistance Turkey would need, the
radio said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Protection of Angolan Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Monday told the U.N. Security Council that three decades
of war have left Angolan children without the most basic
guarantees of human security and without the essential services
all children need to survive, grow and develop.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Security Council, Carol Bellamy, the
UNICEF's executive director, outlined achievements her agency and
others have accomplished for children in the embattled country,
but she said that without an immediate cession in hostilities and
a massive humanitarian response, even these modest gains will be
lost and large numbers of Angola's children will perish.
</P>
<P>
Even before the resurgence of the country's civil war, Angola's
children were in serious peril, Bellamy told the 15-nation
council, with under-five mortality at 292 per 1,000 live births
and with 42 percent of Angola's children moderately or severely
underweight for their age. Only 50 percent of school-age children
are enrolled in classes, with a high dropout rate after the first
grade, especially for girls.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief stated that when these assessments were made
in 1997 -- during a rare period of relative peace -- social
spending was declining and public health and education systems had
broken down, causing increased dependence on external assistance.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the war in December 1998 led to further
deterioration. More than 1.6 million people have been displaced
from their homes and thousands of children have been recruited as
fighters in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Today, the UNICEF's Child Risk Measure ranks Angola as the
country whose children are at the greatest risk of death,
malnutrition, abuse and development failure.
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis points to the conflict in Angola as the single
greatest determinant of this sad reality," Bellamy told the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Despite limited funding and growing insecurity, the UNICEF and
other U.N. agencies, the International Committee for the Red
Cross, bilateral donors and non-governmental organizations
continue to help the government weave a basic safety net for
children.
</P>
<P>
This includes deliveries of food, seeds and tools, care and
counseling of victims of trauma and abuse, basic health care
services, safe water and sanitation, supply of items for shelter,
support for education, intensive campaigns to alert the population
to the perils of living in one of the most heavily mined countries
of the world, and complex negotiations with the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to gain access
to all children in need.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed Miners Back at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The 9,000 miners dismissed
Friday were reinstated and back at work Monday, said
Secretary-General of the National Union of Mine workers (NUM)
Gwede Mantashe.
</P>
<P>
The workers were dismissed from Durban Roodeport Deep's
Hartebeesfontein mine when they challenged the conditions of sale
of the mine from Avgold to Durban Roodepoort Deep (DRD).
</P>
<P>
Mantashe told the press that they would not only retain the
conditions of employment they had with Avgold, but would receive a
nine-percent across- the-board salary increase, backdated to July
1.
</P>
<P>
NUM had finally agreed on increasing annual wages for the three
other DRD mines, -- Buffelsfontein, Blyvooruitzicht and Durban
Roodepoort Deep itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to engage in relationship and team building
to improve mutual trust and communication, and to discuss
strategic issues regularly.
</P>
<P>
DRD chief executive Mike Prinsloo said the agreement
represented a fresh spirit of constructive co-operation and
augured well for the future of Harties and all its people.

HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The six-day annual Zimbabwe
Agricultural Show opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 400 exhibitors attended the show, which will as usual
mirror the region's agricultural, commercial and industrial
outlook.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Agricultural Society (ZAS) Denis
Norman said this year's show is being held during a period of
economic uncertainty, with inflation and interest rates driving up
production costs at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
However, farmers had shown determination to improve their
performance and overcome financial constraints, Norman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ZAS, agriculture will continue to dominate the
 Zimbabwean economy well into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture directly and indirectly provides more than 50
percent of total employment in the country, while contributing
over 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
It generates some 40 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings and provides most of the raw materials to the
manufacturing sector.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Works Out Anti-Malaria Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Ministry
has prepared anti-malaria guidelines in a bid to prevent and
control the epidemic in the country, a senior official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alemayehu Seifu, chief of Epidemiology and AIDS Control
Department of the ministry, said at a press conference here that
the guidelines are designed to help health workers across the
country to carry out malaria diagnosis and treatment in a
standardized manner.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is one of the major killer diseases in Ethiopia. Each
year, close to three to five million people in the country are
affected by malaria, which is among the leading causes of
hospitalization and hospital death in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is officially estimated that about two thirds of the
country's population are at risk of malaria infection.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has been for years making efforts to
curb the spread of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The National Malaria Social Mobilization Week is due to be
observed from 24-30 August this year.
</P>
<P>
The annual nationwide campaign is held with a view to further
bolster the participation of governmental and non-governmental
organizations as well as the public at large in the fight against
the disease.
</P>
<P>
August is a month suitable for malaria breeding in most parts
of Ethiopia, according to medical experts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that anti-malaria chemicals have been sprayed
in many parts of the country to preempt possible outbreak of the
epidemic following the rainy season.

<HEADLINE> WFP Chief Sounds Alarm on Angolan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) Monday said that the civil war in Angola has created
levels of misery and despair among the people that are virtually
unmatched anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Catherine Bertini, the WFP's executive
director, was briefing the Security Council on the humanitarian
situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Bertini said that Angolans have become so desperate to
survive they are even risking death to collect landmine marker
sticks that are then used as cooking fuel.
</P>
<P>
Bertini signaled that the lack of food in Angola is one of the
most serious problems facing the people. She said that farmers
abandoned their fields after the latest outbreak of fighting in
December 1998, so food supplies in the commercial markets are
shrinking even as prices spiral beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition levels are becoming extremely alarming, she said,
citing the town of Malange in southern Angola where several people
are dying every day from lack of food. Hundreds of internally
displaced people (IDPs) have fled to Malange because of fighting
in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The WFP currently has an emergency operation of 38 million U.S.
dollars in Angola to give food to 800,000 vulnerable people and
IDPs. The operation, which began after a ceasefire collapsed late
last year and fighting resumed, originally targeted 500,000 people
and will expand to 1.2 million next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the food aid agency has received 40 percent of the
funding it needs for the new emergency, and Bertini strongly
urged donors to give to Angolan relief.
</P>
<P>
Bertini also underlined the security issues that hamper the
work of humanitarian agencies working in Angola. Since 1993, the
WFP has lost six staff members in Angola to armed attacks. In the
last eight months, two U.N.-chartered aircraft have been shot
down, with a loss of 23 lives including one WFP employee.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is the only answer to save the lives of millions of
Angolans," she said. Up until the renewal of the civil war, the
WFP had been conducting rehabilitation activities in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The country's progress in rebuilding has been severely
undermined by the renewed fighting, she said, calling for
serious efforts by governments worldwide to bring peace to the
southwestern African nation.

CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government has launched a campaign against
poverty since 1995 as part of its economic reforms, but the result
are not satisfactory, according to a report issued by Yemeni
scholars.
</P>
<P>
The report said the government has set up funds for social
welfare and development and raised salary for state employees, but
the measures are facing numerous difficulties in practice, the
Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the report revealed that the number of poor
people has increased from 3ive program for the eradication of
poverty. The report said the high poverty rate is due to low
economic growth, low income, high cost of living and the
abandoning of state subsidies for basic food.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria and Jordan plan to establish a common market
together with Lebanon, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was raised in talks Sunday between Syrian Minister of
Economy and Trade Mohammad al-Imadi and a top-level Jordanian
trade delegation, the Al Hayat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Syrian exports to Jordan have declined from 140 million dollars
in 1996 to 40 million last year while Jordanian exports to Syria
fell from 57 million dollars to 21 million over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed that improvement of trade would only be
achieved through direct import and export deals among businessmen
and exporters of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Basic Syrian imports from Jordan include flour, lime, chemical
and organic by-products, medicine and paper. Major Syrian exports
to Jordan include petroleum, cotton, petroleum by-products,
natural gas, textiles, clothes, mineral water and soft drinks, and
onions.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Wali has said

consultative group of international research centers of the World
Bank, said Wali, who is also minister of Agriculture and Land
Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Wali made the remarks at the opening session of the sixth
international conference on the development of barren lands and
the challenges in next century, the Arabic daily Al Ahram reported

3 million credit cards in the Gulf region since June, 1996,
according to the company's statistics for the quarter which ended
June, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Usage of Visa cards in the Gulf rose by over 600 percent in
the past three years, said the statistics quoted by Gulf News on

</P>
<P>
Oman has toped Visa International's list as the fastest
growing market in the world, with 90,000 Omanis now owning
Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The gas fields in Egypt's Western Desert are producing
23.24 million cubic meters of natural gas, or 32 percent of the
country's total production, per day, Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi said on a visit to the Obayad field that 89 gas fields
were discovered in the last six years, increasing Egypt's proven
gas reserves to 1.14 trillion cubic meters, the country's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Seven discoveries were made during the last six months with a
daily output of 6.3 million cubic meters, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success in the oil and gas sector to the
incentives offered to foreign investments.

<HEADLINE> WTO Applicants Be Allowed to Negotiate First: Supachai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Countries applying for WTO
membership should be allowed to participate its trade negotiations
before their formal accession so that they can prepare themselves
more fully and actively once they are accepted, WTO
Director-General-elect Supachai Panitchpakdi said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It need not be stressed that the increase in the number of
active participants can greatly extend the scope of global
liberalization and thus strengthen multilateral trade system,"
Supachai, Thai deputy prime minister and commerce minister, said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the start of the three-day Meeting of
Senior Officials on the Future of World Trade Organization (WTO)
Trade Agenda and Developing Countries held here from Monday to
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said developing economies should collectively search for
ways to strengthen their participation in multilateral trade
negotiations and integrate themselves into the global trading
system, which would lead to a significant expansion in
international trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater attempts on the part of developed
countries to lower barriers to agricultural trade through an
across-the-board tariff reduction, including the lowering of
out-quota tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss the impact of the Asian economic
crisis on trade and liberalization process, the ways to enhance
the participation of least-developed countries, scope of future
trade agenda and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Falling Pay Eases Rate Fears In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Pay awards across industry in
Britain are still falling, with salary rises posing little threat
of pushing up inflation.
</P>
<P>
The average pay settlement in manufacturing during the three
months to the end of June was 2.7 percent, down from 2.8 percent
in the previous quarter and from 3.5 percent in the same period
last year, according to a survey by the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The news of falling pay comes despite an acceleration in
economic growth, a 19-year low in unemployment and official
figures which say pay is rising.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's Pay Data Bank survey also showed more companies are
setting pay rises at or below the government's 2.5 percent
inflation target.
</P>
<P>
It's chief economic adviser Kate Barker said the figures showed
there was no need for the Bank of England to raise interest rates
in the near future to fend off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Last moth, members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee, which sets interest rates, were sharply divided on the
question of whether inflation would start to rise.

PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- France Telecom, France's state
monopoly of telecommunications, will launch in 2000 a new
technology for putting together portable phones and internet.
</P>

The executive officer of France Telecom, Michel Bon, said that
the technology, called General Package Radio Service (GPRS), will

GPRS has been undergoing experiments with two phone producers,

<HEADLINE> Deal on Seaport, Safe Passage Reached Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators Monday reached a deal on the construction of a seaport
in Gaza and the opening of a safe passage between Gaza and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two issues are aspects of the Palestinian-Israeli Wye
Accord signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel Radio
that the two sides will accelerate talks to iron out difference on
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank, the major part of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, the seaport will begin construction on
October 1, when the southern route of the safe passage, between
Gaza and Hebron, is also due to open. The northern route of the
passage,which links Gaza and Ramallah, will open in January,
Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
In the deal, the Palestinians have reiterated their security
commitments, including the continued collection of illegal
weapons, and the scale-down of Palestinian police, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the seaport and the safe passage, long delayed
by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu, will undoubtedly help restore the
confidence-building between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, however, admitted that the two sides are still locked
in a dispute over the timetable of Israeli troop redeployments
in the West Bank and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye Accord, Israel has to hand over another 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages that
should have finished by the end of January. But Netanyahu froze
the agreement in early December after carrying out the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Ousting Netanyahu on a platform to revive the peace process in
the Israeli elections in May, Barak has promised to carry out the
remaining two stages, but he has proposed some changes to the
timetable.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reluctantly accepted his proposal to
carry out the second troop withdrawal in October.
</P>
<P>
But they have rejected Barak's suggestion that the final stage
of redeployment be postponed until early 2000, when the final
status talks dealing with thorny issues like Jerusalem and
settlements are supposed to have been well under way.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said Sunday that the
Palestinians were insisting the implementation of the Wye
agreement be completed by November 30.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestinian prisoners, the two sides had
reached an agreement on the timeline, under which the first batch
of prisoners will be released on September 1 and the second on
October 8. But dispute remains over the number and terms of the
prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians demand that Israel release another 650 Palestinian
political prisoners jailed for anti-Israel activities .
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel reached a verbal agreement within
the framework of the Wye Accord, under which Israel should release
750 Palestinian political prisoners jailed in Israel. But the
Palestinians accused Netanyahu of cheating by including 150 common
criminals in the first group of 250 freed prisoners last year.
</P>
<P>
The government of Barak, however, insists that the Wye accord
did not specify what kind of prisoners should be released and it
would continue to include common criminals in the remaining 500
prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
In the several rounds of talks over the last few weeks, Erekat
and Israeli chief negotiator Barak's envoy Gilad Sher have failed
to resolve their differences on the redeployment and prisoner
issues. Israeli officials said that Barak might hold a summit with
Arafat to iron out the dispute.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat told Israel Radio that he did not expect such a
summit would take place before the disputes were resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides will continue talks to solve the
problems, adding the Palestinian side would "exert every effort
possible" to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He denied charges by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Monday
that his planned trip with Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas to
Washington this week was intended to aim at enlisting U.S. pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said they were invited by Washington to arrange details
on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's coming visit to the
region, including the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Denying that he is seeking help from Washington when the
Israeli-Palestinian talks enter a critical stage, Erekat said he
has postponed his trip, originally planned about 10 days ago,
because of the talks. He will meet Albright Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Albright will start her trip on September 1 with an aim of
ensuring the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are on the track and
trying to restart the stalled talks between Israel and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Robust Asia-Pacific Internet Growth Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Asia-Pacific
Internet users is expected to surpass 374 million by year-end
2005, up from just over 39 million by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a forecast report released Monday by U.S.
information technology research firm Yankee Group, the number of
paying subscribers, which hovered just under 19 million in the
region at year-end 1998, will grow to over 175 million by the end
of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Yankee Group notes the difference between a paying Internet
access subscriber and the number of users (the addressable
business-to-consumer audience), as there are often multiple users
for one subscription account.
</P>
<P>
The forecast shows China becoming the leading Asia-Pacific
nation in terms of Internet users in 2001, with about 40 million
people online. By 2005, the report said, China should surpass the
United States to have the most users in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The implication of this Asia-Pacific subscriber and user
growth will be enormous on global e-commerce opportunities, from
business-to-business sourcing, to business-to-consumer marketing,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Factors that have constrained the historical growth of the
Internet in Asia include the regulatory, commercial and access
issues that have begun to change and will drive Internet growth
and penetration going forward, according to the research firm.

MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The combined debts of other
member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for
fuel and energy supplied by Russia reached 59.6 billion rubles
(about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the first six months of the
year, the Russian Energy Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the debts, 40.4 billion rubles (1.63 billion

CIS clients made no more than 3.2 percent of their payments for
gas in cash.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Ukraine is the biggest debtor, owing
287.8 billion rubles (11.6 billion dollars). Moldova is the second

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqis Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were killed
and a third one injured on Monday in U.S. and British warplanes'
attacks on civilian targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:35 (0635 GMT), nine formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in Bashiqa
town in Neineva province, some 450 kilometers north of Baghdad,
killing two civilians and injuring another one, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the
enemy planes and repulsed them to their Turkish base.
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes coming from Saudi bases also violated
southern Iraqi airspace in the day, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S.-British bombardment of Iraqi targets came five
days after the Pentagon announced the U.S.-British air
raids against Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones will be suspended
if Iraqi air defenses stop targetting allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after U.S. and British warplanes
bombed some residential areas and targets outside of the no-fly
zones last week and killed 20 Iraqi civilians and injured 10
others.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraqi
targets, Iraq began to fire at U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones.

SEOUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Korea Composite Stock Price

The 39.19 point jump from the previous trading day was

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Further Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The average crude oil price
continued rising this week to 19.92 U.S. dollars per barrel, 33
cents more than that of last week, according to figures released
by the Vienna-based Secretariat of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price had fallen to only 9.5 dollars per barrel in February,
but eventually rose to 18.28 dollars per barrel in July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the price hike to OPEC members sticking to
the agreement reached in March of reducing oil production to
protect the price.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of crude oil mining in the North Sea and the
decrease of Russia's oil exports resulting from its own increasing
demand are also factors lowering oil storage and pushing the price
up, they said.

Taliban's top official responsible for foreign affairs Mulla

According to Pakistan official statistics, the market of

provided to Afghanistan under the ATTA.
</P>
<P>
The ATTA was signed in 1960s to facilitate the foreign trade of
Afghanistan who has no port. Under the agreement, Afghanistan only
pays a meager amount of service charges for the transit trade

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday met in a closed-door session to be briefed by senior U.N.
officials on the current situation in Angola, which has been
plunged into a civil war for decades.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council will be briefed by Hedi Annabi,
U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, undersecretary-general for humanitarian
affairs, Catherine Bertini, director of the World Food Program,
and Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The briefing came at a time when the United Nations is planning
to open a liaison office in Angola to explore ways to restore
peace in the country, six months after the withdrawal of U.N.
peacekeepers from the southwestern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has agreed to allow the new U.N. office,
which will set up links with security and civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian operations have continued to be conducted in
the African country since the departure of the peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations spent 10 years and millions of U.S. dollars
trying to bring peace to the African nation, where civil war broke
out soon after its 1975 independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
At present, fighting, population displacement, drought and
disease have wrought "exceptional food emergencies" in 16 African
countries with Angola hit hardest, the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization said in early August.

<HEADLINE> First British Beef Heads For Europe Since 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The first British beef to be
exported since the lifting of the worldwide ban on the product in
March 1996 is on its way to Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, UK Agriculture Minister Nick Brown told the BBC Monday
that it will take a long time for British beef to reclaim its
share of the market.
</P>
<P>
A symbolic 45 kilograms of fillet steak left St Merryns in
Cornwall on the same day, on route to the continent via Dover. The
tiny amount shows how hard it will be for British farmers to
regain lost markets.
</P>
<P>
The consignment of beef has been ordered by a Brussels hotel
for a British Meat and Livestock Commmission's celebration lunch.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that it is a start on beef exports from the United
Kingdom. "We have been out of exports since 1996. The shutters
came down at probably the worst possible time because exports were
at a record high," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Brown admitted that it will be a very long haul to get beef
export to anything like they were in normal trading conditions.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Promotes Concept of "Life Cycle " Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The UN Environment Program
(UNEP) is promoting the concept of a "life cycle" economy, said
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Life cycle thinking implies that everyone in the whole chain
of a product's life-cycle from the cradle to the grave has a
responsibility and a role to play, taking into account all the
relevant external effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The director commended the recent action of the European Union
to ban batteries containing cadmium by 2008 and to make producers
of electric and electronic equipment responsible for collecting
and recycling waste products.
</P>
<P>
"We must aim toward a society in which producers and consumers
assume responsibility for their own actions and decisions," he
said. "We have to move away from a 'throw-away' society."
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said that UNEP's goal is to reach out to those
unfamiliar with life cycle assessment and to get them involved.
They include small- and medium-sized companies, governments and
businesses, especially those in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the promotion of "life cycle" economy, the
relationship between trade and environment is an important issue.
</P>
<P>
In ensuring that free trade aims at promoting sustainable
development worldwide, internalization of environmental costs,
promotion of environmentally sound technologies and cleaner
production methods are important tools, he added.
</P>
<P>
With comprehensive considerations of the impacts of all life
cycle stages, "it is vitally important that life cycle thinking
be fostered in all parts of the society and within
organizations," said Toepfer.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on licensing the
imports and exports of ozone-depleting substances is expected to
enter into force, the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
By August 12, twenty countries and regions had approved the
Montreal Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer, which met the precondition of at least 20
ratifications for the pact to be effective in November 10 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Amendment stipulates that 90 days after the realization of
20 ratifications it will enter into force automatically.
</P>
<P>
The document provides for signatories to establish and
implement a system for licensing trade in ozone-depleting
substances (ODS) by January 1, 2000 and report to the secretariat
on the establishment of such a system.
</P>
<P>
"The entry into force of this Amendment is a timely measure
which should assist the international community to monitor trade
in ozone depleting substances and curb potential illegal trade,"
said UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The primary aim of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer and its Amendments is to phase out both
production and consumption of ODS in order to protect human health
and the environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Interim
Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) Monday announced that
UNMIK police had started taking over primary responsibility for
law and order in Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference here that the police assumed investigative authority
and jurisdiction for enforcing criminal codes, conducting
investigations, making arrests for criminal offense and
interfacing with the community.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIK police will continue to be supported by international
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, which were sent into the Serbian
province under a U.N. resolution. The two units will continue their
joint work in all communities in an effort to reduce violence and
crime.
</P>
<P>
The security situation is reportedly worsening as a lot of
non-Albanians were persecuted in Kosovo by the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, whose fighters returned to the Serbian province
after Yugoslavia honored an agreement with NATO by prompt
withdrawal of its troops and security forces out of Kosovo in
June.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Able to Stabilize Currency: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua)-- Tanzania's central bank
said Monday that the country has enough foreign reserves to
stabilize its currency shilling.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania said in a statement that its gross foreign
 exchange reserves are at a record high of 587 million U.S.
dollars, equivalent to more than four months merchandised imports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commercial banks hold another 372 million
dollars, the central Bank Governor Daudi Ballali said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the Tanzania shilling and the U.S.
dollar was pegged at 800:1 at the end of July, broadly in line
with economic fundamentals, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania currency depreciated some 10 percent from June to July
this year, which caused alarm among traders.
</P>
<P>
The central bank explained that a drop in exports by 30 percent
in the past two years was the main factor behind the depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The continued growth in imports, in the face of failing
exports, was an added factor in the depreciation of Tanzania
shilling, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: U.S. Blocking START II Ratification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is not
interested in Russia's ratifying the START II treaty although
Washington publicly keeps appealing for its approval by Russian
parliament, a ranking lawmaker said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Roman Popkovich, chairman of defense committee of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, said the United States is
actually trying to disrupt ratification, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. does not want Russia to ratify the START II,
under which Moscow and Washington are to cut their nuclear
warheads each to 3,000 to 3,500, for both political and military
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to portray us as a country unwilling to divest
itself of nuclear arms, a kind of nuclear monster that does not
want to disarm," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The military aspect of the problem boils down to the fact that
Russia needs START II more than the U.S. does," he said.
</P>
<P>
The shelf life of Russia's strategic missiles is much shorter
than that of the U.S.'s because Russia has refurbished and updated
them.
</P>
<P>
"The expiration date for our missiles will have been reached by
2007-2008, while it will be 2020-2025 in the case of America's,"
Popkovich said.
</P>
<P>
"They understand very well that if we do not ratify the treaty
and do not achieve a simultaneous reduction of the maximum number
of warheads, their nuclear strength will be four to six times
greater than ours by 2008-2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of "putting obstacles in the way of our
ratifying the START II treaty by violating the Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty of 1972."
</P>
<P>
As to the chances of START II being ratified by the Duma,
Popkovich said Washington's intention to amend the treaty casts
doubts on ratification since the danger of "disrupted balance" may
arise.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should understand Washington's proposals "to the
extent that we must have an ABM location scheme to be able to
control the process of creating and deploying anti-missile
facilities," he said.

"The argument that the (U.S.) continental ABM system would be
created to counter possible acts of terrorism from third-world
countries that possess nuclear weapons does not stand up to
criticism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if the U.S. decides to set up a continental ABM
system, Russia should work on the creation of new striking means
-- missiles with multiple warheads, that is, a new kind of weapon
that will be a weapon of nuclear deterrence."
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate changes need to be made to Russia's military
doctrine, including considering the possibility of war, the use of
armed forces, and most importantly, reconsidering who are our
friends and adversaries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Review of Contract Holds in Iraq Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday asked for an all-out review of the contracts
holds in the oil-for-food program as they pose "serious
implications" for the humanitarian program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council on the implementation of
the new 180 day phase of the oil-for-food program beginning May
25, Annan expressed concern about the number of contracts
currently on hold, worth some 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq and the U.N. sanctions committee to give priority
to contracts which have a direct impact on the well-being of
children, particularly on nutrition, water and sanitation
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that at current prices and volumes Iraq will
have the capacity to export 6.3 billion dollars worth of oil in
the phase or Phase VI ending November 21, surpassing the 5.2
billion dollars authorized by the Security Council last year.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a shortfall of 3.1 billion dollars in the
total revenues authorized for the humanitarian program under
phases IV and V due to the substantial fall in oil prices, the
report noted.

OTTAWA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- General Motors of Canada Ltd.
Monday announced investment of 20 million Canadian dollars (about
13 million U.S. dollars) in a new research and development site in
Oshawa, Ontario, according to a CTV report.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
expressed welcome to the GM's announcement, which came months

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Award Freedom Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's ruling party is
pushing a controversial bill to subsidize war veterans through
parliament, it is reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The War Veterans Subvention Bill, debated in the upper house of
 parliament, the National Council, won overwhelming support of
parliamentarians of the ruling South West African People's
Organization (Swapo) on Monday, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
The bill is aimed at creating a war veteran subvention trust
fund which will benefit former Swapo freedom fighters who are
currently aged 55 and above or the beneficiaries -- orphans and
relatives of those who laid down their lives in the liberation
struggle.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Swapo's whip in parliament, Henock ya
Kasita, who sponsored the bill, described it as "a step in the
right direction".
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the liberation forces to be remembered for a
job well done."
</P>
<P>
He said: "They (members of the liberation forces) laid down
their precious lives for freedom and independence of this country.
Today, Namibia occupies its rightful place among countries of the
world, a reality that cannot be doubted."
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the amount of money to be given to the
beneficiaries be disbursed by a parliamentary joint committee
comprised of both houses, and that such payments ought to be done
monthly.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Hold Meeting on Liberian Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven foreign ministers of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would hold a
one-day meeting in Lome, Togo's capital, Thursday to discuss the
insurgency in northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
A statement published Monday by the secretariat of the
16-member organization said ministers from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo would attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the secretariat of the Nigeria-based organization
said the meeting was "exploratory" and could be followed by a
mini-summit of the seven countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have been having problems convincing the Guinean president
to attend the mini-summit " proposed earlier by sub-regional
leaders, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia accused neighboring Guinea of harboring dissidents in
its Lofa County, who are reported to be remnants of Ulimo-k, one
of the factions in the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
But Guinea denied the allegation and invited international
observers to their common border to verify the claim.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel to Study Environmental Impact of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
organizing scientists from eight countries to study the impact of
NATO bombing on Danube river, the second longest river in Europe,
a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference here that the Balkans Task Force, jointly organized by
the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) and the U.N. Center for Human
Settlement (Habitat) will visit the Yugoslav section of Danube
river to assess the environmental impact of the recent conflict.
</P>
<P>
The scientists are nine industrial experts from the Czech
Republic, Hungry, France, Germany, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and
Sweden, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
They will visit potential pollution "hot-spot" up and
down-stream of the Novi-Sad oil refinery, Pancevo industrial
complex and a tributary near the Zastava car factory in
Kraguejevac, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The team will also visit the Iron Gates dam on the border
between Yugoslavia and Romania where the Djerdap reservoir holds
extensive layers of sediment that can absorb organic matter, and
toxic and hazardous waste possibly carried down the river Danube.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to assess the environmental health of the Danube
before and after the conflict, the scientists will collect
sediment and water samples.
</P>
<P>
They will also measure the accumulation of pollutants like
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in living mussels, in order to
get a picture of the possible toxic releases to the Danube in the
hours immediately after the damage to industrial facilities in
Yugoslavia, caused by the 79-day air strikes by the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
After the mission, which will end Saturday, the samples will be
sent to independent laboratory for detailed analysis.
</P>
<P>
This is the third team since July to be sent into Yugoslavia to
assess the environmental damage caused by NATO air strikes on
selected industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
On July 18-27, a team of international experts visited
Yugoslavia to assess the environmental damage caused by the
conflict at selected industrial complexes. A second team, based in
the provincial capital of Pristina, is currently working in close
cooperation with the U.N. Mission in Kosovo, known as UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
A fourth team will begin work next month on an assessment of
impacts on the region's biological diversity.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Science and Technology Development in China, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- What strikes him the most is
the great change in the 50 years of new China, Nobel Physics Prize
laureate Chen Ning Yang told Xinhua correspondents in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang, former Director of the Theoretical Physics
Department at State University of New York at Stony Brook, spoke
highly of China's progress in the field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
China's history of science and technology was a blank paper in
the 1920s, he said. Soon after the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, science and technology has begun to
develop in a remarkably fast way, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed to the successful test of nuclear and hydrogen
bombs and the development of rocket and satellite technologies in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Such accomplishments require the efforts of tens of thousands
of scientists and skilled workers," he said, adding that it is
unprecedented to see so many qualified personnel to be trained in
a short period of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Such an achievement is unseen even in the history of world
science and technology," said Yang, who shared the Nobel Prize in
1957 with Tsung-Dao Lee, another Chinese American for their
penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has
led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
In the years of reform and openness in China, new developments
have taken place, particularly in the substantial increase of the
number of people receiving higher-learning education which laid
foundation for further scientific and technological progress,
Professor Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He paid great attention to the growing funds that the Chinese
Government has been allocating for the science and technology
education and research in an effort to meet the needs of the
country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old well-known scientist spoke favorably of the
Chinese Communist Party for its "great contributions" to China's
reunification, construction and its international status.
</P>
<P>
Yang was born in 1922 when warlords tangled in fighting all
over the country and left China to the United States for further
study in 1945 during the Japanese occupation of China. He recalled
what he saw in the early years of his life.
</P>
<P>
There was no electric light in his native city of Hefei, the
capital of Anhui Province and the streets there were so narrow
that they could not allow buses to go in.
</P>
<P>
The situation in many other parts of China was even worse as
there were cases of warlords killing and prevailing poverty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When he first came back to China in 1971, Yang was deeply
impressed by what happened in the 26 years of his stay overseas.
China's mainland, once suffering from the rule of separatist
warlord regimes, became unified.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest developing country, China has won international
recognition of its due status, Yang remarked, joining many
international figures in believing that China will score more
achievements in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang retired from his 33-year Department post in May,
but still cares about international and Chinese scientific trends.
He is now helping Qinhua University of China to build a high level
academic center.
</P>
<P>
He is happy to be invited to participate in the celebrations in
Beijing of the 50th anniversary of the PRC, describing the
founding of the PRC as "a big event in the history of China and
one of the few important events in the 20th century".

<HEADLINE> British, Irish Governments Deny Split over IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish Governments
have insisted they are at one on the peace process in Northern
Ireland, despite disagreeing in public over the IRA (Irish
Republican Army) ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews told reporters on Monday
that "in the round," he and Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
of State, Mo Mowlam, had agreed the ceasefire was intact.
</P>
<P>
But Mowlam immediately interrupted him to take issue with that,
saying: "We did reach that conclusion but I am awaiting additional
information from America and the Irish before I make a final
decision."
</P>
<P>
The two ministers were speaking at a news conference on Monday
in Belfast, shortly after a meeting between the two sides at
Stormont, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Andrews described the recent murder of north Belfast man
Charles Bennett as a brutal outrage, but said he felt the
ceasefire was holding.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam is expected to give her assessment sometime this week on
the state of the IRA ceasefire, after consulting her police and
army security advisors. She has denied that there is any
disagreement between the UK and Irish Governments on the subject,
but she said she was not yet in a position to judge the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I am reviewing the state of the IRA ceasefire and others in
the light of recent events which I continue to view very seriously
indeed," she was quoted as saying. "As I have always said, I will
not rush to judgement, but when I have the relevant information I
will make my decision known."
</P>
<P>
But Andrews was quoted as telling: "I think it's fair to say
the ceasefire has been intact for a number of years now and the
IRA, in the round, have not been using their weapons. That is my
view and it is the view of the (Irish) government."
</P>
<P>
The IRA ceasefire has been under scrutiny since the recent
killing of Bennett, and speculation that republican paramilitaries
were involved in a gun-running plot to post arms from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam is under pressure from unionists to halt paramilitary
prisoner releases, if she judges that the IRA has broken its
ceasefire. Her decision could have a major impact on next month's
review of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which
will be chaired by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who
chaired last year's peace talks in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The review, which starts on 6 September, is an attempt to break
the political logjam over the formation of Northern Ireland's
executive and weapons decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster Monday, Sinn Fein's chief
negotiator, Martin McGuinness, warned the Northern Ireland
secretary against halting the early prison releases if the IRA is
found to have broken its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has said his
party was right to boycott attempts to form a devolved government.
He echoed others in his party who have called on the Northern
Ireland secretary to impose sanctions on Sinn Fein if the IRA is
proved to have been behind the incidents.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Angolans Needing Aid, Senior U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- "In Angola, two million
people are living a precarious existence and are in need of or
dependent on aid," a senior U.N. official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N. undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs and emergency relief co-ordinator, told
reporters that "We estimate that another three million people are
entirely inaccessible and their condition is therefore impossible
to assess."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after he briefed the U.N. Security
Council on the humanitarian situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, 70 percent of the country's population are living
in besieged provincial capitals, or in government-held areas on
the coast," he said. "Intermittent shelling of the provincial
capitals has caused the deaths of many hundreds of civilians and
regularly prevents the delivery of humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
"In the overcrowded provincial capitals, there is a high risk
of outbreak of epidemic diseases due to the lack of sanitation
and safe drinking water and the generally weakened state of the
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
In May a polio epidemic in the vicinity of Benguela and Luanda,
the Angolan capital, resulted in 113 deaths. A meningitis outbreak
was confirmed recently in Kuando Kubango.
</P>
<P>
"Of the two million people known to be in need in Angola,"
600,000 receive humanitarian assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are two main reasons why humanitarian agencies are
unable to do more," he said. "One reason is insecurity and lack of
access and the second reason is funding."
</P>
<P>
Angola has been locked in a civil war shortly after its 1975
independence from Portugal. The Angolan Government and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
resumed fighting in December last year, making the humanitarian
situation in the southwestern African country further worse.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Coalition Agrees Austerity Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 23 (Xinhua)--At their first session in Berlin, the
two parties governing Germany on Monday reached a consensus over
the bill to cut the country's budget drastically in following
years.
</P>
<P>
After the two-hour meeting in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
interim residence, top officials from the Social Democratic Party
(SPD) under Schroeder and the Greens party leaded by Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said they would support the austerity
package in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
" We hope for the support of the parliament, " SPD's
parliamentary fraction chief Peter Struck said after the session.
He said the bill would be passed at this Wednesday's cabinet
session and be sent to the parliament in September for debate and
voting.
</P>
<P>
Struck's counterpart of the Greens party, Kerstin Mueller,
agreed and appealed the labour unions not to ask for too much from
the state.
</P>
<P>
The unions should " take responsibility for all," and it is
false for them to say the bill "socially unjust," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Called "Sparpaket" in German, the package, raised by Finance
Minister Hans Eichel with Schroeder's backing, was aimed to cut
Germany's state budget by 30.4 billion marks in year 2000, 38.6
billion in 2001, 42.2 billion in 2002, and 49.5 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Under the 200-page bill, pension, jobless relief and other
social welfare paying will be strictly limited to grow at the
projected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
And German tax-payers' burden will be relieved by 46 billion
marks under the three-stage tax reform plan indicated in the bill.
</P>
<P>
While praised by business leaders, the austerity package has
been under continuous fire from Germany's influential unions. They
said Schroeder and his SPD, by raising the pro-business bill in
May, had hurt the interests of the weaks and had betrayed their
boasted line of "social justice".

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Satisfied With Decolonization of New Caledonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The delegation, led by the Fiji Vice Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Tupeni Baba, consisted of Papua New Guinea ambassador to
the U.N. Donigi, Chilean ambassador Juan Eguiguren and Vanuatu
ambassador Salwyn Arutangay.
</P>
<P>
They visited local institutions set up since 1998 to replace
French colonial ones, said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting with local French officials, the U.N. delegates
also met with the leader of the pro-independence Front of
Socialist Kanak National Liberation (FLNKS), Rock Wamytan, and the
pro-French Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (PRCR), Jacques
Lafleur.
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS and PRCR differ over the make-up of the transitional
government, whose chairman is Thiery Lataste, the French high
commissioner in New Caledonia, and its vice-chairman is from the
PRCR.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the U.N. delegation encouraged the local
parties to eliminate their differences and completely implement
the agreement on decolonization signed between the French
government and the local parties in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 agreement is aimed at decolonizing the institutions
before holding a referendum in 15 to 20 years to decide between
independence and a high-degree autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Go from Weakness to Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans, who make up 96 percent
of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region, have seen
themselves grown from a weak group living under a feudal system to
a vigorous one under the leadership of the Communist Party, over
the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans know the significance of the democratic reforms
that began in the region in 1959 that turned them into masters of
their own destiny. The democratic reforms put an end to the
political and religious dictatorial rule that had long plagued
Tibet and gave the serfs freedom.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, the 61-year-old chairman of the regional People's
Congress Standing Committee, describes his own experience before
1959 as nightmarish. He was born into a poor herdsman's family in
northern Tibet and worked as a servant to herd owners, tribal
chiefs, and living Buddhas from the age of six.
</P>
<P>
He later fled from his oppressive masters and made a living by
begging. "The scars over my body are reminders of the miserable
past," he says.
</P>
<P>
The Thirteen-article Code and Sixteen-article Code were used in
old Tibet to separate people into three classes, each with three
ranks, enforcing the inequality. But the former Tibetan serfs are
their own masters now and their offspring are playing an important
role in economic development.
</P>
<P>
At present, the autonomous region has about 50,000 Tibetan or
other ethnic cadres, accounted for 75 percent of the total number
of cadres.
</P>
<P>
Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, only a small
number of monk officials and children of the nobility had the
privilege of studying, and less than two percent of the school-age
children went to school. The illiteracy rate ran as high as 97
percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, there were 81.3 percent of the school-age
Tibetan children in school and an education system that went from
preschool to college and university. Since the mid-1980s, to make
it easier for middle school students from Tibet to study in other
parts of China, the Central Government set aside special funds for
Tibetan junior middle-school classes in 16 provinces and
municipalities, involving 13,000 students.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, board and lodging, clothing, and medical care
for those students are all covered by the government.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetans are living better lives as well with the rapid
development especially since China started its reform and open-up
drive 20 years ago. Under the feudal system, most Tibetan farmers
and herdsmen owned no material goods, but now per household assets
are worth 9,000 yuan in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Son of Syrian President Concludes Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bashar Hafez Al-Assad, the
son of Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, left here Tuesday for
Saudi Arabia after wrapping up his first visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, who arrived here late Sunday, held separate talks
with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, and acting Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on ways
of developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The meetings also touched upon regional and international
issues which are of interest to both countries, the official news
agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bashar, 34, asserted Syria's supportive stance
toward settling the issue of Kuwaiti and third country's
nationals allegedly held in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Kuwaiti, Syrian and Lebanese families of
detainees in Iraq at the Kuwaiti National Committee for Missing
and POWs, the Syrian official criticized the continuous detention
of those people, stressing that "Damascus stood and will stand by
Kuwait to solve the issue."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that Iraq is still holding over 600 Kuwaiti
and third country nationals since its invasion of the Gulf
emirate in 1990. But Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti allegation.

NAIROBI -- Splitting rebels of the the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) announced Tuesday that they agreed to sign the
Lusaka Peace Accord as a group, Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The impasse was broken Monday night by the proposal of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit held last
week in Maputo, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit, also attended by major supporters of the
rebels, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni, proposed that all the 51 founding
members of the main rebel party, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD), will sign the agreement as a group instead of one person
as initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted the proposal following the meeting of
founding members Monday night,'' one of the rebel leaders, Bizima
Karaha told RNA in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
Karaha disclosed that the proposal was accepted after they were
convinced to agree with it by the visiting South African Foreign
Minister, Nkosazana Zuma, and the Rwandan Minister in the
President's Office, Patrick Mazimhaka.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement split in May of this year when Ernest Wamba
was removed from the RCD leadership by the founding members, and
then went to Kisangani to establish its own headquarters. (Congo-

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Refiner's Debt-Restructuring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a draft plan to restructure the 2.17-billion-U.S.-dollar
debts of refinery company Thai Oil, a Government House press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT) was asked to inject 350 million dollars of capital into Thai
Oil so that it could maintain its current 49.9-percent stake in
the refiner.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil had asked its 124 creditors to swap about 350 million
dollars' worth of loans for restructured equity and to extend the
maturity of its debt by 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Suwat Liptapallop said that Thai Oil has held
talks with most creditors on the principle of the restructuring
plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the company still needs to further negotiate with
Japanese banks, which are its biggest creditors, on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil, which runs a 220,000-barrel per day refinery, saw its
debt soar after the baht fell sharply in July 1997. The company
has since November 1998 suspended debt repayments pending debt
restructuring talks with creditors.

BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export in the first
half of this year were valued at 27.1 billion U.S. dollars, an

</P>
<P>
The best performers in export were industrial and
agro-industrial products which increased 5.8 percent and 3.1
percent respectively.

The report attributed the export increase to the economic
recovery trend in Asian countries.
</P>

Thailand's total imports from January to June rose by 8.5
percent to 23.2 billion dollars. As a result, the country
registered a trade surplus of 3.9 billion dollars, down 29.7
percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Dogs Raid Somali Village Killing One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of hungry wild dogs
attacked a Somali village, killed a person and wounded 11 others
in Lower Shabelle region of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The raid lasted for about one day starting Monday afternoon and
 continued to 11:00 a.m. (local time) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar Ali Gesey, a businessman in the town, told Xinhua that
the dogs have rushed out from around a large rain-created water
pool near the village. More than eight dogs were seen running
wildly on the sandy streets chasing and attacking people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The biting dogs stripped away all the muscle below the knee of
a boy who is selling toothbrush sticks near a market.
</P>
<P>
Bulo Marer village, about 120 Km south of the capital on the
road to the southern port town of Kismaio, has no hospital or
doctor available. Local elders began treating the wounded
voluntarily with self-assigned pharmacies and organized a group of
young militiamen to fight against the dogs.
</P>
<P>
Two of the dogs were killed Tuesday. One of the elders in the
village said that none of the people has so far caught the rabies
the dogs may be carrying.
</P>
<P>
The town returned to calm in the afternoon, but local people
still carry guns or batons for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Local people said the dogs had probably had nothing to eat and
this could have been a strike against hunger. The Somalis do not
own or feed dogs out of religious reason.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a year that dogs attacked parts of
Lower Shabelle region controlled by faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid. Early last year, a similar attack stormed the town
of Qoryoley wounding several people, four of whom were known to
have caught rabies 20 days later.

Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the People'

series of stories about Chinese men and women, young and old, to
present a picture of the changes that have taken place in China
over the past 50 years. The people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the second article.

<P>
HEFEI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ma Maojie clearly remembers the
day she ferried the first group of People's Liberation Army
soldiers across the Yangtze to fight the Kuomintang troops, 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze separated the Communist area from the Kuomintang
area in 1949 and on April 20 of that year, Mao Zedong attacked
suddenly using thousands of small boats.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was 15, and her brother, ferried the first 30 soldiers
in the assault wave at night. The flames reflected off the river,
she recalls, and the roar of cannons almost made her deaf. Several
of the boats were hit by shells or intercepted by Kuomintang ships,
but Ma's boat continued on its way.
</P>
<P>
As they approached the bank, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in
her right arm. It came from a bullet, but she just continued
paddling and got all the soldiers to the beachhead. The first boat
to reach the south bank.
</P>
<P>
She carried two more loads of boats before daylight and many
more people and weapons over the next several days. The Kuomintang
troops were strong, but could not keep up with the PLA, Ma says,
and several days later, the PLA took Nanjing, which was the
Kuomintang capital, meaning the collapse of the regime.
</P>
<P>
Six months later, Mao Zedong declared the founding of the
People's Republic on the Rostrum of Tian'anmen Square and the end
of the Kuomintang after a four-year civil war. The remaining
Kuomintang troops fled to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma was given a medal and called a hero and her boat was
christened "The First Ferry to Carry Soldiers across the Yangtze".
When asked why she wasn't scared to death, she says plainly: "I
was born to a poor family and my four sisters died of illness or
hunger. My father was enlisted in the Kuomintang army and I was
sold to a man as a wife for three baskets of rice." If the PLA
hadn't come, she says plainly, she would have died.
</P>
<P>
Because she was a hero, Chairman Mao invited her to the
founding ceremony of the People's Republic on October 1, 1949, but
she didn't go because she was too young, she says ruefully. And,
her parents were also afraid of the journey to Beijing. They
thought it was at the end of the horizon and nobody could come
back from there.
</P>
<P>
Today they all have TV sets and newspapers telling about
everything in the world, she explains, but then people had little
access to information, But, in 1951, when Mao sent a second
invitation, the girl started off.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, she watched theatrical performance seated between
Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai. Mao asked her what her name
was and she answered tensely: "I have only the family name Ma.
Villagers call me 'sister'," and Mao said: "How can a hero have no
name?" The next day she ate with Mao and his family. Mao gave her
a pen and a notebook and wrote a few words in it, calling her "
Maojie." He had given her a new name, " Maojie", or "Sister of the
Mao family".
</P>
<P>
Ma has five children and she and her husband live a peaceful
life in east China's Anhui Province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Slightly Disoriented by GPS Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's first Arctic
expedition, which is doing research in the Arctic Ocean, had a
slight malfunction in its global position system (GPS) but no
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
The satellite clock memory was out of sync and could have
caused some operation problems in the GPS. That was on Monday and
some satellites had a problem, but the expedition was not
seriously affected. The new GPS being used by the expedition was
operating well, according to Qin Weijia, assistant to the chief
scientist in charge of coordinating research projects on the ship,
the Snow Dragon.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Arctic Ocean is complicated and visibility
is usually limited to 100 meters on foggy days, so they rely
entirely on GPS. "It's hard to imagine the consequences if some
GPS instruments failed," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
But, for safety's sake, the expedition suspended some
operations for the day and the Snow Dragon stayed close to the
temporary ice station. In the past week, the expedition did
research on a floating piece of ice and the nearly 20 GPS
instruments were key instruments.
</P>
<P>
Ocean currents and winds could change the position of the Snow
Dragon and the temporary observation station from time to time,
and a temporary station could float many kilometers from the
expedition boat overnight. Both people and equipment could be left
missing without any precise idea about their position. The ship's
boat and helicopter could also get lost.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that Kosovo
Albanians' attempt to block Russian peacekeepers entering Orahovac
in Kosovo was "a well-organized provocation planned in advance."
</P>
<P>
Such a provocation represents "an open challenge to the
international community and directly contradicts Resolution 1244
of the U.N. Security Council," the Russian Foreign Ministry said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
These actions have breached "the Kosovo settlement principles,
which were adopted by the G8 countries and the coordinated

BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to sign
protocol to protect victims of international armed conflicts, a
senior official was quoted by the Thai News Agency (TNA) as saying
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Armed Forces are studying carefully the Additional
Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Convention, to determine who should
be classified as "war victims" and whether some certain groups,
like separatists, should be included before signing the protocol,
Vasin Teeravejayarn, director-general of Thai Foreign Ministry's
Department of Treaties and Legal Affairs, said.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that Thailand will not sign Additional
Protocol II to protect victims of non-international armed
conflicts because the Thai Armed Forces opposed to the offering of
protection to domestic armed groups and separatists.
</P>
<P>
According to both codes of ethics, civilians, soldiers wounded
on the battlefield and prisoners-of-war must all be treated
humanely, while the torture and execution of those considered war
victims is prohibited.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of state-owned Krung
Thai Bank (KTB) of Thailand Mechai Viravaidhya resigned Monday,
saying his resignation will provide an opportunity for a more
suitable person to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Mechai and five other board members proposed their resignations
at an emergency meeting of the board of the Financial Institution
Development Fund (FIDF), the majority shareholder of KTB.
</P>
<P>
Mechai's resignation came amidst increasingly heated argument
between the government and the opposition on the KTB issue.
</P>
<P>
Mechai has been accused of conspiring to discredit Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmannahaeminda by leaking a confidential
auditors report, which revealed that KTB was saddled with about 84
percent of non-performing loans (NPL) and would need provisions of
364 billion to 394 billion baht (9.8 billion to 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars) to cover the potential losses.
</P>
<P>
However, KTB, the largest bank of Thailand, said its NPLs were
59.3 percent at the end of June, no higher than the average level
of Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
The KTB issue, directed against Sirin Nimmannahaeminda, former
KTB president and the younger brother of the finance minister, has
been politicized and thus threatened the stability of the
government.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Shine as More Records Fall at Pan Pacific Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian teenager Ian Thorpe
became swimming's newest star as he established his third world
record in as many days at the on-going Pan Pacific swimming
championships in Sydney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
American Lenny Krayzelburg also set a world record in the men's
100 meters backstroke -- the sixth in three days at Sydney's
Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Thorpe lowered his own 200 meters freestyle
mark to one minute 46.00 seconds in Tuesday's final, just 24 hours
after he set the previous mark of 1:46.34 and two days after he
shattered the 400 meters freestyle world record.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, a Ukranian-born American, sliced more than a
quarter of a second off the previous 100m backstroke world mark
set by American Jeff Rouse at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics,
clocking in 53.60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Penny Heyns won the women's 100m breaststroke in
1:07.08, but was not happy with her performance a day after she
broke her own world record in the heats.
</P>
<P>
The dual Atlanta Olympic champion has set an amazing five world
records in the past five weeks but ran out of steam in Tuesday's
race.
</P>
<P>
Mai Nakamura brought about Japan's first gold medal of the
championships after a dead-heat finish with Australian Dyana Calub
in the women's 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Australian Michael Klim, the reigning men's 200m freestyle
world champion, was under Thorpe's world record pace at the 100m
point, but he was unable to keep up when the teenager kicked away
for a new world mark.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe said he would attempt to lower his record even further
on Wednesday by swimming the lead-off leg in the Australian 4x200
meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
The Australians keep the world record they set at last year's
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Their team also includes Grant Hackett, who had held the 200m
individual record before Thorpe shattered it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third day competitions, Australia have won
five of the six gold medals in the men's events while the U.S.
have a sole one through Krayzelburg. The 23-year-old reigning 100
and 200m backstroke champion had never set a world record.
Krayzelburg was 0.35 seconds under Rouse's seven-year-old record
after the first 50 meters and he held on to clip 0.26 off the mark
by the end of the race.

<HEADLINE> Elf Chief Says Balance of Force Changes in Wrestling With Total </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Officer of Elf-
Aquitaine oil group, Philippe Jaffre, said on Tuesday that the
balance of force in his arms wrestling with his rival, Franco-
Belgian oil group Total-Fina, is in the process of changing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde, Jaffre said that a
solution to the merger battle between the two oil and chemical
giants can be found if the president of Total-Fina, Thierry
Desmarest, confirms his intention to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
Elf made a furious counter acquisition bid against Total-Fina a
month ago in reaction to a surprise bid on it by the latter on
July 5.
</P>
<P>
Since then, both Elf and Total-Fina have been seeking a
compromise version of an apparently inevitable merger, which will
result in the world's fourth largest oil and gas group and the
fifth biggest chemicals group.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which has the final power of arbitration
or veto over the merger, has maintained neutrality but seems to
encourage the merger move.
</P>
<P>
Jaffre criticized Total-Fina for seeking a merger with Elf "
within two months."

<HEADLINE> Assets of Closed Thai Finance Firms Sold at 3.9 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has fetched 146.8
billion baht (3.9 billion U.S. dollars) from the sales of core
assets of defunct financial companies, the Financial Sector
Restructure Authority (FRA) said in a report available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FRA said that core assets seized from 56 closed financial
companies were valued at 584 billion baht (15.8 billion dollars).
The authority organized six auctions to sell the assets, which
raised about a quarter of the valued assets.
</P>
<P>
The FRA said U.S.-based investment bank Goldman Sachs was the
biggest winner, taking assets worth 208.9 billion baht (5.6
billion dollars), followed by the Asset Management Corporation of
Thailand, which won assets worth 188.9 billion baht (5.1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
After the financial crisis broke out in mid-1997, the Thai
government closed 56 ailing financial companies. The FRA was then
set up to sell off the assets of these companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the FRA, 72 percent, or 6,364 employees, had been
laid off during the closure of the financial firms.

<HEADLINE> 4 Injured in Slum Explosion in Bangladeshi Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Four people were critically
injured in an explosion in a slum in the Bangladeshi capital city
Dhaka Tuesday afternoon, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of "terrorists" were manufacturing bombs in a house in
a slum to resist a possible eviction drive, police were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Four of them suffered critical sprinter injuries when some
bombs exploded suddenly. Three were admitted to Dhaka Medical
College Hospital, and the other was taken to the Orthopedics
Hospital under police guard.
</P>
<P>
The "terrorists" were arrested and some bombs-manufacturing
materials were recovered from the spot, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The government evicted some 70,000 slum dwellers from the city
early this month following the killing a police constable, on the
ground that the slums had become dens of terrorists and criminals.
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 2 million slum dwellers are living in
Dhaka, which has a population of about 9 million.

The fight against Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong has had
remarkable successes, it says, and most Falun Gong practitioners
have seen the truth about Falun Gong cult and broken with it.
Party members, officials and working people have been educated,
the country has maintained stability, society has more interest in
science and technology, and the reforms and opening up are
progressing, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party's decision to ban
Falun Gong was in the fundamental interest of the entire nation
and was timely and necessary, it says, and the major task facing
Party and government departments now is to continue educating
Falun Gong practitioners who practiced Falun Gong simply to
benefit their health and who knew nothing about Li's political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
When presented with the facts, the majority of them got a clear
idea about Li and his cult and repented and have done well in
exposing Li and his organization, it says, and those who have
broken with Falun Gong should be helped zealously and no prejudice
should be shown them.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Needs to Effectively Utilize Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Water Resources
Ministry has been urged to make a master plan for effective use of
water resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a master plan of water resources is conducive to
efforts geared to ensure the realization of food self-sufficiency,
representative of the ministry Kidane Assefa said in a paper
presented on Tuesday to a panel discussion on "Drought and
Climatic Changes in Ethiopia".
</P>
<P>
Kidane said that the uneven water distribution in Ethiopia has
hindered the efficient utilization of the country's water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, described as "reservoir of Africa", is well known for
its plentiful natural water resources.
</P>
<P>
However, only 200,000 of the three billion hectares of
irrigable land in the country has so far been developed through
irrigation, Kidane said, noting that no more than 17 percent of
the country's population have had access to clean water.
</P>
<P>
The figures, he said, are very minimal when compared with that
of other sub-Saharan countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia loses three billion tons of soil worth about 250
billion birr (nearly 31 billion U.S. dollars) annually due to
erosion, the representative said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A circular from the general
offices of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
and the State Council today says that Falun Gong practitioners
need more education to change their stance and to get them away
from the cult.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, the CPC Central Committee's decision
to expose and criticize Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi and
ban the illegal organization has won wide support from the Chinese
people. The overwhelming majority of Falun Gong practitioners have
expressed willingness to extricate themselves from the cult and
many former practitioners have realized their error in taking part
in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that educating the practitioners is an
important indicator of the effects and success of the fight
against Falun Gong and Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Most practitioners should be treated properly, it says, because
Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong took advantage of their concern for
their health and most of them knew nothing about Li Hongzhi's
ulterior political motives.

<HEADLINE> Sankoh to visit West African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Former rebel leader of Sierra
Leone Foday Sankoh is scheduled to visit Burkina Faso, Cote
d'Ivoire and Liberia before taking up his duties in a new
government of national unity in his country seven weeks after
signing a power-sharing accord with the government.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who is to head a commission for post-war reconstruction
and mineral resources in the new government returned to Togolese
capital of Lome at the weekend from Libya, which has been accused
in the past of providing military support to the rebels, according
to a Vanguard report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying, "I went to Libya to say thanks
to (President Moammer) Kadaffi for his country's mediation in the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said that before heading to Freetown next week, he
planned to go to Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and finally to
Liberia where he would "hold an audience with good friends" in
these countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his arrival in Freetown had been delayed by
security and accommodation problems, adding the government had
not even set up an office yet for his post, which is to be equal
in rank to that of vice president.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
had already submitted a list of its nominations for four cabinet
posts and four deputy ministerial positions, and President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah would announce the new cabinet "shortly".
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, a four-man RUF delegation has been in
Freetown preparing for the RUF's entry into the new government,
which was supposed to have been set up in late July under the Lome
peace agreement signed on July 7 between the government and
rebels.

<P>
The education needs to be sincere, patient, and careful to help
them recognize the serious harm of Li Hongzhi and the cult and
understand that it is in the interest of the state and the people
to ban Falun Gong, it says.
</P>
<P>
People need to believe that after practitioners know the truth
they will support the decision of the Party and government and
separate themselves from the cult.
</P>
<P>
And a clear line needs to be drawn between common practitioners
who seek ways for keeping fit and Li Hongzhi and organizers of
illegal activities who have political reasons for causing chaos,
it says, emphasizing the need for a good command of policy by
those carrying out the program to isolate the few organizers.
</P>
<P>
Those who practiced Falun Gong with hopes of improving their
physical fitness should not be discriminated against as long as
they have correctly understood the issue and stopped participating
in Falun Gong activities.
</P>
<P>
Work units and grassroots organizations can declare that former
practitioners have cut ties with the cult as long as they have
broken away from it, exposed the true nature of the cult and its
illegal activities, and promised not to take part in its
activities.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Delegation Arrives in Pakistan for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban's top foreign
affairs official Mullah Muhammad Hassan, heading a high-level
delegation, arrived here Tuesday for a three-day official visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Hassan will hold talks with his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj
Aziz on various issues including the bilateral relations between
the two countries, with focus on the controversy over the Afghan
Transit Trade Agreement (ATTA).
</P>
<P>
The ATTA, signed in the 1960s, was aimed at facilitating the
foreign trade of Afghanistan which has no sea port. Under the
agreement, the inland country only pays a meager amount of service
charges for the transit trade through Pakistan and enjoys
exemption of duties.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imposed restrictions on the ATTA in 1997, dropping 36
items from the list of duty-exempted goods, arguing that most of
the goods imported under the ATTA were not used in Afghanistan but
made their way back to the Pakistani markets.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, goods smuggled into Pakistan
are depriving the national exchequer of over 5.5 billion rupees
(about 100 million U.S. dollars) every year mainly due to the
exemption provided to Afghanistan under the ATTA.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban are unhappy about the "unilateral
restrictions" by Pakistan on the Afghan transit trade and have
been calling for the removal of the restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Better Education Conditions in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has began to
carry out a program in some poor areas that need extra investment
in education, the Education Department announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program involves the implementation of a 5 billion pesos
(125 million U.S. dollars) worth of school building and
rehabilitation work for poor communities in several provinces,
Philippine News Agency reported.

These provinces belong to a cluster of more than 20 poor
provinces that are covered by a flagship project for basic
education called Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP), he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gonzalez, the new classrooms constructed under the
project, partly funded by the World Bank and the Japan-based
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), are now being used in
Antique province.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts to Fight Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's health care service
cured 38,700 tuberculosis (TB) patients and detected more than
40,300 new cases in the first six months of this year, Vietnam
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TB control has been considered one of the priorities in health
care development in Vietnam, according to Director of Vietnam's
National Institute of TB and Lung Diseases (NITLD) Nguyen Viet Co,
who was briefing an international training course on TB treatment
opened in Hanoi Monday on Vietnam's TB control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese government pledged to provide sufficient medicine
for TB treatment. It allocated 22 billion Vietnamese dong (nearly
2 million U.S. dollars) to the National TB Control Program this
year.
</P>
<P>
Since its launching in 1957, Co said, the National TB Control
Program has been expanded to cover 99 percent of the population
now.
</P>
<P>
NITLD's statistics show that the national rate of TB
contraction is 69.6 per 100,000 and an estimated 130,000 people
contract the disease every year. Curing rate among patients
undergoing short-course chemotherapy is estimated at between 88-89
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of TB cases is likely to increase in connection with
the spread of HIV infection, said Co, adding that at present, more
than 1,270 TB patients are reported to carry HIV, accounting for
almost 11 percent of the total number of HIV-positive cases
detected so far.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam currently has nearly 400 doctors, more than 600 nurses
and about 560 testing technicians working for the TB control
program at district level and almost 8,000 medical workers being
involved at commune level.
</P>
<P>
The on-going international training course on TB control in
Hanoi is organized by the NITLD in coordination with the World
Health Organization (WHO).

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Even though China and Dominica
have not yet established diplomatic ties, the current visit by
President of the Dominican Senate Ramon Alburquerque will help
increase mutual understanding and friendship, and lay foundation
for future cooperation in various fields, said Li Peng, chairman
of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, here
today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Alburquerque this afternoon, Li said
that the two countries, though geographically far apart, both
belong to developing countries and support each other in their
fight for national independence.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people cherish friendly feelings for the Dominican
and both parliaments have carried out exchanges," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Alburquerque hailed China's great achievement in its reform and
economic construction, adding that Dominica hopes to enhance
economic and trade ties, as well as civil exchanges, with China.
</P>

He also voiced the hope that both parliaments improve their
ties so as to push forward the equal and mutual-benefit

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Areas Undergoing Historic Changes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A report from Ministry of
Agriculture indicates that China's grain output this year is
expected to near 500 million tons, basically equaling last year.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth consecutive bumper grain harvest China
has enjoyed since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the per capita share of grain, meat, eggs and milk
of Chinese people has exceeded or neared the world average,
meaning that China has basically solved the food problem which has
affected it for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
The per capita share of grain, meat, eggs and milk of Chinese
people is, respectively, over 400 kilograms, 50 kilometers, 17
kilometers and 6.6 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has increased its annual grain
production capacity from the initial 100 million tons to about 500
million tons while reducing the number of the impoverished
population to 42 million last year from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers' income has surged, accompanied by a
remarkable improvement in the quality of life and living
environment, which has laid a solid foundation for the nation's
economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the National bureau of
Statistics, the average annual net income of farmers soared to 2,
162 yuan in 1998 from 44 yuan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
And in the past 20 years, their income reported a 16-fold
increase, thanks to the reform and opening up policies introduced
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that farmers' spending on food accounted
for 69 percent of the total when new China was founded in 1949,
but the figure dropped to 53 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, their spending on education, recreation and services
grew to 10 percent, with the livable housing space rising to 23.7
square meters per capita.

<HEADLINE> Planned Aluminum Smelter Threatens Iceland's Highlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The planned aluminum smelter in
Reidarfjordur on Iceland's East Coast would result in enormous
costs to the environment of the highlands, the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) said.
</P>
<P>
"Cheap electricity for aluminum production is no justification
for ignoring environmental considerations," said the international
conservation organization in a press release received here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a conference held last week, WWF said that Norsk Hydro,
mainly owned by the Norwegian state, declared it would continue
with plans to build new aluminum smelters in countries such as
Iceland to provide cheap energy.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental accounting should not be a concept alien to an
international firm," said Peter Prokosch, director of the WWF
Arctic Program in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
"If Norsk Hydro engages in building and running an aluminum
smelter in Eastern Iceland, it will also be responsible for the
inevitable destruction of the largest wilderness area remaining in
Western Europe," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Large parts of the unique Icelandic Highlands will have to be
flooded to produce the energy required," Prokosch said.

By 1998, over 95 percent of villages across the country had
access to highways, some 70 percent to telephone services, and
more than 95 percent to electricity.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in lifestyle has prompted the growth of
democratic awareness on the part of farmers, over 90 percent of
whom are actively participating in the direct election of
villagers' committees.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who used to care only about their own grain harvest
have also begun to take interest in and even directly involve
themselves in the management of village affairs.
</P>
<P>
A sociologist said that the democratic rights farmers enjoy
from their autonomy are bound to bring greater social changes in
China, just as the right to farm their own land after 1978 has
done.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the dramatic changes in the country's rural
areas to the central government's consistent policy of putting
agriculture above everything in developing the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The household contract responsibility system with remuneration
linked to output, which symbolized the beginning of China's reform
and opening up, has kindled millions of farmers' enthusiasm for
production.
</P>
<P>
And the introduction of agro-sciences featured by seedling
projects, plastic sheeting and water-saving techniques has further
promoted the rapid growth of agriculture, contributing 40 percent
to the sector's growth.

<P>
With improved productivity and a rapid growth of grain output,
a considerable number of farmers and agricultural workers are free
from being tied to the land and can either go to find jobs in
cities or set up enterprises locally.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Ministry of Agriculture said that 15 percent
of the 80 million farm workers in cities nationwide return home
every year, having learned new techniques and the latest farming
information and often with spare cash in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that they bring home these new ideas
and concepts, which have boosted overall progress in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of township enterprises has come as a
great surprise for most Chinese people as they have not only
improved the overall quality and efficiency of the rural economy
but also played an important role in the growth of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one third of the nation's gross domestic
output, one fifth of the nation's tax revenue and one third of the
nation's exports come from township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these enterprises have employed more than 100
million surplus rural laborers, contributing considerably to the
growth of income in the sector.
</P>
<P>
But agricultural experts warn that China has every reason and
need to step up its agricultural development because by 2030, the
nation's population is expected to reach 1.6 billion and an
additional one-third more of the present day grain output will be
needed to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a sustainable, steady and healthy development of
agriculture, China is spending heavily on such agro-scientific
projects as the Harvest and Bridging programs, while stepping up
protection of farmland and the ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Reinforce Diamond Traffic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has promised
to reinforce control on the international illicit diamond traffic,
which supports various conflicts in Africa, including the Angola
civil war, said the U.S. Embassy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The embassy was quoted on Tuesday by Jornal de Angola as saying
that the U.S. government has maintained contacts with Angolan
entities and Robert Fowler, head of the Commission of Sanctions
for Angola, in a bid to find the best way to reinforce the control
on the illicit flux of diamond.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government has realized that the "blackmarket" constitutes
a factor of causing the unstabilization in Africa, proportionating
arms transactions and profound entrance of international criminal
organizations into regions in conflicts, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued recently by the State
Department, the U. S. government will discuss the situation of the
illicit traffic with principal diamond-producing countries,
including Angola.
</P>
<P>
U.S. admitted it is difficult to identify the diamonds from
Angola among all the precious stones entering U.S., but said that
the priorities given by the new policy will change the situation,

<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's capital goods market has
been developing smoothly since July this year, with prices of most
steel products declining, and sales of automobiles improving,
according to the State Administration of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
As demand for investment in infrastructure projects cooled down,
the prices of most steel products dropped on average by two
percent in July, although the price of steel plates remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
However, experts pointed out that the prices of steel products
will rebound in the later half of this year as a result of the
government's active financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The prices of major nonferrous metal products are expected to
remain stable, and the trend will continue in August and September
this year, according to statistics released by the administration'
s Materials Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Chemical products did not sell well but sales of automobiles,
mostly sedan cars, mini-bus and automobiles for both passenger and
cargo uses, increased by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
In July, the average price of 22 types of automobiles rose a
little from that of the previous month, the center said.

The Ukranian-born American clocked a time of 53.60 seconds to
shatter the previous world mark of 53.86 set by Jeff Rouse at the

<HEADLINE> China to Draft Law on Maritime Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of maritime
lawsuits and a lack of legal solutions have impelled China's
legislative body to create a new maritime law.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee
convened here today to discuss a draft of ad hoc procedures for
maritime lawsuits, which will be subsidiary to the Maritime Law
that went into effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the necessity of the draft, Li Guoguang, vice-
president of the Supreme People's Court, described the draft law
as vital to ocean shipping, foreign trade and better use of
maritime resources of China, which boasts a large ocean territory
and the fifth biggest shipping industry in the world.
</P>
<P>
"A surge of admiralty actions in recent years makes it highly
necessary to formulate a maritime law for handling lawsuits in
accordance with both China's situation and international practice,
" Li said.
</P>
<P>
Admiralty courts across China have heard more than 25,000
maritime cases since 1984. Among these, 3,746 are related to
foreigners from 73 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The existing Maritime Law is too difficult to be implemented
due to the lack of a procedure law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 12-chapter draft stipulates that the law is applicable
within the territory of the People's Republic of China, and that
foreigner-related cases will be tried in accordance with the law,
international treaties participated by China, and international
practice.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Current Account Back in Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa slipped back
into a current account deficit equivalent to some 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter from a surplus
of above one perfect of GDP in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In its Annual Economic Review, the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) said the current account at seasonally adjusted, annual of 13 percent rea
ched in the fourth quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's gross foreign reserves rose by more than five
billion rand (830 million U.S. dollars) in the first half due to
net capital inflows of 7.4 billion rand, and the repayment of 2.1
billion rand in foreign credit lines, as well as valuation
adjustments of 250 million rand.
</P>
<P>
This meant the import coverage of reserves rose to 12 weeks at
the end of June from 10 weeks at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The SARB said export volumes had risen by 4.1 percent in the
first half of 1999 compared with a rise of 3.1 percent in 1998 as
Asian economies recovered.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in foreign reserves meant the real effective
exchange rate of the rand rose by 3.4 percent in the first half of
1999 compared with a decline of 14.1 percent in 1998.
</P>

The employment situation in the private sector seems to be
improving since the middle of 1998 and in the first quarter of
1999 there was a 2.4 percent annualized increase in employment on
the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Average nominal remuneration per worker eased to a 7-percent
growth rate in the 12 months to end March 1999 from 10.7 percent
in 1997. This, the SARB, said augured well for future declines in
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Executed Over 3,000 Court Rulings In Media Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua)-- In the latest week-long media
campaign on law-enforcement, Chinese courts have issued more than
3,000 rulings involving some 200 million yuan (about 24 million U.
S.dollars), the Supreme People's Court (SPC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
 The SPC said in the nationwide media drive against local
interference in and resistance to the enforcement of court rulings
that the courts across the country have effectively tackled the "
law-enforcement difficulties."
</P>
<P>
These courts publicized the names of enterprises which have
refused to honor their debts, and seized, froze, distributed or
sold the property of debtors who have some means of paying off
debts but intentionally evaded court orders, the SPC said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipality held public hearings to conduct legal
education for those who refused to honor their obligations, and at
the same time closed 187 cases involving some 28 million yuan .
Forty debtors who had resisted the court orders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Li Lingshu, an official of Zibo City's Real Estate
Administration Bureau, was detained according to law by the Higher
People's Court of Shandong Province for resisting to assist the
enforcement of court rulings during the campaign, the SPC
confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Liner and Cargo Ship Collide off UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Three people were injured when a
cruise liner with some 2,400 passengers on board collided with a
container vessel off England's southeast coast on early Tuesday,
British coastguards said.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters airlifted the three injured from the Bahamas-
registered Norwegian Dream cruise ship to hospital in England.
</P>
<P>
The injuries were minor, the Reuters news agency quoted a
spokesman for coastguards in the English port of Dover as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cruise liner later limped into Dover after the collision
which also left the container ship ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Three containers were tipped onto the cruiser when the ships
collided, and others went into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Dream's bridge was badly damaged and its bow
dented.
</P>
<P>
The 17 crew on the Panama-registered container vessel Ever
Decent were battling to contain a cargo fire.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters, tugs, lifeboats and the German frigate Augsburg
raced to help the Ever Decent shortly after the accident in the
Channel -- one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
A British Royal Air Force Nimrod aircraft was monitoring the
situation and five merchant ships were ready to assist.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there were no details on how the collision
occurred. He dismissed as "speculative" reports that the
container ship was already on fire when it collided with the
Norwegian Dream.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Boston-based U.S. Gordon Brothers
Retail Partners LLC has been hired to liquidate all the
merchandise of Canada's oldest retailer, T. Eaton Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday that under an
insolvency plan approved by a court Monday, a Gordon affiliate,
Retail Funding Inc., has bought Eaton's entire debt of 189.6
million Canadian dollars (about 126.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Retail Funding has agreed to inject 100 million Canadian
dollars (about 66.7 million U.S. dollars) into Eaton's to keep
stores operating during the liquidation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brothers announced Monday that it has a team of 120
employees ready to move in to the stores to manage the liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eaton's said it aims to have its last store
locations cleared out and closed by November 30, gradually putting
all its 13,000 employees out of work.
</P>
<P>
The 130-year-old collapsing retailing empire also said it will
negotiate with other retailers to find buyers or new tenants for
its 64 stores.
</P>
<P>
Customers are rushing to the Eaton's stores across the country
for liquidation sales, only to be disappointed at the usual price
tags. The expected selloff is yet to start in a couple of days
until the end of November.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Ex-Rebel Leader to Tour West African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Former rebel leader of Sierra
Leone Foday Sankoh is scheduled to visit Burkina Faso, Cote
d'Ivoire and Liberia before taking up his duties in a new
government of national unity in his country seven weeks after
signing a power-sharing accord with the government.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who is to head a commission for post-war reconstruction
and mineral resources in the new government returned to Togolese
capital of Lome at the weekend from Libya, which has been accused
in the past of providing military support to the rebels,
according to a Vanguard report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying "I went to Libya to say thanks
to (President Moamer) Kadhafi for his country's mediation in the
peace process. "
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said that before heading to Freetown next week, he
planned to go to Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and finally to
Liberia where he would "hold an audience with good friends" in
these countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his arrival in Freetown had been delayed by
security and accommodation problems, adding the government had
not even set up an office yet for his post, which is to be equal
in rank to that of vice president.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
had already submitted a list of its nominees for four cabinet
posts and four deputy ministerial positions, and President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah would announce the new cabinet "shortly".
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, a four-man RUF delegation has been in
Freetown preparing for the RUF's entry into the new government,
which was supposed to have been set up in late July under the
Lome peace agreement signed on July 7 between the government and
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Transfer Ownership of Suzhou Industrial Park to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is planning to
transfer a major part of the ownership of the Suzhou Industrial
Park, a joint Singaporean-Chinese development project that began
in 1994, to the Chinese side, according to George Yeo, Singapore's
Minister for Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Yeo made the remark at a press conference here this afternoon
where he said that Singapore's shares will go from 65 percent to
35 percent as of January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong and his Chinese counterpart Li Lanqing will meet in
September to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the park, in Jiangsu Province, east
China, has had 135 projects with 38.5 billion U.S. dollars worth
of investment, 130 of them industrial projects worth 33.2 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singaporean business people still have confidence in China's
economic potential, Yeo said, and transferring ownership won't
affect relations between Singapore and China.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Beer Brewery Reclaims Trademark in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tsingtao Brewery, China's
biggest beer brewery, has successfully reclaimed its trademark of
Tsingtao Beer in Hong Kong, according to a senior official for the
company.
</P>
<P>
Li Guirong, chairman of the Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd., Tuesday
told a press conference at Furama Hotel here that the company has
achieved prominent interim results for the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The company's turnover totaled 1.13 billion RMB yuan (136
million U.S. dollars) in the first six months this year, with an
increase of 43 percent compared with the same period of last year,
" Li said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the stagnant demand and weak consumption in the first
half of this year, it achieved an output of 446,000 tons of beer,
a growth of 89 percent, making it the largest brewery in China in
terms of scale and market share, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the company's fast growth in production and sales
to a large distribution network of 42 agencies throughout the
country and streamlining of the company's management.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the year, Li said that his company will
continue to increase investment and promote the merger and
acquisition of breweries in China.
</P>
<P>
Among the business strategies, the company will put Shenzhen
Tsingtao Asahi into operation to expand the southern China market.
Efforts will be made to expand its world-wide sales network and to
achieve an annual beer production of one million tons.

</P>
<P>
"The study will focus on the means to collect, process and
disseminate both static and dynamic traffic and transport
information in Hong Kong," said a spokesman for the department

</P>
<P>
"Such information includes routes, fares and schedules of the
public transport, traffic volume as well as real time traffic
conditions," added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"To make the system an efficient and user-friendly one, we also
need information about traffic diversions, traffic forecasts and
statistics on traffic accidents," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Retail Sales Rise in 2nd Quarter of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua)-- Hong Kong has witnessed a
strong rebound in retail sales in the second quarter this year,
according to a report released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the value of total retail sales in June
1999 was estimated at 14.9 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S.
dollars), six percent lower when compared with that in June 1998,
but after discounting price changes, there was virtually no change
in volume terms over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco and of
miscellaneous consumer goods picked up further, to increases of
four percent and six percent in volume, and sales of consumer
durable goods other than motor vehicles had a significant growth
of 11 percent in volume, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The performance of retail business improved further in overall
terms in June, underpinned by the pick-up in local consumer demand
as economic conditions turned better, and the sustained revival in
inbound tourism also contributed, according to a government
secretariat spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The significant growth in sales of consumer durables other than
motor vehicles reflects an increased spending on home appliances
and furniture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Rallies Support for Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, who is on a three-day tour in Mindanao, southern
Philippines, called on the local residents Tuesday to back
economic reforms by amending the 1987 Constitution, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of major agriculture projects,
Estrada said their support would help the government bring in the
foreign capital needed to improve domestic industries and other
capital-intensive sectors through the proposed Charter changes.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms, which reportedly dominate the planed charter
amendment, include relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership of
land and equity in certain public utilities and businesses to pave
the way for the inflow of more foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
This initiative, however, met strong domestic opposition which
was highlighted by the August 20 mass rally in Manila led by
former president Corazon Aquino and Manila Archbishop Jaime Sin.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that he is ready to consult with all
sectors on the charter change and defer to their final decision on
the matter, adding that he owes this to the people who elected
him.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada also called on Mindanao residents to
restore and maintain peace and order in the region so as to help
accelerate the region's development.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign capital will come in if investors have a sense of
security," Estrada stressed.
</P>

Mindanao is the second largest island in the Philippines, which
boasts of rich natural resources but has been lagging behind in
the nation due to social disorder stemming from ethnic conflicts
and rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Shell OIl Company to Resume Operations in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Shell Petroleum Development
Company is to resume operations in its northern swamp field of
Nigeria's Niger-Delta area.
</P>
<P>
In a new release issued Monday in Warri, Delta State, the local
Ijaws community told Shell and other sister companies operating in
the area to commence work following a settlement agreement
reached between the government and Shell company.
</P>
<P>
The Ijaws of Warri have agreed to let the world major oil
company into the oil field after 211 days of closure, The Post
Express reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage of operations followed a 2,000 barrels oil spill
at Odidi, which Shell blamed for sabotage of local people, while
the local community maintained that it was a result of equipment
failure occasioned by old pipelines in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Delta State government had appealed to the communities to
let oil companies resume operations, saying that the stoppage of
operations had been affecting government revenue.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Shell and other companies are asked to
look into the issue of compensation to the affected people while
the local communities are required to embark on a public
enlightenment campaign to their people so that nobody will
henceforth disrupt operation on account of the oil spill again.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture had suffered a loss of about 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars following a shut in by the militant Ijaw youths who
stopped oil operations in the area since January 23.

<HEADLINE> New Ministry to Be Formed to Link Education, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to set up a new ministry
to replace the existing Higher Education Ministry in an effort to
forge closer link between academic research and industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
Higher Education Minister, Mostafa Moin, said on Tuesday this
idea, contained in the ministry's draft as part of the third Five
Year Development Plan (2000-2005), has been approved by cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The new ministry will be called Ministry of Sciences and
Technology or Ministry of Research Sciences and Technology, he
said. This will be a drastic move in reform since the 1979 victory
of Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
A bill on the new establishment will be presented to the
government and Majlis (parliament) six months after the
development plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
Iran boasts of its education and fundamental research, but it
feels difficult to translate those advantages into new industrial
productivity. In the new structure, efforts will be made to
"eliminate the legal and executive gaps existing in the current
structure," Moin added.
</P>
<P>
The development plan for the next five years envisages closer
ties between universities and industrial and executive
organizations. Such links, Moin said, are to contribute to the
country's independence in the areas of economy, politics, science
and culture.

<HEADLINE> Son of Syrian President Concludes Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bashar Hafez Al-Assad, the
son of Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, left here Tuesday for
Saudi Arabia after wrapping up his first visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, who arrived here late Sunday, held separate talks
with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, and acting Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on ways
of developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The meetings also touched upon regional and international
issues which are of interest to both countries, the official news
agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bashar, 34, asserted Syria's supportive stance
toward settling the issue of Kuwaiti and third country's
nationals allegedly held in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Kuwaiti, Syrian and Lebanese families of
detainees in Iraq at the Kuwaiti National Committee for Missing
and POWs, the Syrian official criticized the continuous detention
of those people, stressing that "Damascus stood and will stand by
Kuwait to solve the issue."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that Iraq is still holding over 600 Kuwaiti
and third country nationals since its invasion of the Gulf
emirate in 1990. But Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti allegation.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels to Sign Cease-Fire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Splitting rebels of the the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced Tuesday that they
agreed to sign the Lusaka Peace Accord as a group, Rwanda News
Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The impasse was broken Monday night by the proposal of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit held last
week in Maputo, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit, also attended by major supporters of the
rebels, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni, proposed that all the 51 founding
members of the main rebel party, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD), will sign the agreement as a group instead of one person
as initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted the proposal following the meeting of
founding members Monday night,'' one of the rebel leaders, Bizima
Karaha told RNA in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
Karaha disclosed that the proposal was accepted after they were
 convinced to agree with it by the visiting South African Foreign
Minister, Nkosazana Zuma, and the Rwandan Minister in the
President's Office, Patrick Mazimhaka.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement split in May of this year when Ernest Wamba
was removed from the RCD leadership by the founding members, and
then went to Kisangani to establish its own headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Initially each rebel faction of the RCD claimed legitimacy to
sign on behalf of the rebel movement, while only one signature was
reserved for the Congolese rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The solving of this legitimacy problem between the two
Congolese rebel factions engaging in bitter power struggle has
been hailed as a last chance to rescue the peace deal which risked
to derail if the rebels did not endorse it.
</P>
<P>
But regional analysts believe that the signing of the Lusaka
peace deal by the rebels will not resolve the pending issues,
notably the military aspects, relating to the implementation of
the accord.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Air Force to Update its Fighter Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to sell off three types
of combat jets in its air force and buy new multi-role fighters to
replace them, reported a Nigerian newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Air Staff Isaac Alfa announced in Lagos that the
aircraft to be sold are the MiG (Mikoyan - Guverich) 21 and 15
series, the Sepe Cat Jaguar and the G222. "Anyone interested in
buying them should come," the Guardian, a major Nigerian newspaper
quoted the Air Vice-Marshal as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has about 20 MiG aircraft, including some
two-seater MiG 214 for strike interceptor roles. It has about four
MiG-15 UTIs, MiG15 Fagot, now retired, MiG 17, MiG 21 Fish bed and
MiG 21U Mongol, reported the paper.
</P>
<P>
By selling out the old MIG planes, the Nigerian Government will
be clearing its air force of Soviet-supplied combat jets.
</P>
<P>
To take the place of the aircraft, the government has decided
to procure more advanced multi-role fighters for the Air Force
from the west.
</P>
<P>
It was only after the inauguration of Obasanjo administration
that the United States and other western countries had relaxed
their arms sales to Nigeria. The Nigerian government currently is
seeking closer cooperation with the United Sates, and a group of
military experts are reportedly already in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebel Faction to Reconsider Position on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A faction of the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) has agreed to reconsider its
position on the July 10 Lusaka cease-fire agreement aimed at
ending the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a
telephone interview with Xinhua, South African Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma's spokesman Kangalane Hlongwane could not confirm
reports that both factions of the RCD have agreed to sign the
Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
He said after the shuttle diplomacy by Zuma at the weekend, the
RCD faction led by Emile Ilunga has agreed to go to its founding
members in the constituencies to decide on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said after that the rebel faction would communicate with the
 Organization of African Unity on their decision.
</P>
<P>
"At this time we have to wait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hlongwane said Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who leads the other RCD
faction, has been persuaded by Uganda to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
A leadership squabble has kept the two factions from signing
the Lusaka document, signed by Congolese President Laurent Kabila,
together with five other countries involved in the year-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba, who was ousted as RCD leader in May, has
insisted that he should sign the agreement, but the new leader,
Ilunga, said he would not sign it if Wamba dia Wamba does.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola were allies of Kabila, and Uganda
and Rwanda, who sided with the RCD in their fight to topple
Kabila, later supported the two factions respectively.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is supporting Wamba dia Wamba while Rwanda is supporting
Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
Zuma returned home Monday after traveling to the RCD base in
eastern Congo, Goma, and Rwanda and Uganda.

<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The airplane carrying arms for
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
stopped by the Zambian government on August 19 was from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Official news agency Angop quoted diplomatic sources as saying
that the plane capable of transporting heavy arms has been in
Lusaka, capital of Zambia, the east neighbor of Angola, for five
days.
</P>
<P>
The crew members of the plane, now detained by the Zambian
government, were found living in a hotel in Lusaka, according to
Angop.
</P>
<P>
The private aircraft was rented by somebody with an aim to rush
arms for Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel UNITA, said Angop.
</P>
<P>
But the previous reports said that the plane belongs to Kenyan
company "Meridien Air Nairobi" and came from Banqui, capital of
the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Embargos on military and petroliferous materials, prohibition
of journey abroad, closing representative institutions in other
countries, financial sanctions and the interdiction of diamond
export are included in the sanctions against UNITA imposed by the
Security Council of the United Nations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the Security Council, any individuals,
institutions or countries violating the sanctions will be taken to
the tribunal.

<HEADLINE> UPU Emphasizes Potential of Direct Mail Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Direct mail will become a major
factor in postal business to offset the impact of competition from
electronic communications, Director General of the International
Bureau of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) Thomas Leavey said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the first World Conference on Direct
Mail which was part of the on-going 22nd Universal Postal Congress
(UPC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Direct mail is an important methods of communications between
businesses and consumers and mail advertisements are just one kind
of direct mail. As postal services around the world are suffering
loss of business volume due to the competition of electronic
alternatives, the volume and revenue of direct mail has been
growing steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, direct mail generated nearly 430 billion U.S. dollars
worth of sales revenue and created more than 24 million jobs in
the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
Leavey said that direct mail is the biggest potential growth
area in the postal market and that its growth will not only
promote postal services per se, but also increase the volume and
revenues of a wide range of industries, including advertising,
printing, data bases, distribution, retail and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole industry out there that stands to benefit,"
he said, adding that postal organizations should strengthen
cooperation with related industries in the direct mail market.
</P>
<P>
The World Conference on Direct Mail has brought together
representatives from postal administrations, operators and
business partners. It will develop a Direct Mail Market
Development Program in order to build a strong partnership between
postal enterprises and strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
An official from China's State Postal Bureau (SPB) said at the
conference that direct mail service in the country is less
developed than in some other countries. Direct mail accounts for
only 20 percent of the total volume of China's mail services which
account for 11 percent of the country's postal revenue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that spending on advertisements through direct mail
was a negligible part of the total sales of the country's
advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the rapid economic growth of China has
provided much room for the development of direct mail market. By
the year 2005, direct mail will become the fifth greatest means of
advertising in China, following radio, TV, press and out door
advertisements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPB has already set up the China Postal Advertising Company.
Meanwhile, postal administrations in 24 provinces in the country
have also set up direct mail companies. All capital cities of
provinces in the country will set up a direct mail production
center in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The SPB official said that China will target two groups of
customers in developing direct mail services. One is large
enterprise groups, and the other is Chinese and international
brand and postal sales companies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement World's Biggest Coastal Reclamation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's coastal
reclamation project in the northern state of Kedah, reportedly
the biggest in the world, is ready to take off as it has been
given Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval by the
Department of Environment, Kedah Chief Minister Sanusi Junid said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The privatized reclamation project could be implemented anytime
now depending on the capability of the developers concerned, he
said in Alor Setar, the state capital, according to Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The project approved by the federal government in June 1997 was
held back by the economic downturn and also because its macro EIA
studies had not been approved yet.
</P>
<P>
The coastal reclamation project at a proposed cost of 30
billion ringgit (7.894 billion U.S. dollars) will involve 20,390
hectares of coastal areas facing Malacca Strait covering a
110-kilometer stretch from Kuala Sanglang to Kuala Muda of the
state.
</P>
<P>
Among the developments slated under the project to be
implemented in two phases are the Northern Region International
Airport, an industrial area, a port, a power generating station,
housing facilities, resorts and recreational centers.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to be implemented through packages and the key
developers listed include Samudera Baru Darul Aman, Sayak Beach
and SKS Venture.
</P>
<P>
"We will maintain the developers which have been selected and
others which are interested in the project are encouraged to send
their quotations to the state government," the chief minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the state government had received quotations from
Japanese and European companies which were keen to rent out or
sell machinery for the project.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Calls for "Six Plus Two" Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban opposition
alliance Tuesday called for the involvement of "Six plus Two"
group in seeking settlement of the Afghan issue, saying Pakistan
could not be viewed as "an impartial broker".
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for Pakistan to undertake such a project
alone when it can be implemented under the auspices of the 'Six
plus Two' group of nations," Hussain Anwari, member of the
opposition alliance said in a statement from Tajikistan received
here.
</P>
<P>
"The United Front delegation once again declared its support to
the 'Six plus Two' (Afghanistan's six immediately neighbors plus
Russia and the United States) initiative," Anwari said.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani delegation led by Secretary of the Interior
Ministry Rustam Shah traveled to Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan,
Monday for the second round of talks with representatives of the
anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation held talks with the anti-Taliban
alliance in Dushanbe last week. The same team went to Kandahar,
headquarters of the Taliban, last Saturday to brief the Taliban
leaders of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani team presented a new proposal to the opposition
alliance during the second round of talks in Dushanbe saying the
proposal will be presented to the Alliance Supreme Leadership
Council in the coming days, according to Anwari.
</P>
<P>
The final decision will rest with the Alliance Supreme
Leadership Council, said Anwari. He, however, did not give any
details of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from Kabul quoted anti-Taliban spokesman
Abdullah as saying, "The talks (between Pakistan and the
alliance) failed because the Pakistanis did not offer anything
new, nor could they prove in practice that they were impartial
peace mediators."
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition alliance would not hold further
talks with Pakistan until it took practical steps to end its
"military" support to the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the shortcut to peace in Afghanistan is
cessation of Pakistani aid to the Taliban and despatch of
reinforcements of troops and volunteers to our country," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has dismissed the allegations by the
anti-Taliban opposition as "malicious and baseless".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which launched its latest peace initiative last week,
said the aim of its renewed peace efforts was to help the warring
Afghan factions engage in negotiations to restore peace to
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Internet Commerce Procurement Application Market to Explode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide Internet
commerce procurement applications market, now still in its infancy,
will explode in the next few years, according to a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the U.S. research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC) said that the market reached 147 million U.S.
dollars in 1998 and blistering growth will drive revenues to 5.3
billion dollars as soon as 2003.
</P>
<P>
The IDC estimates the number of users of the applications will
increase from 600,000 in 1999 to 250 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, Visio, a Seattle-based software vendor,
started using a Web-based procurement system only a year ago, and
its processing cost has already plummeted from 113 dollars per
purchase order to just six dollars.
</P>
<P>
After surveying the top 40 Internet commerce procurement
vendors and more than 75 end-user organizations that have
implemented their products, the IDC concluded that worldwide
businesses running these Web-based procurement applications are
projected to generate savings of up to 103 billion dollars on
transitions totaling 1.375 trillion dollars by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Museveni: Uganda, Rwanda Not Fighting for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that the recent clashes between Ugandan and
Rwandan troops in the Congolese city of Kisangani were not fought
for the control of the city as previous reports had said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the government's daily New Vision, which reached
here Tuesday morning, Museveni explained that there was no
full-scale battle in Kisangani, the third largest city of the
Democratic Republic of the COngo.
</P>
<P>
"There was no battle for Kisangani; but there were armed
clashes in Kisangani. These clashes were mainly in the center of
Kisangani. The street battles in Kisangani could not have been for
the control of Kisangani in a military sense," he said in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, it was not for the control of Kisangani because to
do so, you do not need to control buildings in the center of town
but to control the two airports, the river transport and the roads
into and out of Kisangani," the 54-year-old president added.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the clashes in Kisangani between the
two allies could have developed into the battle for Kisangani
unless a cease-fire had been reached in time.
</P>
<P>
He said Ugandan troops in the city were to provide protection
for rebel leader Wamba dia Wamba and to ensure the verification
exercise by South African and Zambian ministers.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan troops, who were lightly armed and had little
ammunition as they were not deployed for battle, were attacked by
sizeable Rwandan force operating in the city, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day clashes between the two armed forces in Kisangani,
which started on August 14, had led to a loss of over 200 lives
and more injuries.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul
Kagame met in western Uganda last Tuesday to hammer out a
cease-fire to prevent the escalation of the clashes.

NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph
Kamotho has accused developed countries of failing to abide by the
agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Tuesday quoted Kamotho as
saying that Kenya has opened its markets like some other African
countries, and developed countries should reciprocate this gesture
by opening further their markets.
</P>

"WTO agreements having been in existence for four and a half
years, developing countries have not achieved any meaningful

</P>
<P>
Kamotho noted that the implementation of the Uruguay Round of
WTO agreements have posed serious challenges to developing
countries because their needs, wishes and limits were not taken
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Due to huge external debts and reduced international aid, WTO
must start focusing on the constraints of developing countries,
the minister said.

He also called for technical assistance in capacity building,
product management and infrastructure from developed world.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Declines Against Other Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling has lost
ground significantly against the major currencies due to changes
at the international market and a slight rise in demand for
foreign exchange at the local market.
</P>
<P>
Compared to last week's trading, the shilling turned weaker
Monday, in some instances weakening with more than one shilling
against the sterling pound, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The shilling lost 14 cents against the U.S. dollar to stand at
74.49 shillings Monday from 74.35 shillings last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Against the British pound, it shed 1.23 shillings to stand at
120.46 shillings from last Thursday's closing of 119.30 shillings.
As a result, the shilling has breached the mark of 120 shillings,
the first such breach to the pound in a long time.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said that there was no link between the decline
of the shilling and the change of the minister in Kenya's Ministry
of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that there was no cause for alarm, saying
the fall of the shilling was associated with cross-currency
changes at the international market and a slight rise in demand
for foreign exchange at the local market.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia police service is
understaffed by at least 14,000 officers, making it difficult for
the service to combat the escalating crimes, according to Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted police spokesman Alex Chilufya as saying
Monday that with the Zambian population of about 10 million there
is need to have a minimal number of 27,000 policemen.
</P>
<P>
Currently there is only 13,000 policemen and women, which means
that one officer caters for about 730 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chilufya said it is important to recruit more policemen if the
crime is to be curbed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the police service is facing some other
major hurdles like lack of transport, which makes it difficult to
follow up any reports.
</P>
<P>
The police command of the country has set a deliberate policy
to reach the 27,000 establishment by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police also needs modern and effective communication
equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the government to definitely look into the
plight of the policemen because their current conditions of
service leave much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
The crime cases such as armed robberies have been increasing in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a group of gunmen snatched 248,000
U.S. dollars last week from seven foreign tourists about 100
kilometers southeast of Lusaka in broad daylight.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Allow 10,000 More Palestinian laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- As another conciliatory
gesture towards the Palestinians, the Israeli government has
decided to allow 10,000 more Palestinian laborers into the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Prime Minister Ehud Barak adopted the
recommendation by Israel's coordinator in the Palestinian areas
and security facilities.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator recommends the government loosen the age
restriction for Arab laborers entering Israel and increase the
quota of Arab businessmen entering Israel or traveling between the
West Bank and Gaza, the local daily Jerusalem Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, Arab workers without security violation
records will be allowed to enter Israel if they are married and at
the age of 21 or above. Previously, only those married workers who
are at the age of 23 or above could be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to increase the number of Arab workers
entering Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to some 80,000,
compared with the previous 70,000. The number of Palestinian
merchants allowed to enter Israel or to travel between West Bank
and Gaza increased by about 5,000, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to allow hundreds of Gaza
residents above 44 years old to worship at the Al-Aqsa Mosque
complex in the Arab East Jerusalem on Fridays. The number of
family unification permits was also increased, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Ministry said these steps were aimed at
improving economic and social conditions of the Palestinians and
also in line with the government's policy to reduce the number of
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
The new decision came a week after Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh of the Labor Party said that Israel would increase
the number of work permits given to Palestinian laborers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry believes the country's security can be enhanced if
more Palestinians are earning livelihoods from jobs in Israel, the
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli defense officials, about 17 percent of
employed Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza work in Israel,
but they earn over 40 percent of the total income in the areas.
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, the moderate Israeli government has
taken several goodwill gesture towards the Palestinians, including
opening a main street closed five years ago in the West Bank
city of Hebron and releasing a long-held Palestinian prisoner.
</P>
<P>
In their talks Monday, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
also reached an overdue deal on the construction of a seaport in
Gaza and the opening of a "safe passage" between Gaza and the
West Bank, which will help improve the economic situation in the
Palestinian areas.

NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations official has
said that he was very much interested in reconciliation and the
effort of the Rwandan government to have all its refugees back and
reintegrated, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Albert Alain Peters, director of Africa Bureau of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who arrived in
Kigali Monday on a three-day working visit to Rwanda, said his
current tour of Rwanda is "a follow-up to Commissioner Sadako
Ogata's visit this June", RNA has learnt from the UNHCR office in

<HEADLINE> Israel's Industrial Production Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel's industrial production
during the first half of this year fell by 2.8 percent compared to
the previous six months, according to a report issued by the
Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Israel left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 11.5 percent when it Monday announced the monetary
policy for September, saying it is necessary to keep the inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production figure, based on preliminary figures,
declined by 0.8 percent compared with the first half of 1998. The
number of salaried workers and work hours were down 2.5 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the quarterly figures showed that the economy might be
rebounding from the bottom of a slump. While the industrial
production in the first quarter declined by 2 percent, the second
quarter saw a 1 percent increase, both in comparison with the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in the second quarter, Bank of Israel Governor
Jacob Frenkel announced Monday that he would keep interest rates
unchanged in September. Central bank officials said that the
decision stemmed from a need to temper inflation.
</P>
<P>
Twelve-month inflation is expected to reache about 5.4
percent, higher than the 3-4 percent target the government set for
the next two years.
</P>

Prospects of a rate cut weakened after the consumer price index
rose by 0.3 percent in July, higher than expected. The Bank of
Israel was also concerned that declining interest rates would
further weaken the Israeli currency shekel, which dropped to a
nearly nine-month low against the dollar this month.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators reached an agreement in
principle Monday on two thorny issues: the opening of the safe
passage route between the Gaza Strip and the Hebron area and the
beginning of construction of the Gaza port. The agreement shows
that differences over Wye implementation are being narrowed.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli sources in the Prime Minister's Office said the
deal on the safe passage and Gaza port was still contingent on
reaching agreement on the two key issues outstanding between the
Israeli and Palestinian sides: the timing of the final interim
withdrawal from the West Bank and the release of Palestinian
prisoners. However, both sides indicate that they expect a deal to
be struck in time for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
visit in early September.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- If there is no breakdown in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, a ceremony for the opening of talks on permanent
agreement will be held in Cairo on September 2, with the
participation of Albright, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Jordan's King Abudullah.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot:
</P>
<P>
-- Education Minister Yossi Sarid said he would not agree to
additional cut in the 2000 budget. The teacher's union threatened
to stage a strike if the budget for education is cut and demanded
a written commitment from the government before September 1 that
education budget would not be harmed.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Two States" Remark Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to the Museum of
Historical Data on Li Zongren, located in Zaozhuang City in east
China's Shandong Province, have expressed indignation at the
recent "two states" remark by Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Most have written their criticism in the guest book,
complaining of Lee's separatist statement and praising Li Zongren'
s patriotism as a former general of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yousong, Li's widow, said that her late husband's beliefs
oppose Lee's remark and that no Chinese would agree with him.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that when Li was critically ill, he wrote to the late
Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, saying that the people
of Taiwan would only have a bright future if Taiwan returned to
the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan visitor, surnamed Hui, said that all Chinese should
learn from Li Zongren and make efforts to assist the reunification
of the motherland as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong visitor named Zheng said that the reunification of
the motherland is the common desire of all Chinese on both sides
of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Li Zongren successfully commanded the Battle of Taierzhuang
against Japanese invaders in 1938 at Taierzhuang, a location of
strategic importance in Zaozhuang.
</P>
<P>
Li was elected vice-president under the Kuomintang rule in 1948.
He returned to Beijing in 1965 and issued a statement promising to
devote his life to the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The museum opened in April and has received hundreds of
visitors daily.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Panda Has Two Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda in Beijing Zoo
gave birth to two cubs on Monday only a week after a giant panda
in southwest Sichuan province had triplets.
</P>
<P>
Known as "Yong Yong" the 18 year old has previously given birth
to nine cubs, including three sets of twins.
</P>
<P>
Panda breeders say that the first cub was born at 5:00 pm and
the second at 8:00 pm yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Because a giant panda can only suckle one cub during her
lactation, the breeders and zoo keepers have to feed the cubs with
milk by turns.
</P>
<P>
"Yong Yong" is actually considered to be quite old even though
a panda's life expectancy is usually 36 years. Zoo keepers,
therefore, took great care of her when she was pregnant. Now she
is in good health.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is an endangered species with only 1,000 living
in the wild in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, 58 pandas have been born in Beijing zoo which currently
has 19 pandas in captivity.

<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
told visiting Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan and head of state of
Brunei Darussalam, that he will attend the third informal meeting
between leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN) and leaders from China, Japan and the Republic of Korea,
scheduled to be held in Manila, Philippines, in November.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in a meeting with Brunei Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attached importance to its cooperation with
ASEAN member states and such cooperation had witnessed rapid
progress and a good momentum. He also said that mutual
understanding and trust had been enhanced thanks to the ever
frequent contacts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The informal meeting is a good mechanism and a creative move
for concerned countries to develop cooperation for common growth,"
he said, adding that it also plays an important role in
strengthening mutual understanding and trust and cooperation
between countries and in promoting regional stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to make more efforts to ensure the success of
this informal meeting and cooperation throughout the whole East
Asia region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Discussing Chinese-Brunei relationship, Zhu said that he
believed the Sultan's visit will give an impetus to the growth of
bilateral friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, which was published Monday, delineated
the framework for future cooperation and reflected the consensus
of the two country's highest leaders, according to Zhu. "The
Chinese government will make every effort to implement the goals
set out in the document," he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that there is great potential yet to be tapped
between China and Brunei in economic and trade cooperation. "
Brunei boasts rich resources and China has the willingness to
expand its cooperation in all fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brunei's Sultan told Zhu that he was impressed by China's
achievements made in economic growth in this second China trip.
Compared to what he saw in 1993, China has obviously enjoyed even
greater development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for China's efforts in expanding
friendly relations with ASEAN and extended congratulations to the
Chinese government and people for the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.

<P>
It says Lee's "two states" statement fully demonstrates that he
is a trouble-maker and an obstacle to safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the sovereign states and the
international community believe that there is only one China, and
that Taiwan is a part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
When the People's Republic of China was founded 50 years ago,
even some forces hostile to China did not deny the fact that both
sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one country, and this truth
cannot be changed by any anti-China forces and separatist
activities, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
China is an important country in the Asia-Pacific region as
well as a major force for protecting peace and promoting
development in the region. The stability between both sides of the
Straits and a good cross-Straits relation are closely connected to
the overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful reunification of the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits is the common goal of the whole Chinese nation. The
Chinese Government has repeated that it is in the best interest of
Chinese people, including Taiwanese compatriots, to settle the
Taiwan issue according to the principle of peaceful reunification
and "one China, two systems," the article says.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure its territorial integrity and sovereignty,
China does not rule out the use of military force to settle the
problem, which is the right of any sovereign state, the article
points out.

<HEADLINE> Law Amendments to Combat Worsening Air Pollution in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature
is considering new dramatic changes to the law on the control of
air pollution, despite the fact that it was only revised three
years ago, in a bid to tackle the foul air which is affecting
people's health and the country's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Draft amendments tabled today suggest banning the discharge
of air pollutants beyond a certain level and imposing heavy fines
for those who contravene the regulations," Qu Geping, chairman of
the Environment and Resources Protection Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), told lawmakers of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Such changes mark a noticeable change from the existing
practice that allows the discharge of pollutants with only small
fines even if they exceed the legal limits.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments also target car emissions and dust from
construction sites which are slowly poisoning city dwellers,
causing respiratory problems and affecting people's eyesight on
dry days.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 21 million tons of sulfur
dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere in China, in addition to
14 million tons of smoke-filled dust along with 13 million tons of
powder-like particles as a result of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the most polluted countries in the world,"
Qu said, citing a World Health Organization (WHO) report which
pointed out that of the world's 10 most polluted cities, seven are
in China.
</P>
<P>
The foul air has caused public outcry from among the people
of all walks of life, and it is quite usual for Chinese
legislators to consider new changes to a law that was just amended
three years ago, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> "Two States" Remarks Threaten Peace in Asia-Pacific Region: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's stand on the matter has won the respect of the
countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The article says that denying the one China principle and
separating Taiwan from China would damage the peace and stability
in the Taiwan Straits as well as in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government is determined and able to protect its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
Hegemony recently has taken a new role on the world stage, and
a new attitude of intervention has reared its head. But any force
in the world would have to consider the cost and risk it would
face should it interfere with the Taiwan issue, which is China's
domestic business.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian countries are now seeing a glimmer of economic
recovery after suffering a two-year financial crisis. Therefore
they prefer a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific environment which
would hasten the economic recovery and sustainable development,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
It says that with the resistance of people in both China and
the Asia-Pacific region, Lee Teng-hui's separatist scheme to
damage the Taiwan people's interests and the peace of the Asia-
Pacific region is bound to fail.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China made public today a set of
new policies in a bid to strengthen the country's technological
innovation and industrialization of new and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the
State Council jointly issued a decision on the policies, noting
that new and high technologies are vital to the maintenance of
national sovereignty and economic security.
</P>
<P>
To enhance technological innovation and develop hi-tech will
help not only to solve the deep-rooted problems hindering the
development of the Chinese economy, but also to upgrade the entire
performance of the national economy and the overall strength of
the country, the document says.

<P>
Statistics show that 70 percent of the 300 Chinese cities
under environmental surveillance are graded at "level three" or
beyond of the established pollutant standards for their air
quality which concerns Chinese officials as "level 2" is
internationally recognized as just about "suitable for human
existence".
</P>
<P>
"To achieve the results required by the legislation will be
a costly exercise," Qu said, pointing out that in the next 10
years, 180 billion yuan ( 21.77 billion US dollars) will be needed
to free 175 cities from the acid rain and nearly 150 billion yuan
(18 billion US dollars) for cleaning up the haze which affects 47
major cities.
</P>
<P>
Over the next ten years China also needs to spend 0.3
percent to 0.7 percent the value of its gross national product to
install mufflers in various industrial and social sectors. "
Meanwhile, urban real estate developers will have to spend 0.15
to 0.35 percent more on their projects to keep dust particles from
floating through the streets," Qu added.
</P>
<P>
"However," he claimed, " if this money is well spent the
benefits will be enormous. "
</P>
<P>
The discharge of major pollutants should decrease year by
year after controls are imposed and the air quality in major
cities is likely to improve significantly, he said. "The public
will be more than pleased if the amendment is adopted and enforced.
"
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the economic benefits generated by green
industries, people will be able to see a clear blue sky and
breathe fresh air and spend much less time seeing doctors," Qu
told the lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature to Review Nine Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative
body, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (
NPC), opened its week-long session here today with nine
legislative bills scheduled for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided
over today's opening meeting.
</P>
<P>
A draft amendment to the Personal Income Tax Law, proposed
by the State Council and tabled at today's meeting, suggests that
the words "interest from deposits and savings" be deleted from
items listed for exemption from personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng told the lawmakers that
the measure is intended to stimulate domestic consumption and
invigorate the slack market demand. A vote will be taken when the
legislative session concludes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The draft laws on solely-funded enterprises and public
bidding, which drew close attention of personalities from the
economic circles and were presented for further review today, are
also expected to be adopted during this session.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts say that the legislation for private
businesses will be of great significance to the Chinese economy,
just as significant as the late veteran leader Deng Xiaoping's
policy of household responsibility system was to the country's
vast rural reform of the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Three other bills were submitted today: the draft
regulations on supervision over major legal cases in adjudication
and prosecution work; draft amendments to the air pollution
prevention law; and a draft law on the ad hoc procedures of
maritime lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, draft laws on maritime environment, weather
services, and accountancy, which had been deliberated on and
revised earlier, were again presented to the lawmakers for
further deliberation.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda adopted today, another bill set
forth by the State Council proposing an increase of national debt
for fixed-asset investment and an adjustment to the central
government's budget will be explained to the lawmakers on Saturday
and ready for a vote by Monday.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adding details China Introduces New Polices to Improve Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New policies aimed at boosting
China's technological strength were announced today by the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
A jointly issued decision pointed out that technological
innovation, high-tech development and industrialization of new and
high technologies will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that new and high technologies are vital to
safeguarding the national sovereignty and the country's future
economic security.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that development of the sector will help solve some
of the deep-rooted problems of the Chinese economic development
and upgrade the entire quality of the national economy and the
overall strength of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to move on from actual structural reforms,
activate existing scientific and technological resources,
intensify market-oriented research and development, and vigorously
promote the use of hi-tech and applicable technologies so as to
effectively turn scientific achievements into competitive products,
the decision noted.
</P>
<P>
The new policies, which deal with 15 items in four areas, call
for more efforts to transform most scientific resources into
market oriented projects, deepen economic, scientific and
educational reforms and improve scientific legislation.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to open further to the outside world, to
collaborate and exchange with other countries, and achieve
development through competition, the policy document lays down.
</P>
<P>
It also outlines how the state is to take measures to ensure
enterprises play a major role in technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing the construction of state-level hi-tech development
zones, supporting the development of private scientific businesses
and giving more incentives to service agencies in the field are
further important aspects of the new policies.
</P>
<P>
China will also improve the management of its scientific talent,
improve the status and financial rewards for a range of national
awards and intensify the protection of intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
Party and government departments at all levels are urged to
fully recognize the necessity for these important policy changes
and developments.

<HEADLINE> NPC Cracks Down On Public Bidding Loopholes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to curb shoddy
construction projects, China's highest legislative body, the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, plans to
revise the relevant law affecting the building sector.
</P>
<P>
A new draft of the Law for Inviting and Submitting Tenders has
been submitted for review to the eleventh meeting of the Ninth NPC
Standing Committee, which opened here today, to regulate public
bidding.
</P>
<P>
"Parts of the law have been changed in a bid to halt
corruption which arises in the course of public bidding," said Gu
Angran, vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee, who explained the
proposed amendment to the NPC Standing Committee members.
Malpractice and low transparency in inviting and submitting
tenders are blamed as a major cause of poor quality construction
in China.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that all large scale infrastructure and
public projects which are thoroughly or partially funded by the
state, international organizations or foreign government loans
have to undergo public bidding which will cover the survey and the
design and the construction of projects, as well as quality
inspection and purchase of major equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials will be prohibited from interfering
with the bidding. They will face disciplinary action such as
demotion or dismissal if they contravene the rules.
</P>
<P>
The draft also highlights the responsibilities of bidding board
members and outlines the penalties for offenders, such as the
confiscation of bribes and incorporating fines as high as 500,000
yuan (60,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that the draft law will be probably approved at this
current meeting since it has twice undergone revision and its
feasibility confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Legislature to Supervise Major Misjudged Legal Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- In a move to curb judicial
corruption, the National People's Congress, China's highest
legislative body, may give itself and local legislative bodies
jurisdiction over major legal cases which have been improperly
handled.
</P>
<P>
A provisional draft on related regulations has been submitted
to the ongoing session of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The new supervisory powers cover the major misjudged cases and
illegal activities of judges and law enforcement officers, which "
have tremendous negative impact on society and were not solved on
time," Hou Zongbin, chairman of the Civil and Legal Committee
under the NPC, explained to the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Violators are subject to severe punishment, including recall,
and serious cases will be "investigated and prosecuted for their
criminal liability according to law," the draft said.
</P>
<P>
The draft regulations also stressed that the supervision must
be exercised by the legislature as a group and not by individuals,
and jurisdiction must never be used to interfere with the
legitimate, independent rights and normal operation of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Judicial supervision greatly concerns the general public, and
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, always attaches
great importance to it, Hou Zongbin said. He added that the draft
will create foundations for the formulation of a "supervision law.
"
</P>
<P>
The draft was formulated by the Civil and Legal Committee in
accordance with direct instructions issued by the NPC Standing
Committee, and based on wide-range investigation and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the fight against judicial corruption needs both an
internal supervision system handled by judiciary bodies and the
outside supervision of legislatures.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years legislatures have managed to correct some
misjudged cases, which has helped to promote justice, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Formulates Action Plan for Mariculture Industry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has formulated an
action plan to ensure the proper and sustainable development of
the mariculture industry, a senior official of the Fisheries
Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan advocates the concept of aquaculture development areas
under the greater context of coastal zone management, Mohamed
Mazlan Jusoh, director-general of the Fisheries Department, said
at a conference on mariculture and the environment here.
</P>
<P>
Marine-based aquaculture activities have been regulated through
the Mariculture Regulation 1990 and the Fisheries Department has
recently drafted a comprehensive set of Aquaculture Regulation
covering both land and water based activities.
</P>
<P>
Three different codes of practice for shrimp farming, marine
fish culture in cages and fish hatcheries have been developed to
serve as guideline for mariculturists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suitable areas are identified and allocated for aquaculture use
while the Fisheries Department avoided mangrove clearings for
shrimp farming, especially in peninsular Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Unproductive agricultural land with access to brackishwater or
seawater and coastal belt with no mangroves are presently the
preferred sites for shrimp farming development, Mazlan said.
</P>
<P>
He said technical development would need to be balanced by
environmental considerations and this would require the legal
framework to achieve the ideal blend for sustainability.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Demobilize 2,000 Soldiers in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 2,000 soldiers will
be demobilized later this year for the start of an effort to
eventually reintegrate 40 percent of Cambodia's total military
personnel into local communities, according to Tuesday's Rasmei
Kampuchea (Light of Cambodia).
</P>
<P>
The government is conducting a nationwide registration of
soldiers for the purpose of creating a real registration system by
eliminating ghost soldiers and of demobilizing a total of 55,000
soldiers by year 2003 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The effort, directly tied to the money received from donor
countries, is being coordinated by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The pilot demobilization will begin in December and the
demobilized soldiers and their families will be reintegrated into
communities of their choosing in Kampot province.
</P>
<P>
All will be given a one-year transitional period provided with
money, food, shelter and educational and vocational training. Job
counseling and placement will follow a soldier's settling down in
a community, and local authorities will be in charge of providing
land, according to World Bank officials.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the pilot demobilization project will cost
roughly 4 million U.S. dollars while the full-scale project will
cost 100 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi Differ on Definition of Duty-free Access Products: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Ministry has handed
over a list of 25 Bangladeshi products to India for consideration
of their duty-free access to the Indian market, but there seems to
be divergence of views on the products list, an English newspaper
here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The list, which was handed over to the Indian High Commission
in Dhaka last week, has been passed on to New Delhi for
examination, The Independent daily said.
</P>
<P>
During official talks in New Delhi in May this year, Indian
Commerce Minister R.K. Hedge assured his Bangladeshi counterpart
Tofail Ahmed that the Indian government would seriously consider
to allow duty-free access to 25 export products of Bangladesh to
help reduce the bilateral trade imbalance which is heavily in
favor of India.
</P>
<P>
While the Bangladeshi side maintained the definitions of a
product with its wider application, the Indian side was reportedly
taking a narrow view on it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commission officials in Dhaka had indicated that to
them the 25 products meant only 25 export items, a view also
shared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, a source said.
</P>
<P>
By 25 products, Bangladesh meant 25 broad categories of
products, each of which could have many individual items under it.
The products list that Bangladesh handed over to India had roughly
more than 200 items, belonging to 25 broad categories of products.
</P>
<P>
Given the volume of trade imbalance and the wide range of
Indian export to Bangladesh running up to thousands of items, the
offer of zero tariff to only 25 items as indicated by the Indian
side hardly makes any sense, the source said.
</P>
<P>
India should not take a narrow view of the list and should show
goodwill to Bangladesh at a time when the government in Dhaka was
taking a greater risk while considering opening of transshipment
facility to India through Bangladesh, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed declined to comment on the
divergence of views on the products list, saying he would not lend
credence to speculations.
</P>
<P>
The list of the 25 products includes artificial flower, ceramic
products, cosmetics and toiletries, electrical goods, electrical
cables and wires, furniture, jute and jute goods, knitwear,
leather products, plastic products, pharmaceutical products,
prepared food, tea, textile fabrics, and woven ready-made
garments.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh imports from India stood at 755 million U.S. dollars
during the 1997-98 fiscal year, while its exports to that country
were valued at 50 million dollars only, resulting in a huge trade
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception Marks Sino-Brazilian Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) held a reception
here today to mark the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
Sino-Brazilian diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), was among those present at the
reception.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said at the occasion that the two
countries have enjoyed fruitful cooperation in political, economic,
cultural, educational areas since the forging of diplomatic ties
25 years ago, and bilateral ties have developed in an all-round
and smooth manner.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the fact that China and Brazil established a
strategic partnership in 1993, saying that these two important,
developing countries are economically complementary, thus there
exists enormous potential and broad prospect for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qi expressed the conviction that through joint efforts, a
comprehensive and cooperative relationship between the two
countries will continue to grow in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian ambassador to China Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said
at the occasion that there is a solid foundation for the growth of
bilateral ties, and confirmed that the two countries have not only
cooperated in political and trade aspects, but have also a number
of proposals for safeguarding a just and peaceful international
order.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Brazilian cooperation in the space sector has
served as a good model for cooperation between developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Penalties Towards Dishonest Accountants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Accountants jailed for drawing
up false returns will be banned from re-entering the profession in
China, according to the draft accountancy law submitted to the
current session of the top legislature today for review.
</P>
<P>
Others whose certificates are revoked for breaking professional
ethics, including forging accounts, embezzling or misappropriating
company funds, but not yet punishable by the criminal law, will be
barred from practicing for at least five years, the draft
amendment stipulates.
</P>
<P>
These revisions have been introduced to curb the practices of
forging statistics to evade taxes, defraud banks of loans and
cheating the government, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts, in the past quite a few companies
in China, as worldwide, used to maintain two sets of accounts: one
depicting actual turnover and figures and another for taxation
purposes. But today, some have been found to have up to four or
five.
</P>
<P>
However, most false accounts are compiled at the instruction or
instigation of managers or other executive officials, the
lawmakers pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To counter the situation, the draft law has included
administrative penalties for officials responsible and stipulates
that those whose deeds constitute a crime will be punished
according to the criminal code.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Dismisses Charges of Aid Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Health Minister Osman
Durmus, who has been under fire in the last two days for
allegedly turning down foreign aid to the earthquake-hit victims,
said Tuesday that his earlier statements had been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
Some Turkish and foreign media reported that Durmus had told
health teams from the United States, Sweden, Romania and Greece on
Sunday that "we don't need any help."
</P>
<P>
"We're asking our hospitals to work under normal conditions
starting on Monday, because they are not overburdened," the
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This alleged statement has drew strong criticism from the
Turkish public as well as officials. Some have asked for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
After a cabinet meeting on Monday, Durmus told reporters that
his earlier statements had been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
"We need health equipment but not medicine. The foreign aid to
Turkey must be provided according to the needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said embassies of foreign countries which
had dispatched rescue and medical teams to Turkey had told local
press that aid workers from their countries had been warmly
greeted by Turkish government officials.
</P>
<P>
The health minister also denied that there had been any
outbreaks of epidemics in the quake-stricken northwestern Turkish
regions, where over 14,000 people had been confirmed dead so far
in the 7.4-degree quake that occurred at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT)
on August 17.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an outbreak of epidemic has been one of the
major concerns of the authorities since the pre-dawn killer
quake. A heavy rain soaking parts of the quake-hit regions Monday
aggravated their concerns.
</P>
<P>
Health officials are grappling with ways to block possible
spread of diseases like typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Officials had sprayed disinfectants over stricken areas, dusted
purifying lime on rubble, roads and cemeteries while water
purification tablets had been distributed in some regions.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Better Off After 10 years in APEC: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said New Zealanders "are much better off as a result
of a more open and competitive economy."
</P>
<P>
She said this Tuesday when launching at the Parliament Building
the publication "APEC - 10 Years and Beyond", which contains a
collection of views from 10 prominent academics and business
people from around the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The authors, Prime Minister Shipley said, offer clearly the
view that "APEC is a force for the good of the region".
</P>
<P>
Shipley said statistics in the publication show that at the end
of 1997, New Zealand's economy (GDP) was worth 65 billion U.S.
dollars, compared with 44 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1989,
 when the APEC was established.
</P>
<P>
Per capita, she continued, New Zealand's GDP was 17,317 U.S.
dollars at the end of 1997, compared with 13,213 U.S. dollars at
the end of 1989.
</P>
<P>
In the area of tariffs, Shipley said, substantial reductions
are occurring across the region. For example, she added, China's
tariffs have fallen by 57 percent on average, while the Republic
of Korea and Malaysia's have reduced by 59 and 43 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the importance of the Asia Pacific region to her
country, Shipley said: "70 percent of New Zealand's exports go to
the APEC region, and 70 percent of its imports are sourced from
the Asia Pacific. APEC economies also send New Zealand 70 percent
of its tourists. The jobs and well-being of New Zealanders are
inextricably linked with the Asia Pacific, and the health and
stability of the economies of the region. It is absolutely vital
for a small trading nation like New Zealand to engage with a
process like APEC."
</P>
<P>
Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand, will be the venue
for this year's Informal Meeting of APEC Leaders, which is
scheduled for September.

head of state of Brunei, left here for Xiamen, a coastal city in
east China's Fujian Province, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, the Sultan held talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, in which the two heads of state exchanged
views on bilateral ties, and regional and international issues of
common concern. Following the talks, the two countries issued a
joint communique to delineate the framework for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Sultan met with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji this morning to

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Bank to Treble Fee for ATM Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bank customers in New Zealand
can expect big rises in fees for using automatic teller machines
(ATM).
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Tuesday quoted an announcement of WestpacTrust,
New Zealand's biggest bank, as saying the bank would more than
treble ATM charges for its customers who use rival bank machines
from the present 25 cents of the NZ dollar (13.3 U.S. cents) to 85
cents of the NZ dollar (45 U.S. cents) in October.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said it is likely other banks
would follow suit with similar fees to protest the use of their
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
"The move is seen by other banks as possibly the first salvo in
a war for automatic teller machine use," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that WestpacTrust will also in October
increase fees for electronic transactions by 10 cents (5.3 U.S.
cents) to 35 cents (18.6 U.S. cents) and over-the-counter
transactions on check accounts from 50 cents (26.5 U.S. cents) to
65 cents (34.5 U.S. cents).

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Increase Police Presence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is sending its
extra military and police staff to East Timor, and its army is
preparing armored personnel carriers which may be sent later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Tuesday quoted New Zealand Foreign Minister
Don McKinnon as saying that more military officers and police
would be sent following next Monday's ballot on East Timor's
future.
</P>
<P>
Five Defense Force military liaison officers and 10 civilian
police officers are now serving with a large UN contingent in East
Timor, according to the Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon was quoted as saying that a transition period of some
months will occur before the Indonesian Parliament can give
constitutional effect to the outcome of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
During this time, New Zealand will double to 10 the number of
military liaison officers in East Timor and increase the number of
civilian police officers to 15, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The UN plans to increase the civilian police force from about
280 to 460 and boost the number of military liaison officers from
50 to 300, according to him.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said big hurdles remain, such as persuading all
parties to accept the ballot result without resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
He urged Indonesia to redouble its efforts to ensure security
and calm in the post-ballot period.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Review Agreements With Foreign Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine civil aviation
authority has ordered a review of the nation's agreements with
foreign airlines in a bid to protect interests of the Philippine
Airlines (PAL), Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the lopsided
air agreements entered between the Philippines and at least 38
foreign airlines stalled the rehabilitation program of the PAL and
cut its revenues drastically.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted CAB Executive Director Guia Martinez as saying
that of these 38 agreements, at least 11 have been confirmed to be
gravely disadvantageous to PAL.
</P>
<P>
She said as a result of these lopsided agreements, PAL lost
hundreds of millions of pesos.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that from 1993 to 1998, CAB took
unilateral action that damaged the national interest and
contributed significantly to PAL's near collapse.
</P>
<P>
The CAB readily granted the foreign airlines' requests to
increase their number of flights and seat capacity, but it failed
to get the same arrangement from their respective governments for
PAL, they added.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Son: Hezbollah to Lay Down Arms After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The son of Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, Bashar Assad, has said that Hezbollah will dismantle its
military wing following an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe its (Hezbollah) members will go back to normal life
and will choose other ways to serve their country after achieving
their long-cherished victory," said Assad, a reportedly political
heir apparent of his father, in an interview with the London-based
Arabic magazine Al-Wasat, which was also reproduced by the paper.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Muslim Shiite military group Hezbollah, or Party of
God, has been spearheading a guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli
forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iran have been the principal backers of the group.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Hezbollah has remained tight-lipped on its
long-term plans for the resistance.
</P>
<P>
This has made Israel hesitate to carry out a troops pullout
from the country for fear that its northern areas will be
attacked again after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
However, few observers in Lebanon believe that Hezbollah will
continue its operations against Israel once the occupation has
ended.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Raad, who heads Hezbollah's parliamentary block,
hinted that the views of the party's leadership were close to
those of Assad.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the group told the paper that Hezbollah has
been preparing for the inevitable Israeli withdrawal and is
expected to switch its efforts to championing the cause of the
dispossessed Shiite community via Parliament and its substantial
social wing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Of the 400,000 deliveries that
occur in Zambia every year, about 80,000 are HIV positive, Zambian
Mother-to-Child Transmission Working Group has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Co-ordinator of the group Chewe Luo said her organization would
try to reduce the number by 50 percent through the provision of
the AIDS drug AZT Zidovudine to infected mothers while receiving
66,400 U.S. dollars from the Japanese government for the purchase
of equipment and detergents to be used in the testing of expectant
mothers and their children.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, The Post, Tuesday quoted Luo as saying:"We
shall also make sure that we substitute infected breast milk with
formula milk to reduce the mother-to-child infection."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony held Monday, Japanese
Ambassador to Zambia Yoshihiro Nakamura said the negative impact
of the HIV infection on the human resources development of the
Zambian people demands that intervention measures be taken to cope
with the situation.
</P>
<P>
In order to give the best and appropriate care to expectant
mothers and their children, he said it is vital that they should
undergo testing that will give accurate results.
</P>
<P>
That was the only way the prevention of the HIV transmission
from mother-to-child could be achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is preparing a
foundation through the merger of banks, brokerage and insurance
firms in order to face global competition, Second Finance Minister
Mustapa Mohamed said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, Malaysia would not be able to avoid global
powers and "it is important for us to make these preparations so
as not to be submerged by the flow of liberalization and
globalization," he said when officiating at a seminar on
investment strategy here.
</P>
<P>
"One day, foreign investors would invest freely here and we
should also be able to grab investment opportunities in other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amidst this scenario, the government wants Malaysian companies
to be active participants, Mustapa said, adding Malaysian
companies should prepare themselves to become global participants
in line with the process of market liberalization and
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the government policy now is to reduce
investment overseas, this is only a temporary measure due to the
regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has taught everyone in the region not to
practice herdlike investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said it was important to initiate efforts to diversify
investments but the crisis has taught a lesson, namely, not to
rely only on the property sector or a particular sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that expertise in coming out with investment analysis
and quality needed to be enhanced.

<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by the Zimbabwe Prison
Services (ZPS) to introduce the open prison system are at an
advanced stage, the daily Herald reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Prison Services spokesman Oliver Chigariro as
saying that some officers were sent to Denmark, which is
sponsoring the whole project, to understudy existing projects in
that country.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to reduce the number of inmates in the
country's prisons to manageable levels, and will start at
Connemara Prison near Gweru of central Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
 Zimbabwe's prisons hold about 20,000 prisoners, 4,000 more
than their carrying capacity. The prison service is looking at
ways of reducing the number of prisoners in the country's jails
following the success of the community service program.
</P>
<P>
"The community service scheme has had a success rate of over 90
percent," Chigariro said.
</P>
<P>
The number of prisoners was increasing because of the
prevailing economic conditions.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Has its Eye on 2020 Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 24 (Xinhua) -- With a projected growing
demand of the natural rubber in the future, Cambodia strives to
revive its rubber industry from now on.
</P>
<P>
Some local industry analysts said earlier that rubber's global
production next year was estimated at 6.6 million tons, while
demand expected at 17 million tons. And in 2020, the production
would be 7.3 million tons against the demand of 28.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
These figures show that the natural rubber is returning to the
world stage, after being overtaken by synthetic which was
developed during the World War two to overcome rubber supply
disruption from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is undertaking a multimillion dollar plan in Kompong
Cham to develop rubber small holdings with the funding of a French
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, families will be given plots of land to plant
and tend rubber seedlings, and they will be provided with subsidy
until the trees are ready for bleeding latex, which will be bought
by a corporation to be established.
</P>
<P>
The French will also help Cambodia develop a national rubber
research institute to help improve the quality of latex and to
establish a standard for Cambodian rubber to meet buyer's needs.
</P>
<P>
The institute will help Cambodia develop better planting,
tapping and processing techniques to improve the current poor
quality of latex production in the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan will have good prospects of reaping profits from a
long-term point of view, said experts here.

BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An oil refinery at Novi Sad of
Yugoslavia, destroyed during NATO's 78-day bombing, resumed
partial production on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The refinery, about 60 kilometers north of Belgrade, with a
daily capacity of 300 tons of diesel oil and 850 tons of heavy oil,
will have refined 500,000 tons of the two products by the end of
the year, according to its manager.
</P>

More than 100 destructive bombs were dropped on the refinery
during NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests Against France for Destroying TV Transmitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Foreign Ministry on
Monday lodged a strong protest with the French government for
destroying a Serb television transmitter in northern Kosovo by the
French troops in the NATO-led peacekeeping forces in Kosovo (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
The protest was handed over to the charge d'affaires of
Switzerland's embassy in Yugoslavia, who represented France
because Belgrade broke off diplomatic relations with it on March
25 after NATO began air raid on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
This conduct is illegal and hard to understand, which brutally
trampled on the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and Serbia, a statement
released by Yugoslavia Foreign Ministry said later.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the French troops of KFOR to restore the
transmitter as soon as possible so that people in Kosovo and
southern Serbia could receive TV and radio signals from Belgrade
again, and demanded the French government to compensate Radio-
Televizija Srbija for the damage.
</P>
<P>
The transmitter on Mount Mokra Gora, near the town of Zubin
Potok, was demolished by the French on August 16 after surviving
more than 10 attacks during NATO's 78-day bombing earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> hke082417 - Bangladesh High Court Orders Removal of Slum Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A High Court Division of
Bangladesh's Supreme Court has ordered the government to remove
shanties set up in the court premises within 24 hours upon receipt
of the order, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the judgment on Monday, Justice Mohammad Fazlul
Karim said that the home minister, home secretary and the
inspector general of police should take measures to remove the
shanties.
</P>
<P>
"Remove them from the court compound and from in front of the
house of Dr. Kamal Hossain, otherwise we'll take serious and
strong view of the matter," Karim said. Hossain, an eminent
lawyer, was fighting the legal battle against the demolition of
slums.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the law will take its own course," Justice Karim
said while disposing off a writ petition seeking a rule against
the government's eviction of slums from the city.
</P>
<P>
The division bench disposed of the writ petition without
issuing a rule and vacated the "stay" order issued earlier on
eviction of slums.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed by some non-governmental organizations
and slum dwellers to challenge the legality and authority of the
demolition of slums and the eviction of inhabitants without
arranging alternative accommodation and without any prior notice.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the slums should be removed from the city
in phases under a rehabilitation program by the government. "It
has to be done phase by phase otherwise the demolition of slums
may not solve the problems," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We find that petitioners don't oppose the removal of slums
from the city if it's done under a rehabilitation scheme," Justice
Karim said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government asked the slum dwellers on Monday
night to vacate the Supreme Court premises by Tuesday, following
the judgment of the High Court Division.
</P>
<P>
The court asked the government on Sunday to evacuate the
squatting slum dwellers from their compound for the sake of
discipline and security at the county's highest seat of justice.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of evicted slum dwellers entered the Supreme Court
premises in central Dhaka last Wednesday night and built makeshift
homes there, refusing to leave the area until their demand of
immediate rehabilitation was met.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70,000 people were evicted from the slums in the capital
city early this month by law-enforcing agencies, following the
killing a police constable. The government launched the eviction
drive on the ground that the slums had become dens of terrorists
and criminals.
</P>
<P>
It is said there are about 2 million slum dwellers in the
Bangladeshi capital, home for some 9 million people.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senators Doubted of Conclusion of NBI Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate
investigators have aired doubts that the August 13 blast at the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) headquarters was accidental
as claimed by the bureau, the newspaper Today said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Barbers, chairman of the Senate peace and order
committee conducting a separate inquiry into the blast, was quoted
as saying that he was not convinced by the bureau's findings and
would not rule out other possible causes at this time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a prober's report declared the explosion that killed
seven agents and wounded several others inside the office of NBI's
Special Investigation Division (SID) was an "accident."
</P>
<P>
Other senators pressed the bureau to pursue all angles in the
blast, saying that the explosion, believed to have been caused by
various explosives stored inside the SID office, was not
accidental.
</P>
<P>
Senator Rene Cayetano claimed the explosion could not be
concluded as an "Act of God" or a fortuitous event, saying "the
fact that a sizable amount of explosives seized by the NBI since
last year had not been turned over to the Firearms and Explosives
Office and remained in custody constitutes gross negligence on the
part of the NBI."
</P>
<P>
Senator Aquilino Pimental urged investigators to check the
possibility that the blast may have been "criminally instigated."
</P>
<P>
According to NBI lawyer Sasai Fiji, a volunteer witness claimed
to have seen someone lob an unknown object on the roof of the SID
building moments before the explosion.

<HEADLINE> Voting Result in E.Timor to be Announced in New York, Dili: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations, organizer of
the August 30 direct autonomy ballot in East Timor, will announce
simultaneously the voting result in New York and Dili, capital of
East Timor, about one week after the popular consultation, a U.N.
official said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan himself will announce the
result, spokesman of the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) David
Wimhurst said in Dili Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a total of 451,792 people have registered
for the ballot, reports reaching here from Dili said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the vote counting would be conducted in Dili and only
one result would be announced.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an influential political party, the Forum for Unity
proposed to conduct vote counting in the polling stations. It
warned that intransparency in vote counting could become a reason
for either or both of the two conflicting groups in East Timor to
reject the ballot's outcome.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET is planning to set up 700 ballot stations across
East Timor. The consultation is meant to let the East Timorese
people indicate whether they accept or reject wide-ranging
autonomy within Indonesia's fold. If they vote against autonomy,
the Indonesian government will let the territory get independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas here Monday
expressed his rejection to the proposal for the sending of a U.N.
peacekeeping force to East Timor, saying it was personnel opinion
from a few U.S. Senators.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some U.S. senators who visited Dili, proposed to
send a U.N. peacekeeping force to Dili because violence had been
increasing recently.
</P>
<P>
"It's their business, their personnel opinion, not the U.S.
government official stance," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
He said any party could have its own opinion about East Timor,
but Indonesia's internal policy on the issue would not be
influenced by it.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the security situation in East Timor has continued
to improve although minor instances of violence occurred here and
there.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesian Defense and Security Minister General
Wiranto said earlier that he would have no objection to the
assignment of more U.N. civilian police in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government agreed to offer
wide-ranging autonomy for the East Timorese people through a
direct ballot. On May 5, Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations decided to hold the ballot in August.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
about 15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until
1975. It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Endemic Fauna, Flora Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- About 75 percent of Sri Lanka's
endemic species of fauna and flora face the threat of extinction,
said a latest study by the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
</P>
<P>
The IUCN has compiled in its study a list of nationally
threatened species of Sri Lanka in consultation with a wide forum
of floral and fauna experts representing universities, government
departments and various others institutions.
</P>
<P>
The study aims to evaluate the degree of threat as well as
initiate proper conservation strategies for their long-term
survival in Sri Lanka, known for its richness in exotic flora and
fauna.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, 50 percent of fresh water fish, 61
percent of amphibians, 55 percent of reptiles, 27 percent of birds
and 39 percent of mammals are threatened with extinction in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 117 species of land snails including 50 percent of
endemic species, 15 species of fresh water shrimps, 22 species of
fresh water crabs, 70 species of dragonflies and 76 species of
butterflies are also threatened.
</P>
<P>
In terms of plants, the study said 700 species of flowering
plants are under threat of extinction.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are all the more significant as they are not
exhaustive. Only a mere 1,239 species of fauna and only 811
species of flowering plants have been evaluated for threat
status," the IUCN study said.
</P>
<P>
There wasn't enough data to even consider evaluating many of
the other species, it added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Will Not Fight in Colombia: Brazilian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Enrique Cardoso said Monday that he was reassured by the
U.S. government that the United States would not take any military
action in Colombia to fight drug cartels there.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil's policy is very clear: we believe it is an internal
affair of Colombia," the President said of the current anti-drug
warfare in Colombia in an interview with the local television.
</P>
<P>
The interview was given during the visit of Barry McCaffrey,
the top U.S. official in charge of anti-drug affairs in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has to date not received any request for military
assistance from Colombia in its battle against drug bastions, said
Cardoso, adding that his country is willing to provide any kind of
cooperation once Bogota asks for it.
</P>
<P>
According to the President, Brazil has enhanced vigilance along
its border with Colombia to make sure that war conflicts in
Colombia will not spread to the Brazilian territory. Apart from
drug traffickers, the Colombian government is also waging a war
against rebel guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports said that the Brazilian government is
preparing a major operation to cut off the traffic along the
Amazon River, which will be conducted by federal police and armed
forces units. The river is a major transportation line for both
the Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> No Conditional Aid From U.S. to Be Accepted: Colombian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto denied allegations Monday
that the U.S. government has required the Colombian government to
achieve positive results in peace talks with rebel groups as a
precondition for any U.S. economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government will never attach conditions to its
support for the Colombian peace process, neither will the
Colombian government accept any such conditions," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
U.S. media reports allege that Washington submitted an
ultimatum and a plan for U.S. intervention in Colombia to the
Colombian government during a recent visit to Bogota of a senior U.
S. government delegation headed by Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Foreign Minister said there was no ultimatum or
plan of intervention from Washington, and that the rumor about any
possible U.S. military action in Colombia is untrue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Government earlier announced that in principle it
would provide some one billion US dollars in economic assistance
for Colombia in the coming two years.

<HEADLINE> Dini: NATO's Involvement in Kosovo War Not a Rule For The Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In referring to NATO's decision to
unleash war in Kosovo against Yugoslavia without the approval of
the United Nations, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Monday that NATO's self-investiture during the war could not
become a rule for the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on Friendship Among the Peoples held in
Italy's resort town of Rimini, Dini said, "The U.S. itself should
be more clear of what it can and cannot do."
</P>
<P>
He said the defense of a right should be separated from "
hegemonic aspirations" in the future and that no more "new
missions" should be undertaken by NATO now that it is without its
"enemy of yesterday."
</P>
<P>
However, Dini made it clear that he was not questioning his
country's friendship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The issue, he said, is to "build a peace which is not solely
American, even if it will continue to have the United States as an
indispensable power."
</P>
<P>
Dini admitted that the U.S. role in the Balkans stemmed from
the EU's weakness "as a political entity and its non-existence in
military terms," but, he argued, the U.S. role can be contained by
building up the EU's joint security and foreign policy, by its
enlargement to neighboring countries, including the Balkans, and
by improving international legal instruments.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Lauds China's Achievements in 5 Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestinian National Authority, said that facts have testified
that the Chinese people chose a suitable political system which
has led to the enhancement of their country's prestige in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, the chairman said that
reality has shown the political road the Chinese people took five
decades ago suits their geographic environment, cultural identity
and historic civilization. As a result, the Chinese people have
made great progress in national construction and are progressing
along the path of scientific and technological development.
</P>
<P>
This year the People's Republic of China celebrates its 50th
founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Praising the great strides made by New China in economic reform
and construction over the past 50 years, Arafat spoke highly in
particular of the achievement made over the past 20 years when
the opening-up and reform program is being carried out.
</P>
<P>
He said he views with admiration and appreciation these
accomplishments that are embodied in China's steady economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
They also contributed to China's enhanced standing in the world
community, enabling the country to assume a constructive and
important role both in Asia and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has visited China for more than a dozen times since
the mid-1960s and has been an old friend of Chinese leaders of
three generations, said the economic policy pursued by China has
taken into consideration the political and economic changes in the
outside world. China's success story in the economic field has
encouraged other nations and peoples in their efforts for
attaining economic and political liberation.
</P>
<P>
Talking of China's foreign policy, he said the diplomatic
principle of peaceful coexistence as pursued by China is in total
conformity with the objectives and principles sought by the United
Nations. China has all along supported international efforts aimed
at maintaining world peace and security. And at all international
forums, particularly at the United Nations, it has taken side with
peoples struggling for their rights to self-determination, freedom,
independence and security on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
He said these policies have earned the country respect from all
third world countries. "We highly praise China for its friendly,
uncompromising and firm stand in supporting the struggle of our
Palestinian people ever since the very beginning and at all
international platforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Sino-Palestinian relations, Arafat said, "We
highly value the close friendship that bonds us with China for
many years. These ties have further expanded and deepened
throughout four decades."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people have always viewed China with deep
respect and admiration and will never forget the support China
has given them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need China's support and cooperation, particularly during
the present decisive phase when the Palestinian people are on the
threshold of achieving their freedom and independence on their
soil." He said he is sure that China will, as always, stand on the
side of the Palestinian people in establishing an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
On China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
Arafat said the Palestinian people joined all freedom- and peace-
loving peoples of the world in welcoming the historic event.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that as China has adopted a wise and
responsible policy in dealing with the issue of Hong Kong's return,
it will undoubtedly succeed in resolving the issue of Macao's
return and in reunifying with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Comets Guard Cynthia Cooper Named WNBA Player of the Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Houston Comets guard Cynthia

<HEADLINE> U.S. High-tech Plants Register Faster Productivity Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 23 (Xinhua) -- High-tech manufacturing
plants in the United States registered significantly faster
productivity growth than plants in other industries, according to
a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The average plant in high-tech industries, which include
electric machinery, scientific instruments and chemicals, posted
productivity gains of 3.3 percent between 1963 and 1992, the last
year for which official data is available. That compares with
average productivity increase of 2.5 percent for all manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Conference Board, a leading U.S.
business membership and research organization, covered virtually
all of America's manufacturing plants that report data to the U.S.
Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Older surviving manufacturing plants in high-tech industries
have showed the highest productivity gains since 1967, according
to the study. The newest high-tech plants, however, tended to be
competitive more quickly than in other industries. But high-tech
status did not guarantee success and some low-tech industries such
as textiles also showed large gains.
</P>
<P>
The study shed new light on the productivity performance of
both start-ups in U.S. manufacturing and long-term survivors.
</P>
<P>
While newer plants with access to adequate capital and the
latest technology have obvious competitive advantages over many
older plants, the study showed that experience is a critical
factor boosting productivity. "Managers cannot entirely avoid the
learning process simply by hiring skilled workers or heavily
investing in new technology," the Conference Board said.

<HEADLINE> Port Expansion Project Begins in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Work on the second-phase
expansion project of Zhapu Port, an emerging sea port in east
China's Zhejiang Province, has started, as part of the national
effort to establish the Shanghai International Shipping Center.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will involve a total investment of 746
million yuan (90.2 million U.S. dollars), aims to build a 15,000-
dwt berth for sundry goods, a 15,000-dwt multi-purpose berth, a 20,
000-dwt coal dock, and an array of inland supporting facilities in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Zhapu, which is near Shanghai, has 70 km. of coastline with a
depth of 10 to 15 m., and is generally considered a good deep-
water port. It now has seven berths.
</P>
<P>
Zhapu is expected to have a total cargo handling capacity of 30
million tons by the year 2000 and 50 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Customs offices, inspection offices, commodity checks, and
quarantine monitors, have been established to the port since its
approval by the State Council in 1996 as a first-class open port.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Attributes Attack Against Colombian Consulate to Secret Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 23 (Xinhua)-- The Venezuelan government on
Monday attributed a bomb attack against Colombia's consulate to a
local clandestine group.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel attributed the
attack at 3:30 a.m. local time to a clandestine group called the "
Tupamaro Movement," which is protesting the military trial of four
Venezuelans in Colombia's capital of Santa Fe de Bogota, and the
killing of other Venezuelans in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The explosion shattered windows and destroyed the main door of
the consulate's building without causing injuries to victims.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan government ordered police to strengthen
vigilance around the consulate, the Colombian Embassy and the
Colombo-Venezuela Institute in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
According to police at the Colombian-Venezuelan Institute in
Caracas, where an explosive device was defused on Monday, police
found pamphlets from the Tupamaro Movement.
</P>
<P>
The secret organization was set up in 1998 under the flag of
murdering corrupt officials and policemen in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Rangel denied the attacks were related to the political
disagreements between Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his
Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's General Consul in Venezuela, Jose Alfredo Maestre,
dismissed rumors on Monday that the attack and other events would
upset relations between both countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean economy shrank 2.9
percent in the first half of this year compared with the same
period in 1998, the central bank reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
has fallen to the lowest level since the crisis in 1982,
attributing the drop to the decline of internal demand and the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1999, Chile's industry decreased 3.2
percent, fishing 1.3 percent and agriculture 0.4 percent, while
the mining sector, an exception, increased 15.3 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The recession has caused a 13.5 percent decrease in internal
consumption and a 14.6 percent reduction of capital, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials Allegedly Involved in Bank Bali Scandal Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The independent Indonesian
Corruption Watch (ICW) Monday disclosed that 11 high-ranking
officials were allegedly involved in the Bank Bali scandal,
according to The Indonesian Observer.
</P>
<P>
The 11 people named by the corruption watchdog in its report
include President B.J. Habibie's chief adviser A.A. Baramuli,
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, State Enterprises Minister
Tanri Abeng, former State Auditor chief as well as ex-commissioner
of Bank Bali J.B. Sumarlin, Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA) chairman Glenn Yusuf, IBRA deputy chairmen Pande Lubis and
Farid Harianto.
</P>
<P>
The ICW has accused businessman Djoko Chandra of transferring
200 billion rupiah (28.5 million U.S. dollars) to the so-called
"Habibie Success Team" through the account of his wife Anna
Bontaran. The so-called "Habibie Success Team" aims to secure the
"re-election" of the incumbent president, who is the ruling Golkar
Party's presidential candidate, in the November presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
ICW Coordinator Teten Masduki said the ICW has hard evidence of
the close relationship between Minister Tanri and Setya Novanto,
deputy treasurer of Golkar who is one of the key players in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Certain parties have pressed Bank Bali ex-president Rudy Ramli
to reveal the scandal in plain terms, "and not touching upon the
political nuances," Teten was quoted by The Indonesian Observer
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Election winner Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle said
last week that it has hard evidence showing the direct involvement
of 16 people in the scam: four ministerial-level executives, three
high-ranking officials, two political party functionaries, five
business tycoons, one confidante of the president and one brother
of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali saga began when a top official of the Golkar
colluded with high ranking officials to help Bank Bali collect
interbank loans totaling 904 billion rupiah (about 129 million
U.S. dollars) from a liquidated bank at a huge fee of 546 billion
rupiah (78 million dollars), although under the recapitalization
scheme, the government fully guarantees interbank borrowings.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 23 (Xinhua)-- The meeting between presidents of
Brazil and Venezuela scheduled on Wednesday will be postponed to
September 4, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's President Fernando Herique Cardoso phoned on Monday

with a march of peasants in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern Brazilian state of Para, the two presidents
will discuss bilateral issues and neighboring Colombia's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in February, Venezuelan President Hugo
Chaves has expressed a desire to play a major role in Colombia's
fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conflict, which has killed more than 35,000
people in the last decade, could spill over Colombia's borders and
destabilize its South American neighbors.

<HEADLINE> World Record Holder Barmasai Beaten in Men's Steeplechase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Bernard
Barmasai suffered a surprise defeat in the men's steeplechase as
his fellow Kenyan Christopher Koskei grabbed the title at the 7th
World Athletics Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai, who set the world record of seven minutes 55.72
seconds on August 24, 1997, finished a distance fifth place in 8:
13.51.
</P>
<P>
Koskei, 25, who ran barefoot to win the silver in the 1995
World Championships, stormed to victory in 8:11.76, with another
Kenyan and defending champion Wilson Boit Kipketer second in 8:12.
09.
</P>
<P>
The bronze was won by Ali Ezzine of Morocco Paul Kosgei with a
time of 8:12.73. Paul Kosgei, also of Kenya, finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
"We had a pre-race plan, " Koskei said. "I mean all four
Kenyans were to work together as a team until 200 meters from the
finish and then it was every man for himself."
</P>
<P>
He added: "As the final 200m point came close I was aware that
both Barmasai and the a German were close by. I know their
strength was very strong. But I collected my thoughts mentally and
concentrated on the finish line. The result you know."
</P>
<P>
Kipketer said: "I fell very good because I didn't expect to be
in top three since I haven't had a very good season. I had an
injury in 1997 in my achilles tendor. "
</P>
<P>
But the 1-2 finish failed to live up to the expectation of the
Kenyans, who clean-swept all the three medals in the last
championships with Kipketer winning the gold, three-time world
champion Moses Kiptanui at second and Barmasai third.
</P>
<P>
"It was a shame not to achieve a clean sweep," said Kipketer. "
That's what we came here for. The heat really didn't affect my
performance. In fact I like to run when it is hot. "
</P>
<P>
But he hoped to come back one day to Seville to break the world
record.
</P>
<P>
"The stadium is fantastic. I hope to come back next year to
break the world record."
</P>
<P>
Barmasai, who has domainated the event since 1997, led the race
from a short time but faded in the late stage.
</P>
<P>
The race was somewhat a repeat of the fifth stage of the Golden
League in Zurich two weeks ago except that the result was
different.
</P>
<P>
The world record holder revealed that he had Koskei to let him
win in Zurich as he was overtaken by the teammate at the end of
the race.
</P>
<P>
The victory kept Barmasai, who had won the previous four stages
in the Golden League, in the chase for the season-ending one
million U.S. dollars jackpot.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF has decided to investigate the case but Kosei later
denied there was a deal between them.
</P>
<P>
The four Kenyans then jogged a victory lap holding their
national colors and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Ezzine said: "I am very proud of my bronze because no other
Moroccan has ever got a medal in steeplechase."

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Bodybuilders to Take Part in Asian Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will send eight
bodybuilders to the Asian Bodybuilding Championships which will
begin Thursday in Chinese Taipei, according to Bernama news agency
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Bodybuilding Federation (MBBF) decided to send a full
team after the National Sports Council (NSC) agreed to pay for the
trip, MBBF executive secretary Francis Yong told Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The eight were the champions of the respective categories at
the national championships held in Malacca two weeks ago, he said,
adding they are Mohamed Ali Sukardi (flyweight), Sazali Abdul
Samad (bantamweight), Abdul Ghani Abdul Kadir (lightweight), Syed
Fazli Syed Ali (welterweight), Liaw Teck Leong (light middleweight)
, Othman Yahya (middleweight), Wong Ngai Heong (light heavyweight)
and Terry Gallyot (heavyweight).
</P>
<P>
Yong said although the competition would be tough, the exposure
and experience would be useful as the bodybuilders geared
themselves for the biennial SEA (South East Asia) Games in 2001,
which Malaysia will host.
</P>
<P>
The team's chief coach Abdul Aziz Ahmad is optimistic that the
Malaysians would be able to win two golds, two silvers and a
bronze at the Asian meet. Sazali and Wong were tipped to win the
gold medals at stake in the bantamweight and light heavyweight
respectively while Liaw and Gallyot were expected to walk away
with the silver medals and Syed Fazli should win the bronze in the
welter weight category.
</P>
<P>
At the Asian meet in Vietnam last year, Sazali won the gold
medal in the bantamweight category while the two silvers came from
Zetri Munir (bantamweight) and Liaw (light middleweight).
</P>
<P>
The bodybuilders will leave for Taipei on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Montalvo Wins Women's Long Jump in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Niurka Montalvo claimed the
first gold medal for host Spain at the World Athletics
Championships when she won the women's long jump in foul dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard, 32, flied 7.06 meters in her final jump, which
defeated her nearest opponent Fiona May of Italy into the second
place by 0.12 meters.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones of the United States, who aimed to take four gold
medals including the long jump, only managed to finish third at 6.
83 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, Montalvo's final attempt had caused a row which May
claimed that it was no jump for the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously a foul, you can watch the replay," angry May
said.
</P>
<P>
Televison replay showed that Montalvo's right foot crossed
about two centimeters over the line on the jumping pad.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say I'm happy and I don't want to be unsporting but
everybody saw what happened in Montalvo's last jump. I am showing
good sportsmanship and settle for this. It is not my job to make
a protest, it is my team which does this," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the Italian team has appealed
against the decision and a rule is expected tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Montalvo insisted that she had a good jump in the
final round and told May to learn to lose.
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn to lose in the competition," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Normally I'm good with my last attempt and tonight proved this
fact. My last attempt was clearly valid. The take-off board
showed no mark to indicate a foul, so I believe it was good,"
added the joyful Montalvo.
</P>
<P>
After five rounds of the competition, May led a field of 12
jumpers with 6.94 meters from the third attempt while Montalvo was
second at 6.88, which came from her third try.
</P>
<P>
Montalvo, who was first to appear in the order, made the
victorious jump in the sixth round while May only made it at 6.87
meters.
</P>
<P>
For Jones, it was a disappointing jump tonight. When entering
into the field, Jones had been the top favourite to win with
personal best of 7.31 meters.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I am a little bit disappointed. I came here to win,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"This time it didn't go my way but that means I just have to
try next year again," she added.

SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan displayed their dominance
in the 3,000 meters steeplechase as Christopher Koskei led a 1-2
finish on Monday at the 7th World Athletics Championships, but
women's super star Marion Jones had her dream of winning four gold
medals dashed, only settling for a bronze in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
Koskei, 25, who ran barefoot to win the silver in the 1995

But Kenya's world record holder Bernard Barmasai suffered a
surprise defeat, finished a distance fifth in 8:13.51. Paul Kosgei,
also of Kenya, finished seventh.

</P>
<P>
Jones, who retained her 100 meters world title on Sunday and
also aimed to win the long jump, 200m and 1600m relay, had to
reduce her four-medal hope to three when she only won a bronze
with a jump of 6.83 meters.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I am a little disappointed, I came here to win. This
time it didn't go my way but that means I just have to try next

Local jumper Niurka Montalvo soared to victory with a jump of 7.

in the 1995 World Championships, led the field of 12 jumpers with
6.94 meters until Montalvo registered the last winning efforts.

The organizers said a decision was expected to be made tonight.
</P>
<P>
The 1-2 finish in the steeplechase failed to live up to the
expectation of the Kenyans, who clean-swept all the three medals
in the last championships with Kipketer winning the gold, three-
time world champion Moses Kiptanui at second and Barmasai third.
</P>
<P>
"It was a shame not to achieve a clean sweep," said Kipketer. "
That's what we came here for. The heat really didn't affect my
performance. In fact I like to run when it is hot. "
</P>
<P>
But he hoped to come back one day to Seville to break the world
record.
</P>
<P>
"The stadium is fantastic. I hope to come back next year to
break the world record."
</P>
<P>
The day's first gold medal went to German's European champion
Franka Dietzsch, who won the women's discus throw with a toss of
68.14 meters.
</P>
<P>
Anastasia Kelesidou of Greece took the silver in 66.05 meters
and Romania's Nicoleta Grasu third in 65.35.
</P>
<P>
"I came here as the second best in the world so far this year
and I thought I would be satisfied even if I only got the bronze,"
Dietzsch said. "Now I have two major golds. I have no dreams for
the future, next year is next year."
</P>
<P>
In the men's high jump final, Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia,
cleared 2.37 meters for the gold, improving his personal best of 2.
36.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Mark Boswell finished second by jumping over 2.35
meters and Martin Buss of German settled for the third in 2.32.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Charles Austin, who had a personal best of 2.
40 meters and the hot favorite with the absence of world record
holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, wound up only eighth with 2.29.
</P>
<P>
"I controled myself today," Voronin said. "My body and mind
were in harmony. These great championships are all about your
psychological strength. We all train to the same level, the mind
is what decides the medals."
</P>
<P>
World men's triple jump record holder Honathan Edwards of
Britain passed the first hurdle comfortably with a jump of 17.28
meters in the heat. Only Bulgarian Rostislav Dimitrov's 17.30 was
superior to his.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson and Colin Jackson also eased into to the semi-
finals in the 400 meters and 110 meters hurdle respectively.

<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool recovered from two
straight English premier league defeats to win 2-1 at Leeds on
Monday courtesy of an own goal from home skipper Lucas Radebe.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Gerard Houllier's side had been under pressure as two
1-0 defeats, by Watford last week and Middlesbrough on Saturday,
left them struggling in 17th place on the league table.
</P>
<P>
The home side went ahead after 20 minutes as a Michael Bridges
shot cannoned into the net off Liverpool's Cameroonian Rigobert
Song's left ankle.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool levelled the score through a Titi Camara goal in the
dying minutes of the first half and after 55 minutes, the second
own goal of the night came as Radebe deflected a Liverpool
freekick past Nigel Martyn to hand the guests the much-needed
victory.
</P>
<P>
The win moved Liverpool to ninth in the table.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Name British Doctor for Pinochet Medical Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 23 (Xinhua)-- The Chilean government will
assign a British doctor to examine the state of health of life-
long Senator Augusto Pinochet, Chilean Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Pinochet's medical examination will be
conducted before the extradition process begins by Britain on
September 27, at the request of a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said it is up to the British government to determine the
procedure to be followed in order to cite humanitarian grounds
against Pinochet's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in Britain on October 16, 1998, at
the request of a Spanish judge who is seeking to extradite him to
Spain to face charges of human rights abuses alleged to have
occurred during his rule from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chile has protested his detention, arguing other countries
should not be allowed to judge crimes committed on Chilean soil.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said Pinochet would undergo medical tests
this week which would be used by defense lawyers to support their
case for his release.

<HEADLINE> hke082401-Pak Always Desires Tension-Free Ties with India: Sajjad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Pakistan's Senate
Wasim Sajjad Monday called on the international community to
persuade India to resume dialogue with Pakistan to resolve all
outstanding issues, especially the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad was talking to a nine-member delegation of British
parliamentarians which is paying a week-long visit to Pakistan,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kashmir should be the cause for greater concern to
the international community in view of the consistent and massive
violations of human rights by over 700,000 Indian security forces
stationed in the Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always desired tension-free and mutually
beneficial relations with India and to achieve that end it remains
committed to a substantive and result-oriented dialogue with India
aimed at finding an amicable solution to all issues, including
Kashmir, said the Senate chairman.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad said Pakistan's commitment to the dialogue process was
evident from the measures it has taken to promote a conducive
atmosphere in South Asia, including commencement of bus service
between India and Pakistan, release of Indian fishermen and
renewal of sports exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Sajjad asserted that India should reciprocate Pakistan's
gestures by translating its commitments into reality and engage in
substantive talks to resolve the Kashmir issue on the basis of the
wishes of the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
He assured the British Parliamentarians that Pakistan remained
committed to avoiding a nuclear and conventional arms race in the
South Asia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kipketer Appeals for Blood Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Men's 800m world record holder
Wilson Kipketer of Denmark called Monday on the International
Amateur Athletics Federation to catch drug cheats by imposing
blood testing.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, a favourite to take the title for the third
consecutive times at world championships, made the comment when
the sport is facing a credit problem after several hight profile
athletes failing drugs tests recently.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Danish added that the IAAF should also take a
more consistent line in the way they tested athletes.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the athletes should be blood tested because that
is the clearest way of finding out if they are taking drugs or not,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also think that the top 20 athletes in each event should be
tested all through the year and not just randomly as happens at
the moment," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the blood testing would only be used on a voluntary
basis at the Sydney Olympic Games for reseach purpose only, as
what it was stated by the International Olympic Committee earlier
this week.

<HEADLINE> German Veteran Wins Women's Discus Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- German veteran Franka Dietzsch
produced her first ever gold medal at world championships when she
threw 68.14 meters in her penultimate attempt to win the women's
discus event on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dietzsch, 32, had a disappointing performance in Athens two
years ago when she failed to win anything with three no-shows.
</P>
<P>
Anastasia Kelesidou of Greece was second with a throw of 66.05m
and Nicoleta Grasu of Romania finished third with 65.35.
</P>
<P>
Competing against a strong field including World University
Games champion Grasu and 1995 world champion Ellina Zvereva of
Belarus, Dietzsch admitted that she felt nervous entering her
position.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very nervous entering the infield before the
competition began, but I was lucky enough to get a good throw out
in the first round," she said.
</P>
<P>
The European champion had virtually settled for the gold in her
first try in which she managed to throw the discus to a distance
of 66.34 meters.
</P>
<P>
In her third throw, she improved her mark to 67.60 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, after Kelesidou had 66.05 meters in the penultimate
round, Dietzsch felt that the Greek might throw even farther in
the final round, which may well overtake her mark of 67.60 meters.
</P>
<P>
"After the Greek threw 66 meters, I knew my earlier result
might not be enough for gold. However, I was able to collect my
throughts again and calm myself which made it possible to throw so
far in the fifth round," she said.
</P>
<P>
The result and the victory may well satisfy the German, who
said that she only hoped for a brzone medal before the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I came here as the second best in the world so far this year
and I thought I would be satisfied even if I only got the bronze,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Beatrice Faumuina, who won the first ever world
champion for New Zealand when she won the discus event in Athens,
would not be happy today.
</P>
<P>
Faumuina only managed 64.62 meters in her best throw to finish
in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Moves to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved sharply to the record high Monday one day before the
Federal Reserve was expected to raise interest rates in a bid to
preempt inflation from the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index closed up 199.15 at 11,299.76. surpassing
the record closing high of 11,209.84 set on July 16. The Dow rose
136.72 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 23.61 at 1,360.22 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 71.24 at 2,719.57.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied despite the predication for hike in interest
rates at the Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting in Washington
Tuesday. The Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
earlier that the Federal Reserve would act "promptly and
forcefully" to raise the rates if the new data show pressures on
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The stocks have faltered after the warning but edged back last
week as investors absorbed the likelihood of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 8.72 at 634.81 and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.72 at 792.51. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.87 at 437.25.

the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,269 down and 550
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 673.76 million shares from 658.10
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Brazil to Accelerate Structural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said on Monday that the developments of Brazilian
economy in the first half of this year were significantly better
than expected, but urged the government to accelerate structural
reforms to lay foundations for sustained recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Developments in the Brazilian economy during the first half of
1999 have been, on the whole, significantly better than expected
under the revised IMF-supported program that was approved by the
executive board at the end of March 1999," the IMF said in an
annual review of the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's real gross domestic product (GDP), which had stagnated
in 1998, partly due to the adverse impact of the Asian and Russian
crisis, began to recover and grew at annualized rates of 3.2
percent and 3.8 percent in the first and second quarters of 1999
respectively, relative to the preceding quarters.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1999, the IMF projected real GDP to
decline by 1 percent or less, compared with the decline of almost
4 percent projected in the revised March program.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price inflation in the first seven months of 1999
remained around 5 percent, reflecting the initial overshooting of
the exchange rate of the Brazilian real after it was allowed to
float in January was corrected relatively quickly. For the year as
a whole, the consumer price is expected to increase by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the authorities' commitment to the policy
framework of the program, along with the strong official
international support and the constructive voluntary involvement
of the private sector, had been instrumental in securing an early
recovery of confidence, correcting the initial overshooting of the
exchange rate, and allowing an incipient pick up in activity with
relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, it stressed that, to lay the foundation for sustained
recovery, the authorities' principal challenges are to build on
the progress already achieved in implementing fiscal consolidation
and to accelerate structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Directors urged the authorities to continue monitoring fiscal
developments closely, and to stand ready to take further measures
as needed to ensure that the targeted public sector primary
surplus of 3.1 percent of GDP is strictly adhered to," the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stressed that fiscal sustainability over the medium
term depends heavily on the progress in pending structural fiscal
reforms, especially regarding the social security and tax systems,
and in the implementation of administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, they (directors) strongly urged the authorities to
intensify their efforts to ensure early and substantial progress
in these areas," the IMF said.
