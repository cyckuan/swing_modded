<HEADLINE> Togo Activist Fights Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An activist who claims she will be tortured and  
possibly killed if she returns to her native West Africa is 
fighting a deportation effort by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ablavi Haden is seeking protection under the Convention Against  
Torture. The international pact allows people who are deported to 
halt proceedings if they can demonstrate a credible fear of 
government-sanctioned torture in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Haden, 47, said in Sunday's editions of The Dallas Morning  
News that Republic of Togo officials in 1991 killed her husband, 
Mensah Haden, a Togolese official who believed other government 
officials were stealing public money for private use. Mrs. Haden, a 
leader in Togo's fledgling women's rights and democracy movements, 
said she fears a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am afraid they will take me and imprison me, and the next  
thing my body will be found somewhere,'' she said. ``I'm afraid of 
being tortured to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But INS officials say her fears are unfounded and have kept the  
mother of five locked up in a Dallas County jail since March 
because they believe she will go into hiding if released while her 
case is being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has believed her enough to sustain her claim,'' said  
Lynn Ligon, a spokesman with the INS' Dallas office. ``If it 
doesn't pass muster, then obviously the story is not a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Haden came to the United States in 1989 to get a second  
master's degree. She had filed an application to extend her student 
visa when INS officials moved to deport her in 1996 for overstaying 
her visa. She filed a claim of political asylum, but Dallas 
immigration Judge Cary H. Copeland said he believed she was 
motivated primarily by economics and that she was not eligible for 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney filed an appeal and Mrs. Haden was permitted to  
remain free while her case was being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, she was ordered to show up for deportation,  
but had changed moved and didn't get the letter. The government 
began to view her as a fugitive, but she noted that she was still 
working at the same office and had received a one-year work visa 
from the INS in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ligon said the office that handles deportations is separate from  
the one that issues work authorizations, and that she should have 
notified them of her address change. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in March by INS agents at her office.  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Obinna Duruji, said the INS made a mistake. ``They  
arrested her in error and tried to find a rationalization for 
holding her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the several hundred people who have tried to halt deportation  
through the international pact, only one -- an Iraqi -- has been 
granted protection.

<HEADLINE> Net-Mania Reigns on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a new year dawns on Wall Street, many  
investors are faced with a thorny problem: What to do, or what not 
to do, about the mania for Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Any prudent adviser will tell you how dangerous it is to try to  
ride this wave, which has lately broadened from technology 
companies to merchandisers engaged in Internet commerce, commonly 
known as ``E-tailing.'' By any traditional measure, these stocks 
typically sell at outlandish prices. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest names in the field, the book and music dealer  
Amazon.com, has seen its shares skyrocket more than 1,300 percent 
in the past 12 months. Though the company has not yet reported its 
first dollar of profit, investors have assigned it a market value 
greater than many of the biggest, long-established names in the 
retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, shares of both established and new companies that  
announce plans for E-tailing ventures routinely jump 50 percent, 
100 percent or more in a single day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few days, America Online has been added to the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, where it immediately 
ranks among the top 10 percent in market value, and Charles Schwab 
&AMP; Co. has surpassed longtime financial titan Merrill Lynch in 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow I have the feeling that this is all going to end  
badly,'' says Ray DeVoe, a veteran market analyst at Legg Mason 
Wood Walker Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``An old saying in Wall Street is that the high-flyers of a bull  
market all seem to sell around $5 a share at the bottom of the 
cycle. This looks to me like another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if you simply adopt a hands-off policy to any investments  
with links to the Internet, you run the very real risk of watching 
from the sidelines as a dramatic story of economic progress keeps 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	For individuals managing only their own money, this may mean  
nothing more than lost opportunity. But for professionals making 
fiduciary decisions, other things like their jobs and their 
reputations may be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to own tech in a portfolio,'' says Fred Taylor, chief  
investment officer at New York's U.S. Trust Co., which has been in 
the business of managing wealthy people's money for nearly 150 
years. ``You just can't have only yesterday's stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the game has been going lately, investors may find  
themselves suddenly in the midst of the action even if they never 
sought to buy an Internet stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of staunch tech-avoiders own stocks like Schwab, or  
shares of some established catalog or specialty retailer that 
suddenly becomes a hot Internet property when attention focuses on 
its World Wide Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	So before you conclude that you're not involved in Netmania,  
check the latest list of portfolio holdings from any stock mutual 
fund you may own. 
</P>
<P>
	Once you truly get away from the Internet hubbub, many other  
sectors of the stock market are remarkably quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the last few sessions of 1998, calculates market  
strategist John Manley at Salomon Smith Barney, just 50 of the 500 
stocks in the S&AMP;P composite accounted for 94 percent of the index's 
gain, which came to a little more than 22 percent for the year to 
date. That left the other 450 stocks with a gain of about 1.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stocks, in the aggregate, made no progress at all. And an  
investor warned that Internet mania might be a sign of an impending 
market break might easily reply, ``Bear market? We just had one 
three months ago!'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what this all means for the future remains very much a  
mystery. As for the recent past, summarizes Manley, ``while 1998 
may be remembered as a great year for equities and equity 
investors, in truth there was very little easy money to be made.''

<HEADLINE> Ken Starr May Have Final Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offstage while the Senate deals with the final  
act in the impeachment of President Clinton, the man who wrote the 
script for it has not rested his cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr has only lowered his profile since the House  
approved the perjury and cover-up charges he framed and sent them 
to the Senate for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The special prosecutor may yet have a role in the outcome,  
should there be a Senate attempt to punish the president without 
firing him. That could involve Starr because a censure settlement 
involving admissions would leave Clinton vulnerable to the 
independent counsel's prosecutors after his term ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's Office of Independent Counsel still has targets to  
pursue, with indictments and at trial. His spokesman said they may 
be operating for another two years or more, before wrapping up what 
began as their Whitewater investigation with a final report. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be longer than any special prosecutor in the 20 years  
of the independent counsel law, which expires in June. Even if the 
law lapses, Starr would be entitled to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	And after noon on Jan. 20, 2001, there would be no bar to the  
indictment of a censured former president. Starr said so when he 
testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He didn't say he 
would seek to do it. He has not said he wouldn't. Friends now say 
he has not ruled out a settlement in which Clinton would be spared 
future prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In an extraordinary year of presidential sex scandal and lies  
about it -- Clinton won't admit lying, let alone the perjury charged 
in the impeachment -- Starr wielded powers without precedent. He 
went beyond the specific letter of the independent counsel law in 
recommending impeachment on 11 counts, among them the grand jury 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges on which the House 
impeached the president on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second impeachment of a president; charges were  
brought against Richard M. Nixon but he resigned before the House 
acted. And it was the first in which the House did not initiate the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr did, under a provision of the law stating the independent  
counsels ``shall advise the House of Representatives of any 
substantial and credible information ... that may constitute 
grounds for an impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He delivered the information, 36 boxes of grand jury and other  
evidence, and more -- plus a 453-page report of his case against 
Clinton and 11 impeachment charges he recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that the House of Representatives -- not an  
independent counsel -- has the sole power to impeach,'' Starr began 
when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 18. 
But under the independent counsel act, Starr had the power to begin 
it. When Congress considered impeaching Nixon, it acted on its own. 
The Watergate special prosecutor wouldn't share his grand jury 
evidence with the House Judiciary Committee, saying he was bound by 
the rules of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr decided that he was not, and got court clearance to  
deliver grand jury testimony to the House, which then made it 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment evidence was Starr's evidence, on the Monica  
Lewinsky affair and coverup that he got added to his 
Whitewater-plus investigations last Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	On this Jan. 11, the Senate is due to begin its impeachment  
trial of the president, and may proceed on the same evidence, 
although House impeachment managers -- now the prosecutors -- want to 
summon witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, no single figure in all of this has been more  
powerful than Starr, appointed by a panel of three federal judges 
nearly 4 1/2 years ago, to take over the Whitewater investigation, 
with alleged abuses in White House travel office firings and 
mishandling of FBI files, with the Lewinsky affair added to his 
franchise later. 
</P>
<P>
	Should it come to censure, ``the only option left'' for lack of  
the 67 votes it would take to convict Clinton, according to GOP 
Sen. Orrin Hatch, Starr could be central once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some Democrats talking of censure -- others are  
adamant against a fallback penalty -- have insisted that Clinton 
admit to lying under oath as part of any censure settlement. Even 
were he to waver in his denials, his lawyers could be expected to 
balk at admissions that could be used against him for prosecution 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Were Starr to rule out prosecution for a confession as part of a  
censure settlement, one obstacle would be removed. But it could 
raise another one -- there have been suggestions in Congress that 
censure would suffice only because Clinton could ultimately face 
perjury prosecution, to demonstrate that no citizen is above the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	That's hypothetical. Starr didn't answer questions about his  
plans even when his terse driveway interviews and that smile as he 
drove away to the office were regular TV fare. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that now. He's silent, but not nearly finished.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Miami Faces Uphill Battle at Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Even eternal optimist Jimmy Johnson admits  
his Miami Dolphins face long odds in the second round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville's 25-10 victory Sunday over New England determined  
the pairings for next weekend's AFC games, and the Dolphins will 
play Saturday at Denver. That means Miami must contend with the 
well-rested defending Super Bowl champions, a hostile crowd and 
winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Dolphins must do it without their only Pro Bowl player.  
Defensive tackle Tim Bowens underwent surgery Sunday to repair a 
torn tendon in his arm, and he'll miss the rest of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowens was hurt in Saturday's 24-17 wild-card victory over the  
Buffalo Bills, Miami's first postseason win in four years. With 
Denver looming, the thrill of victory didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's going to be an uphill battle playing on the road  
when they have two weeks to prepare and a bye and an opportunity to 
get their team healthy,'' Johnson said. ``That's why teams with a 
bye playing at home have such a high winning percentage in the 
playoffs. We know the odds are against us. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the same token, anything can happen, and we like the  
opportunity to go take a few chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins beat the Broncos 31-21 two weeks ago, but Denver  
had already clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs and had 
little incentive to win. And that game was in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins' last road victory in the postseason came 25 years  
ago against Minnesota in the Super Bowl. Miami has since lost eight 
consecutive postseason road games, and Johnson acknowledged cold 
weather would put his team at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not acclimated to it,'' he said. ``We don't like it, we  
don't practice in it, we rarely play in it, we don't live in it, 
and we don't want to live in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Johnson broke into a grin, but he didn't smile  
when discussing the Dolphins' injuries. Leading receiver O.J. 
McDuffie (sprained foot), tight end Troy Drayton (sprained ankle) 
and long snapper Frank Wainright (sprained shoulder) could miss the 
Denver game. Tackle Richmond Webb (torn arm tendon) and guard Kevin 
Donnalley (sore knee) played Saturday, but might miss practice time 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Bowens hurts the run defense just as it gears up to  
deal with 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis. The Dolphins were 
already shorthanded in the front four because end Jason Taylor was 
sidelined for the season by a broken collarbone last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty beat up,'' Johnson said, ``like every team is  
this time of year -- or at least the teams that are still playing.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Trading Begins in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- International trading began at the crack of dawn  
Monday for the euro, the new common currency expected to increase 
Europe's power in the global economy and eventually rival the U.S. 
dollar as the money of choice for traders and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's first dealings in the euro were cautious and subdued.  
It was still dark in Sydney, Australia's financial district when 
trading began at 5 a.m. (1 p.m. EST Sunday), but lights could be 
seen from some of their offices in skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Westpac Bank foreign exchange trading room, there was a  
hum of activity from traders and media taking pictures and 
television footage of the opening of trade in the euro. Traders 
gazed intently at their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just having a small punt so they can say they dealt  
in the euro,'' said Wayne Raven, a senior manager of Westpac's 
corporate, currency and commodity division. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro trading also took place in markets around Asia where banks  
opened earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo and Hong Kong, where Bank of America engaged in euro  
trading, Vice President Yasuhisa Morikuni, said: ``It has been 
quiet so far. We haven't seen any surprises for far this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after trading began in Sydney, the euro was  
selling between $1.1735 and $1.1750. In Tokyo, the new currency was 
trading from $1.1700 to $1.1748. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Asian institutions were buying the new currency and  
European ones were selling it, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks had spent the New Year's holiday weekend preparing to  
launch the world's euro trading. On Monday, most of the modified 
computer systems were working just fine, but at least one bank in 
Sydney reported minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, speculation had run high in Asian newspapers about  
just what the euro would do to the region's troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the financial crisis in Asia and Russia causing anxieties  
about the dollar-dominated currency system, the eyes of the world 
are on the euro, which has a chance of rivaling the U.S. dollar,'' 
Japan's Mainichi newspaper said in a front-page story. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who might have missed the point, the article's  
headline read: ``Topple the Dollar's Dominance!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 European nations that launched the euro Friday represent  
20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent of world trade, 
and they will be a powerful player in the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, one goal of the euro is for it to help the European  
Union forge a common market that is able to stand its ground 
against the United States and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Sunday's official China Daily newspaper said that  
Chinese companies should find it easier to raise money and sell 
goods in Europe with its new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be a real asset in Asia, where many countries are  
fighting brutal economic crises that began in July 1997, with huge 
devaluations in their currency and stock markets and a massive 
exodus of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the China Daily also said the euro is creating new  
headaches, including the fact that exchange rate risks have 
increased as international markets adjust to the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	While electronic trading in the euro began Monday, the first  
business day since New Year's, euro bills and coins will not be 
introduced until January 2002.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Interior Secretariat denied rebel  
claims that the government is waging a war on Indians and guerrilla 
supporters in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a war does not exist,'' the secretariat said in a press  
statement released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatista rebels on Friday accused the government of  
offering Chiapas Indians only ``war and destruction'' and blamed it 
for the Dec. 22, 1997 massacre of 45 Indian villagers in the 
Chiapas hamlet of Acteal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several state police officers have been arrested for failing to  
stop the massacre or helping supply weapons to the pro-government 
group that allegedly carried out the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government blamed the rebels, who rose up in 1994 demanding  
greater democracy and Indian rights, for a lack of progress in 
peace talks that have been stalled since 1996.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori has denied  
allegations by an opposition legislator that he has cancer and said 
he is in perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftist Congressman Javier Diez Canseco told reporters last week  
that Fujimori may have cancer and was using his frequent trips 
abroad to consult with cancer specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My health is very good from top to bottom,'' Fujimori told  
reporters on Saturday. He called Diez Canseco's comments a 
tasteless joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Fujimori's health have circulated since May 1997,  
when the government said that doctors had successfully removed a 
benign tumor from the president's tongue and advised him not to 
speak for several days. 
</P>

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In an effort to combat police  
brutality, Rio's police force will be monitored by a civilian 
review board for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have long been campaigning for this as a means of  
controlling extreme police brutality,'' said James Cavallaro, the 
director of the Brazil office of Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board will offer a toll-free number for citizens to  
file anonymous complaints against police for abuses like murder, 
torture, beatings and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights activists have long complained that Brazil's poorly  
trained and low-paid police routinely beat, torture and execute 
criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board is the idea of Rio de Janeiro state Gov.  
Anthony Garotinho. He has vowed to curb abuses by the city's police 
force, which has a reputation for violence and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Julita Lemgruber, a respected sociologist who will head the new  
review board, said Sunday that ``any democratic society should have 
an organ for citizens to complain about police abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Detains Denver Cult Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEVASSERET ZION, Israel (AP) -- Israeli police detained eight  
adults and six children belonging to a Denver-based apocalyptic 
Christian cult on Sunday and accused the group of planning violent 
acts in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said that the group planned to provoke a bloody shoot-out  
by opening fire on Israeli police and members of the group believed 
that this catastrophic act would hasten the Second Coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the  
streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of 
bringing Jesus back to life,'' said Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, the 
national police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrests were carried out to protect certain sectors of the  
Israeli population and members of the cult themselves who blindly 
follow'' a leader who is now overseas, the police statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult's leader has been identified as Monte Kim Miller.  
</P>
<P>
	The cult members -- including three families as well as  
individuals -- did not resist arrest when police raided two 
apartments in suburbs outside Jerusalem. The Shin Bet, Israel's 
internal security service, was heavily involved in the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police would not release the names of any of the  
suspects arrested. Israeli law prohibits the publication of 
suspects' names until they appear in court. Suspects may be held up 
to 48 hours before their first court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid was led by Jerusalem area commander Yair Yitzhaki.  
Police planned to work with the Interior Ministry to deport the 
suspects, and did not plan to try them. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. embassy official said that a consular official would  
visit those arrested as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the cult members believed that being killed by police ``would lead 
them to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said many of the violent acts were planned for Jerusalem's  
Old City and that one possible location was the Temple Mount, the 
site of Jewish-Arab tensions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members had been under police surveillance for a month.  
They lived in homes in Mevasseret Zion and Moza, well-to-do western 
suburbs of Jerusalem. Police said they were financed by funds 
raised overseas, not necessarily in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The house in Mevasseret Zion was two stories, on a steep  
hillside overlooking Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were so nice, so quiet, so polite.'' said neighbor Rami  
Hanono. He said the children didn't appear to attend school and 
were at home all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight members of the ``Concerned Christians'' cult had  
disappeared from Denver, Colorado, in October and were believed to 
be living in the Jerusalem area. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1997 affidavit by 16-year-old Nicolette Weaver,  
filed in a Boulder District Court proceeding awarding her father 
sole custody of her, her mother -- a cult member -- had said she 
would kill her if ordered to by Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother told me in August '96 that we have only 40 months  
left on Earth,'' the affidavit said. ``My mother told me that if 
Kim Miller told her to kill me, she would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the Concerned Christians who vanished in October  
include members who are white and black, married and single, 
white-collar professionals and unemployed laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	They range in age from infancy to 68.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the 44-year-old former Denver resident who has said  
he's one of the final two witnesses prophesied in the Bible in 
Chapter 11 of the Book of Revelation. He claims he is destined to 
die in the streets of Jerusalem in the final days of December 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Guesses as to the whereabouts of Miller and his followers range  
from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to Toronto to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the missing Concerned Christians occasionally leave  
e-mail and phone messages for those left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police will continue to work in every legal way possible  
to make possible freedom of religion and ritual in Jerusalem and in 
Israel, for all religions, in the year of the millennium'' a 
statement by Yitzhaki said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it will act firmly against the attempts of extreme  
groups to block access to Christians in the year 1999,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NHL To Penalize Blues for Tampering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The NHL will penalize the St. Louis  
Blues for talking to New Jersey's Scott Stevens before he became a 
restricted free agent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils will get the Blues' first-round pick in the 1999  
entry draft, and also can choose to swap first-round picks in the 
2000 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also will get some money, possibly millions of dollars,  
in an announcement expected to come within the week, The Daily News 
reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's announcement comes as a close to a four-year  
investigation. In the summer of 1994, Devils President Lou 
Lamoriello said then-Blues President Jack Quinn had laid the 
groundwork for an offer to Stevens before the beginning of the 
annual free agency period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens had been traded to the Devils from the Blues in  
September 1991. The Blues offered him a four-year contract worth 
$17.5 million in 1994, but the Devils matched the offer and 
retained him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported that the talks between the Blues  
management team and representatives for Stevens happened sometime 
between Sept. 3, 1991 and July 4, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Messages Mixed on Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The exiled Saudi millionaire accused by U.S.  
officials of masterminding two embassy bombings is sending mixed 
messages about his role, telling one U.S. magazine he did not order 
the attacks and another that he ``instigated'' them. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews published in the Jan. 11 issues of Newsweek and  
Time, Osama bin Laden is consistent on two other subjects -- 
defending the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and 
denying that he is ill, as some U.S. reports have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The interviews, released over the weekend, were conducted on  
successive days last month by Pakistani reporters who had received 
clandestine invitations to bin Laden's mountain base in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has offered $5 million for bin Laden's  
capture, citing his alleged role in the Aug. 7 terrorist bombings 
of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden has previously denied involvement in the bombings, and  
repeated that denial in the Newsweek interview, conducted Dec. 22. 
``I did not order them but was very glad for what happened to the 
Anericans there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Dec. 23, he told Time's reporter that he had  
``instigated'' the attacks -- the closest he has come to admitting 
personal involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and  
the Americans... is considered a crime, then let history be a 
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said. ``Our job is to 
instigate, and by the grace of God, we did that, and certain people 
responded to this instigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek quoted bin Laden as saying the bombings were ``Islamic  
revenge on American spies in East Africa,'' carried out by 
``oppressed Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States retaliated 13 days later with cruise missile  
raids on bin Laden's mountain encampment in northern Afghanistan, 
and a plant in Khartoum, Sudan, that was suspected of making nerve 
gas components for bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men arrested later in East Africa and now in custody in the  
United States had nothing to do with the bombings, bin Laden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Time that he knew one of them, Wadih El-Hage, but had  
not seen or heard from him in several years, and told Newsweek that 
the other, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-`Owhali, had been tortured into 
confessing and implicating bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do know is that those who risked their lives to earn  
the pleasure of God are real men,'' Time quoted him as saying. 
``They managed to rid the Islamic nation of disgrace. We hold them 
in the highest esteem... 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray to God to end the plight (of the arrested men) and we  
are confident they will be exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reports that he is in ill health, bin Laden told  
Newsweek, ``The Americans are committing another lie. I'm healthier 
now than at any time before.'' Time said bin Laden seemed ``eager 
to deny reports that he had cancer,'' but used no direct quotes. It 
noted that he walked with a stick because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden told both interviewers he saw nothing wrong with  
acquiring chemical and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious  
duty.... And if I seek to acquire these weapons, I am carrying out 
a duty,'' he said to Time. ``It would be a sin for Muslims not to 
try to possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels from 
inflicting harm on Muslims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Newsweek interview, he called it ``very strange'' that  
America and Israel could have such weapons, ``but if a Muslim state 
like Pakistan tries to defend itself... everything should be done 
to prevent it from doing so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports described bin Laden as holding an AK-47 rifle  
during the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Time quoted aides as saying bin Laden relied solely on radio and  
newspapers for outside contact, and avoids using a portable 
satellite phone because the Americans might use the signal to 
target his location.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Wiberg Wins Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIBOR, Slovenia (AP) -- Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg made a  
stunning comeback Sunday to win the women's World Cup slalom -- her 
first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninth after the first run, Wiberg powered down the foggy and  
chopped-up course 57.55 seconds -- the fastest second run, though 
.22 seconds slower than her first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I could win because the time difference after  
the first run was too big,'' Wiberg said. ``I just thought I would 
be happy finishing in the top five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Olympic winner finished with a combined time of 1  
minute, 54.88 seconds to post her 23rd World Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hilde Gerg, fresh off a super-G victory here Saturday,  
finished second, just .29 seconds off Wiberg's pace. Another Swede, 
Ylva Nowen, placed third at 1:55.37. 
</P>
<P>
	American Kristina Koznick, in second after the opening run, had  
trouble handling the holes that developed along the course in the 
second run and slid to ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course didn't hold up very well,'' said a disappointed  
Koznick, who cried on her trainer's shoulder at the finish-line. 
``Even though I knew there were going to be many ruts, I just made 
too many mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Koznick scored her first victory of the season in a  
night slalom in Semmering, Austria. She said her confidence was not 
shaken, however, for the upcoming World Championships in Vail, 
Colorado in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, who hadn't won a race in two years, proved she is still  
a force to contend with on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``My skiing has been getting better and better each race,''  
Wiberg said. ``Now my goal is to win the Worlds in Vail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her three Olympic and five World Championship  
medals, Wiberg also captured the overall World Cup title in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She also won the slalom in Maribor in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Gerg and Martina Ertl put in a great showing for Germany over  
the two days of racing in Maribor, finishing 1-2 in the super-G on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Germans always ski well in Maribor and this year it was  
the same,'' Gerg said. ``I think it was a very good beginning to 
the new year.''

<HEADLINE> Is Packers' Run Over? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Reggie White didn't watch his career come  
to an end Sunday at 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He heard it.  
</P>
<P>
	White's view of the end zone was blocked on San Francisco  
quarterback Steve Young's 25-yard strike to Terrell Owens with 
three seconds and no timeouts left that sank the Green Bay Packers 
30-27. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the roar,'' White said. ``And I knew it was over.''  
</P>
<P>
	And maybe not just his magnificent career had ended, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it was the sound of an era ending, the heavy-hearted  
pitch of a last hurrah for the green and gold. 
</P>
<P>
	White, the most honored defensive end in league history, helped  
guide Green Bay back to glory after joining the Packers in 1993 as 
the NFL's first marquee free agent. He is retiring, going out on 
the top of his game, if not the top of the football world. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Holmgren now has to decide whether he wants to stay  
in Green Bay and sign a contract extension that will make him the 
league's highest-paid coach, or if he wants to prove himself as a 
personnel man somewhere else -- while still coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, there's two dozen free agents to worry about.  
</P>
<P>
	So, was Sunday's devastating defeat the end of an era?  
</P>
<P>
	White and Holmgren, along with Brett Favre -- who proved to be  
human in 1998 after a three-year MVP run -- and strong safety LeRoy 
Butler, put the title back in Titletown. The seven-year restoration 
project was overseen by general manager Ron Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is an unfortunate loss, but I don't think this is  
the end of an era, no,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	But things will be different at Lambeau Field after the Packers  
failed to become the first NFC team to reach three straight Super 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially without the ``Minister of Defense,'' who now will  
spend his days sacking sin and not quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing this game hurts,'' White said. ``But realizing I'm  
getting ready to go my way hurts even more. It's not going to be 
easy to leave these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre shared a poignant moment with White after the loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I gave him a hug and told him I enjoyed it,'' Favre said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Favre, who threw 23 interceptions during the season and two  
more Sunday, said life goes on without White and maybe without 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie White can't play forever. I can't play forever. Steve  
Young can't play forever. It's got to end sometime,'' Favre said. 
``Reggie White had one of the best seasons of his career. It's 
sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sad to see White's famous club move for the last time; sad for  
everybody but relieved right tackles and reassured quarterbacks who 
will get a better night's sleep knowing White will never add to his 
record 192 1/2 career sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football player,'' Wolf said. ``It's unfortunate  
he has to go out this way and not a winner. But he is a winner in 
his own right. He was a tremendous asset to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White single-handedly showed Green Bay was a place players,  
especially blacks, could love. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it still a place Holmgren will call home?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's uncertainty, certainly, because he now begins  
his ...'' Wolf said, catching himself. ``Only he can address that. 
I took a New Year's vow. I am not discussing Mike Holmgren any more 
in 1999. So, it's all up to him now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, who guided Green Bay to a franchise-record six  
straight playoff berths, didn't want to talk about his future, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to address that now. I don't think this is the  
end of an era, though,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, curiously, Holmgren spoke of the Packers in the past tense  
and the third person plural in his post-game news conference: 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be good for a long time,'' he said of the  
Packers, and later this: ``It was an honor for me to coach Brett.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only Holmgren knows if those were Freudian slips.  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever, Favre said, he'll be a Packer for life and so will  
many other young players such as Dorsey Levens and Mark Chmura. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to figure Reggie's going to hang it up,'' Favre  
said. ``Mike, he may stay, he may go. We hope he stays, he's a 
great coach. But if he goes, Ron will find us a good coach and good 
assistant coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman, a star in the last two Super Bowls and very  
nearly the star Sunday with two TD catches, said he couldn't tell 
if his teammates sensed this was the end of something special. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if guys are feeling anything right now,'' said  
Freeman, whose 15-yard TD catch with 1:56 left put the Packers 
ahead 27-23 before Young's amazing desperation drive. ``I'm still 
numb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're all numb,'' Wolf said. ``But we still have to  
start tomorrow. We have to get over this thing and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without White, and with or without Holmgren.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Owner Mum on Officiating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- This time, Ralph Wilson kept quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bills owner was given a chance to vent in the wake of  
another frustrating loss in which his team pointed fingers at the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who joined in the chorus for instant replay, was fined  
$50,000 by the league for criticizing officials after dubious calls 
contributed to a critical loss in New England in November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Wilson apparently chose to keep both his mouth and  
his checkbook closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills had an apparent touchdown taken away in a 24-17  
wild-card loss to Miami on Saturday, and some players were still 
fuming a day later as they cleaned out their lockers. But Wilson, 
through a spokesman, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills, set back 93 yards by nine penalties in the loss, were  
most critical of the officials' spotting of the ball just inside 
the Miami 1-yard line after an apparent touchdown catch by Andre 
Reed with under two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Bills criticized some of the flags, they waited for  
others that never fell. They claimed two of their players were held 
after Eric Moulds caught a long pass on the Bills' first play and 
fumbled. Moulds and Reed both appeared to be held by Miami 
defensive backs as they struggled to get to the loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said the officiating in the league this season was the  
worst he's seen ``in 20 years.'' And he was not alone in that 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills were still simmering from the Nov. 29 loss at New  
England. After Shawn Jefferson was given a sideline catch on which 
replays showed he didn't get either foot in-bounds, a pass 
interference call on a desperation heave by Drew Bledsoe gave New 
England one more play. Ben Coates' TD won the game for the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson took his anger out on the officials. Then he took his  
lumps. The 80-year-old owner said he wished he could call the stock 
market as well as he could predict incompetence on the part of the 
NFL officials. Teams are prohibited from criticizing the officials 
and he was fined $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who has voted against replay in the past but now is  
championing its return, ripped Paul Tagliabue after the 
commissioner said Wilson would be fined for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need pompous lectures from the commissioner and I feel  
that the $50,000 is not only unwarranted, but punitive in nature. 
The next time he may ask me to sit in the corner,'' Wilson said at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson came away with a game ball when the players showed their  
appreciation for his outspokenness after their 33-20 win in 
Cincinnati, one week after the loss to the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Smith shook his head as he cleaned out his locker on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the answer is,'' he said. ``There were  
definitely some things that were called yesterday that shouldn't 
have been called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then again, we did some things that put ourselves in a bad  
situation, as well.''

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Mars Lander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's newest spacecraft hurtled  
toward Mars today with a shovel to dig for ice and a microphone to 
pick up sounds from the planet's South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander soared into an overcast sky aboard a  
Boeing rocket Sunday afternoon, beginning a journey that will span 
11 months and 470 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first spacecraft to land near the Martian South  
Pole when it parachutes down in December. By then, it will be late 
spring, a time when the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Landing near a pole of a planet where you might see some  
frozen ice, that's neat stuff,'' said Edward Weiler, head of NASA's 
space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's three previous Mars landers plopped down in the  
equatorial desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bunch of rocks, couple hills in the background,'' said Weiler.  
``Now we're landing near a pole. I mean, I don't know what we're 
going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as thrilling will be what the Polar Lander hears.  
</P>
<P>
	The lander is equipped with a tiny microphone, the kind used in  
hearing aids. It was provided by The Planetary Society at no cost 
to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists question whether sound will travel in the thin  
Martian atmosphere and, if it does, whether anything will be heard 
other than the movement of the Polar Lander's robot arm and its 
internal systems. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility the sound of dust or sand blowing against  
the lander might be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, I hope to be wrong, that we'll actually hear  
the wind blowing through the trees,'' said project manager John 
McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 objective of the Polar Lander is to find water, the  
same goal of its companion craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, some 4 
million miles from Earth following its launch three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
Weiler explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- is due to  
touch down Dec. 3. Scientists have yet to pick the exact spot, but 
are aiming for a latitude of about 75 degrees south. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the cushioned Pathfinder, which bounced down amid  
boulders on July 4, 1997, the Polar Lander will come down on three 
legs the same way the two Viking landers did in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on air bags,'' Weiler  
noted, but it should be safer and, what's more, will be 
photographed by an on-board camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander's best feature is a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a  
scoop on the end to scrape beneath the Martian surface. The 
collected dirt will be heated, allowing any water that's present to 
vaporize and be detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also equipped with a pair of cantaloupe-size probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes will hunt for water but at a  
much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment cost $29 million. That's on top of $327 million  
for the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ongoing controversy over whether a Mars meteorite  
contains evidence of ancient life, the Polar Lander carries no 
life-detection instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The only real way to confirm life on Mars, Weiler said, is to  
fetch dirt and rocks. NASA plans to launch a soil-return mission in 
2005; the samples would reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission, unless its microphone hears Elvis or a Martian  
walks by the camera, it's not going to find life on Mars,'' Weiler 
said. ``But it's part of a long-term program.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers To Name Seifert As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE(AP) -- George Seifert, who has the best winning  
percentage of any coach in NFL history, will be the new head coach 
of the Carolina Panthers, The Associated Press learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would not confirm its choice of Seifert to replace the  
fired Dom Capers, but sources said the Panthers were trying to 
arrange a news conference at Ericsson Stadium on Monday to 
introduce their new coach.

<P>
	Seifert, 58, who has been out of coaching since he left the San  
Francisco 49ers after the 1996 season, is to get a multiyear deal 
with Carolina worth about $2 million per season, the sources said. 
In addition to serving as head coach, Seifert is to have a leading 
role in the team's player personnel moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, who won 75.5 percent of his games (108-35) with San  
Francisco from 1989-96, did not immediately return telephone 
messages left Sunday at his home in Los Altos, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's introduction of Seifert would complete a whirlwind  
eight days for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers was fired last Monday after posting a 30-34 record in  
Carolina's first four seasons. Capers helped the 1996 Panthers to 
the NFC West title and a 12-4 record -- both unprecedented feats for 
second-year NFL expansion teams -- but Carolina followed by losing 
21 of 32, including a 4-12 record this past season, when the 
Panthers were hampered by numerous personnel problems and their 
most injury-plagued year yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of Capers' ouster, Seifert arrived in Charlotte. He  
stayed overnight Monday and met with team owner Jerry Richardson on 
Tuesday before flying back to California. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams with coaching vacancies also expressed  
interest in Seifert, and the Panthers also were considering Green 
Bay's Mike Holmgren. But with Holmgren thought to be leaning toward 
either staying with the Packers or going to the 49ers, Carolina 
made a strong push for Seifert, who went 12-4 in his final season 
in San Francisco but was swept by the upstart Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert likely would find part of his new staff already waiting  
for him in Carolina. Richardson said last week he wants to retain 
three of Capers' assistants -- offensive coordinator Gil Haskell, 
tight ends coach Don Breaux and wide receivers coach Richard 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspapers have reported that Ray Rhodes, fired last  
Monday as Philadelphia's coach, could become Seifert's defensive 
coordinator if he is unable to find another head coaching job.

<HEADLINE> `Patch Adams' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Family fare drew audiences to theaters during  
the New Year's holiday as ``Patch Adams,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``You've 
Got Mail'' finishing on top at the box office, estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robin Williams movie ``Patch Adams'' took No. 1 for a second  
weekend with $20.1 million in ticket sales. The film has developed 
into a hit -- even though it was roundly panned by critics for being 
overly sappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really responding to his Golden Globe nomination  
for best actor and they're very taken by the true-life story of 
Patch Adams,'' said Alan Sutton, senior vice president of 
distribution and marketing for Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom,'' which also took critical lumps, was second with $15  
million, followed by the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan comedy ``You've Got 
Mail'' with $14.1 million, according to industry estimates released 
Sunday by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
	Without any new competition -- not a single film debuted in wide  
release -- animated and children's films held their own. Studios 
truck out such fare for the holidays because they know families 
tend to get together and the children are out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt,'' DreamWorks' animated adult fable of  
Moses that reportedly cost more than $100 million to make, was in 
fourth place with $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' had legs -- many of them. In fifth  
place, it lost just 1 percent of its audience in its seventh week 
for a $10 million gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had two other films in the Top 10. The big ape movie  
``Mighty Joe Young'' was sixth with $8.7 million and ``Enemy of the 
State'' was at No. 8 with $5 million, behind the horror film ``The 
Faculty,'' which took in $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek: Insurrection'' and ``Jack Frost'' rounded out the  
list, with $4.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In its seventh week, ``Enemy of the State'' was close to hitting  
the $100 million total gross already exceeded by four other Disney 
films of 1998: ``A Bug's Life,'' ``Waterboy,'' ``Armageddon'' and 
``Mulan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Disney expects to have well over $1.1 billion in North  
American grosses for the box office year running from Jan. 5, 1998 
through Sunday. That would put it ahead even of Paramount, which 
scored with the blockbuster ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a titanic comeback, or actually a comeback from  
`Titanic,''' quipped Phil Barlow, president of Disney's Buena Vista 
Pictures Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies are thriving generally, thanks in part to the soaring  
number of screens, Barlow added. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the take for the top 12 weekend films was down from the  
same weekend last year -- $106.4 million compared to $107.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several films opened in limited release to qualify for Oscar  
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing by Heart,'' an ensemble romance starring Sean Connery,  
Gena Rowlands, Angelina Jolie and Gillian Anderson of ``The 
X-Files,'' had a strong $28,000 on a single screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hi-Lo Country,'' a Western with Woody Harrelson, had a  
meager $6,363 on three screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' the literate, fictional tale of how the  
Bard got his inspiration, was on track to be the year's first 
sleeper hit. Although it finished out of the top 10, the movie 
earned $3.2 million in its fourth weekend, a 23 percent increase 
over the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The war film ``The Thin Red Line,'' playing on just two screens,  
had $376,326 in ticket sales, jumping an enormous 68 percent in its 
second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the well-reviewed ``Down in the Delta,'' the  
first directing effort of noted author Maya Angelou, was tanking 
even though it played on just two screens, with ticket sales down 
27 percent in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Patch Adams,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Stepmom,'' $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``You've Got Mail,'' $14.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $11.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``A Bug's Life,'' $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Mighty Joe Young,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Faculty,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Enemy of the State,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Jack Frost,'' $3.2 million.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Mars Lander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's newest spacecraft hurtled  
toward Mars today with a shovel to dig for ice and a microphone to 
pick up sounds from the planet's South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander soared into an overcast sky aboard a  
Boeing rocket Sunday afternoon, beginning a journey that will span 
11 months and 470 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first spacecraft to land near the Martian South  
Pole when it parachutes down in December. By then, it will be late 
spring, a time when the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Landing near a pole of a planet where you might see some  
frozen ice, that's neat stuff,'' said Edward Weiler, head of NASA's 
space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's three previous Mars landers plopped down in the  
equatorial desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bunch of rocks, couple hills in the background,'' said Weiler.  
``Now we're landing near a pole. I mean, I don't know what we're 
going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as thrilling will be what the Polar Lander hears.  
</P>
<P>
	The lander is equipped with a tiny microphone, the kind used in  
hearing aids. It was provided by The Planetary Society at no cost 
to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists question whether sound will travel in the thin  
Martian atmosphere and, if it does, whether anything will be heard 
other than the movement of the Polar Lander's robot arm and its 
internal systems. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a possibility the sound of dust or sand blowing against  
the lander might be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think, I hope to be wrong, that we'll actually hear  
the wind blowing through the trees,'' said project manager John 
McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 objective of the Polar Lander is to find water, the  
same goal of its companion craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, some 4 
million miles from Earth following its launch three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
Weiler explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- is due to  
touch down Dec. 3. Scientists have yet to pick the exact spot, but 
are aiming for a latitude of about 75 degrees south. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the cushioned Pathfinder, which bounced down amid  
boulders on July 4, 1997, the Polar Lander will come down on three 
legs the same way the two Viking landers did in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on air bags,'' Weiler  
noted, but it should be safer and, what's more, will be 
photographed by an on-board camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander's best feature is a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a  
scoop on the end to scrape beneath the Martian surface. The 
collected dirt will be heated, allowing any water that's present to 
vaporize and be detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also equipped with a pair of cantaloupe-size probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes will hunt for water but at a  
much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment cost $29 million. That's on top of $327 million  
for the Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the ongoing controversy over whether a Mars meteorite  
contains evidence of ancient life, the Polar Lander carries no 
life-detection instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The only real way to confirm life on Mars, Weiler said, is to  
fetch dirt and rocks. NASA plans to launch a soil-return mission in 
2005; the samples would reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission, unless its microphone hears Elvis or a Martian  
walks by the camera, it's not going to find life on Mars,'' Weiler 
said. ``But it's part of a long-term program.''

<HEADLINE> Can the Volunteers Run the Ball? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- For top-ranked Tennessee, the Fiesta Bowl  
battle for the national championship might come to this: Can the 
Vols run the ball? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to that question will be critical Monday night,  
because second-ranked Florida State designs its defense to stop the 
run first. And the Seminoles are good at it. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (12-0) set out this season to lead the Southeastern  
Conference in rushing, and did so despite losing starting tailback 
Jamal Lewis to injury in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest reason for that success is sophomore Travis Henry, a  
stocky, powerful runner who gained 970 yards on 176 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's been so special about this team,'' said senior  
co-captain and kicker Jeff Hall. ``It hasn't been so much the 
people who have been pegged to be successful who have gotten it 
done, but the people who have risen to the occasion and maximized 
their potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry nearly wasn't around to maximize anything. He arrived on  
campus 18 months ago with torn cartilage in his right knee. Then 
Lewis emerged as one of the top freshman runners in the country 
last season, and Henry contemplated a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henry stuck it out, and is glad he did.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an opportunity to step up and show my talent,'' he said  
of Lewis' injury. ``I prepared myself for a chance like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols are in the big game largely because of Henry's  
production. The running game has carried the brunt of the load as 
quarterback Tee Martin felt his way through his first season as a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though Florida State (11-1) has the nation's  
second-best rushing defense -- allowing just 80 yards per game -- the 
Vols say they don't have any choice in their game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 12-0 doing what we do,'' said new offensive coordinator  
Randy Sanders. ``We won't change anything drastically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the things we do may not work against the Florida  
State defense, but we're going to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry says he's ready.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the type of player who runs hard down after down,'' he  
said. ``I'll go in with the mindset that I'm going to get the tough 
yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to worry about the big run. Hopefully by the  
third and fourth quarter, more yards will open up for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Vols can run against FSU, Martin smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been stopped running this year,'' he said. ``I'll  
leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's ground game is by no means grounded if Henry doesn't  
have a big game. Shawn Bryson is extremely fast for a fullback, 
scoring twice this season on long runs alien to most at his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also a good blocker and receiver.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, asked which player overlooked this week could make a big  
difference Monday night, picked Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be a big key going in against the  
Florida State linebackers,'' Martin said. ``I think he's the unsung 
hero of this game.''

<HEADLINE> Pats' Coach Confident He'll Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The comparisons have been constant  
since Pete Carroll succeeded Bill Parcells as coach of the 
Patriots. And Carroll has always finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	So it didn't matter to detractors that he led New England to two  
playoff berths in his two seasons, overcoming numerous injuries to 
do that. Reports surfaced that a bad performance Sunday against 
Jacksonville could put his job in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll, who has three years left on his contract, didn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming back to put together a football team that can win  
the championship,'' he said after Sunday's 25-10 playoff loss to 
the Jaguars. ``With good health and good fortune, we'll do the 
things that we dream about doing and things that we set as our 
goals. And I'm going to be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The player-friendly Carroll stepped into a difficult situation.  
Parcells, one of the NFL's top coaches, had just led the Patriots 
to the Super Bowl, then jumped to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Patriots were 10-6 in Carroll's first season and only a  
one-point loss to Pittsburgh kept them from the AFC title game. 
They were 9-7 this season despite injuries to many key players, 
including Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Ted Johnson and Todd Collins, 
who all missed Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a few days after five other NFL coaches were fired, a member  
of the Patriots' front office reportedly planted a newspaper item 
last week that Carroll might be in trouble, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chris Slade said the Patriots were outplayed and  
outcoached in a 31-10 loss to Parcells and the New York Jets in the 
regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, though, Slade said, ``As far as I'm concerned, Pete  
Carroll's the head coach of the Patriots and that's the way it's 
going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans have spoken fondly of Parcells, a more assertive  
coach, but after the loss no Patriots criticized Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair'' to blame him, strong safety Lawyer  
Milloy said. ``All he does is prepare us to go out and play. He 
didn't think at the beginning of the year he was going to lose so 
many starters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro cornerback Ty Law, beaten by Jimmy Smith for a 37-yard  
scoring pass that put the Jaguars ahead 19-10 early in the fourth 
quarter, said coaching changes don't have to be disruptive. He 
cited the switch to Carroll as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Pete Carroll. I like Bill Parcells,'' Law said. ``We're  
getting to know him (Carroll). He's getting to know us a lot 
better. He's `The Man' on the team right now, so I have no doubt 
that he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete has 100 percent Ty Law's backing, if it means anything.''  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of talk about Pete, but Pete can't get out  
and play for us,'' wide receiver Shawn Jefferson said. ``Good game 
plans ... are put in place. It's up to these guys to execute the 
game plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the only opinion that counts belongs to Patriots  
owner Robert Kraft, who had high praise for Carroll when the coach 
was hired. And Kraft has been silent publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carroll said they've gotten along well,  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been together on everything we've done,'' Carroll said.  
``He has been terrific about it. ... Everything has been very 
amicable.''

<HEADLINE> Seminoles' May Use Substitute QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- It took an extra flight and a bummed ride,  
but Florida State coach Bobby Bowden could be glad he found his way 
to Walla Walla, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Walla Walla is the hometown of freshman Jared Jones, who would  
have to quarterback the second-ranked Seminoles if something 
happens to starter Marcus Outzen against No. 1 Tennessee Monday 
night in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Outzen is a third-string sophomore with only two starts after  
season-ending injuries to Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not have but one more quarterback on scholarship,''  
Bowden said Sunday. ``That's Jared Jones, a freshman from Walla 
Walla, Washington, which I just love to say -- Walla Walla, 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walla Walla might be fun to say, but Bowden lamented that it was  
hard to get there from Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a four hour flight to Seattle,'' Bowden said. ``It's a  
missed plane to Walla Walla. Catch an extra flight over to a town 
about 47 miles away. Bum a ride with some guy who lives in Walla 
Walla and finally get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting there paid off when Jones, a highly touted prep star,  
accepted a Florida State scholarship last year. Since then, Jones 
has gone from Walla Walla to preparing for a national championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I keep in my mind most is ... try not to worry about  
things you can't control,'' Jones said. ``I can't control if Marcus 
gets hurt. If it happens, I'll have to deal with it the best I 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had expected to redshirt this season, but after Weinke  
went down late in the season, Bowden decided he had to see what he 
could do, anticipating the situation Florida State will be in 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' only action, mop-up duty in a 24-7 victory over Wake  
Forest, was not impressive. He completed 2 of 6 for 8 yards and was 
intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden gave a deadpan account of what happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``First pass, got a guy wide open,'' he said. ``He's got plenty  
of time. He bounces it to him. Next pass, the guy's open. He 
bounces another one. I'm thinkin' `Oh-oh, that ain't the way you 
complete passes -- bouncing 'em. We ain't getting 'em on the second 
bounce.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden insists the Seminoles could win with Jones, but also he  
is realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a good one, but he's not ready.'' Bowden  
said. ``Our chances to win are better if Outzen is there.''

<HEADLINE> Chattanooga Times Closes Its Doors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- The staff of 130-year-old The  
Chattanooga Times emptied their desks and said their goodbyes 
Sunday while putting out the morning newspaper's final edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times has merged with its afternoon rival, the Chattanooga  
Free Press. The first edition of the combined The Chattanooga 
Times/Chattanooga Free Press comes out Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a death,'' said editorial writer Pat Wilcox, who  
started at the Times as a college intern and has worked there for 
27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chattanooga, once the home of fiercely competitive family-owned  
newspapers, had been the last Tennessee city with two dailies and 
one of 53 U.S. cities with at least two newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Hussman Jr., chief executive officer of WEHCO Media Inc.,  
announced plans in November to buy the Times in November from the 
13 great-grandchildren of Adolph Ochs, who became an owner and 
publisher in 1878 -- 18 years before acquiring The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Times' last day, publisher Paul Neely provided sandwiches  
and cookies as the normally quiet Sunday newsroom filled with 
staffers and their children. People hugged, shared stories and 
cried as copy editors sat at their computers putting together the 
paper's last edition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been extremely difficult, a roller coaster ride,'' said  
Billy Weeks, the Times photo editor who will run the photo 
department at the new paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Of an editorial staff of about 60, 14 full-time staffers were  
laid off and at least four others chose to retire or find other 
work. Some Free Press workers were laid off as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochs was 20 years old in 1878 when he paid $250 for the  
publisher's title and half-interest in the paper. He became full 
owner two years later, emphasizing objective coverage of political 
and city issues at a time when many papers were shaped by political 
parties or their publishers' beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Neely said it would take ``some iron will and some time'' for  
the staffs of the two papers to learn to work together.

<HEADLINE> Net-Mania Reigns on Wall Street / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a new year dawns on Wall Street, many  
investors are faced with a thorny problem: What to do, or what not 
to do, about the mania for Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Any prudent adviser will tell you how dangerous it is to try to  
ride this wave, which has lately broadened from technology 
companies to merchandisers engaged in Internet commerce, commonly 
known as ``E-tailing.'' By any traditional measure, these stocks 
typically sell at outlandish prices. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest names in the field, the book and music dealer  
Amazon.com, has seen its shares skyrocket more than 1,300 percent 
in the past 12 months. Though the company has not yet reported its 
first dollar of profit, investors have assigned it a market value 
greater than many of the biggest, long-established names in the 
retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, shares of both established and new companies that  
announce plans for E-tailing ventures routinely jump 50 percent, 
100 percent or more in a single day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few days, America Online has been added to the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, where it immediately 
ranks among the top 10 percent in market value, and Charles Schwab 
&AMP; Co. has surpassed longtime financial titan Merrill Lynch in 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow I have the feeling that this is all going to end  
badly,'' says Ray DeVoe, a veteran market analyst at Legg Mason 
Wood Walker Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``An old saying in Wall Street is that the high-flyers of a bull  
market all seem to sell around $5 a share at the bottom of the 
cycle. This looks to me like another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if you simply adopt a hands-off policy to any investments  
with links to the Internet, you run the very real risk of watching 
from the sidelines as a dramatic story of economic progress keeps 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	For individuals managing only their own money, this may mean  
nothing more than lost opportunity. But for professionals making 
fiduciary decisions, other things like their jobs and their 
reputations may be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to own tech in a portfolio,'' says Fred Taylor, chief  
investment officer at New York's U.S. Trust Co., which has been in 
the business of managing wealthy people's money for nearly 150 
years. ``You just can't have only yesterday's stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the game has been going lately, investors may find  
themselves suddenly in the midst of the action even if they never 
sought to buy an Internet stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of staunch tech-avoiders own stocks like Schwab, or  
shares of some established catalog or specialty retailer that 
suddenly becomes a hot Internet property when attention focuses on 
its World Wide Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	So before you conclude that you're not involved in Netmania,  
check the latest list of portfolio holdings from any stock mutual 
fund you may own. 
</P>
<P>
	Once you truly get away from the Internet hubbub, many other  
sectors of the stock market are remarkably quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the last few sessions of 1998, calculates market  
strategist John Manley at Salomon Smith Barney, just 50 of the 500 
stocks in the S&AMP;P composite accounted for 94 percent of the index's 
gain, which came to a little more than 22 percent for the year to 
date. That left the other 450 stocks with a gain of about 1.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stocks, in the aggregate, made no progress at all. And an  
investor warned that Internet mania might be a sign of an impending 
market break might easily reply, ``Bear market? We just had one 
three months ago!'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what this all means for the future remains very much a  
mystery. As for the recent past, summarizes Manley, ``while 1998 
may be remembered as a great year for equities and equity 
investors, in truth there was very little easy money to be made.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Mars Lander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A Mars lander equipped with a robot  
arm and shovel rocketed away Sunday on a 470 million-mile quest to 
uncover frozen water near the planet's South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Mars Polar Lander took off aboard a Boeing rocket at  
exactly 3:21 p.m. The rain that managers had feared stayed away, 
allowing NASA to meet the instantaneous launch window despite an 
overcast sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, the final rocket motor fired, kicking  
the Polar Lander out of Earth orbit and putting it on an 11-month 
course for Mars. Launch managers cheered and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``My birthday is tomorrow and this is just about the best  
birthday present I've ever had,'' said project scientist Richard 
Zurek, who is turning 52. ``Right now, I'm feeling a lot younger 
than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is bound for the frosty fringes of Mars' south  
polar cap. It's due to arrive in December when it's late spring and 
the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be virgin territory: No spacecraft has ever ventured so  
far south on Mars. As a result, scientists' expectations are high. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal is to find water ice in the Martian soil. Where  
there's water, NASA's top space scientist says, there could be 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of reason to believe there's water on Mars in  
the form of ice,'' he added. ``But until you actually land there 
and find it and measure it, you can't say for sure. That's one 
thing I think this mission will demonstrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- has three  
legs as well as a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a scoop on the end to 
scrape beneath the Martian surface. The collected dirt will be 
heated, allowing any water that's present to vaporize and be 
detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It carries no life-detection equipment. The only real way to  
confirm life on Mars, Weiler says, is to fetch rocks and soil. NASA 
plans to launch a soil-return mission in 2005; the samples would 
reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander also is equipped with a pair of probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes also will hunt for water but at  
a much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is a companion to NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter  
launched last month. The two missions cost $327 million and Deep 
Space 2 another $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has landed spacecraft on Mars only three times: the two  
Vikings in 1976 and Pathfinder in 1997. All three landed in the 
Martian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings came down on three legs, the same as the Polar  
Lander will. The Pathfinder, cushioned with newfangled air bags, 
bounced down amid boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler acknowledges that the Polar Lander's Dec. 3 touchdown at  
a latitude of about 75 degrees south -- which will be photographed 
by an on-board camera -- won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on 
air bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is appealing, though, he said, is the fact that ``we're  
landing in an area that we've never landed in before, where we 
think there will be some frost, if not ice, in the layered terrain. 
Maybe a very interesting color scheme. We really don't know what 
we're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what they're going to hear, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is equipped with a tiny microphone. Many  
believe the only sounds that might be heard in the thin Martian 
atmosphere will be the movement of the robot arm and the internal 
systems of the lander. There's a possibility, however slight, that 
the sound of dust or sand blowing against the lander also might be 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the fun part of science,'' said Weiler. ``We don't know  
what we're going to hear. Except I don't think we'll hear Elvis. At 
least I hope not.''

<HEADLINE> Reluctant Bride Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Two men were arrested for allegedly  
kidnapping and trying to smuggle into the United States a woman who 
refused an arranged marriage to one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid Nader, 29, and Jamal Nasser Aziz, 37, both natives of  
Afghanistan, were arrested Friday after authorities at the 
U.S.-Canada border found the woman bound and gagged in a car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol E. Heckman on Saturday ordered them  
held without bail until at least Monday, when they are to attend a 
detention hearing. They face kidnapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Mine Betoor was kidnapped after refusing  
marriage to Nader, which had been arranged by her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were arrested after an inspector at an Immigration and  
Naturalization Service inspection booth at the Rainbow Bridge in 
Niagara Falls sensed something suspicious about Aziz, who was 
driving the car, and asked him to open the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, he discovered Nader and Ms. Betoor of Toronto, who was  
handcuffed. Her feet were tied with ropes and a scarf was stuffed 
in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Betoor, whose age was not released, told authorities that  
Aziz, her uncle, threatened to kill her if she made noise or tried 
to escape. Ms. Betoor was released after treatment at Niagara Falls 
Memorial Medical Center for undisclosed injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	After refusing to travel to Nader's home in San Francisco to be  
married, Ms. Betoor was knocked out with a blow to the head and 
imprisoned in the basement of a home in Etobicoke, Ont., for more 
than two days before being forced into the trunk, police said.

<HEADLINE> Two Guards Die in Calif. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- Two armed security guards were shot to  
death and two others were critically wounded Sunday after 
apparently arguing with a man at the apartment complex where they 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards were inside or standing near a guard shack at the New  
Wilmington Arms complex when they were shot shortly before 5:30 
a.m., police Lt. Danny Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate arrests. Sneed said the shooter appeared  
to be a man who ``frequents the building'' but it wasn't clear if 
he was a resident. 
</P>
<P>
	All four guards worked for a Torrance company called  
International Total Services. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether they fired back at their attacker, as the  
area has no security cameras. No weapon was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton, about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has been  
plagued by gang and drug-related violence. But residents of the 
Wilmington Arms said that until the shooting they felt safe inside 
the block-long, two-story complex with its neat stucco apartments 
and trim lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is evil and this is hate. I do feel frightened. I feel  
like we are targets,'' said Shirley Thompson, who has lived in the 
complex for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead guards were identified as Remigio Molinao, 49, and  
Rodrico Paz, 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Saul Conner Martinez, 59, and Rodolso Bombarda, 52, were listed  
in critical condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical 
Center.

<HEADLINE> Time Gets Osama bin Laden Admission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Exiled Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden appears  
to admit in a Time magazine interview that he instigated the 
terrorist bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview seems to be the closest that bin Laden has come to  
admitting a role in the deadly attacks. He has previously denied 
any role. 
</P>
<P>
	Time said the interview was conducted Dec. 22 at bin Laden's  
secret encampment in Afghanistan. He was specifically asked if he 
was responsible for the embassy attacks, and he couched his 
response in religious references -- like he did with most questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the instigation for jihad (holy war) against the Jews and  
the Americans... is considered a crime, then let history be a 
witness that I am a criminal,'' bin Laden said in the Jan. 11 issue 
of Time magazine. ``Our job is to instigate, and by the grace of 
God, we did that, and certain people responded to this 
instigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 24, a Pakistani news agency had quoted bin Laden as  
saying he was ``not involved'' in the bombing ``but I don't regret 
what happened there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have indicted bin Laden on charges of  
masterminding terrorist bomb attacks on American embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania Aug. 7 that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. 
He also is suspected in terrorist attacks on U.S. targets in Saudi 
Arabia and other incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States retaliated 13 days later with cruise missile  
raids on bin Laden's mountain hideout in northern Afghanistan, and 
a plant in Khartoum, Sudan, that was suspected of making nerve gas 
components for bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew two men in custody in the United States in  
connection with the bombings, bin Laden replied: ``What I do know 
is that those who risked their lives to earn the pleasure of God 
are real men. They managed to rid the Islamic nation of disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden said he knew one of the two, Wadi el-Hage, but had not  
seen or heard from him in several years. He said el-Hage ``has 
nothing to do with the U.S. allegations,'' and implied that the 
second man, Mohamad Rashed-Al'Owhali, also is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Al-'Owhali are charged with more than  
200 counts of murder. El Hage is accused of lying about his 
relationship with bin Laden's organization.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Idea Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using stock market investments to boost the  
supply of money for Social Security is a complex and controversial 
idea that will not easily become a reality, even though President 
Clinton gave lawmakers the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't as simple a question as it appears at first  
blush,'' said Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., chairman of a House 
subcommittee overseeing Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans long have favored plans that would try to  
fatten the retirement program by investing its money on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with lawmakers on Dec. 9, Clinton endorsed private  
investment, in general, as one way to help prevent a cash shortfall 
expected after more than 75 million baby boomers retire and begin 
collecting benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and the  
American Association of Retired Persons -- the nation's largest 
organization of older adults -- also are offering conditional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: Using the stock market to try for higher  
investment returns is more appealing than the alternatives -- deep 
retirement benefit cuts or sharp tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all counting on these better returns,'' said AARP  
lobbying chief John Rother. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consensus ends there.  
</P>
<P>
	Disagreements still to be resolved include even the most basic  
question: Who would do the investing -- individual Americans in 
personal accounts or the government by investing people's Social 
Security contributions in bulk? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has taken no position on this, although some top  
advisers, including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, have voiced 
worries about both choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republican lawmakers -- along with Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan -- are against bulk investments that would mean 
government ownership of corporate stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the federal government running America's  
corporations, that's socialism, and we sure don't want politics 
getting involved in the investments,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	A powerful lobbying coalition of business and conservative  
groups, from the National Association of Manufacturers to the 
Center for New Black Leadership, also is opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats argue it would be possible to set up a board of  
trustees to insulate Social Security's investment decisions from 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative -- a new system of individual retirement savings  
accounts -- long has been favored by many Republicans and more 
recently won support from some key Democrats. Some government 
benefits likely still would be guaranteed as a safety net, and 
supporters say the power of Wall Street would leave most people 
better off. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shift would be tricky. The first problem is where money  
for the accounts would come from initially -- not to mention how 
much it would cost just to set up and maintain accounts for 148 
million American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many supporters suggest filling the accounts by diverting some  
of the Social Security taxes that workers now pay. But all those 
taxes -- and more -- will be needed in coming decades to pay benefits 
promised to aging baby boomers. Also, baby boomers do not have 
enough working years left to get much out of new private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ideas to generate money to cover transition costs,  
including raising the retirement age or a tax increase for the 
wealthy, already are drawing fire. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, consensus is growing for using budget  
surpluses, administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the surplus and the possibility of higher returns, we  
increase the chance of having a Social Security reform package that 
keeps a strong standard of living for America's senior citizens and 
could be politically palatable enough to pass,'' said Clinton's top 
economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one can predict how much money the nation will have to  
spare in coming years, and already there is a clamor to spend any 
surpluses for other purposes -- from tax cuts to education or 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to talk about how much of the surplus  
could be used for Social Security without starving other 
priorities,'' said Roger Hickey of the Institute for America's 
Future, coordinating a grass-roots campaign against private 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That opposition includes the AFL-CIO and civil rights groups  
such as the NAACP. They argue the accounts would leave individuals 
-- especially low-wage workers -- at the mercy of the stock market . 
</P>
<P>
	Rother said the AARP would be willing to support personal  
accounts only if the current system's retirement income guarantees 
also are maintained somehow. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and prominent economists are working on a variety of  
ideas to resolve such concerns. Democrats and Republicans have 
agreed to write a summary of the options that could be used as the 
basis for future negotiations. Many are cautiously optimistic that 
compromise can be reached despite the complexities.

<HEADLINE> NHL: Blues Tampered With Stevens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The NHL will penalize the St. Louis  
Blues for talking to New Jersey's Scott Stevens before he became a 
restricted free agent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils will get the Blues' first-round pick in the 1999  
entry draft, and also can choose to swap first-round picks in the 
2000 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also will get some money, possibly millions of dollars,  
in an announcement expected to come within the week, The Daily News 
reported in Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's announcement comes as a close to a four-year  
investigation. In the summer of 1994, Devils president Lou 
Lamoriello said then-Blues president Jack Quinn had laid the 
groundwork for an offer to Stevens before the beginning of the 
annual free agency period. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens went to the Devils from the Blues in September 1991 as  
compensation for St. Louis signing free agent Brendan Shanahan. The 
Blues offered Stevens a four-year contract worth $17.5 million in 
1994, but the Devils matched the offer and retained him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News reported that the talks between the Blues  
management team and representatives for Stevens happened sometime 
between Sept. 3, 1991 and July 4, 1994.

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Before the internal combustion engine dies and  
pollution-free, fuel-cell powertrains have a chance to replace it, 
motorists likely will see technologies that blend the old with the 
new. 
</P>
<P>
	They include electric-gasoline hybrids, synthetic diesel fuels  
and natural gas-powered engines. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the theory behind much of the research at  
DaimlerChrysler AG, which unveiled a trio of concept cars and 
trucks Sunday that represent the German-American automaker's 
efforts to find near-term alternatives to conventional gasoline 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't bet the farm on any single technology,'' Thomas T.  
Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's North American arm, said 
at the media preview of the Detroit auto show. ``We're pretty 
excited about fuel cells in the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the short term, DaimlerChrysler is betting that high-tech  
diesel fuels will meet tougher emissions standards in the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	That bet is demonstrated in the Dodge Power Wagon, an oversized  
pickup packed with a 7.2-liter, turbocharged diesel engine designed 
to run on a synthetic diesel-type fuel derived from natural gas. 
Because the fuel is made from natural gas, it lacks the polluting 
sulfur that comes from crude oil-derived fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine generates 250 horsepower and incredible pulling power  
while using 40 percent less fuel than a comparable gasoline 
powerplant. Which leads to another point DaimlerChrysler wants to 
make with its latest concepts: High performance and cleaner 
technology can go hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a monster,'' said Steve Brueckner,  
DaimlerChrysler's senior manager of advanced diesel engine 
technology. ``But you can drive this and still feel good about 
yourself in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker hopes the hulking truck will draw enough attention  
to refocus the debate on diesel technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Diesels emit about half as much carbon dioxide as gasoline  
engines. Carbon dioxide is a so-called greenhouse gas that is 
believed to be contributing to global warming. But conventional 
diesels also release more soot and oxides of nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have been lobbying against diesels, even as a  
near-term solution. California regulators recently adopted tougher 
vehicle emissions rules that did away with special exemptions for 
diesel engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union of Concerned Scientists argues that the refining  
process for the Power Wagon's new fuel generates twice the 
greenhouse gases of refining conventional diesel, which reduces the 
engine's pollution savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp said such problems can be resolved through continued  
research, however. Of all the technologies DaimlerChrysler is 
studying, the diesel hybrid is the closest to being practical for 
everyday use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also unveiled two other concept cars Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler Citadel, a sport sedan with a hybrid powertrain,  
uses a V6 engine to drive the rear wheels and an electric motor to 
drive the front wheels. DaimlerChrysler officials say the result is 
the equivalent power of a V8, lower emissions and V6 fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodge Charger R/T uses a supercharged, 325-horsepower V8  
engine powered by compressed natural gas and is designed to be a 
clean-burning muscle car. Its key technology is a new storage tank 
that takes up less space than a typical, heavy tank needed for 
compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with natural gas is there is no widespread system of  
filling stations. For now, the best hope for natural gas vehicles 
is with business and government fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	At last week's Los Angeles Auto Show, DaimlerChrysler also  
unveiled an experimental fuel-cell-powered sport utility vehicle 
called the Jeep Commander. It is designed to use methanol as its 
main energy source, which would be converted on board to the 
hydrogen a fuel cell needs to create electricity. At present, 
however, the system does not work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long term, that's the right way,'' Stallkamp said. ``It's the  
cleanest and most efficient.''

<HEADLINE> Moss Wins AP Offensive Rookie Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just like Randy Moss to run away from the competition.  
</P>
<P>
	The game-breaking wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings was a  
landslide winner of The Associated Press' NFL Offensive Rookie of 
the Year award Sunday. Moss, who led the NFL with 17 touchdown 
receptions and averaged 19 yards per catch, received 44 votes from 
a nationwide panel of 47 sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the top overall pick in  
the 1998 draft, got two votes. The other vote went to Jacksonville 
running back Fred Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who refused to be interviewed after learning he won the  
award, was chosen 21st in the draft. Although he was an 
All-American and a dangerous receiver at Marshall, off-field 
problems made most NFL teams leery of taking him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings had no reservations, and were rewarded with an  
All-Pro year in which Moss made 69 receptions for 1,313 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And Moss wasn't even at full strength the entire season,  
bothered by a sprained ankle he injured while playing basketball in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it before: You won't see all of Randy until next  
year,'' coach Dennis Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss helped the Vikings produce the league's best record (15-1),  
and set an NFL record with 556 points. He found many ways to get 
free deep, and if he didn't, he used his size (6-foot-4) and 
tremendous leaping ability to outjump defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the things we've done and the success we've had,  
we've had huge explosiveness,'' offensive coordinator Brian Billick 
said. ``He's brought the offense to a critical mass. He's taken it 
from an offense that is one of the best in the league to 
challenging, maybe, the all-time best, based on points and 
yardage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Can Moss be one of the best ever? Green, who was an assistant  
coach during Jerry Rice's early days in San Francisco, has some 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're different style of players,'' he said. ``Jerry  
has had great health. Randy had the disadvantage of coming in and 
overcoming an ankle. But ... it's clear to everybody that Randy has 
exceptional speed, exceptional eye-hand coordination, and those 
things have held up for him so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss had two TD receptions and 95 yards in his NFL debut and  
never slowed down. He drew national attention in a Monday night 
victory at Green Bay, where he had 52- and 44-yard TDs, gaining 190 
yards on five catches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going out there playing,'' Moss said during the  
season. ``There's nothing that comes that I get down on myself or 
try to outdo anybody. I just try and do my job. I don't talk trash. 
You'll never hear me talk to a defender. They get paid to do what 
they do, I get paid to do what I do. My job is to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rookie did that better this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Moss is the fourth Vikings player to win the award. Last year's  
winner was Tampa Bay running back Warrick Dunn.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Ice Shut Down Midwest Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The year's first major winter storm pummeled the eastern half of  
the country Saturday with more than a foot of snow in the upper 
Midwest and freezing rain as far south as the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to and from major Midwest  
hubs, frustrating travelers trying to get home after the holidays. 
The storm was expected to spread its icy, dangerous driving 
conditions to the Northeast on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday night, the storm had dumped 17 inches at Chicago's  
Midway Airport, 12 inches in Milwaukee and 11 inches on Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport. More than 50 of Indiana's counties and cities 
declared snow emergencies, banning unnecessary travel. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen deaths throughout the region were blamed on the  
storm, which packed gusts of 55 mph and blew drifts up to 8 feet 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service even quit delivering mail in the Indianapolis  
area. Rain, slush and freezing temperatures made it too dangerous 
for carriers to walk their routes, said Postmaster Mike Lamborne. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, American Airlines  
canceled all flights through midnight Saturday and United shut down 
everything after midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	United spokesman Matt Triaca said anyone planning to fly out of  
O'Hare should wait until Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA canceled nearly 400 morning flights at its main hub in St.  
Louis. The shutdown triggered delays and other cancellations across 
the country, including Denver and New York City's three major 
airports. Northwest Airlines shut down about 150 flights systemwide 
and Delta canceled dozens of flights to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Near-blizzard conditions in the north and glazed roadways  
farther south sent drivers spinning off roads from Wisconsin to New 
Jersey to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hardly see driving to work. I prayed all the way to  
work,'' Belinda Bates, a hostess at a Detroit restaurant, said 
Saturday. ``You can't hardly see cause the snow is coming down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, more than 110 vehicles were involved in two  
massive pileups on Interstate 94, and at least one person died in 
the accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern flank of the storm carried tornadoes and severe  
thunderstorms into Florida. More than a dozen homes and cars were 
destroyed by tornadoes and high winds in the northern part of the 
state, while more than 100 homes to the south in Palm Beach County 
were flooded by heavy rains.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM Escapes Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful bomb shattered a bridge and  
killed four people Sunday shortly before Pakistan's prime minister 
was to cross it. Police said a delay at home saved the leader and 
his family from the assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the bombing, which also left three people  
wounded and two missing in rubble, was carried out by an ethnic 
party formerly allied with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
	The roar of the 4:50 a.m. explosion could be heard for miles  
around Raiwind, the site of Sharif's private residence, 13 miles 
from Lahore. Police said the bomb exploded when he normally crosses 
the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif's wife, Kusloom, said she just couldn't get her family  
moving this particular morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a delay in our preparation and we were at home when  
the blast occurred,'' she told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said Sharif was unshaken  
by the explosion: ``He is more concerned about those who died and 
were wounded in the explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three civilians and a police officer died. Police say they fear  
another two people still may be buried in the rubble. Three 
policemen were wounded, according to doctors and police officers in 
Lahore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating all the aspects of the case,'' Hussain  
said, ``but it is too early to blame someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police, however, suspect the ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement. A  
police source speaking on condition of anonymity said three MQM 
workers have been arrested in the southern city of Karachi in 
connection with the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also raided MQM offices in Lahore, but made no arrests.  
</P>
<P>
	MQM leaders say blaming their group is another attempt by  
Sharif's government to destroy their political base in southern 
Sindh province and force their leaders underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government wants to use this incident to launch a fresh  
crackdown on our party,'' said Farooq Sattar, an MQM spokesman at a 
news conference in Karachi. ``They want to eliminate the MQM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif blames the MQM for most of the violence in Karachi, the  
capital of southern Sindh province and Pakistan's largest city of 
14 million, which has been controlled by the MQM since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people died in political and religious violence  
there last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The MQM, which represents Urdu-speaking people who immigrated  
from British India at independence in 1947, denies the accusations 
and says the government is engaging in ``state-sponsored 
terrorism'' against its ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif split with MQM in October and pledged to end the violence  
in Karachi.

<HEADLINE> Two Guards Die in Calif. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMPTON, Calif. (AP) -- Two armed security guards were shot to  
death and two others critically wounded Sunday at an apartment 
complex, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards were inside or standing near a guard shack at the  
Wilmington Arms complex when they were shot shortly before 5:30 
a.m. by at least one gunman, police Lt. Danny Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests were made and the identities of the victims were not  
immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	One guard died at the scene and the other at Martin Luther King  
Jr.-Drew Medical Center, where two others underwent surgery and 
were listed in critical condition, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the guards fired back at their attacker,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who had argued with the guards earlier may have shot them,  
although it was unclear how many attackers were involved, police 
said. The area lacked security cameras and no weapon was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton is about 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Takes Show on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its Washington home, the Smithsonian  
Institution reflects all stone and brick and permanence. But on the 
road it turns into a pretty spry outfit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine art traveled from junction to junction by rail in one  
mobile Smithsonian show, the train becoming the art gallery. 
Highbrow glass creations sparkled at the Silver Dollar City 
amusement park in Branson, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The flash of Broadway, the forlorn prairie schoolhouse, the  
murky mysteries of the Florida manatee all are being celebrated in 
shows moving from the National Mall to a shopping mall near you. 
</P>
<P>
	Or to a library, school, museum, theater or historical society --  
wherever the like-minded congregate, a touch of the human 
experience, on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been trying more and more to branch out and reach people  
where they truly live,'' said Anna Cohn, director of the 
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. ``Our focus 
is on reaching the largest number of people in the widest variety 
of places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those places range from Miami to Menomonie, Wis., both planning  
to play host to ``Red, Hot &AMP; Blue,'' a tribute to Broadway and 
Hollywood musicals. No fewer than three exhibitions about quilts 
and the people who make them have been on tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The traveling exhibits vary in size as much as the venues do.  
</P>
<P>
	``Barn Again: Celebrating an American Icon,'' comprises several  
dozen panels of photographs of farm buildings, along with some 
objects, that a site can exhibit for under $500. Still in 
preparation is an extravaganza marking discoveries of the Hubble 
telescope, scheduled to open in May at a cost to exhibitors of 
$100,000 for each eight-week stint. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Red, Hot &AMP; Blue,'' opening this month, the Smithsonian is  
teaming with Turner Classic Movies and the League of Historic 
American Theaters to take an exhibit showcasing the history of 
classic musicals on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorn of the theater and film artifacts that helped make the  
exhibit a hit in Washington, the much smaller touring version 
features kiosks highlighting the stars, composers and other 
creative forces behind musicals, as well as a video drawn from 
Turner's extensive archives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian has been taking exhibits out of Washington since  
1952, but venues traditionally were large urban museums and foreign 
embassies until the 1976 bicentennial. That's when the institution 
began fanning out far and wide and into smaller places. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Ms. Cohn said, ``We have an unrivaled presence in rural  
America,'' as well as a reach into the traditional large sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as adapting some of the institution's popular Washington  
exhibits for the road, the traveling service creates some 
independently. Working with Woody Guthrie's family and Smithsonian 
recordings, it is putting together a show on the Depression-era 
folk singer that will contain his song manuscripts, illustrations, 
home movies and more. 
</P>
<P>
	Further ahead, 40 artists, architects and designers are creating  
time capsules marking the century's achievements and values. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millennium Messages'' will begin touring early in 2000. When  
it's done, the capsules will somehow, somewhere, disappear from 
view for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian notes the first known time capsule, buried on  
the site of the 1939 World's Fair, was made to last 5,000 years and 
contains a slide rule, a women's hat and messages from the likes of 
Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
	What might the new capsules hold to represent  
turn-of-the-century civilization? A computer mouse? The Smithsonian 
itself seems to have one foot in each century, rolling out the 
trucks and trains like a traveling circus of old while tackling a 
topic here and there solely online, such as ``Rotten Truth (About 
Garbage).'' 
</P>

	So far, the Internet has been more of a boon than a crowd-buster  
for museums, a way to drum up interest without persuading people to 
stay home, skip the show and see it on a computer screen.

<P>
	``I wonder often, in the next generation, or in the next two  
generations, what the impact might be,'' Ms. Cohn said. But for 
now, she said, people seem to value the direct encounter between 
viewer and object, ``a contemplative antidote to the ferocious 
speed of the electronic age.''

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About the Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Eleven European nations are adopting the euro as their shared  
currency. Euro banknotes and coins won't be in circulation until 
2002, but the euro's impact will begin being noticed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,  
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	EXCHANGE RATES: The new currency is worth: 1.95583 German marks,  
6.55957 French francs, 1,936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish 
pesetas, 2.20371 Dutch guilders, 40.3399 Belgian francs, 13.7603 
Austrian schillings, 200.482 Portuguese escudos, 5.94573 Finnish 
markka, 0.787564 Irish pounds, and 40.3399 Luxembourg francs. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was expected to start trading Monday, after the long  
holiday weekend, at about $1.17, 133 Japanese yen and 70 British 
pence. 
</P>
<P>
	FINANCIAL MARKETS: Starting Monday, stocks, bonds and mutual  
funds will be quoted in euros. Inter-bank dealings will be in 
euros. Public debts will be converted into euros. 
</P>
<P>
	BUSINESS: Banks are offering clients the choice of accounts in  
euros or national currencies. Some multinational companies intend 
to switch immediately, but most firms plan to stay with national 
currencies for now. Companies will have to decide whether to use 
euros for tax returns, account statements or bookkeeping. The euro 
should make it easier and cheaper to transfer funds from 
country-to-country and streamline international operations. Banks 
will offer financing and cash-management options in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	PRIVATE CITIZENS: Stores are phasing in dual-pricing in euros  
and national currencies, so customers can better compare prices 
between countries. Cash payments, though, will remain in the old 
currencies until 2002. Americans and other visitors will still have 
to change money. Banks will offer euro-denominated accounts, euro 
checking accounts and credit-card bills in euros. Consumers will be 
able to pay in euros by credit or debit card, or by check, but only 
at those retailers switching early.

<HEADLINE> Fiesta Bowl Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Ohio State coach John Cooper has made his  
appeal to the voters in The Associated Press poll: If No. 2 Florida 
State barely beats No. 1 Tennessee in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, 
consider the Buckeyes for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden says it won't work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,''  
Bowden said Sunday. ``John might have the best team in the nation, 
but if Tennessee wins, it will be the national champion. And if we 
win, we will be national champions. That's the way it was drawn up 
this year, and I sympathize with John because I've been in his 
place before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Bowl Championship Series setup, the Fiesta Bowl  
winner automatically finishes No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' 
poll. No. 3 Ohio State, 11-1 after a 24-14 win over Texas A&AMP;M in 
the Sugar Bowl, cannot be considered for the title in the coaches' 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP media poll, which has no such restrictions, will be  
released early Tuesday after the 70 voters cast their ballots. It's 
certainly a longshot, but at least the Buckeyes would have a chance 
to share the title. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Seminoles win, they would improve to 12-1, and they also  
have a win over Texas A&AMP;M -- 23-14 in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Florida State defensive end Tony Bryant: ``They lost one  
game. We lost one game. They won their bowl game. I think the 
Fiesta Bowl should decide who the national champion is, but it's 
not up to us. We can just hope and pray that if we win, we will be 
national champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEART-TO-HEART:* On the Monday after Florida State's 24-7 loss  
to North Carolina State, coach Bobby Bowden had a rare 
``heart-to-heart'' with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have not responded if they wanted to,'' Bowden said  
Sunday on the eve of the Fiesta Bowl . ``But they wouldn't have 
been around very long afterwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, the Seminoles responded by winning their next 10  
games and squeezed their way into a title showdown against No. 1 
Tennessee only after losses by the two teams ranked ahead of them -- 
Kansas State and UCLA -- on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said if his players didn't respond, he was set to go with  
a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit them with the fact that they, us, we, were trying live  
off last year's reputation, or the year before, or the year before, 
or the year before,'' Bowden said. ``The biggest enemy you have 
when you're successful is overconfidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lineman Corey Simon said Bowden could have saved the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we had to step it up,'' Simon said. ``The coaches  
didn't have to say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BCS FUTURE:* The Bowl Championship Series got through its first  
season with a minimum of controversy and a maximum of interest -- 
thanks largely to last-game losses by previously undefeated Kansas 
State and UCLA that set up a Tennessee-Florida State matchup in the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the BCS' designated title game is the Sugar Bowl  
Jan. 3, 2000 at New Orleans. The Rose and Orange bowls will be 
played Jan. 1, the Fiesta Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2000 season, the big game shifts to the Orange Bowl  
Jan. 1, 2001. The Rose and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Sugar Jan. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2001 season, the top game moves to the Rose Bowl Jan.  
3, 2002 -- the first time the game will be played at night. The 
Sugar and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Orange Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO. 1 VS. No. 2:* Florida State will be playing in a No. 1 vs.  
No. 2 game for the fifth time in the 1990s. The Seminoles are 2-2 
entering Monday night's Fiesta Bowl against top-ranked Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 1996, but then  
lost in the Sugar Bowl rematch and the Gators won the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 2 Nebraska 18-16 in the 1994 Orange  
Bowl, and won the '93 national title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Notre Dame beat No. 1 Florida State 31-24, Nov. 13, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami beat No. 1 Florida State 17-16 Nov. 16, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXTRA POINTS:* The Fiesta Bowl marks the 32nd time No. 1 has  
played No. 2 since the AP poll began in 1936. It's also the first 
1-2 game since Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 
1996. ... The No. 2 team has won 10 of the last 16 1 vs. 2 games. 
... Florida State is 2-1 in Fiesta Bowls, 2-0 under coach Bobby 
Bowden. The Seminoles lost to Arizona State in the first Fiesta 
Bowl in 1971, then beat Nebraska twice in Tempe -- 31-28 in the 1998 
game and 41-17 in the '90 game. ... Florida State played eight bowl 
teams this season, including BCS teams Florida and Texas A&AMP;M. ... 
Tennessee also has wins over two BCS teams -- Syracuse and Florida. 
... The Seminoles have held five opponents to under 100 yards 
passing, and 10 teams were unable to complete 50 percent of their 
passes. ... Vols tailback Jamal Lewis was lost for the season in 
the fourth game, but Tennessee still led the SEC in rushing as 
Travis Henry posted five 100-yard plus games. ... Vols quarterback 
Tee Martin completed an NCAA record 23 straight passes in a win 
over South Carolina. ... The Seminoles are 97-12-1 in the 1990s, 
the best record in the nation. The Vols, at 89-19-2 are fourth, 
behind Nebraska and Florida.

	Clinton Backs Long-Term Care Credit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing an  
unprecedented $1,000 tax credit, at a cost of billions, to 
compensate 2 million American families struggling to provide 
long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives. The tax credit, 
meant to compensate caregivers for a wide range of activities that 
tending to others requires, is part of a five-year, $6.2 billion 
package that the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
will announce tomorrow. None of it becomes reality without 
Congress, which last year rejected the president's ``Patients Bill 
of Rights.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Senators Say Clinton Will Survive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton is unlikely to be removed from  
office, but his presidency is permanently blighted by his 
impeachment on charges he lied about his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, senators said today. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Sen. 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., have floated a plan under which the 
Senate, after several days of hearing arguments in the case, would 
vote on whether the charges are enough to remove the president from 
office. With a two-thirds majority unlikely, the Senate could move 
to end the trial and consider a censure motion against the 
president.

	Midwest Storm Spreads to Northeast

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At least a dozen deaths are being blamed on the  
storm which pummeled the upper Midwest with more than a foot of 
snow and is spreading its dangerous driving conditions to the 
Northeast today. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to and from 
major Midwest hubs. United Airlines spokesman Matt Triaca said 
anyone planning to fly out of O'Hare in Chicago should wait until 
tomorrow or Tuesday. The southern flank of the storm carried 
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms into Florida.

	Euro Trading Begins in Australia  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- International trading began today for the euro, the  
new common currency that is expected to increase Europe's power in 
the global economy and eventually rival the U.S. dollar as the type 
of money chosen by traders and reserves. The day's first dealings 
in the euro are expected to be cautious and subdued, and that was 
clear in Sydney, Australia, where trading began at 5 a.m. Monday (1 
p.m. EST Sunday). Taxi drivers enjoyed a booming business, thanks 
to the early rising executives and traders. The 11 European nations 
that launched the euro Friday represent 20 percent of world 
economic output and 18 percent of world trade.

	Israel Detains Denver Cult Members  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police detained eight adults and six  
children belonging to a Denver-based apocalyptic Christian cult 
today, and accused the group of planning violent acts in Jerusalem. 
Police said the group planned to provoke a bloody shoot-out by 
opening fire on Israeli police and members of the group believed 
that this catastrophic act would hasten the Second Coming. ``They 
planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the streets of 
Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of bringing Jesus 
back to life,'' said Brig. Gen. Elihu Ben-Onn, the national police 
spokesman.

violation'' of U.N. resolutions. Saddam, in a speech to a Cabinet 
meeting carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, also sought to 
cast doubt on American claims that its planes were firing back when 
they aimed missiles at Iraqi air defenses in two recent clashes.

was to cross it, with police saying a delay at home saved the 
leader from the assassination attempt. The government said the 
bombing was carried out by an ethnic party formerly allied with 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A police source said three workers 
from the Muttahida Qami Movement have been arrested in the southern 
city of Karachi. MQM leaders say blaming their group is an attempt 
to destroy their political base and force their leaders 
underground.

	Biennial World Cup Soccer Proposed  
</P>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter proposed  
the biggest change in the history of world soccer today, saying the 
World Cup should be held every two years instead of four. The 
president of soccer's world governing body told the Zurich weekly 
SonntagsBlick that the changes would increase the status of 
national teams, which he said are threatened by proposals for a new 
Super League of European clubs.

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like twins separated at birth, John Elway and Dan Marino met  
just once since being drafted in that great quarterback class of 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, they meet for the second time in four weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Marino at Elway (well, Miami at Denver). That matchup was set up  
when Jacksonville beat New England 25-10 Sunday, sending the 
Dolphins, who beat Buffalo 24-17 on Saturday, to Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's going to be an uphill battle playing on the road  
when they have two weeks to prepare and an opportunity to get their 
team healthy,'' said Jimmy Johnson, whose Dolphins beat the Broncos 
31-21 in Miami on Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why teams with a bye playing at home have such a high  
winning percentage in the playoffs. By the same token, anything can 
happen, and we like the opportunity to go take a few chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins-Broncos game will be late next Saturday, preceded  
by San Francisco at Atlanta, a matchup set up by Steve Young's 
25-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens with three seconds left 
that beat Green Bay 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars will be at the New York Jets on Sunday. Then  
Minnesota, which finished with the NFL's best record, will host 
Arizona, which upset Dallas 20-7 for its first playoff victory in 
51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the early odds, only the 49ers-Falcons is expected  
to be close. Atlanta is favored by 3 points, the margin the 
oddsmakers generally provide for home field. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota is favored by 14 1/2 over the Cardinals; Denver is an  
11 1/2-point favorite over Miami; and the Jets are a 7-point favorite 
against Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a game-by-game preview:  

</P>
<P>
                    *Miami (11-6) at Denver (14-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	When these two met last month, the Broncos were at the end of  
four-game slide that included unimpressive wins over San Diego and 
Kansas City and a loss to the Giants that ended their hopes for an 
unbeaten season. They recouped somewhat by winning their final game 
against Seattle and now have had a week to get ready for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino easily outplayed Elway in their first meeting, their  
first since 1985, throwing for 355 yards and four touchdowns, three 
to Lamar Thomas. Elway had his worst game of the season, throwing 
for just 151 yards and completing just 13 of 36 pass attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the home field advantage is huge for Denver.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos haven't lost at Mile High in 17 games, or since they  
were shocked two years ago by the Jaguars. Miami is 8-1 at home, 
but just 3-5 on the road, and has lost eight straight playoff games 
away from Miami since Jan. 13, 1974, when the Dolphins beat 
Minnesota in Houston to win their second Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't win a Super Bowl, I hope John does,'' Marino said  
before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway won his last year. Marino's quest is likely to end in  
Elway's home. 

</P>
<P>
                *San Francisco (13-4) at Atlanta (14-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	This game might finalize the passing of the torch in the NFC  
West. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers handed the Falcons one of their two losses, 31-20 at  
San Francisco, then lost 31-19 at Atlanta in the biggest 
regular-season victory in the Falcons' 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons were doing this weekend what the 49ers have done  
most seasons since 1981. They rested while San Francisco was using 
every ounce of its energy to beat the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent a couple of days in bed,'' said Jamal Anderson, who  
set an NFL record with 410 carries this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson's 49ers counterpart, Garrison Hearst, was being  
helped off the field at the end of Sunday's game after aggravating 
a leg injury. Anderson will be healthier next week, the benefit of 
the bye. 
</P>
<P>
	So, probably will Atlanta.  

</P>
<P>
              *Jacksonville (12-5) at New York Jets (12-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	``Before you start the Parcells-Coughlin deal, I'll take a few  
minutes to enjoy this one,'' Tom Coughlin said after his Jaguars 
beat the Patriots on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, it's Tuna vs. Tuna South -- Coughlin, who served on Bill  
Parcells' staff with the Giants from 1988-90. Another connection: 
Chris Palmer, the Jaguars' offensive coordinator, was Parcells' 
quarterback coach in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	'' It's not like we don't have an idea about the head coach and  
the guy calling plays there,'' Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional wisdom says the Jets were the best team in the AFC  
the last month of the season; they were certainly better than the 
Broncos in December. 
</P>
<P>
	They also figure to be better than the Jaguars, particularly  
with Mark Brunell's mobility limited by his sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't enjoy playing against a friend,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he probably won't mind beating him.  

</P>
<P>
                  *Arizona (10-7) at Minnesota (15-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Green doesn't try to disguise his confidence with  
CoachSpeak. When he was asked Sunday what they'd do if Aeneas 
Williams shut down Randy Moss the way he shut down Michael Irvin, 
he replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of weapons. Just guarding Randy Moss is not  
what you have to do to stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have had a nice run.  
</P>
<P>
	They made the playoffs for the first time in 16 years and won a  
playoff game for the first time in 51, just their second postseason 
win in 79 seasons as a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the change in this team all season was like watching  
a flower grow from a seed to a beautiful bloom,'' said rookie 
defensive end Andre Wadsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	A very literate line for a defensive lineman.  
</P>
<P>
	But after next week, the desert rose will probably have to take  
up blooming again next year.

<HEADLINE> London Banks Ready for Euro Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain is sticking with its pounds and pence for  
now, but London's bankers and traders spent the weekend preparing 
to plunge into the uncharted waters of the single European currency 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Sweden and Denmark, Britain has postponed participation in  
the single currency and economic and monetary union, which locks 11 
of the 15 European Union nations together financially. Greece 
didn't meet the economic criteria for entry. 
</P>
<P>
	London is the world's leading financial center. Five hundred  
international banks are based in the City, London's financial 
district. Sixty percent of share transactions in London are in 
non-British stocks and a third of the world's foreign exchange 
deals are made here. 
</P>
<P>
	Any British investment bank that wants to buy and sell shares in  
European companies will have to be able to do it in euros on Monday 
morning. Exchange rates for the 11 currencies were not fixed until 
Thursday, so London institutions spent the first days of 1999 
redenominating bonds and converting currency balances to euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Many businesses -- particularly importers and exporters -- will  
need to set prices in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	The first euro trading began in Sydney, Australia, at 5 a.m.  
Monday (1 p.m. EST Sunday), with the currency trading between 
$1.1742 and $1.17774 shortly after opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The new currency's value was fixed last week at 1.95583 German  
marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish 
pesetas. 
</P>
<P>
	Marks and Spencer, a major British clothing chain with stores in  
10 of the 11 countries, will accept euro-denominated checks and 
travelers checks at its stores there and in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists contribute about 40 percent of the business in its main  
London store, so ``as a business, we're taking such practical steps 
as are necessary,'' said spokeswoman Frances Cutts. 
</P>
<P>
	The City hummed with the efforts of thousands of financial  
workers getting their companies and computers ready. But confident 
statements began to emerge from the financial labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long, long weekend; lots of bleary-eyed people  
around, but we'll be ready tomorrow,'' ``We're very pleased,'' said 
Keith Hamilton of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversion weekend across the city of London has gone very  
smoothly indeed,'' David Clementi, deputy govenor of the Bank of 
England, said Sunday night. He added that the scale of London's 
currency business made the conversion one of the largest logistical 
operations ever undertaken in London markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Letley, managing director of business operations for HSBC  
Investment Bank, said the company was ``completely on course,'' and 
that conversion was complete in the bank's office in Tokyo, where 
trade in the euro was to begin hours before London. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to do 90 percent of the work in conversion that we  
would have had to do if we (Britain) were a member'' of the single 
currency, Letley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has said it will wait to  
see whether joining the single currency is in Britain's economic 
interest, and then put the question to the people in a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euro will bring one big change soon to thousands who  
toil in the London markets -- the loss of some traditional ``bank 
holidays,'' when markets and businesses shut down for long weekends 
in spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will need to work on the days which are public holidays  
here but which are not public holidays in Europe,'' Letley said. 
``There are only about three days that are holidays right across 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, the euro should simplify accounting. ``It will  
be much less complicated if the settlement of all your accounts for 
11 countries is in one currency,'' Letley said. ``Eventuallly it's 
going to simplify things enoromously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The euro and national currencies will operate in parallel until  
2002, when single currency notes and coins will go into circulation 
and supplant the familiar German marks, French francs and Italian 
lire. 
</P>
<P>
	Letley said he felt optimistic ``because the euro market in  
general is easier to trade in and will be better for the City in 
the long run. ... I don't think (Britain's) not being in tomorrow 
is going to have a negative effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU represents 20 percent of the world's economic  
output and 18 percent of world trade. Some economists predict the 
euro could rival the U.S. dollar as the international currency of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the three reluctant nations, plus Greece, which is trying  
to qualify economically to join the single currency, share trading 
systems with euro nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``A successful EMU (economic and monetary union) means growth  
and jobs for all Europe, including the U.K. We wish it well,'' Sir 
Stephen Wall, Britain's ambassador to the European Union, said last 
week.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Nervous About Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Political pundits laughed at former professional  
wrestler Jesse Ventura's populist quest for the Minnesota 
governorship. He got the last laugh when voters backed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now reality is setting in.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura will be sworn in on Monday as the state's 37th governor.  
Admittedly nervous about the job facing him, Ventura said, ``It's 
uncharted water.'' He even joked that he fears flubbing his lines 
when reciting the oath of office in the Capitol rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, the 47-year-old Ventura is glad he'll  
finally start getting a paycheck again. He's been unemployed since 
leaving a radio talk show job last summer to make the gubernatorial 
run. His new salary is $120,303. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying true to his populist campaign platform, Ventura and wife  
Terry opted to skip the traditional black-tie inaugural ball in 
favor of a ``people's celebration'' bash at the Target Center Jan. 
16 with live music. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural will cap Ventura's Reform Party victory, which  
shocked the career politicians he beat and many others -- seemingly 
everyone but Ventura himself. He's been locked in a media spotlight 
ever since, receiving far greater attention than he ever won acting 
in films or as a pro wrestler known as ``The Body'' for his 
impressive physique. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Ventura T-shirts, hats, cups and bumper stickers have  
boomed since the election. Airport shops have sold thousands of 
shirts emblazoned with the slogan ``My governor can beat up your 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seating at the official inauguration ceremony is limited to  
about 200 members of the public, but Ventura pledged to stand and 
shake hands for two hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	His plans for an inaugural speech are still up in the air.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even really thought about what I'm going to talk  
about Monday,'' Ventura said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be something for Minnesotans to feel good  
about the next four years, that we're excited, that we should all 
be excited and that their state isn't crumbling apart for what they 
did.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Larkin Still Seeking Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Shortstop Barry Larkin hasn't changed his  
stance: he wants to be traded if the Cincinnati Reds continue 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin, who attended the team's annual RedsFest this weekend,  
said he won't let his disappointment get in the way of his 
performance if the Reds choose to hold onto him. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden reiterated over the weekend that  
there's little chance Larkin will be dealt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're playing, my focus is going to be on winning,''  
Larkin said. ``This never stemmed from the players on the team. 
This stems from up top and what was going to happen and things 
changed course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Larkin asked to be traded last season after the  
Reds began dealing their best players as part of a long-range 
rebuilding. He would like to play for a team that has a chance to 
compete for the playoffs as he approaches the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	After the season, agent Eric Goldschmidt reiterated the trade  
request and said Larkin would accept a trade to Los Angeles, St. 
Louis, San Diego, Texas or the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin would like to finish his career in Cincinnati, and wishes  
the Reds were more committed to winning. The Reds hope to be in 
shape to contend when they move into a new stadium, tentatively 
scheduled for 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get a chance to go somewhere where there's an obvious  
focus to win, fine,'' Larkin said. ``Hopefully, that will be here. 
If not, I'm not going to go somewhere just to leave Cincinnati. I 
love it here. It's just a matter of wanting to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went public with his frustrations at the front office after  
Bowden traded second baseman Bret Boone to Atlanta for a minor 
leaguer and pitcher Denny Neagle, who can demand a trade after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, the Reds also have traded No. 1 starter Dave  
Burba to Cleveland for Sean Casey and closer Jeff Shaw to Los 
Angeles for Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes. They traded Konerko to 
the Chicago White Sox after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you try to build a foundation, you build it on something  
solid that you know about,'' Larkin said. ``Don't keep breaking 
down that foundation. That's what has been happening around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden reiterated this weekend that he won't trade Larkin unless  
he can get some top prospects for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been offered a middle reliever and a Double-A utility  
infielder,'' Bowden said. ``There hasn't been a lot of interest in 
him. But that's OK because we'd like him to be our shortstop. We've 
said that all along.''

<HEADLINE>  T-Bird Fanatic Placed Early Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Bill Gill has owned hundreds of T-Birds over the  
years -- he's lost track of the exact count. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, well before Ford had even hinted publicly that it  
would shelve one of its most recognized nameplates and bring it 
back on a roadster early in the next century, Gill went to his 
dealer and placed an order for two 2001 Thunderbirds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be the first on their list,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gill was there when the concept car destined to become the 2001  
T-Bird was unveiled to the automotive press Sunday at the North 
American International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, who's partial to the original 1955-57 T-Birds, said he had  
hoped the concept car would look more like the original. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice, tasteful,'' Gill said. ``I realize they had to  
change the body styling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill suspected that a new retro T-Bird roadster was in the  
works. He owns a shop that specializes in classic T-Bird parts in 
Hazel Park outside Detroit, and Ford engineers and designers had 
been making frequent visits to buy parts and inquire whether he 
knew of any '55 and '57 'Birds for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	They put the purchases on personal credit cards, so as not to  
tip anybody off at the shop, but Gill knew they worked for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of backdoor,'' Gill recalled. ``They ended up  
buying a '55 in the Detroit area and a '57 out of Texas and started 
freshening those cars up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Ford employees gave up the pretense that their  
interest was purely personal. They began paying Gill with Ford 
Motor Co. checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, who also serves as adviser to the American Road  
Thunderbird Club chapter in Dearborn, said Ford used the classic 
T-Birds to help them design the concept car that was unveiled 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the designers and engineers were just out of school and  
weren't even alive in the '50s and '60s, the T-Bird's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know what an old T-Bird was like,'' said Gill, 56.  
</P>
<P>
	There's no shortage of Ford employees who own classic T-Birds.  
Gill said Ford wisely sought out their advice in areas such as what 
the new car should look like, what colors it should use and how 
many seats it should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a lot of influence in getting this thing off the  
ground,'' Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said the strong affection people have for the original  
'Bird goes beyond its unique styling: He says it's about as 
American a car as you'll find. Part of that has to do with its 
namesake, a bird with invisible wings that created the winds and 
thunder, according to Southwest Indian legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thunderbird, American Indian, the turquoise -- there's  
turquoise in the emblems on the car,'' Gill noted. ``Our nation's 
ancestry is with the Indians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said used '55-57 T-Birds today fetch from $15,000 for one  
that's driveable and in fair condition to $200,000 for a rare '57 
with supercharged V8 engine.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura Merchandise Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With appearances on network news and  
late-night talk shows, CNN and C-SPAN, Jesse Ventura has peddled 
his political shtick to millions. Now, quite a few of them are 
literally buying it. 
</P>
<P>
	You'd expect the Reform Party governor to be popular in the  
state that just elected him. But his appeal has gone national, with 
people all over the country gobbling up Ventura T-shirts, hats and 
bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen (Ventura merchandise) all over the place. You  
combine the yearning for a different political way with the 
personality of Jesse and you see what you get,'' said Dean Barkley, 
Ventura's campaign chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kahn, a retiree who lives in Windsor, Calif., had his  
niece in Minneapolis ship two black Ventura T-shirts his way. He's 
keeping one for himself and giving the other to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was really interesting that he won. I'm not just  
buying the T-shirts for a joke,'' said Kahn, who followed Ventura 
during his pro wrestling days. Kahn still has an original Ventura 
action figure from when his children were young. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ventura rush started the day after his surprise victory Nov.  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	Salesmen started calling Host Marriott, concessionaire at the  
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, early the next morning 
and they've had hundreds of calls since, said marketing manager 
Sarah Londerville. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Marriott has sold 5,000 T-shirts emblazoned with ``My  
governor can beat up your governor'' at its five airport gift shops 
in the past two months, Londerville said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 51 Target stores in Minnesota, supplies of ``Mind Your  
Body'' T-shirts and sweatshirts, ``Man of Action'' hats and ``My 
governor can beat up your governor'' mugs have to be replenished 
every week, said Target spokeswoman Denise Workcuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature Group, one of the few companies licensed to sell the  
goods, has shipped products to J.C. Penney Co. and Musicland Stores 
across the country. Mervyn's also is opening a national account, 
said Peter Lambert, co-owner of the Plymouth-based retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Friedline, Ventura's former campaign manager, said recently  
that he got 25 requests for Ventura T-shirts in a three-day span. 
Only two of them were from Minnesotans. Now he's trying to figure 
out how to reprint and sell Ventura's campaign lawn signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in charge of marketing a governor. Who would have ever  
thought that would happen?'' Friedline said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next item that will mix politics with the free market is a  
beefy action figure in Ventura's likeness, bald head and all. 
Contrary to the wild attire of the Ventura doll from his wrestling 
days, the new one -- due out this spring -- shows the governor-elect 
in a business suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's custom-made doll stole the show in Ventura's campaign  
commercials, which depicted two boys playing with a Ventura doll 
banging his fist on a desk and dismissing Evil Special Interest 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hillsman, the man who produced Ventura's campaign ads, said  
they created the doll -- a combination of several action figure 
parts -- as a surrogate for the candidate who didn't have enough 
time to shoot the TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea that there'd actually be people clamoring for an  
action figure. But this is America,'' Hillsman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he's flattered by the demand for products with his  
face or name. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to do everything I can for the state of Minnesota.  
If that's part of it then, yeah, I suppose it's gratifying to know 
that I'm already helping and I haven't even been sworn in yet,'' he 
said ahead of his Monday swearing-in ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future first lady, Terry Ventura, said she was a bit  
frustrated by all the unlicensed paraphernalia being sold. The 
governor-elect has been out of work since he left his radio job 
last summer to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ventura profited from the sale of his first action figure  
during his pro wrestling days (he bought a Porsche with the 
proceeds), he won't see any of it this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his campaign is amassing the proceeds from its sales  
for future campaigns. In the two months since the election, 
Ventura's campaign has sold tens of thousands of dollars in 
T-shirts and hats at $20 a clip. Other products are being 
discussed, including a Ventura educational comic book that would 
promote a healthy lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	A nonprofit corporation, Ventura for Minnesota Inc., has been  
formed to license the products. Profits are being held in escrow 
until the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Disclosure Board 
determines how Ventura's office can spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism, culture and sociology at  
New York University, said Ventura's popularity will eventually wane 
outside Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he can't think of another governor who has been  
able to market himself as Ventura has done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine anything competing,'' he said.

 *Tamara Dudko    	
</P>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Tamara Dudko, the deputy speaker of  
Belarus' upper house of parliament, died Saturday in a car 
accident, state-run television announced Sunday. She was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	No other details were available.  
</P>
<P>
	Dudko, who was a member of the Supreme Soviet under the last  
Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was an engineer by training and 
was general director of Belarus' largest brewery, Alivariya. 
</P>
<P>
	She was appointed to parliament by President Alexander  
Lukashenko in January 1997, after he pushed through a referendum 
creating a new legislature to replace the one he dissolved. 

</P>
<P>
 *Rolf Liebermann    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Swiss composer Rolf Liebermann, who led the Hamburg  
Opera for more than a decade before sparking the revival of the 
moribund Paris Opera, died Saturday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebermann spent 13 years as head of the Hamburg Opera, from  
1959 to 1972, before joining the Paris Opera as chief administrator 
at a time when it was being abandoned by the public and by stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liebermann years, from 1973-80, ``were those of revival,  
reform and a period of great splendor,'' Paris Opera Director 
Hughes Gall said in a telephone interview with The Associated 
Press.

	Taking on the revival of the Paris Opera, Liebermann brought in  
some of the world's great conductors, including Karl Bohm, Pierre

<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- David E. Lynch, a former Washington  
correspondent for several Lincoln newspapers, died Thursday after a 
long fight with cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch covered regional news from the nation's capital for  
various newspapers for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch became the correspondent for the former Lincoln Journal  
and the Sunday Lincoln Journal-Star in 1982 and continued in that 
role until Lee Enterprises bought the Lincoln Journal in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Milford, Mass., he was a general assignment reporter  
for the Worcester Telegram and Gazette in Massachusetts from 1965 
to 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970 he became the Washington correspondent for the  
Griffin-Larrabee News Bureau, a regional news service covering the 
northeast part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974 he became an investigative reporter and acting assistant  
city editor in the home office of the Buffalo Courier-Express in 
New York. In 1977 he was assigned to the Washington bureau for the 
newspaper, which no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the Courier-Express he opened his own news service  
called Lynch Communications. He took on clients included the 
Lincoln Journal, the Cedar Rapids Gazette and Data Transmission 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors inlcude his wife, a daughter and two brothers.

 *David Manners    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- David Manners, who played the  
romantic hero in such classic horror films as ``Dracula'' and ``The 
Mummy,'' died Dec. 23. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he appeared in more than three dozen films, Manners was  
best known for playing the stalwart hero or the love interest in 
the horror films of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	He played Jonathan Harker to Bela Lugosi's Dracula in the 1931  
film and fought to keep his lover from the clutches of Boris 
Karloff in 1932's ``The Mummy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His many non-horror roles included the fiance of Katherine  
Hepburn in her screen debut, 1932's ``A Bill of Divorcement,'' 
which co-starred John Barrymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Manngers made his stage debut in 1924 at the Hart House Theater  
in Toronto. He also performed plays in New York and Chicago before 
moving to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	He also did stage work in the 1940s in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	He eventually left the entertainment field for a Mojave Desert  
ranch and kept a journal, excerpts of which were published as 
``Awakening from a Dream of Me.'' He also wrote several other 
books, including the novels ``Convenient Season'' and ``Under 
Running Laughter.''

 *Jerry Quarry    	
</P>
<P>
	TEMPLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Quarry, a popular heavyweight  
boxer who fought Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson then eventually 
lapsed into a punch-drunk fog, died Sunday after being taken off 
life support. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry was hospitalized Dec. 28 with pneumonia and then suffered  
cardiac arrest while at Twin Cities Community Hospital. He died 
after family members told doctors to remove him from life support, 
said Claude Sutherland, a longtime family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, who earned $2.1 million in purses as a top contender in  
the 1960s and '70s, later lived on Social Security checks. By the 
age of 50, the pounding he had taken in the ring turned him into a 
confused, childlike man whose relatives had to take care of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered from dementia pugilistica, severe brain damage  
caused by repeated blows to the head. Neurological tests revealed 
early signs of dementia in 1982, before his short-term memory loss 
and motor skills deteriorated so noticeably and before his last 
three fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of Quarry's career were two fights against  
Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. The first ended in a 
draw, and he won the second on a controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, a 6-foot, 195-pounder, earned his biggest payday of  
$338,000 by fighting Ali when Ali returned from his banishment from 
boxing in 1970.

died Thursday of a drug overdose, according to the musician's 
publicist. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional details about his death were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Boz Scaggs, 54, recorded two albums with the Steve Miller Band  
before embarking on a solo career in 1968. He achieved success in 
the late 1960s and 1970s with hits like ``Lowdown,'' ``Lido 
Shuffle'' and ``We're All Alone.''

<HEADLINE>  Pats' Coach Confident He'll Return </HEADLINE>

 *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The comparisons have been constant  
since Pete Carroll succeeded Bill Parcells as coach of the 
Patriots. And Carroll has always finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	So it didn't matter to detractors that he led New England to two  
playoff berths in his two seasons, overcoming numerous injuries to 
do that. Reports surfaced that a bad performance Sunday against 
Jacksonville could put his job in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll, who has three years left on his contract, didn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming back to put together a football team that can win  
the championship,'' he said after Sunday's 25-10 playoff loss to 
the Jaguars. ``With good health and good fortune, we'll do the 
things that we dream about doing and things that we set as our 
goals. And I'm going to be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The player-friendly Carroll stepped into a difficult situation.  
Parcells, one of the NFL's top coaches, had just led the Patriots 
to the Super Bowl, then jumped to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Patriots were 10-6 in Carroll's first season and only a  
one-point loss to Pittsburgh kept them from the AFC title game. 
They were 9-7 this season despite injuries to many key players, 
including Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Ted Johnson and Todd Collins, 
who all missed Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a few days after five other NFL coaches were fired, a member  
of the Patriots' front office reportedly planted a newspaper item 
last week that Carroll might be in trouble, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Chris Slade said the Patriots were outplayed and  
outcoached in a 31-10 loss to Parcells and the New York Jets in the 
regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, though, Slade said, ``As far as I'm concerned, Pete  
Carroll's the head coach of the Patriots and that's the way it's 
going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans have spoken fondly of Parcells, a more assertive  
coach, but after the loss no Patriots criticized Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair'' to blame him, strong safety Lawyer  
Milloy said. ``All he does is prepare us to go out and play. He 
didn't think at the beginning of the year he was going to lose so 
many starters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro cornerback Ty Law, beaten by Jimmy Smith for a 37-yard  
scoring pass that put the Jaguars ahead 19-10 early in the fourth 
quarter, said coaching changes don't have to be disruptive. He 
cited the switch to Carroll as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Pete Carroll. I like Bill Parcells,'' Law said. ``We're  
getting to know him (Carroll). He's getting to know us a lot 
better. He's `The Man' on the team right now, so I have no doubt 
that he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete has 100 percent Ty Law's backing, if it means anything.''  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of talk about Pete, but Pete can't get out  
and play for us,'' wide receiver Shawn Jefferson said. ``Good game 
plans ... are put in place. It's up to these guys to execute the 
game plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the only opinion that counts belongs to Patriots  
owner Robert Kraft, who had high praise for Carroll when the coach 
was hired. And Kraft has been silent publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carroll said they've gotten along well,  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been together on everything we've done,'' Carroll said.  
``He has been terrific about it. ... Everything has been very 
amicable.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Unveils Concept Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Before the internal combustion engine dies and  
pollution-free, fuel-cell powertrains have a chance to replace it, 
motorists likely will see technologies that blend the old with the 
new. 
</P>
<P>
	They include electric-gasoline hybrids, synthetic diesel fuels  
and natural gas-powered engines. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the theory behind much of the research at  
DaimlerChrysler AG, which unveiled a trio of concept cars and 
trucks Sunday that represent the German-American automaker's 
efforts to find near-term alternatives to conventional gasoline 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't bet the farm on any single technology,'' Thomas T.  
Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's North American arm, said 
at the media preview of the Detroit auto show. ``We're pretty 
excited about fuel cells in the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the short term, DaimlerChrysler is betting that high-tech  
diesel fuels will meet tougher emissions standards in the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	That bet is demonstrated in the Dodge Power Wagon, an oversized  
pickup packed with a 7.2-liter, turbocharged diesel engine designed 
to run on a synthetic diesel-type fuel derived from natural gas. 
Because the fuel is made from natural gas, it lacks the polluting 
sulfur that comes from crude oil-derived fuels. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine generates 250 horsepower and incredible pulling power  
while using 40 percent less fuel than a comparable gasoline 
powerplant. Which leads to another point DaimlerChrysler wants to 
make with its latest concepts: High performance and cleaner 
technology can go hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really kind of a monster,'' said Steve Brueckner,  
DaimlerChrysler's senior manager of advanced diesel engine 
technology. ``But you can drive this and still feel good about 
yourself in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker hopes the hulking truck will draw enough attention  
to refocus the debate on diesel technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Diesels emit about half as much carbon dioxide as gasoline  
engines. Carbon dioxide is a so-called greenhouse gas that is 
believed to be contributing to global warming. But conventional 
diesels also release more soot and oxides of nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have been lobbying against diesels, even as a  
near-term solution. California regulators recently adopted tougher 
vehicle emissions rules that did away with special exemptions for 
diesel engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union of Concerned Scientists argues that the refining  
process for the Power Wagon's new fuel generates twice the 
greenhouse gases of refining conventional diesel, which reduces the 
engine's pollution savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp said such problems can be resolved through continued  
research, however. Of all the technologies DaimlerChrysler is 
studying, the diesel hybrid is the closest to being practical for 
everyday use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also unveiled two other concept cars Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chrysler Citadel, a sport sedan with a hybrid powertrain,  
uses a V6 engine to drive the rear wheels and an electric motor to 
drive the front wheels. DaimlerChrysler officials say the result is 
the equivalent power of a V8, lower emissions and V6 fuel economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodge Charger R/T uses a supercharged, 325-horsepower V8  
engine powered by compressed natural gas and is designed to be a 
clean-burning muscle car. Its key technology is a new storage tank 
that takes up less space than a typical, heavy tank needed for 
compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with natural gas is there is no widespread system of  
filling stations. For now, the best hope for natural gas vehicles 
is with business and government fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	At last week's Los Angeles Auto Show, DaimlerChrysler also  
unveiled an experimental fuel-cell-powered sport utility vehicle 
called the Jeep Commander. It is designed to use methanol as its 
main energy source, which would be converted on board to the 
hydrogen a fuel cell needs to create electricity. At present, 
however, the system does not work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long term, that's the right way,'' Stallkamp said. ``It's the  
cleanest and most efficient.''

<HEADLINE>  Euro Trading Starts Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- International trading began at the crack of dawn  
Monday for the euro, the new common currency expected to increase 
Europe's power in the global economy and eventually rival the U.S. 
dollar as the money of choice for traders and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after trading began in Sydney, the euro was quoted  
by buyers and sellers at $1.1747. In Tokyo, the euro was trading as 
high as $1.1810 by midday Monday, up from $1.1755 earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's first dealings in the euro were cautious and subdued.  
It was still dark in Sydney, Australia's financial district when 
trading began at 5 a.m. (1 p.m. EST Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
	At the Westpac Bank foreign exchange trading room, there was a  
hum of activity from traders and media taking pictures and 
television footage of the opening of trade in the euro. Traders 
gazed intently at their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just having a small punt so they can say they dealt  
in the euro,'' said Wayne Raven, a senior manager of Westpac's 
corporate, currency and commodity division. 
</P>
<P>
	Euro trading also took place in markets around Asia where banks  
opened earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong and Singapore, bankers said the euro had an  
uneventful Asian debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a few requests come through with regard to  
finding out what levels would be. But trading in the euro itself 
has been very light,'' said Peter Chen, director of sales for 
Southeast Asia and North Asia at Deutsche Bank in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America Vice President Yasuhisa Morikuni said in Tokyo:  
``It has been quiet so far. We haven't seen any surprises this 
morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In general, Asian institutions were buying the new currency and  
European ones were selling it, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks had spent the New Year's holiday weekend preparing to  
launch the world's euro trading. On Monday, most of the modified 
computer systems were working just fine, but at least one bank in 
Sydney reported minor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, speculation had run high in Asian newspapers about  
just what the euro would do to the region's troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the financial crisis in Asia and Russia causing anxieties  
about the dollar-dominated currency system, the eyes of the world 
are on the euro, which has a chance of rivaling the U.S. dollar,'' 
Japan's Mainichi newspaper said in a front-page story. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who might have missed the point, the article's  
headline read: ``Topple the Dollar's Dominance!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 European nations that launched the euro Friday represent  
20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent of world trade, 
and they will be a powerful player in the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, one goal of the euro is for it to help the European  
Union forge a common market that is able to stand its ground 
against the United States and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Sunday's official China Daily newspaper said that  
Chinese companies should find it easier to raise money and sell 
goods in Europe with its new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be a real asset in Asia, where many countries are  
fighting brutal economic crises that began in July 1997, with huge 
devaluations in their currency and stock markets and a massive 
exodus of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the China Daily also said the euro is creating new  
headaches, including the fact that exchange rate risks have 
increased as international markets adjust to the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	While electronic trading in the euro began Monday, the first  
business day since New Year's, euro bills and coins will not be 
introduced until January 2002.

<HEADLINE> Ore. May Rein in Health Care Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- As he pulls himself along the edge of a  
coffee table and munches on a handful of goldfish crackers, Korben 
Baker looks like any other rambunctious toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	But the surgical scars that crisscross his belly and the feeding  
tube that sticks out of his stomach tell another story -- of a 
little boy born with a heart defect who has already endured three 
major operations in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Korben's mother, Debbie Jensen, is convinced her son is alive  
today because of the Oregon Health Plan, the state insurance 
program that allowed her to take Korben to a specialist in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It saved his life. He's now a healthy, happy baby boy,'' said  
Jensen, who worked in a furniture refinishing shop before she quit 
to spend more time with her son. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among the beneficiaries of Oregon's nationally touted  
experiment that has extended insurance to thousands of low-income 
residents by rationing health care to recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	But spiraling costs will put it under intense scrutiny in the  
Oregon Legislature in 1999. Even the plan's author -- Democratic 
Gov. John Kitzhaber -- is proposing cutting services and imposing 
tougher screening to make certain applicants are truly eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kitzhaber is asking legislators to provide $764 million  
in state support -- a 28 percent increase over current spending -- to 
cover the plan's rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans might seek even deeper cuts, which could trigger a  
battle over whether the state can continue to afford the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the need for health care, but you can't have a  
program that's growing in the 20 percent range year after year,'' 
said Senate President Brady Adams. ``The taxpayers' pockets are 
only so deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1994, the Oregon Health Plan now provides coverage  
to more than 300,000 poor and working poor Oregonians -- those who 
have jobs but who can't afford health insurance and whose employers 
don't offer insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	To help keep the program's costs down, the health plan  
``rations'' services through a prioritized list of medical 
conditions and treatments, with the state paying only for those 
treatments deemed the most important and most likely to be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has meant peace of mind for people such as Ronald  
Wisler. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisler, 42, a divorced father of four who is raising his  
children, said his carpenter's job is seasonal and he often finds 
himself out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where I would get health care for me and my kids  
if it weren't for the health plan,'' Wisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue recently hit home for Wisler when it appeared his  
6-year-old daughter, Bonnie Rose, might have a crippling spinal 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it turned out, one of her legs is shorter than the other,''  
he said. ``But it could have cost me hundreds of dollars just to 
find out she's OK. I had to take her to a bone specialist, and 
those guys aren't cheap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help curb the program's costs, Kitzhaber is proposing tougher  
screening to make sure all health plan applicants are eligible. The 
governor's plan is expected to trim the number of health plan 
participants by 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitzhaber, a former emergency room physician, also wants to pare  
the costs of the program by deleting some of the medical services 
now covered on the prioritized list of services. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, the Oregon Health Plan has expanded to  
include such services as doctor-assisted suicide. Also, officials 
are seriously studying the idea of adding sex-change operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitzhaber's budget would eliminate coverage for treatment of  
such maladies as skin irritations that often go away on their own. 
Ligament damage to the knee also would no longer be covered, on the 
theory that ligaments often grow back. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Kitzhaber would require hospitals to cover an  
additional $10.4 million in patients' health care costs by changing 
the timelines governing when people become eligible for the health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he and other Senate Republicans might want to look  
for other savings, such as cutting more deeply into the benefits 
package so that fewer medical services and treatments on the 
prioritized list are covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole idea behind the ``rationing'' concept was that the  
state would decide what services it could afford to cover and draw 
the line there, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't we go back to the original premise and talk about  
adjusting the line?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he's open to other proposals by the  
Republican-led legislature -- as long as they don't have the effect 
of gutting Oregon's nationally touted plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sign up for that,'' Kitzhaber said. ``At some  
point, you really wouldn't have a benefits package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen said she hopes lawmakers will keep people such as her son  
Korben in mind when they make decisions about the health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just take a look at him,'' she said, gesturing toward the  
smiling, curly-haired boy. ``That's what I'd say to the 
legislature. The health plan is a great thing for people who have a 
job like I did with no health insurance.''

<HEADLINE> Trial Could Affect Clinton Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties say President  
Clinton should not deliver his annual State of the Union address to 
Congress if the scheduled date conflicts with his impeachment trial 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 19 date for the speech thus provides a concrete  
deadline for senators now searching for a way to bring a quick end 
to the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be unseemly and distracting for the president  
to be giving a State of the Union address to Congress while he was 
under trial in the Senate,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that the State of the  
Union address is one ``minor factor in favor of seeing whether or 
not we can do it promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Democrat Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Gorton is proposing a  
plan that could end the trial after four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman, also on NBC, agreed that Clinton's speech to outline  
his legislative goals for the year is ``another reason why we have 
a very short window here to try to work out a procedure for this 
trial. If we don't, we are going to descend, I fear, to the kind of 
partisan rancor that characterized the House proceeding,'' 
Judiciary Committee hearings that resulted in the first impeachment 
of a president in 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech must be postponed, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,  
said, because as long as the trial continues, ``The state of the 
union from the perspective of his administration is unclear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Clinton might resort to the  
practice of earlier presidents and submit his report in writing. 
``The president should not be speaking to Congress when he is under 
this cloud, under the trial,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy had no immediate comment on  
whether the president would deliver the speech as planned if the 
trial is still under way on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress convenes on Wednesday. The Senate's first order of  
business is to determine the shape of the trial on House-passed 
articles of impeachment, which charge the president with perjury 
and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority is needed to remove the president from  
office. While most senators are reluctant to say how they would 
vote, even Republicans who favored conviction admitted they don't 
have the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said that while he thought the president should lose his  
job if the charges against him were true, ``I believe the president 
will be found not guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, agreed on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that  
``I don't think today there are, there may never be,'' the 
two-thirds majority to convict. But he said the charges should be 
fully aired anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	But momentum was building for the Gorton-Lieberman approach.  
</P>
<P>
	Under that, from Jan. 11 the House prosecutors and the White  
House would each have one day to present their cases. Senators 
would then have a day to ask questions. Then, on the fourth day, 
they would vote whether charges against the president, even if 
true, were grave enough to remove him from office. If a two-thirds 
majority isn't reached, the Senate could adjourn the trial with a 
simple majority, then move to a possible censure motion against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in an interview with  
Time magazine, said the Gorton-Lieberman idea was a ``fair start.'' 
He said he would be criticized no matter what is decided from the 
left, which is demanding an end to the proceedings, and from the 
right, which wants a full trial with witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an effort to short-circuit it,'' Lott said. ``It  
is an effort to have the evidence presented and have votes that 
bring this to a closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Managers'' from the House Judiciary Committee, who would act  
as prosecutors in the Senate trial, continue to demand a full trial 
with witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, but there appeared little 
appetite for that in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., one of the president's harshest  
critics, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that while he is uneasy about 
an abbreviated trial, ``let's not have a carnival here. This isn't 
Judge Ito. This isn't O.J.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders worry that a protracted trial interfering with  
legislative business would again cast the party as more interested 
in punishing the president than addressing the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La., also on Fox, said he would support any  
Democratic plan to hold up all other business until the trial is 
over. ``How can you have a trial impeaching the president of the 
United States and then, in the afternoon or in the morning say, 
'Oh, we're going to do Medicare,' or 'Let's now do Social 
Security.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on the Sunday news programs generally agreed that any  
resolution to censure the president for his affair with the former 
White House intern should not include a fine, a move that many view 
as constitutionally suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not like a Chinese kangaroo court, where we execute  
somebody and then charge the family for the bullet,'' Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt., said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''

<HEADLINE> Bills Rip Officials After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Bills cleaned a season's  
worth of junk out of their lockers on Sunday. But they couldn't 
dispose of the bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of suspects in a 24-17 wild-card loss to  
Miami, including Buffalo's turnover-plagued players. Still, a day 
later the Bills were left with that familiar feeling of having 
something stolen from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen officiating this bad,'' Pro Bowl guard Ruben  
Brown said Sunday, referring to dubious calls around the NFL, 
including two crucial calls in a Buffalo loss to New England in 
November, and yet another in the Miami defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills were penalized nine times for 93 yards in Miami. They  
most vehemently objected to a ruling that took an apparent 
touchdown away from receiver Andre Reed late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The day punctuated an NFL season in which the referees have come  
under intense scrutiny, rekindling player angst and owner debate 
about instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they have other jobs or what, but I think they  
need to devote full time to what they do,'' Reed said. ``And they 
need to go back to school or do something, because some of the 
calls they made this year are some of the worst in 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the answer is, but I'll tell you this,''  
Bills guard Joe Panos said, ``there has to be a change for the 
better. Because it can't get any worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even one full day and a pile of snow back home could cool  
the Bills off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they should get rid of all them,'' veteran running  
back Thurman Thomas said of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The play that most infuriated the Bills came in the closing  
moments. They drove deep into Miami territory and Reed caught a 
pass at the 1 and tried to extend it over the goal line as he was 
tackled with 1:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials spotted the ball inside the Miami 1-yard line;  
replays indicated Reed's upper body and the ball were over the goal 
line. Reed jumped up and bumped into field judge Steve Zimmer and 
was ejected; the penalty forced Buffalo to settle for Steve 
Christie's field goal and a 24-17 score. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills, who started the season 0-3, recovered an onside kick  
and drove back. But a sack of Doug Flutie, causing a fumble, ended 
the threat and their season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills lost a touchdown, Reed and 15 yards -- all on one call.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was clearly in the end zone,'' Reed said Sunday.  
``I was waiting for the call and I didn't hear it. I got up and 
said a few things, like I can't believe this, and the guy just 
happened to be right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about it is that when I got back up, I didn't know  
if that was a ref or a player or whatever,'' Reed said. ``My 
emotions came out, and to be kicked out of a game because of that, 
it just was uncalled for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills still smarted from bad officiating they say robbed  
them of a win in New England and gave another win to the Jets, 
depriving Buffalo of the homefield advantage in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Seahawks-Jets game on Dec. 6 a replay showed that the  
Jets' Vinny Testaverde came up short of the goal line on the final 
play, but he was awarded a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``And his helmet wasn't even on the goal line,'' Reed said.  
``Yeah, it gets the blood boiling, but I'm not going to say that's 
the reason why we lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills, who lost the ball just 20 times -- including a  
team-record low of six fumbles -- fumbled the ball away four times, 
while the normally reliable Doug Flutie tossed an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot reasons we didn't win the game,'' Reed said.  
``They made some good plays. Jimmy Johnson coaches that team well. 
You have to take something positive out of it and come back next 
year. It was a complete turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bills weren't ready to let go of this year, in which  
Flutie replaced injured Rob Johnson and became a Pro Bowl backup; 
Antowain Smith rushed for more than 1,000 yards; Eric Moulds as one 
of the league's top receivers; and John Holecek was an able 
replacement at middle linebacker for Chris Spielman. Buffalo 
finished 10-6 in Wade Phillips' first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the officials robbed them of a trip to Denver for the  
next round, Panos said, ``What do you think? I don't want to get 
fined, but I think we should be preparing for Denver right now.''

<HEADLINE> Vols Seek National Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tennessee can feel it. One more win. A  
perfect season. The national championship. At long last. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Volunteers play No. 2 Florida State for the  
national title Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl, well aware of the 
game's significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennessee was not a program that you could ignore the last  
couple of years, but this is the next step, a key hump for us,'' 
Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``We like being at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Fulmer's six full seasons as coach, the Vols have steadily  
climbed to the top of the college football elite. Beating Florida 
State, firmly entrenched as one of the top teams in the game today, 
would lift the Volunteers into the same stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people haven't looked at this Tennessee program as  
playing for the national title,'' linebacker Raynoch Thompson said. 
``But I feel if we win it, we will be up there with Florida State, 
Nebraska and Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's Bobby Bowden has been where Fulmer is now. It  
took Bowden nearly 40 years of coaching to win a national title, 
and he knows a championship team when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll get it, he's got too good a program,'' Bowden said,  
``but I hope he doesn't do it Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols just might. Even though Tennessee is a 5 1/2-point  
underdog, the Vols turned aside every challenge -- a one-point win 
over Syracuse, an overtime thriller against Florida, a lucky 
break-win over Arkansas, a come-from-behind win over Mississippi 
State in the SEC title game -- to finish 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
	And they did it with versatile Tee Martin at quarterback, not  
folk-hero Peyton Manning, who in four years set many records but 
couldn't get the Vols into the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, meanwhile, lost to North Carolina State 24-7 in  
its second game, but oddsmakers still like the Seminoles based on 
big-game experience and a big-time defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get a whole lot of respect,'' Vols defensive tackle  
Darwin Walker said. ``People said this team was lucky, but we've 
earned everything we've gotten. There's not one speck of luck. 
Everything you see, we deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot to see on Fulmer's resume. Since replacing Johnny  
Majors, the Vols have won 85.7 percent of their games (66-11) -- the 
best career winning percentage among active coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	There have also been four straight Top 10 finishes in The  
Associated Press poll, a 44-5 record the past four years and 
consecutive Southeastern Conference titles. Not bad for a team rich 
in tradition but looking for its first national title since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden spent 18 seasons in Tallahassee before winning a national  
title, and he often talks about his sense of relief after finally 
reaching the top. Fulmer hopes he can do it in one-third the time 
it took Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win, then early in my career I'd have that weight lifted  
off my back,'' Fulmer said. ``We expect at some point to win a 
national championship, hopefully this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It better not take 18 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won't last 18 years,'' Fulmer said. ``We've got to get it  
quicker than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s, Tennessee's annual quest for national acclaim  
usually ended with an early-season loss to Florida. Not even 
Manning could pull out a win, but Martin stepped in and the 
five-game skid mercifully ended -- Vols 20, Gators 17, in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	And the road to Tempe was opened. Even Bowden, foiled many times  
before by Florida, knew how important the victory was for the Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been overshadowed by Florida and overshadowed in the  
conference,'' Bowden said. ``Then he won the conference 
championship and now he's going for the national championship. I 
would say he has arrived. He didn't arrive five years ago. He 
arrived now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer's new contract also arrived last week in the form of $1  
million a year for the next six seasons. He must be doing something 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	He is. Tennessee's recruiting classes have been rated among the  
best the past few years, and the Vols already have commitments from 
Chris Simms and A.J. Suggs -- two of the nation's top-rated high 
school quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	He's worked on trying to keep his staff together, although  
longtime assistant David Cutcliffe left to coach Mississippi after 
18 seasons with the Vols. Defensive coordinator John Chavis has 
been aboard since 1989, and Randy Sanders, promoted to offensive 
coordinator to replace Cutcliffe, was a former Tennessee backup 
quarterback in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer says teams like Florida State and Nebraska have set the  
standard for building powerhouses, and he wants to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to consider how they've done things, and how Bobby  
Bowden has been so successful for so long,'' Fulmer said. ``What 
we've tried to do in recruiting and in continuity of staff is what 
you see Florida State do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Florida State, fans expect nothing less than a national  
title. And Bowden usually has his team in the mix until the end. If 
not for an occasional loss to Miami or to Florida there, the 
Seminoles could have three, maybe four, titles by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to think we can spoil the people at Tennessee like  
coach Bowden has at Florida State,'' Fulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols can start with a win Monday night.

	Midwest Storm Spreads to Northeast  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicagoans are digging out from their biggest  
snow storm in more than 30 years while thousands of already delayed 
travelers across the Midwest and elsewhere are waiting for airlines 
to get their planes de-iced and back in the air. At least a dozen 
deaths are being blamed on the storm which pummeled the upper 
Midwest with more than a foot of snow and spread its dangerous 
driving conditions to the Northeast today. The southern flank of 
the storm carried tornadoes and severe thunderstorms into Florida.

	Senators Say Clinton Will Survive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton is unlikely to be removed from  
office, but his presidency is permanently blighted by his 
impeachment on charges he lied about his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, senators said today. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Sen. 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., have floated a plan under which the 
Senate, after several days of hearing arguments, would vote on 
whether the charges are enough to remove the president from office. 
With a two-thirds majority unlikely, the Senate could move to end 
the trial and consider a censure motion against the president.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A Mars lander equipped with an arm  
and shovel blasted off today on a 470 million-mile quest to uncover 
frozen water near the planet's South Pole. NASA's Mars Polar Lander 
soared aboard a Boeing rocket at exactly 3:21 p.m. The rain that 
managers had feared stayed away, allowing NASA to meet the 
instantaneous launch window despite an overcast sky. The Polar 
Lander is bound for the frosty fringes of Mars' south polar cap. 
It's due to arrive in December when it's late spring and the sun 
never sets.

the global economy and eventually rival the U.S. dollar as the type 
of money chosen by traders and reserves. The day's first dealings 
in the euro are expected to be cautious and subdued, and that was 
clear in Sydney, Australia, where trading began at 5 a.m. Monday (1 
p.m. EST Sunday). The 11 European nations that launched the euro

	Israel Detains Denver Cult Members  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police detained eight adults and six  
children belonging to a Denver-based apocalyptic Christian cult 
today, and accused the group of planning violent acts in Jerusalem. 
Police said the group planned to provoke a bloody shootout with 
Israeli cops which members of the group believe would hasten the 
Second Coming. ``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts 
in the streets of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process 
of bringing Jesus back to life,'' said Israel's national police 
spokesman.

	Survey: 1998 Was Less Violent Year  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The year ended with a war simmering between  
the United States and Iraq, but a cease-fire by Basque separatists 
and the end of Liberia's vicious civil war helped contribute to a 
sharp drop in the number of violent conflicts worldwide, think 
tanks reported today. In its annual survey, the National Defense 
Council Foundation counted 60 conflicts. That represents a drop of 
seven from 1997 but remains well above the 35 conflicts happening 
when the Cold War ended in 1989. The Alexandria, Va.-based council 
tallies all violent situations that result in regional instability.

	Panthers Select Seifert as Coach  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- George Seifert, who has the best winning  
percentage of any coach in NFL history, will be the Carolina 
Panthers' new head coach, The Associated Press learned today. The 
team would not confirm its choice of Seifert to replace the fired 
Dom Capers, but sources said the Panthers were trying to arrange a 
news conference at Ericsson Stadium tomorrow to introduce their new 
coach. Seifert, who won 75.5 percent of his games (108-35) with San 
Francisco from 1989-96, did not immediately return telephone 
messages left at his home Sunday in Los Altos, Calif.

	Moss Wins AP Offensive Rookie Award  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Randy Moss, the game-breaking wide receiver for  
the Minnesota Vikings, was a landslide winner of The Associated 
Press' NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award today. Moss, who led 
the NFL with 17 touchdown receptions and averaged 19 yards per 
catch, received 44 votes from a nationwide panel of 47 sports 
writers and broadcasters. Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, 
the top overall pick in the 1998 draft, got two votes. The other 
vote went to Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor.

<HEADLINE> Packers: We Were Robbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mike Holmgren rose up against the NFL's  
instant replay plan for the playoffs and he's lived to regret it. 
</P>
<P>
	It very well could have salvaged the Green Bay Packers' season  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of fans across the country got to see Jerry Rice in  
slow motion as he fumbled on San Francisco's game-winning touchdown 
drive in the 49ers' thrilling 30-27 wild-card victory over the 
Green Bay Packers at 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials, who ruled no fumble, didn't get to see it  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	With time running out, Rice caught his first pass of the game, a  
6-yard reception on second-and-10 from the Green Bay 47 with about 
40 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers linebacker Bernardo Harris and rookie nickel back Scott  
McGarrahan stripped the ball and Harris pounced on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers began celebrating their fourth straight playoff  
victory over the 49ers and a trip to face the Atlanta Falcons in 
the second-round. 
</P>
<P>
	But line judge Jeff Bergman said Rice never fumbled, and  
although field judge Kevin Mack had a better view, he didn't 
overrule his colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	And, four plays later, Steve Young hit Terrell Owens between  
three defenders for the winning 25-yard touchdown with three 
seconds and no timeouts left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was clearly a fumble,'' Packers general manager Ron Wolf  
fumed in the hushed locker room. ``We clearly recovered. The game's 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to lose no matter how you do it. But when you make  
a play in a championship game and it's not awarded to you, there's 
something wrong with the whole system. It's something that has to 
be addressed,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said they were robbed by a bad call at the worst  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' strong safety LeRoy Butler declared. ``But he's  
Jerry Rice and I can't comment on the referees or I'll get fined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren was asked if he thought Rice got star treatment on the  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope not,'' he sighed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They told me from upstairs that it was a fumble,'' Holmgren  
said. ``You hope that over the course of a season those plays will 
even out, but I wish they would have called that. Then the game 
would have been over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Brett Favre, who threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to  
Antonio Freeman with 1:56 left to put the Packers ahead 27-23, said 
he felt like victory was stolen from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the one play was a fumble and we recovered,'' Favre  
said. ``Somebody said the replay showed that. But we can sit here 
and make excuses all day ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was certain it was a legitimate fumble recovery, ``but  
there's always questionable calls in a football game and you just 
have to live with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or die with them.  
</P>
<P>
	McGarrahan said the point is academic anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was a fumble,'' he said. ``But I know one  
thing -- we didn't get the ball -- so I guess not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said instant replay is an absolute necessity to restore  
respect to the league that has gotten a black eye from bad calls 
for the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're for instant replay and we'll always be for it,'' he  
said. ``Because it's obvious that something within the working 
mechanism that governs our game is not working. And that's the 
correct call. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, why not use the tools that will enable us to make sure  
that the team that really and truly wins the game wins the game?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials didn't have instant replay Sunday in large part  
because Wolf's coach, Holmgren, as co-chair of the league's 
competition committee, helped kill the idea last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a chance to do it,'' Holmgren, who was leader of the  
pro-replay forces last March, when it failed by two votes, said 
several weeks ago when the league floated the idea of bringing 
instant replay back for the playoffs after officials' mistakes 
played a major part in deciding three games late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was the infamous Thanksgiving coin toss to start  
overtime in the Pittsburgh-Detroit game. Four days later, the 
officials made what the league conceded were two bad calls late in 
the game against Buffalo that gave New England a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The third mistake came a week later, when the officials gave the  
New York Jets a 32-31 win over Seattle by ruling that Vinny 
Testaverde had crossed the goal line on a fourth-down quarterback 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the NFL floated the idea of instant replay for the  
playoffs, a good public relations move that was rejected by its 
rule-making competition committee by a 7-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant replay has a good chance of returning for next season.  
</P>
<P>
	But it couldn't help Holmgren and the Packers keep their season  
alive Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bills Special-Teamer Pike Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Mark Pike, one of the Buffalo Bills'  
four remaining players from the Super Bowl years, retired Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pike, a special-teams standout, played his entire 13-year career  
with the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by former Super Bowl teammates Andre Reed, Thurman Thomas  
and Bruce Smith in the media room at Ralph Wilson Stadium, a 
tearful Pike said he was retiring to spend more time with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I can be a full-time dad and a full-time husband,'' Pike  
said. ``My head and my heart say it's time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, Thomas and Smith are the only players left on the team who  
played in Buffalo's four straight Super Bowls losses from 1990-93. 
</P>
<P>
	As captain of special teams coverage, the 35-year-old Pike led  
the unit in tackles for the eighth time in nine years this season 
with 28. The Bills' season ended with a wild-card loss to Miami on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never would have imagined that I'd be part of one of the  
greatest runs in sports history,'' Pike said.

<HEADLINE> `Patch Adams' Tops Box Office Again / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Patch Adams'' was the No. 1 movie for a  
second weekend, and ``Stepmom'' held its own as family films 
claimed the top box office spots over the New Year's holiday, 
according to weekly industry estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though roundly panned as sappy, the Robin Williams movie about a  
doctor who uses comedy to heal was an audience hit with $20.1 
million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really responding to his Golden Globe nomination  
for best actor and they're very taken by ... the true-life story of 
Patch Adams,'' said Alan Sutton, senior vice president of 
distribution and marketing for Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom,'' which also took critical lumps, was second with $15  
million, followed by the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan comedy ``You've Got 
Mail'' with $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also doing well were animated and children's films, which are  
typically trucked out during the holidays because studios know 
children are out of school and families are together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Prince of Egypt,'' DreamWorks' animated adult fable of  
Moses that reportedly cost more than $100 million to make, was in 
fourth place with $11.5 million, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc. Disney's ``A Bug's Life,'' was in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had two other films in the Top 10. The big ape movie  
``Mighty Joe Young'' was sixth with $8.7 million and ``Enemy of the 
State'' was at No. 8 with $5 million. The horror film ``The 
Faculty,'' which took in $8 million, was in seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek: Insurrection'' and ``Jack Frost'' rounded out the  
list, with $4.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies are thriving generally, thanks in part to the soaring  
number of screens, said Phil Barlow, president of Disney's Buena 
Vista Pictures Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sorts of records are being shattered. People are going to  
movies more than they've ever gone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the take for the top 12 weekend films was down from the  
same weekend last year -- $106.4 million compared to $107.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Patch Adams,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Stepmom,'' $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``You've Got Mail,'' $14.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $11.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``A Bug's Life,'' $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Mighty Joe Young,'' $8.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Faculty,'' $8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Enemy of the State,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Jack Frost,'' $3.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S., Sudan Make Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The United States and Sudan are making quiet  
contacts to try to settle their differences, mainly over the U.S. 
missile attack that destroyed a factory in Khartoum, a leading Arab 
newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Al-Hayat quoted Sudanese Foreign Minister  
Mustafa Othman Ismael as saying he met with President Clinton on 
the sidelines of a U.N. General Assembly meeting and that the two 
men initiated the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Ismael had sought the meeting with Clinton to explain  
Sudan's position on the attack. He did not say when the meeting 
occurred, but Clinton made a speech at the opening of the General 
Assembly session on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. president understood the case, and he was positive as  
he ordered high-level State Department officials to continue the 
dialogue,'' Ismael was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Hayat said the U.S.-Sudan contacts are carried out through  
diplomatic channels, mainly between the two governments' 
representatives at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. missiles severely damaged the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical  
factory in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	American forces fired the missiles at Sudan and at the suspected  
camps of Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in retaliation for twin 
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa on Aug. 7 that killed 224 
people, 12 of them Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said that the factory was making ingredients  
for chemical weapons and had links to Saudi Arabian dissident Osama 
bin Laden, whose camps in Afghanistan were hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan maintains that the plant made pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Twins Re-Sign Steinbach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Terry Steinbach has reached an agreement with  
the Minnesota Twins on a one-year contract with about $1 million, 
the Star Tribune reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old catcher and Minnesota native turned down more  
money from the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago White Sox to remain 
in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to be back with the Twins next season,'' Steinbach  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official announcement is expected Monday after the Twins  
create an opening for the veteran catcher on their 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the Twins rejected an option to re-sign Steinbach  
for 1999 at $2.25 million and used their option to buy out his 
contract for $500,000. Just a week later, Steinbach filed for free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbach batted .242 with 14 home runs and 54 RBIs last season.

<HEADLINE> McDade's Career in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) -- For Lois Fadden, all that mattered about  
the 36 years that Joseph McDade spent in Congress is this: He 
helped keep the work going at a local ammunition plant that 
employed her brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind the eight-year racketeering case that cast a cloud  
over McDade's career before the Pennsylvania Republican finally won 
acquittal in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do constituents ponder over the derisive comment about the  
$66 million he got from federal taxpayers to build the Steamtown 
railroad historic site from scratch in Scranton, about 100 miles 
north of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	They sent him back to Washington 18 times, and no one doubts  
they would have given him a 19th two-year House term, too, had the 
67-year-old lawmaker not elected to retire. For the folks in 
Scranton, it was the bread-and-butter issues that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you voted for him, you voted for yourself, too,'' Ms.  
Fadden said. ``He kept a lot of people working, raising families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDade, the House's senior Republican, used his spot on the  
defense spending panel to make sure a local factory kept getting 
contracts to produce howitzer shells. He also helped businesses 
battle federal bureaucracy and lured defense companies to replace a 
collapsed coal industry. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters say most people outside the district heard only  
one side of McDade, the one presented in the national media. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably know more about the trial and Steamtown,'' said  
J.A. Panuska, former president of the University of Scranton. 
``They are missing the solid, devoted worker who is a person of 
integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDade was cleared in August 1996 of federal charges that he  
accepted $100,000 in vacations, gifts and campaign contributions in 
exchange for helping defense contractors inside and outside his 
district win $68 million in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although McDade was acquitted, the ordeal took a political and  
personal toll. He lost the chance to become chairman of the 
powerful House Appropriations Committee. He also was diagnosed with 
Parkinson's disease, which causes a slow but steady loss of motor 
skills and flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, his efforts to create the Steamtown site became a  
symbol of pork-barrel politics to critics. Local business leaders, 
however, consider the federally financed project an important 
economic development tool. 
</P>
<P>
	McDade's accomplishments in the district are numerous, and many  
buildings, a recreational trail and a park built atop an abandoned 
coal mine bear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	McDade entered Congress in 1963 and became a member of the  
Appropriations Committee two years later, becoming adept at 
bringing millions of dollars to Scranton and environs. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Reagan called for more defense spending in the  
early 1980s, McDade saw job opportunities and joined the 
committee's defense panel, rising to the ranking Republican in 
1985. It was in that capacity where he had the most influence on 
national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe McDade is a very strong person, and if there's something  
he wanted to see accomplished or prevent, he didn't give in 
easily,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., incoming chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McDade's office was renowned for constituent service, helping  
people fill out unemployment claims and resolve Social Security 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	McDade rarely sought headlines or television appearances and  
never sought any higher office. He usually won re-election by wide 
margins, even while criminal charges were pending against him. 
</P>
<P>
	His efforts to help defense firms win contracts ultimately got  
him in trouble. Federal prosecutors tried to link those contracts 
to free flights he received on corporate jets, tickets to the NCAA 
Final Four basketball tournament and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	On the witness stand in Philadelphia, McDade acknowledged  
receiving many of the items, but he blamed staff oversight for his 
failure to report them. The jury cleared him. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks later, defense contractors and other supporters  
threw a poolside cocktail party for McDade at the Republican 
National Convention in San Diego. Later, he invited jurors to 
Washington for a private tour of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	McDade, who said he wanted to spend more time with his family,  
has not announced any post-retirement plans. He said his eight 
years under investigation and indictment were his only 
disappointments in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very privileged to have served here,'' he said. ``I have  
been able to move the wheel a number of times in helping the 
country.''

<HEADLINE> Spurrier Defuses QB Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Less than 12 hours after Florida's Orange Bowl win  
over Syracuse, coach Steve Spurrier was subtly turning up the heat 
on Doug Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier said Sunday that Johnson, who broke his left leg midway  
through the seventh-ranked Gators' 31-10 victory, would remain his 
No. 1 quarterback ahead of Jesse Palmer when spring practice 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug is first in line to be our quarterback next year,''  
Spurrier said before going on recruiting visits. ``Hopefully we 
won't have to alternate them. We're not planning on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that could change based on Johnson's ability to  
recover in time for spring ball. Or his decision whether to 
concentrate on football this summer instead of playing minor-league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how all of this is going to play out,'' Spurrier  
said. ``Doug's got to make a decision whether to stay in 
Gainesville all summer. It helps a quarterback to be a team leader 
if he's with them working out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A third baseman in the Tampa Bay system, Johnson was rated the  
Devil Rays' 10th-best prospect by Baseball America magazine before 
rotator-cuff surgery caused him to sit out last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll talk to some people, talk to the Devil Rays,'' Johnson  
said Saturday night. He expects to make a decision in about a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson appeared on the way to his best game of the season  
before getting injured on a hit by Syracuse's Marc Pilon with 4:18 
left before halftime. X-rays showed a broken fibula, requiring 
about 12 weeks of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson completed his first six passes for 139 yards and  
touchdown tosses of 51 and 26 yards to Travis Taylor, finishing 
12-of-17 for 195 yards. That came after a regular season in which 
he threw for 2,346 yards with 19 TDs and only eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug's got one year left of college football,'' Spurrier said.  
``If baseball's his best sport, he's got the rest of his life to do 
that. He's only got one more year to see if football's his best 
sport.'' 
</P>

	Palmer, whose broken collarbone gave Johnson the starting job  
midway through the season, completed 10 of 14 for 113 yards and a

	MANTI, Utah (AP) -- The bodies of two teen-age boys who were  
killed in an avalanche while snowboarding were found early Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Cowboys Stunned by Playoff Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Tex. (AP) -- Chan Gailey's first year as Dallas Cowboys  
coach ended in a playoff disaster that has shaken the organization 
to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Cowboys won the NFC East with a 10-6 record,  
nobody expected a collapse against the Arizona Cardinals in the 
playoffs. The Cowboys had beaten Arizona 16 of the last 17 times 
they played. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-7 beating wasn't as close as the score indicated.  
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Deion Sanders said it might be time for a big player  
shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look in a mirror and be happy with the way we  
played,'' Sanders said following the loss. ``It's time for some 
guys to step up or step out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona, Dallas looked like the 6-10 club last year that  
got Barry Switzer fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to call ourselves bigtime players, then we  
have to make big plays,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys missed wide receiver Ernie Mills, who has the speed  
to stretch a defense. Mills was lost for the season with an injury 
a month ago. Also, Dallas played without Chris Warren, signed to 
give Emmitt Smith some rest at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the way Dallas played neither player could have helped  
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is a long way from being the team that won three Super  
Bowls in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to think this is the same Cowboys as the old  
days and it's not,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman, who was sacked 
four times and intercepted three times by the Cardinals. ``It's 
not. We rely on different people now, and for a few of the people 
the door of opportunity is shut. We are looking through a different 
window now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys still need help on the offensive line, more speed on  
offense, and a pass rush. In the offseason, they must sign 
linebacker Randall Godfrey, placekicker Richie Cunningham and 
punter Toby Gowin, wide receiver Patrick Jeffers, running back 
Sherman Williams, and Mills, whose contracts have expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive guard Nate Newton is an unrestricted free agent and  
the Cowboys likely won't pursue him. Cornerback Kevin Smith's fate 
also is to be determined. He was healthy, but didn't play against 
Arizona as Kevin Mathis took his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a heck of a season and there is a lot to be proud of,''  
Aikman said. ``We're not satisfied, but there was a lot to be proud 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys suffered a total breakdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a total team loss from the top to the bottom,'' Jones  
said. ``We're very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones said he was pleased with the first year under  
Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about our coach and what he brought to the table  
with our players and quarterback,'' Jones said. ``Next year should 
be an exciting one and we'll study what went wrong and address our 
needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Michael Irvin said it hurt the way the Cowboys  
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hate to think we had to lose a playoff game to do some  
soul searching,'' Irvin said. ``We should have done a whole bunch 
of soul searching before we got into the playoffs. I just need to 
sit down and deal with this right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys hadn't lost a home playoff game since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis tried to look on the bright  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some positives to build on for next year,'' Ellis  
said. ``Our overall record and record in the (division, 8-0) was 
good. At this time last year we were a losing team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said the Cowboys will be studied from top to bottom in  
the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost seven times this year and we will go and evaluate why  
and where we did poorly and try to correct it for next year,'' 
Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to give the team a goodbye speech, but stopped short.  
</P>
<P>
	``I started to evaluate the season and then stopped and just  
talked about the game,'' he said. ``I thought the guys were too 
disappointed to take what I was saying about the season. I will 
address the season later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Daryl Johnston said that despite the premature ending,  
it was a good year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first year under a new system and we probably did  
better than people expected, going 10-6,'' Johnston said. ``We'll 
be back next year after we have extra time to work on our new 
offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said changes in personnel could be coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Surely some changes will be made,'' Smith said. ``Whatever it  
takes I'm all for it. I feel we have a good system.''

<HEADLINE>  Midwest Digs Out From Winter Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicagoans dug out from their biggest snowstorm  
in more than 30 years Sunday while thousands of already delayed 
travelers across the Midwest waited for airlines to get their 
planes de-iced and back in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	About 22 inches of snow had piled up from Chicago across  
northern Indiana as the storm spread snow, ice, slush and rain from 
the Missouri Valley to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Old Man Winter can just go away now and give us  
80-degree weather. He made his point,'' Karen Erickson said after 
finding her car covered by a snow drift in Fond du Lac, Wis., 60 
miles north of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 28 deaths had been blamed on the storm, 10 of them in  
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Lakeshore Drive reopened and pavement was clean on  
many other main arteries. However, public and Catholic school 
classes were canceled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going real well considering that 24 hours ago we were in  
the second-worst snowstorm in Chicago history,'' said Terry Levin, 
a spokesman for the city, which put more than 700 pieces of 
snow-fighting equipment on the streets. The city's record is 23 
inches, set in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, who's running against Mayor  
Richard Daley in February, complained that crews concentrated on 
neighborhoods with more white residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about politics,'' Daley responded.  
</P>
<P>
	The city's delay in plowing away the 18.8 inches that fell in  
1979 was blamed for Jane Byrne's upset victory over incumbent Mayor 
Michael Bilandic in that year's Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice and blinding, wind-driven snow created havoc for air  
travelers through the entire weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest,  
United, American and most other airlines canceled the bulk of their 
flights Saturday. And on Sunday -- expected to be one of the busiest 
travel days of the year -- United canceled 60 percent of its flights 
out of Chicago and American canceled at least half, according to 
officials at the airport's two largest carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherri Gilbert waited in a line the length of two football  
fields at O'Hare's United terminal. She had been trying to get home 
to Springfield, Mo., from Portland, Maine, since Friday night and 
her chances of making a flight Sunday were grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't get through this line before my flight leaves,'' said  
Gilbert, one of the lucky ones who got a hotel room near O'Hare 
Saturday night. ``I told my husband one more day and I'm going to 
have to go shopping in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of Chicago's woes spread far beyond the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to go to Chicago to get somewhere else,'' said  
Kathy Tremmel of Harlan, Iowa, who was stuck at Omaha's Eppley 
Airfield trying to catch a connecting flight in Chicago to take her 
to London. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis International Airport closed overnight for the  
first time in 20 years. Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport 
reopened Sunday after being shut down overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight cancellations at Detroit Metropolitan Airport left  
travelers sacked out in booths at Mike &AMP; Pat's Bar &AMP; Deli -- which 
advertised ``Best view of the snow inside the airport'' -- while 
others slept in an airport mezzanine. The airport doled out about 
2,000 pillows and 2,200 blankets, airport spokesman Mike Conway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like one big pajama party,'' said Donna Brigman. She  
and her 13-year-old daughter returned to Detroit on Saturday from a 
Florida vacation -- they swam with dolphins in temperatures in the 
80s -- but couldn't find a way home to Ypsilanti, just 20 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 to 15 inches of snow that blanketed the Detroit  
metropolitan area was the most from a winter storm since Jan. 6, 
1994, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stretch of Interstate 65 in northwestern Indiana was closed  
Sunday for the second time in two days, and 10 cities and 44 of the 
state's 92 counties still banned unnecessary travel. Drifts more 
than 2 feet high closed the South Shore Railroad, which carries 
over 12,000 daily commuters from northwestern Indiana to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the  
night with 200 other travelers at Faith Baptist Church near 
Lafayette, Ind., after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just 
picked it up and put it in the ditch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were killed and as many as 23 others were injured  
Sunday in a 16-vehicle accident on ice-slicked Interstate 81 in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also spread ice on parts of the Northeast. Ice was  
blamed for a 50-car pileup on New York's Grand Central Parkway, and 
22 cars and a truck were caught in a chain-reaction wreck on I-80 
in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding forced authorities to close the Garden State Parkway in  
New Jersey on Sunday when a stream covered the roadway about 10 
miles northwest of Newark. It was later reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain drenched New York City, where 2.42 inches of rain fell in  
Central Park, breaking the record of 1.41 inches for the date set 
in 1936. Bridgeport, Conn., also set a record with 2 inches of 
rain.

<HEADLINE> Md. Farmer Seeks Profit From Deers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TANEYTOWN, Md. (AP) -- To most farmers, deer are a pest that eat  
their crops. But Leonard Miller thinks that raising deer for their 
meat could be a profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller faces considerable odds not only in the skeptical farm  
community but in the Legislature as well. Maryland is one of three 
states that prohibit deer farming. 
</P>
<P>
	Deer devoured an estimated $38 million worth of corn, wheat and  
soybeans in the state in 1996, according to a survey by the 
University of Maryland. That did not include damage to other 
vegetables and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They take a look at the wild deer here and think these are the  
same, but these animals, the way they're grouped up and treated, is 
just the same as beef or dairy cattle would be,'' Miller told The 
(Baltimore) Sun recently. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a growing market for venison among gourmet restaurants  
and grocery stores and health-conscious meat lovers seeking to cut 
back on fat and cholesterol. Miller thinks deer could give his farm 
a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Venison consumption in the United States has risen 30 percent a  
year for the past five years, said Barbara Fox, executive director 
of the North American Deer Farmers Association. More than 80 
percent of that meat comes from New Zealand, which is the major 
exporter worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Deer farming caught on in the United States in the 1970s,  
starting with two farmers who began raising European species such 
as fallow and red deer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who has three teen-age children, hopes domesticated deer  
could be the product that ensures his farm's viability into the 
next generation. 
</P>
<P>
	He used to raise dairy cattle but has sold off his herd over the  
past few years. Fluctuating milk prices and the labor-intensive 
nature of dairy farming convinced him it would not ensure the farm 
for his children. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Leonard Jr., 19, works as a hunting guide in Montana.  
It was while on such a trip two years ago that he met John Craig, a 
Maine farmer who raises deer. He told his father about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Miller ordered several deer from Craig, but as he  
looked into state regulations he learned he could be breaking the 
law if he penned the deer on his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had hoped to get the Maryland Farm Bureau to include a  
proposal on deer in its legislative agenda for the coming 
legislative session, but the organization rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Bureau was concerned about diseases the animals can  
spread to existing livestock herds, such as cattle, said Emily 
Wilson, the group's assistant director of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller maintains that deer can be managed and inoculated  
like any other farm animal.

<HEADLINE> Questions Abound About NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- We should know shortly whether David Stern's  
threat was real, whether Michael Jordan will play again and whether 
it was worth it to push the NBA to the brink of calamity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern is due back in the office Monday after spending two weeks  
in Aspen, Colo., and union director Billy Hunter has told the 
players on his negotiating committee to be in town by Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to negotiate. The league is refusing to  
negotiate,'' Hunter said Sunday. Hunter also said he had not yet 
spoken to Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	With Thursday the deadline for reaching a new collective  
bargaining agreement, a look at some of the most pressing questions 
in what will be one of the most pivotal weeks in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: They wouldn't cancel the rest of the season, would they?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Yes, they would. The threat of losing the entire 1998-99  
season is very real, with Stern saying many owners are pushing him 
to pull the plug and teach everyone a lesson about how seriously 
imperiled the league's financial health is. But rest assured, NBA 
fans, Stern will not cancel the season without making at least one 
sincere, last-ditch effort to forge a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So when does Stern make his final push?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It depends on what his owners tell him to do. One possibility  
would be for him to come out of the Board of Governors meeting 
Thursday with the authorization to make one ``absolute, final 
offer.'' It's hard to see Stern ending the season without something 
being voted on by the 430 players. The NHL lockout settlement in 
1995 came several days after the deadline, and baseball owners went 
two days past their deadline when they canceled the 1994 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is the biggest factor in the way of a compromise?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Aside from the fact that the chief negotiators have let this  
fight get too personal, the single biggest stumbling block appears 
to be the union's insistence upon receiving 57 percent of the 
revenues in year 6 of a six-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So why doesn't the union drop to 56 percent?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Because the players received 57 percent last season, and  
union director Billy Hunter has said that even though the players 
are willing to take less in years 4 and 5 of the agreement, they 
shouldn't come out of year 6 receiving any less of a percentage 
than they had when they negotiated the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How far apart are they after so many proposals and  
counterproposals? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Each side has addressed the other's main concerns, with the  
union limiting high-end salaries and the owners offering higher pay 
for the so-called shrinking middle-class of the player population. 
The main sticking point now is the percentage of revenues that 
should be devoted to salaries, the owners asking for 53-54 percent 
and the players asking for 55-57 percent. Each percentage point 
equals about $20 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Who is most to blame?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Both sides. The owners could have gotten a deal done months  
ago by playing the give-and-take negotiating game more 
aggressively. The union, for its part, should have found a way to 
make a deal Oct. 28 when Stern still wanted to save an 82-game 
season, or during the 30-day period late in the summer when 
everyone was waiting for arbitrator John Feerick's guaranteed 
contracts ruling. Once regular-season games became irretrievably 
lost, there was no chance for a quick compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens if they settle?  
</P>
<P>
	A: First, they'd have to put the agreement on paper and have it  
ratified -- a process that could take about a week. After that, 
training camps would open, 200 free agents would be on the market, 
trades could take place and everyone would be placed into an 
unprecedented scramble before the season started in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What happens if they don't settle?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Everything becomes chaotic. Franchises that are worth an  
average of $200 million lose value, $1 billion in player salaries 
goes unpaid, someone tries to start a new league, players try to 
make money overseas, the union decertifies, the whole mess is 
fought in court, the fans continue to learn to live without the NBA 
and the league never is the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's wrong with them?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The owners and the commissioner have been waiting several  
years to regain control of their industry and set the NBA on the 
correct financial course. Kevin Garnett signed for $126 million in 
1997, and Allen Iverson may have topped that figure in 1998 if the 
lockout hadn't commenced. As far as they're concerned, this fight 
had to be fought at some point in time to put a stop to the lunacy. 
The players, meanwhile, know that they are the product everyone 
pays to see. And like any union, it does not want to give back many 
of the gains they have made at the bargaining table through the 
years. Don't forget that players are competitors. And when someone 
challenges them, they fight back harder than most. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about the fans?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The widespread public apathy associated with this lockout  
proves that fans don't want to take sides on an issue in which no 
one seems to have their best interests at heart. The fan population 
has become jaded by strikes and lockouts in major league baseball, 
pro football and pro hockey during the past three decades, and it 
appears they have learned to tune out when billionaires and 
millionaires fight over their money. If the lockout ends and a 45- 
to 50-game season is saved, there's no telling if and when the fans 
will come back. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: And finally, what about Jordan?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Only Michael knows, and it'll take a settlement to get him to  
announce his plans.

<HEADLINE>  Midwest Digs Out From Winter Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicagoans dug out from their biggest snowstorm  
in more than 30 years Sunday while thousands of already delayed 
travelers across the Midwest waited for airlines to get their 
planes de-iced and back in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	About 22 inches of snow had piled up from Chicago across  
northern Indiana as the storm spread snow, ice, slush and rain from 
the Missouri Valley to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Old Man Winter can just go away now and give us  
80-degree weather. He made his point,'' Karen Erickson said after 
finding her car covered by a snow drift in Fond du Lac, Wis., 60 
miles north of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 28 deaths had been blamed on the storm, 10 of them in  
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Lakeshore Drive reopened and pavement was clean on  
many other main arteries. However, public and Catholic school 
classes were canceled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going real well considering that 24 hours ago we were in  
the second-worst snowstorm in Chicago history,'' said Terry Levin, 
a spokesman for the city, which put more than 700 pieces of 
snow-fighting equipment on the streets. The city's record is 23 
inches, set in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	However, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, who's running against Mayor  
Richard Daley in February, complained that crews concentrated on 
neighborhoods with more white residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about politics,'' Daley responded.  
</P>
<P>
	The city's delay in plowing away the 18.8 inches that fell in  
1979 was blamed for Jane Byrne's upset victory over incumbent Mayor 
Michael Bilandic in that year's Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice and blinding, wind-driven snow created havoc for air  
travelers through the entire weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the nation's busiest,  
United, American and most other airlines canceled the bulk of their 
flights Saturday. And on Sunday -- expected to be one of the busiest 
travel days of the year -- United canceled 60 percent of its flights 
out of Chicago and American canceled at least half, according to 
officials at the airport's two largest carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherri Gilbert waited in a line the length of two football  
fields at O'Hare's United terminal. She had been trying to get home 
to Springfield, Mo., from Portland, Maine, since Friday night and 
her chances of making a flight Sunday were grim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't get through this line before my flight leaves,'' said  
Gilbert, one of the lucky ones who got a hotel room near O'Hare 
Saturday night. ``I told my husband one more day and I'm going to 
have to go shopping in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of Chicago's woes spread far beyond the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to go to Chicago to get somewhere else,'' said  
Kathy Tremmel of Harlan, Iowa, who was stuck at Omaha's Eppley 
Airfield trying to catch a connecting flight in Chicago to take her 
to London. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis International Airport closed overnight for the  
first time in 20 years. Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport 
reopened Sunday after being shut down overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight cancellations at Detroit Metropolitan Airport left  
travelers sacked out in booths at Mike &AMP; Pat's Bar &AMP; Deli -- which 
advertised ``Best view of the snow inside the airport'' -- while 
others slept in an airport mezzanine. The airport doled out about 
2,000 pillows and 2,200 blankets, airport spokesman Mike Conway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like one big pajama party,'' said Donna Brigman. She  
and her 13-year-old daughter returned to Detroit on Saturday from a 
Florida vacation -- they swam with dolphins in temperatures in the 
80s -- but couldn't find a way home to Ypsilanti, just 20 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 to 15 inches of snow that blanketed the Detroit  
metropolitan area was the most from a winter storm since Jan. 6, 
1994, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stretch of Interstate 65 in northwestern Indiana was closed  
Sunday for the second time in two days, and 10 cities and 44 of the 
state's 92 counties still banned unnecessary travel. Drifts more 
than 2 feet high closed the South Shore Railroad, which carries 
over 12,000 daily commuters from northwestern Indiana to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads were like ice,'' said John Rawlings, who spent the  
night with 200 other travelers at Faith Baptist Church near 
Lafayette, Ind., after his van slid off I-65. ``The wind just 
picked it up and put it in the ditch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were killed and as many as 23 others were injured  
Sunday in a 16-vehicle accident on ice-slicked Interstate 81 in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm also spread ice on parts of the Northeast. Ice was  
blamed for a 50-car pileup on New York's Grand Central Parkway, and 
22 cars and a truck were caught in a chain-reaction wreck on I-80 
in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding forced authorities to close the Garden State Parkway in  
New Jersey on Sunday when a stream covered the roadway about 10 
miles northwest of Newark. It was later reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain drenched New York City, where 2.42 inches of rain fell in  
Central Park, breaking the record of 1.41 inches for the date set 
in 1936. Bridgeport, Conn., also set a record with 2 inches of 
rain.

<HEADLINE> Williams Sworn In As D.C. Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local elected politics in the nation's capital  
entered a new era Saturday as Anthony Williams, a Harvard-educated 
lawyer credited with taking control of the city's finances, was 
inaugurated the District of Columbia's fourth elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our citizens deserve the best city in America,'' said  
Williams. ``Strong schools, safe streets, clean communities, 
affordable housing and reliable transportation,'' were among the 
goals he outlined in his 15-minute inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 47, also appealed to residents for greater commitment  
to the district's youth. ``We have watched the sons of the district 
die in pools of blood on their front porches,'' said Williams, 
noting further that too many young people are winding up in prison, 
or as young parents at a time when they still need parents 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	And Williams, who was dubbed the ``federal'' candidate by  
critics during the election, pledged to work for greater 
self-governance in the district. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, Congress exercises legislative oversight  
of district affairs, and can prohibit the use of district resources 
for controversial policies such as needle exchange programs, 
abortions and a ballot referendum on the medical use of marijuana. 
The city elects a non-voting delegate to the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams plans to be integrally involved in the day-to-day  
running of the city, meeting weekly with department heads and 
senior-level staff as he attempts to deliver on his promises to 
improve the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for all D.C. residents to give mayor Tony Williams  
their full support,'' said outgoing Mayor Marion Barry as he 
presented Williams with the city seal. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry -- who was elected to four terms, the last, following his  
1991 conviction and jail sentence on a misdemeanor drug charge -- 
also offered a final thanks to residents ``for your forgiveness of 
me from time to time when I mess up.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Faces Impeachment Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY JIM ABRAMS   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress convenes this week with Senate  
leaders still looking for a middle-ground approach that ends 
President Clinton's impeachment trial quickly while satisfying 
conservatives' demands for full presentation of his alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 106th Congress goes into session Wednesday and senators will  
immediately huddle to consider a plan that could end the 
impeachment process within four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans will meet Thursday, and ``my assumption is  
that this will be the sole topic of the conversation,'' Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a bipartisan proposal crafted by Sens. Slade Gorton,  
R-Wash., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the House ``managers,'' or 
prosecutors, would present their case on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's defense team would have the next day to rebut;  
questions and answers would occupy the third day and senators would 
vote on the fourth day whether the House's accusations of perjury 
and obstruction of justice against the president, even if true, 
warranted removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	If, as expected, a two-thirds majority is not reached, the  
Senate could then, with a simple majority vote, adjourn the trial 
and consider a censure resolution against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told Time magazine  
that the Gorton-Lieberman plan was a ``fair start'' but that the 
situation was fluid and ``it could be blown away by any number of 
people or events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott is under strong pressure from House Republicans and fellow  
conservatives to allow a full trial, including the calling of 
witnesses. Whatever is done, he said, he would be ``bashed by the 
left'' or ``criticized by people on the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP concern is that with a lengthy trial, Republicans will  
be characterized as more interested in punishing the president than 
attending to the nation's business. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties said Clinton should postpone his  
scheduled Jan. 19 State of the Union address if the trial is still 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be unseemly and distracting for the president  
to be giving a State of the Union address to Congress while he was 
under trial in the Senate,'' Gorton said on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., appearing with Gorton, agreed.  
``It's inappropriate to report on the State of the Union as long as 
the president is under impeachment, because the State of the Union 
from the perspective of his administration is unclear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, noted that it was not until the era of  
television that the president began to appear personally before 
Congress to outline his legislative goals for the year. Clinton 
could revert to the old practice of submitting his speech in 
writing, Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made clear they would oppose any plan to conduct  
regular business while the trial was ongoing. ``How can you have a 
trial impeaching the president of the United States and then, in 
the afternoon or in the morning say, 'Oh, we're going to do 
Medicare,' or 'Let's now do Social Security,''' Sen. John Breaux, 
D-La., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum for a quick trial has grown with recognition, even  
among Republicans critical of Clinton, that they do not have close 
to the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody believes that it is unlikely at this point  
that two-thirds of the Senate would vote to remove the president 
from office,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers -- GOP members of the House Judiciary Committee  
who would act as prosecutors in the Senate trial -- insisted they 
could carry out a full trial, including the calling of witnesses, 
and still finish in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican who has come out against removing Clinton from  
office, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said nonetheless the 
president should be one of the few witnesses summoned. 
</P>

	``In the context here where the president is really asking the  
Senate to ... leave him in office ... we are entitled to hear from 
him in a very sensible, straightforward way,'' he said on NBC.

<HEADLINE> Va. Highway Crash Leaves 4 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Four people were killed and as many as 23  
others were injured in a multi-vehicle crash Sunday morning on an 
icy stretch of highway. 
</P>
<P>
	State police Sgt R.D. Ross said four people were killed in the  
series of accidents. He blamed the crashes on slick road conditions 
and excessive speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police dispatcher S. Thompson said the wreck on Interstate 81  
just south of Lexington involved eight tractor-trailers and eight 
cars, including the vehicle of a trooper who had been working on an 
earlier accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the injured was trucker Billy Freeman, who was driving  
from Los Angeles to Boston in a tractor-trailer loaded with lemons 
when they saw the first accident and stopped. Moments later, other 
trucks crashed into the back of their rig, overturning it and 
knocking it off the road. Freeman suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were coming off a hill and it was slick but we came to a  
stop,'' he said. ``Then, after that -- Slam! Bang! I thank God I'm 
here because there were some people who did not make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said the dead included two people from Tennessee and two  
from Alabama, but names were being withheld pending notification of 
next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 16 injured people were taken to Stonewall Jackson  
Hospital in Lexington, hospital spokeswoman Beverly Fertig said. 
She said six people were taken to hospitals in Roanoke and 
Charlottesville. Their conditions were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The accidents left I-81's northbound lanes closed and backed up  
traffic at least seven miles. The highway was expected to remain 
closed for hours, Thompson said. Side roads also were backed up for 
miles.

<HEADLINE> Pats' Law Beaten on Critical Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Ty Law raced up the left side of the  
field, stride for stride with Jimmy Smith. The All-Pro cornerback 
simply had to knock the ball down, as he had done so often, to keep 
the momentum with the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, though, ran a little farther and made a diving catch in  
the end zone of Mark Brunell's 37-yard pass. Just like that, the 
Jaguars, whose 12-0 halftime lead had been cut to 12-10, were back 
in control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only one play,'' Law said after Jacksonville's 25-10  
wild-card playoff win Sunday. ``They say that doesn't win or lose a 
game, but as far as I'm concerned, that was a turning point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law led the NFL with nine interceptions, matching the total for  
his previous three NFL seasons. As unlikely as he was to give the 
momentum back to the Jaguars, so was backup quarterback Scott Zolak 
unlikely to take it from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak completed just 5 of 16 passes for 39 yards in the first  
half. But in the second half, the substitute for injured Drew 
Bledsoe, led New England to a touchdown and a field goal, 
completing 11 of 15 passes for 116 yards on those two drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were only down 12-0. This team's pretty good under  
adversity. I got my rhythm,'' Zolak said. ``We were getting 
rolling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, they were doing it without Bledsoe, who missed his  
third straight game with a fractured finger, and their top wide 
receiver, Terry Glenn, who has a broken ankle. And on defense, 
starting linebackers Ted Johnson and Todd Collins were sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	But another of their top players was healthy: Law.  
</P>
<P>
	And, as he lined up opposite Smith on a first-and-10 play early  
in the fourth quarter, he didn't expect to get beat. In fact, 
Miami's Oronde Gadsden was the only receiver to beat him for a 
touchdown all season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brunell had the wind at his back and Law lost the footrace  
with 12:24 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Brunell threw a great ball and Jimmy Smith made a great  
catch. He (Smith) just played the ball longer than I did,'' Law 
said. ``I just slowed up at the end, because I thought it was an 
underthrown ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He had an extraordinarily, extraordinarily good year,'' coach  
Pete Carroll said of Law. ``It took a great play to beat a great 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 19-10, the Patriots still had more than 12 minutes left  
to get back in the game, but Zolak, starting the first playoff game 
of his eight-year career, couldn't get the momentum back. Their 
remaining four possessions ended with Zolak losing the ball on a 
fumble, an interception and a fourth-down sack, and Tom Tupa 
punting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was bad in the first half, better in the second,'' Zolak  
said. ``We came back and rallied, but ran out of gas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Patriots, though, would blame the loss on injuries  
that, at different times in the season, forced 11 opening-day 
starters to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even talking about it. It's so obvious,'' Carroll  
said. ``To see Drew sitting on the sidelines and Teddy (Johnson) 
over there, there's no words for it. We've been dealing with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely, though, did they have to deal with Law not coming  
through. 
</P>
<P>
	``That one of the first times I've seen Ty get beat all year and  
Jimmy Smith beat him,'' linebacker Chris Slade said. ``It's not 
like Jimmy Smith is a scrub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't matter to Law. All he knew is that he didn't do his  
job and it hurt his team badly. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a Pro Bowl guy over there and he made a great catch,''  
Law said. ``He ended up with five catches, but that one catch is 
what everyone is going to remember. I'll shoulder the blame for 
everything.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Jerry Quarry Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Quarry, a popular heavyweight who  
fought Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson then eventually lapsed into 
a punch-drunk fog, died Sunday after being taken off life support. 
He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry was hospitalized Dec. 28 with pneumonia and then suffered  
cardiac arrest while at Twin Cities Community Hospital. He died at 
3:52 p.m. after family members directed doctors to remove life 
support, according to Claude Sutherland, a longtime family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a family decision to take him off life support when  
they were told he would probably be bedridden,'' Sutherland said. 
``They're pretty distraught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, who earned $2.1 million in purses as a top contender in  
the 1960s and '70s, later was living on Social Security checks. By 
the age of 50, the pounding he had taken in the ring turned him 
into a confused, childlike man whose relatives had to take care of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won the last fight of his life by going home to God,''  
Quarry's mother, Arwanda, said through Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical name for his condition was dementia pugilistica,  
severe brain damage caused by repeated blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of Quarry's career were two fights against  
Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. Both bouts were in 
Quarry's hometown of Los Angeles, and the first ended in a draw and 
he won the second on a controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, a 6-foot, 195-pound blond who seemed to be easy to cut,  
earned his biggest payday, $338,000, by fighting Ali when Ali 
returned from his banishment in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fight in Atlanta, the two butted heads and a gash  
opened above Quarry's left eye. Ali peppered the spot with jabs, 
spraying blood, and stopped Quarry in three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry futilely pleaded with the referee not to stop it.  
</P>
<P>
	Ali cut Quarry again to win a rematch in seven rounds, and Joe  
Frazier bloodied him badly in the second of their two fights, 
winning in five at Madison Garden in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry turned to cocaine and alcohol on the downslopes of his  
career, dulling his reflexes and leaving him virtually defenseless 
in the ring. He finished his pro career with a 53-9-4 record after 
having fighting more than 200 bouts as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd do it all again, same way,'' he said three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Neurological tests revealed early signs of dementia in 1982,  
before his short-term memory loss and motor skills deteriorated so 
noticeably and before his last three fights. 
</P>
<P>
	A neuropsychologist who examined him five years ago said that  
boxing had aged the boxer 30 years and that he was at third-stage 
dementia, similar to Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Quarry fought for one final time. Believing he could  
make a comeback as George Foreman had, he took a bout in Colorado, 
a state where no boxing license was required. 
</P>
<P>
	But Quarry was battered for six rounds by a club fighter.  
``Irish Jerry'' Quarry's payday for absorbing the beating was 
$1,050. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was missing the accolades,'' Jerry's brother James said  
three years ago. ``In making those comebacks, Jerry would walk 
around saying, `I'm going to be a hero again.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by three children; four sisters; three brothers,  
including Jimmy and Mike, who were fighters; and parents, Jack and 
Arwanda Quarry. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled for Saturday in Shasta.

<HEADLINE> Computing Gets `iMac Look' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac is not merely a popular computer  
that single-handedly helped pull Apple Computer Inc. back from the 
brink. It's the new fashion trend in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the desktop machine's recent climb to No. 1 in  
retail sales, computer designers are rolling out a new breed of 
products wrapped in similar translucent casing through which inner 
circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	They range from computer mice to joysticks that seem like tools  
from an alien space ship. And veteran industry watchers expect 
Apple to sell other computers, including a laptop due out next 
spring, that take cues from the iMac's design. 
</P>
<P>
	Even chip maker Intel Corp., which Apple publicly roasted in  
advertisements last year, is prodding other big computer makers 
like Compaq to reshape the clunky, beige machines on most desks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that there haven't been other attempts to change the  
traditional computer look. Sony several years ago introduced a 
sleek, black desktop that never really took off. But the 
jellybean-like iMac, which comes equipped with a built-in monitor, 
seems to be transforming computer fashion the way Swatch started a 
new craze in watches. 
</P>
<P>
	And the iMac offers more than a new look. It also appeals to  
computer users who crave simplicity. The iMac's connectors are 
located conveniently on the side, instead of the back, and the 
machine can quickly be hooked up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's $1,300 iMacs accounted for 7 percent of all PCs sold at  
retail in the United States in November, giving it the top-selling 
spot and helping to double Apple's overall retail market share to 
10 percent, market researcher PC Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures suggest the iMac has helped Apple stem a defection  
of Mac customers to personal computers that run on Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, a trend that contributed to two years of 
red ink at the once-prosperous computer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive,  
hopes to try to extend the recent success to other products. Some 
analysts say he has little choice in an industry increasingly 
dominated by cheaper Windows machines, which cost as low as $400 
excluding the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has concluded the only way to differentiate himself is  
industrial design and ergonomics,'' said Tim Bajarin of Creative 
Strategies Research International, a Campbell, Calif. consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement over the technology design trend is evident at  
the MacWorld Expo computer show, opening here Monday. The number of 
exhibitors is up 15 percent to 420 this year, reflecting an 
increase in companies making iMac-related products, said show 
manager Rob Scheschareg. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan-owned Mace Group Inc. is showing off four products from  
its Macally unit -- iMouse, iStick game joystick, iBall trackball, 
and the iHub for connecting peripherals -- all encased in bluish, 
clear plastic like the iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple wasn't commenting on its future plans for see-through  
computers. A spokeswoman said the company won't use the show to 
unveil details of a new low-cost laptop computer due out next 
spring. But the industry is buzzing with speculation the new 
portable will sport a stylish, translucent looked modeled on the 
iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard it's quite different from any portable we've ever  
seen,'' Bajarin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is taking a more conventional route to boost demand  
for its machines: Speeding them up. The company is expected to 
introduce a new iMac with a more powerful microprocessor and 
possibly drop the price of the current version, which is equipped 
with a 233-megahertz chip. The new iMac reportedly will debut in 
February for a price similar to the current $1,300 ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is set to roll out its new line of G3 professional  
desktop systems, code-named Yosemite. The new models will sport 
speedier microprocessors and higher-capacity storage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jobs is not expected to change one oft-criticized feature of  
the iMac: Its lack of a floppy drive, a turnoff to those dependent 
on disks for storing and transferring files. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's success with the iMac, it remains an open  
question whether the company can sustain its momentum and become a 
major rival again to makers of Windows-based machines. One 
lingering concern is whether software makers will continue to 
develop exciting new programs for the Mac.

<HEADLINE> Report: BMW Chief Admits Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder  
acknowledged management errors at Rover Group, the company's 
struggling British subsidiary, according to a report released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has Rover on ``too long a leash,'' Pischetsrieder was quoted  
as saying in the Hamburg-based weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Rover's nagging financial woes -- analysts predict the  
unit could post losses of $650 million for 1998 -- the BMW chief 
declared he has no plans to resign. There has been speculation that 
BMW board member Wolfgang Reitzle would replace Pischetsrieder as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Rover failed to sell enough cars in Britain to private  
customers, although sales remained strong to groups such as car 
rental agencies, the BMW chief said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several top managers have resigned over the crisis at Rover,  
which reached agreement with unions in December to trim 2,500 jobs 
from the current work force of 39,000. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW's Rolls Royce subsidiary also expects to post 1998 losses of  
$179 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pischetsrieder denied any plans for a merger. ``Under no  
circumstances will we hand Rolls Royce over to Volkswagen or anyone 
else,'' he was quoted as saying. Rumors had named VW and Ford as 
possible merger partners with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Offsetting losses in its subsidiaries, the BMW brand expects  
record profits this year of $1.9 billion, according to recent 
German media reports.

<HEADLINE> Kona Gold Sets Santa Anita Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Kona Gold broke the Santa Anita track  
record for 5 1/2 furlongs when the 5-year-old gelding won the $107,300 
El Conejo Handicap in 1:01 3-5, beating Big Jag by 2 1/4 lengths 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis, Kona Gold knocked a fifth of a second off  
the record set by Lit De Justice in the 1996 El Conejo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kona Gold, who carried high weight of 119 pounds, paid $4, $2.60  
and $2.20. Big Jag returned $3.40 and $2.40. Mr. Doubledown was 
another 4 1/2 lengths back, and paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $64,380, increased Kona Gold's career  
earnings to $282,514, with four wins in seven starts. He was third 
last year in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Bruce Headley, who trains Kona Gold, had  
suggested his horse would set a track record. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's training out of his mind,'' Headley said.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Bruce says something like a horse is going to set a track  
record, I know I take him seriously,'' Solis said. ``I knew this 
horse had never trained as well as he had before this race. So I 
was confident, too.''

<HEADLINE> Biennial World Cup Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter proposed  
the biggest change in the history of world soccer Sunday, saying 
the World Cup should be held every two years instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter said the changes would increase the status of national  
teams, which he said were threatened by proposals for a new Super 
League of European clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am demanding a clear statement: Do we want national teams or  
do we only want club football?'' the president of soccer's world 
governing body told the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his plan would see the competition taking place in all  
even-numbered years, instead of every four years as at present. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existing four-yearly tournament is out-of-date. It dates  
from the 1930s when teams chugged from one continent to another on 
ships,'' Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bobby Charlton, star of England's World Cup-winning team of  
1966 attacked the plans Sunday, saying a move to a biennial 
tournament would be ``very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how they could do that because there wouldn't be  
time to qualify. My own personal feeling is that every four years 
is often enough because it's something to look forward to,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to wait for it and it increases the whole value of  
it. I just hope it's not based on finance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Blatter's proposals, qualification for the finals would  
happen in odd-numbered years when national teams would take part in 
continental tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing system of qualification, where teams play  
international matches in groups over the course of the years 
leading up to the finals, would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, elected FIFA president last June, said his proposals  
were a reaction to European media tycoons -- including Italian 
Silvio Berlusconi -- pressing for a European super league of top 
club teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was afraid if the league went ahead clubs would be  
unwilling to release their international stars, which could see the 
next World Cup -- in Japan and South Korea in 2002 -- being fought 
out among reserve teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A competition every two years would give national teams the  
``status they deserve,'' Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he has already put his idea to the FIFA executive  
committee, which is now studying it. Any changes could not come 
into force before 2006.

<HEADLINE> Recreational Anglers Get Organized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- When he was a boy, Stephen Medeiros and  
his father could drop a few hooks into the icy waters of 
Narragansett Bay and fill a bucket with winter flounder in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the winter flounder, like a number of other fish caught by  
generations of weekend anglers, are largely gone from Narragansett 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Medeiros blames years of intensive commercial fishing,  
especially by boats that dragged the bottom to scoop up the flat 
groundfish. 
</P>
<P>
	So, like recreational fishermen in coastal states around the  
country, Medeiros is putting down his rod and marching to the state 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, he helped found the Rhode Island Saltwater  
Anglers Association, a grassroots organization intent on lobbying 
for tougher commercial fishing regulations in state waters. The 
group has grown to 170 members in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't start acting, our grandkids are never going to  
know the joy of catching a fish,'' said Medeiros, a retired police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, recreational fishermen like Medeiros, who  
have seen everything from flounder to swordfish disappear from 
their favorite fishing spots, are preparing to fight commercial 
fishing interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar organizations have sprouted in recent years in Alaska,  
California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina 
and Virginia, according to James Donofrio, executive director of 
the national Recreational Fishing Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to organize recreational fishermen is the brainchild  
of Donofrio, a charter boat captain who has seen stocks of 
swordfish, sharks, tuna, marlin and other large sport fish decline 
rapidly in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed the alliance, headquartered in New Gretna, N.J., in  
1996 and hopes to do for recreational fishermen what the National 
Rifle Association, one of the country's most powerful lobbies, has 
done for hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the problems in fishing as political,'' said Donofrio.  
``To be effective, you need to be organized in congressional 
districts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the state affiliates and the national alliance has  
reached 48,000, he said. Donofrio is forming a political action 
committee to target key congressmen and senators and hopes to give 
about $100,000 in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance also plans to get the attention of congressmen by  
mass mailings and numerous telephone calls to key legislators, 
methods also employed by groups like the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization is still puny by national standards. It has a  
Washington lobbying office and a $500,000 budget supported largely 
by annual dues of $25. But Donofrio wants to enlist many more of 
the country's estimated 15 million recreational anglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Donofrio wants ``I fish and I vote'' to become a familiar phrase  
to congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	He has already won some allies in Congress, including Rep. Jim  
Saxton, R-N.J., chairman of the House Resources Subcommittee on 
Fisheries Conservation, Oceans and Wildlife, who commended the 
group in a letter published in the October edition of Makin' Waves, 
the alliance's national newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., has prepared a nonbinding  
Sense of Congress document that says commercial swordfish and tuna 
fishing should be curtailed. If approved by Congress, the document 
would be presented to the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, recreational fishing interests will make their biggest  
lobbying effort ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Donofrio has enlisted Pallone and other congressmen to push a  
bill that would outlaw so-called long lines, which many scientists 
blame for falling stocks of swordfish, tuna, marlin and sailfish, 
among other species. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines can stretch across 10 or 20 miles of ocean and dangle  
thousands of baited hooks in the migratory channels or spawning 
areas of swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the 1960s, fishermen used harpoons to spear swordfish.  
Harpooning required skill, and it ensured that many swordfish got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the advent of long lines, swordfish stocks in the North  
Atlantic have fallen 68 percent, according to documents from the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The average weight of a swordfish caught has dropped to 90  
pounds, from several hundred in the 1960s, according to Donofrio 
and others. That means juveniles that have never had a chance to 
spawn are being taken in large numbers, Donofrio says. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is producing a gory video about long lining to be  
shown to key congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a frontal attack on long lining and we make no bones  
about it,'' said Mike Laptew, an underwater filmmaker who is 
producing the video. 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude has drawn criticism from the commercial fishing  
industry at the state and national level. 
</P>
<P>
	``For one thing, the fish doesn't belong to them, it belongs to  
the people,'' said Jerry Carvalho, president of the Rhode Island 
Inshore Fisherman's Association, which represents a fleet of small 
commercial boats. ``We bring the fish to market for the citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a group of commercial fishing interests sent a  
letter to congressmen in August that called the Recreational 
Fishing Alliance ``a serious threat to our domestic marine 
fisheries management process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, signed by the National Fisheries Institute, which  
lobbies for fish packers and distributors, told congressmen to 
disregard mail from the recreational fishing alliance as 
``blatantly biased misinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Gutting Jr., executive vice president of the National  
Fisheries Institute in Arlington, Va., said the recreational 
fishermen want to drive commercial fishermen out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	He said declines in swordfish have been caused by overfishing in  
international waters and that recreational fishermen, some of whom 
have charter businesses, are trying to protect their own interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned when people demand exclusive use of  
resources for themselves,'' he said of the recreational fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Donofrio says he supports commercial fishermen -- it's their gear  
he dislikes. Commercial fishing once was a romantic business, but 
that aura no longer is deserved, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the gear they use is simply brutal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woody Harrelson admits he has expressive eyes.  
He's just not sure it's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could say some people say I look kinda crazy,'' Harrelson  
says in Sunday's Daily News. ``People who don't even know me, they 
say, `You look crazy in your eyes.' I don't see it, but I have that 
said enough times that I have to give it some weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of numerous film including ``Natural Born Killers,''  
``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ``Kingpin,'' Harrelson can be 
seen in two holiday season releases: ``The Thin Red Line'' and 
``Hi-Lo Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrelson got his start and won an Emmy playing bumbling  
bartender Woody Boyd on ``Cheers.'' Social activism accompanied his 
movie success. He has protested against laws criminalizing the 
cultivation of hemp and against logging in old growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the first to admit many movie fans have no sympathy for  
actors who use their celebrity to back social causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually people just want you to shut up,'' Harrelson said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Plunge at Midday Close / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen  
Monday as the euro made a quiet debut on Asian foreign exchange 
markets. Fears about a stronger yen caused Tokyo share prices to 
plunge in the first trading session of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.28 yen at midday, down 1.92 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 113.57 yen 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 426.28 points,  
or 3.08 percent, to close the abbreviated session at 13,415.89 
points. On Wednesday, the average closed down 1.84 points, or 0.17 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday and Friday for  
the New Year's holidays. The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at the end 
of morning trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday Monday, the euro was quoted at dlrs 1.1800, up from  
dlrs 1.1755 earlier in the session, and well above the fixing rate 
of dlrs 1.16675 set Thursday by the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro also reached 134.77 yen at midday, above 132.60 earlier  
and up from its initial fixing of 132.80 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for euros by Japanese investors wanting to acquire  
euro-denominated assets pushed the currency up against the yen, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many players were reluctant to trade the new currency  
against either the dollar or the yen ahead of the opening of the 
European market later Monday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the first week, it will be all wait-and-see,'' said  
Kazuo Takayama, chief foreign exchange sales manager at Midland 
Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of  
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said he arrived at the trading room at 4 a.m. to 
make sure systems were functioning properly. 
</P>
<P>
	No banks have reported any major system glitches so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, worries about the state of U.S. and Latin American  
financial markets continued to exert downward pressure on the 
dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices fell amid active  
futures-led selling because of concern over a steep gain in the yen 
against the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players are worried about a continued decline of the dollar  
and uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, 
general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Among early losers were blue chips, including Sony, NEC,  
Fujitsu, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive  
abroad, thus cutting into earnings of export-oriented companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 22.07 points, or 2.03 percent, to close at 
1,064.92. The TOPIX finished down 1.84 points or 0.17 percent, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.990 percent from Wednesday's finish of 2.010 
percent, driving its price up to 98.48 yen from 98.33 yen.

<HEADLINE> New Age Church Leader To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORWIN SPRINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Elizabeth Clare Prophet has  
announced she will retire as spiritual leader of the Church 
Universal and Triumphant, a New Age sect headquartered on a 
sprawling ranch next to Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Prophet, diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in November, said  
she will retire sometime this summer to deal with health concerns 
and to spend more time with her family, including a 4-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman known as ``Mother'' to her followers said she will be  
60 in April. She stepped down as church president in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, the church founded by Prophet's first  
husband bought the 28,000-acre Royal Teton Ranch and based its 
operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	A survivalist reputation developed and was reinforced during a  
court case challenging the church's tax-exempt status. In 
depositions, church officials acknowledged that in the early 1990s, 
more than 100 firearms and two armored personnel carriers were 
stored near a big fallout shelter at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prophet insisted no church funds were used, and said she was  
unaware of details of weapons purchases by individual church 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prophet had been president of the church for 23 years when she  
left the position in 1996. Her action came within weeks of the 
announcement that she and second husband Ed Francis, then the 
executive vice president of the church, were divorcing after 15 
years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, church followers were told Prophet was one of  
two people through whom ``Ascended Masters'' relayed messages. The 
other was the deceased Mark Prophet, her first husband, who founded 
the church in 1958 in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Church Universal and Triumphant teachings incorporate elements  
of Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism. Use of alcohol and tobacco 
is denounced, as is gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Prophet's retirement as spiritual leader was announced in Miami  
at the church's annual New Year's conference, according to a church 
news release dated Friday.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Hardy Has Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The New England Patriots finally made  
a first down as the first quarter was winding down Sunday. Then 
rookie running back Robert Edwards took a handoff and came 
face-to-face with Jacksonville linebacker Kevin Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	It became a familiar sight the rest of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Stung by two critical losses to the Patriots in his first two  
years in the league, Hardy was bent on making the kind of plays 
expected of a first-round draft pick. In the Jaguars' 25-10 victory 
Sunday, he delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this team wants to go anywhere in the playoffs, we're going  
to have to keep teams from getting in the end zone,'' Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy certainly did his part.  
</P>
<P>
	Along with deflecting a punt on the first possession of the  
game, Hardy wound up with eight tackles in what might have been his 
best game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Fred Taylor helped take the load off a hobbled Mark  
Brunell by rushing for 162 yards, the Patriots needed the same kind 
of contribution from Edwards with Scott Zolak starting for Drew 
Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Hardy, they didn't get it.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's really been a key ingredient for us defensively,'' coach  
Tom Coughlin said. ``I thought today, knowing full well what they 
would try to do with Robert Edwards, he and our defensive front 
seven did a real fine job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who rushed for 1,115 yards this year, managed only 28  
yards on 17 carries. If Hardy wasn't making the tackle himself -- 
Edwards was stopped for no gain or worse four times by the 
third-year linebacker -- he was forcing the play into a swarm of 
Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards' longest run of the game went for 7 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had to shut him down,'' said middle linebacker  
Bryan Schwartz. ``Kevin played very well. He was making plays all 
over the field, and he's done that all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy thanked a change in position for that.  
</P>
<P>
	He struggled through his second season with Jaguars at  
strongside linebacker, but moved over to the weak side when the 
Jaguars signed Bryce Paup as a free agent. Paup, an All-Pro with 
the Buffalo Bills, has been somewhat of a disappointment this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy hasn't. He led the Jaguars with 178 tackles, recovered two  
fumbles and had two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's performed very, very well for us,'' Coughlin said. ``By  
having him back in that spot, he goes sideline to sideline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Hardy showed Sunday, he makes plays.  
</P>
<P>
	About the only thing Hardy was kicking himself over was a punt  
he deflected after the Patriots' first possession of the game. 
Hardy broke free inside the line, but Tom Tupa barely managed to 
get the ball off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe I was free, but when I got in there I was  
trying to think: Is he a left-footed or a right-footed punter?'' 
Hardy said. ``I just tried to lay out, but he got it off and I was 
kicking myself. I got a deflection, but it should have been a 
touchdown or a safety. That would have been a big play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy didn't come up with a highlights play the rest of the  
game, but made a lot of solid plays that kept New England out of 
sync. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots had only one first down and 54 yards at halftime,  
although the Jaguars failed to run up a score better than 12-0. 
Zolak gave up on the run and the Patriots worked their way down the 
field on a 17-play, 85-yard touchdown drive behind short passes -- 
only three plays longer than 10 yards, none longer than 21. 
</P>
<P>
	After another similar drive led to a field goal that cut the  
lead to 12-10, Jimmy Smith gave the Jaguars a 19-10 lead and the 
defense finally got the stop it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the sidelines, guys were getting a little antsy,'' Hardy  
said. ``We just had to stay calm and play our game, and we did 
that. We lost to New England in a couple of big games, the biggest 
being the AFC championship game, and that's still a sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``To avenge that loss was a big thing to do, especially in the  
playoffs.''

<HEADLINE>  Panthers To Name Seifert As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE(AP) -- George Seifert, who has the best winning  
percentage of any coach in NFL history, will be the new head coach 
of the Carolina Panthers, The Associated Press learned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would not confirm its choice of Seifert to replace the  
fired Dom Capers, but sources said the Panthers were trying to 
arrange a news conference at Ericsson Stadium on Monday to 
introduce their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, 58, who has been out of coaching since he left the San  
Francisco 49ers after the 1996 season, is to get a multiyear deal 
with Carolina worth about $2 million per season, the sources said. 
In addition to serving as head coach, Seifert is to have a leading 
role in the team's player personnel moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, who won 75.5 percent of his games (108-35) with San  
Francisco from 1989-96, did not immediately return telephone 
messages left Sunday at his home in Los Altos, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's introduction of Seifert would complete a whirlwind  
eight days for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers was fired last Monday after posting a 30-34 record in  
Carolina's first four seasons. Capers helped the 1996 Panthers to 
the NFC West title and a 12-4 record -- both unprecedented feats for 
second-year NFL expansion teams -- but Carolina followed by losing 
21 of 32, including a 4-12 record this past season, when the 
Panthers were hampered by numerous personnel problems and their 
most injury-plagued year yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of Capers' ouster, Seifert arrived in Charlotte. He  
stayed overnight Monday and met with team owner Jerry Richardson on 
Tuesday before flying back to California. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams with coaching vacancies also expressed  
interest in Seifert, and the Panthers also were considering Green 
Bay's Mike Holmgren. But with Holmgren thought to be leaning toward 
either staying with the Packers or going to the 49ers, Carolina 
made a strong push for Seifert, who went 12-4 in his final season 
in San Francisco but was swept by the upstart Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert likely would find part of his new staff already waiting  
for him in Carolina. Richardson said last week he wants to retain 
three of Capers' assistants -- offensive coordinator Gil Haskell, 
tight ends coach Don Breaux and wide receivers coach Richard 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspapers have reported that Ray Rhodes, fired last  
Monday as Philadelphia's coach, could become Seifert's defensive 
coordinator if he is unable to find another head coaching job.

<HEADLINE>  Cardinals Looking For Another Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have followed every  
step in coach Vince Tobin's blueprint for restoring a tattered 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	First, they swept away the team's negative history. Then they  
accomplished what even diehard fans considered unthinkable at the 
start of this year -- a first-round playoff victory over the Cowboys 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they face what may be an insurmountable object -- the 15-1  
Minnesota Vikings, at the Metrodome no less.. 
</P>
<P>
	His team's intensity and effort in a 20-7 domination of Dallas  
on Saturday impressed Tobin, but not the fact that the Cardinals 
won a playoff game for the first time in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got work to do. We're not in a celebrating mood,''  
Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, one of the NFL's charter franchises, carried a  
losing image from Chicago to St. Louis to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last winning season before this year's 9-7 was in 1984,  
their last playoff appearance in 1982 and their last playoff 
victory in 1947, an era when the NFL championship was decided in 
one game. Until Saturday, that was the only postseason win since 
the franchise was founded in 1920.

past. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tobin doesn't mind discussing his two years as defensive  
coordinator at Indianapolis and the similarities between the Colts 
and Cardinals -- unpopular owners, fan apathy and players who felt 
they were destined to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the year before Tobin left for the Cardinals, the Colts  
earned a wild-card spot, won two games and fell four points short 
of beating Pittsburgh in the AFC championship game and earning a 
Super Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin has something similar in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our future is this week against Minnesota, or next year,

the league.

	``A big part of the goal when I got here was, `Why couldn't the  
Cardinals be a class operation that other teams would want to

here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin took a 4-12 team to 7-9 his first year in Arizona. The  
Cardinals skidded to 4-12 last season, but Tobin continued to 
insist his club was better than its record, which included two 
one-point losses and three in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, homegrown stars like quarterback Jake Plummer, wide  
receiver Frank Sanders and linebackers Jamir Miller and Ronald

<P>
	And the players learned to think about the future.  
</P>
<P>
	They found it in Texas Stadium, where they hadn't won since  
1989.

	In its first playoff appearance, the NFL's youngest defense  
sacked Troy Aikman four times, pressured him into 22-of-49 passing

<P>
	The Cardinals, who rose from 29th to 13th in total offense over

<HEADLINE>  Cardinals Looking For Another Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have followed every  
step in coach Vince Tobin's blueprint for restoring a tattered 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	First, they swept away the team's negative history. Then they  
accomplished what even diehard fans considered unthinkable at the 
start of this year -- a first-round playoff victory over the Cowboys 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they face what may be an insurmountable object -- the 15-1  
Minnesota Vikings, at the Metrodome no less.. 
</P>
<P>
	His team's intensity and effort in a 20-7 domination of Dallas  
on Saturday impressed Tobin, but not the fact that the Cardinals 
won a playoff game for the first time in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got work to do. We're not in a celebrating mood,''  
Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, one of the NFL's charter franchises, carried a  
losing image from Chicago to St. Louis to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last winning season before this year's 9-7 was in 1984,  
their last playoff appearance in 1982 and their last playoff 
victory in 1947, an era when the NFL championship was decided in 
one game. Until Saturday, that was the only postseason win since 
the franchise was founded in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all history to Tobin, who says he doesn't care about the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tobin doesn't mind discussing his two years as defensive

<HEADLINE> Embattled Mountain Gorillas Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Kenneth Cameron got the emergency call after  
only a few months in Rwanda. A young female mountain gorilla had a 
snare around her ankle and was in danger of losing a foot, maybe 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
	What he didn't know when he headed for the Congo forest was that  
she had a protector -- a 400-pound male gorilla who dealt with the 
human interloper by sitting on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came walking over, turned and sat on one leg, reached over  
my head and grabbed some leaves and ate for several minutes while 
he had me pinned,'' Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron, an associate veterinarian at the Cincinnati Zoo, is in  
the midst of a two-year stint with the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary 
Project, which tries to monitor the health of the rare animals. 
Mike Cranfield, head veterinarian of the Baltimore Zoo, is the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The gorilla project was established by the Denver-based Morris  
Animal Foundation in 1985, the year gorilla expert Dian Fossey was 
killed at her camp in Parc National des Volcans in Rwanda, where 
she studied the animals for 18 years and waged a personal war to 
protect them from poachers. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a decade, scientists have been stymied in their  
efforts to help mountain gorillas because of ethnic fighting near 
their home -- a densely-forested volcanic mountain range at the 
borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Parc National des Volcans, where the gorillas live at elevations  
between 9,000 and 13,000 feet, has become so dangerous that Cameron 
has been unable to visit the project's veterinary center in the 
park in Kinigi since his arrival in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossey's camp, Karisoke, has been stripped of lumber and metal  
sheeting. Several times the project's center has been looted and 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The military recently provided an escort for trackers with the  
Atlanta-based Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, another research group that 
collaborates with the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project, to count 
Fossey's gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trackers found 63 gorillas in September representing two of  
Fossey's original three groups. The following month they located 
the third group of 16, a bit smaller than when last counted in the 
1980s. Two infants were among the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is surprising with the turmoil that the gorillas are still  
around and appear to be doing all right,'' said Dieter Steklis, the 
gorilla fund's chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranfield, who returned from a two-week visit in early December,  
said he's hopeful the veterinary center can be re-opened in the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rwanda is much more settled and we were able to make it to the  
edge of the park,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of mountain gorillas left is in dispute. None live in  
captivity. About 300 are believed to live in parks in Rwanda, Congo 
and Uganda. A second population of smaller gorillas with broader 
faces in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda could 
double that number depending upon whether they are mountain 
gorillas or a subspecies. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic testing indicates that the two gorilla groups are  
genetically the same, but scientists want more testing to determine 
whether the Bwindi gorillas, which live at lower altitudes, are 
truly mountain gorillas. The two groups are divided by a large 
swath of farmland in a broad valley in the volcanic mountain range. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Cameron would expect to provide emergency veterinary  
care for at least two or three injured gorillas a year. But the 
call in October 1997 was a rare opportunity, in large part because 
rebel fighting prevents trackers and park guards from entering the 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``We're just not getting the  
calls. No one is there to see and report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel fighters aren't the only ones giving Cameron trouble.  
Sometimes it's the gorillas. After traveling for five hours, he 
found the young female gorilla and a silverback -- the name given to 
dominant males for the grey hairs down their backs. Trackers formed 
a defensive line so Cameron and his assistant could begin their 
work, or so they thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He unfortunately moved through that defensive line and was  
looking for someone to take out his anger on. Unfortunately it was 
me,'' Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the male gorilla sat on him, Cameron made guttural noises to  
calm him. After about five minutes, the silverback let him crawl 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron found the young female in thick underbrush. He clipped  
dead skin from where the snare had amputated the end of her toe, 
took blood, urine and stool samples, and gave her an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished just as the silverback broke through the underbrush,  
10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came right down to the wire,'' Cameron said.  
</P>
<P>
	If not for rebel fighting, Cameron said he probably could have  
saved a young male gorilla in Bwindi. The youngster was 
malnourished and weakened by parasites and couldn't keep up when 
his group fled, probably after encountering another gorilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron had to delay his departure for about 12 hours because it  
is not safe to travel at night. The gorilla died several hours 
before Cameron reached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better during Cranfield's visit when the team was  
called to help a young male gorilla in Uganda with a snare on its 
right hand. The group found the injured gorilla in dense bamboo 
among a group of eight gorillas, which included two silverbacks who 
twice charged the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	The young gorilla was darted and the team got to work, cleaning  
the wound and administering an antibiotic. Even so, the gorilla 
will probably lose two fingers, Cranfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their research, the project team of Cameron, his  
assistant, and two local veterinarians, is gathering data on the 
gorillas' vulnerability to human diseases. Since mountain gorillas 
and humans share about 97 percent of the same DNA, they get the 
same diseases, including polio and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists want to know what diseases the gorillas are being  
exposed to and whether they are developing resistance. The 
information will be used to develop a new protocol for tourist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Several mountain gorillas died in 1988 and 1990 of respiratory  
problems caused by human measles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like a nasty flu virus can go through that  
population and ravage it,'' Steklis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cameron returned to Rwanda in late October, he took back a  
portable blood chemical analyzer that will allow veterinarians to 
test for kidney and liver problems, anemia and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about 100 hair, tissue, blood and feces samples have  
been sent to the University of California-Davis to be analyzed for 
parasites, bacteria, viruses and other infections, as well as clues 
to nutrition and genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also hopes to educate the locals about alternative  
sources of protein besides bush meat, such as cane rats, goats and 
rabbits, that won't require hunting with snares in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranfield said being able to help the young gorilla was one of  
the greatest thrills of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are magnificent animals and there are very few of them  
left.''

	Report: Dole To Leave Red Cross  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is planning to step aside as  
president of the American Red Cross in a step her political 
supporters hope will lead to her running for president, Newsweek 
magazine reported. The magazine reports in its Jan. 11 edition that 
one of Mrs. Dole's close advisers described her decision as a 
``first step'' toward a possible campaign for the Republican 
nomination. Red Cross officials would not confirm the report but 
announced late today that Mrs. Dole would make a ``major'' 
announcement tomorrow. Mrs. Dole's husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, 
was the GOP presidential nominee in 1996 and she has consistently 
scored high in public opinion polls as a potential candidate.

	Clinton Backs Long-Term Care Credit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing an  
unprecedented $1,000 tax credit, at a cost of billions, to 
compensate 2 million American families struggling to provide 
long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives. The tax credit, 
meant to compensate caregivers for a wide range of activities that 
tending to others requires, is part of a five-year, $6.2 billion 
package that the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
will announce tomorrow. 

</P>

	Deadly Storm Strikes Midwest  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At least 23 deaths are being blamed on the storm  
that's spread snow, ice, slush and rain from the Missouri Valley to 
the East Coast. Ten of the deaths were in Illinois. Chicago got 
almost 22 inches of snow, its biggest snowfall since 1967. The 
storm also hit the Northeast, where ice caused numerous car 
crashes. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Case May Move Quickly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Momentum is building for a Senate plan that  
may lead to the censure of President Clinton. Proposed by one 
Democrat and one Republican, the proposal would give the House 
prosecutors and the White House each one day to present the senate 
with their cases. Senators would then have a day to ask questions. 
Then, on the fourth day, they would vote on whether charges against 
the president, even if true, were grave enough to remove him from 
office. If a two-thirds majority isn't reached, the Senate could 
adjourn the trial with a simple majority, then move to a possible 
censure motion against the president.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A Mars lander is up and away at Cape  
Canaveral, headed for the fringes of the Martian south polar cap 
470 million miles away. NASA's Mars Polar Lander took off aboard a 
Boeing rocket at exactly 3:21 p.m. The rain that managers had 
feared stayed away, allowing NASA to meet the instantaneous launch 
window despite an overcast sky. The lander is due to arrive in 
December when it's late spring on Mars and the sun never sets.

	Euro Trading Begins  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The euro, the new common currency expected to  
increase Europe's power in the global economy, began trading today. 
The day's first dealings in the euro were expected to be cautious 
and subdued, and that was clear in Sydney, Australia, where the 
currency was trading between $1.1742 and $1.1777. In Tokyo, the new 
currency was trading from $1.1700 to $1.1748. The 11 European 
nations that launched the euro represent 20 percent of world 
economic output.

six children belonging to a Denver-based Christian Cult they say 
planned to open fire on officers in Jerusalem at the end of 1999. 
``They planned to carry out violent and extreme acts in the streets 
of Jerusalem at the end of 1999 to start the process of bringing

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Patch Adams'' was the No. 1 movie for a  
second weekend, and ``Stepmom'' held its own as family films 
claimed the top box office spots over the New Year's holiday, 
according to weekly industry estimates released today. Though 
roundly panned as sappy, the Robin Williams movie about a doctor 
who uses comedy to heal was an audience hit with $20.1 million in 
ticket sales. ``Stepmom,'' which also took critical lumps, was 
second with $15 million, followed by the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan comedy

<P>
	ORANGE, Calif. (AP) -- A Washington state tourist was released  
from the hospital more than a week after she suffered head injuries 
in a Disneyland accident that killed her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieu Thuy Vuong was discharged from University of California,  
Irvine Medical Center on Saturday, a few days earlier than planned, 
said Michelle Glassmeyer, a spokeswoman for the hospital. 
</P>

accident. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband, Luan Phi Dawson, were in a crowd waiting to  
board the Columbia -- Disneyland's replica of a three-masted sailing 
ship -- when a mooring rope tightened and tore an 8-pound, T-shaped 
metal cleat from the ship's bow. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson, 33, suffered severe head injuries and died two days

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Confirms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and AirTouch Communications  
Inc. confirmed they are holding talks relating to a possible 
business combination. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch, the nation's second-largest cellular phone company,  
said that ``significant issues still remain unresolved,'' and that 
its board of directors had not approved a transaction. It did not 
elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	In statements released late Sunday, both companies said that no  
further comment would be made by either company until an agreement 
had been reached or discussions were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday cable news channel CNBC, citing sources close to  
the talks, said that Bell Atlantic was negotiating a $45 billion 
takeover of AirTouch. The reported purchase price would make Bell 
Atlantic-AirTouch the fifth-largest merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Gerace, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, refused to comment on the  
report, nor would he comment on a possible timetable for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic this summer agreed to merge with  
GTE Corp. in a $64 billion deal that would allow the companies to 
create a huge provider of all-in-one services, including long 
distance, local calling and wireless services. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC said the Stamford, Conn.-based GTE has already agreed to  
the AirTouch deal, which would be completed before the Bell 
Atlantic-GTE deal closes. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch, a spinoff of former Baby Bell  
Pacific Telesis Group, ranks behind only AT&AMP;T Corp. among U.S. 
cellular phone companies. The company has 14 million cellular 
subscribers in the United States, as well as fast-growing 
international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, the nation's biggest local phone company, has 42  
million telephone access lines and 8 million wireless customers 
worldwide.

<P>
	Without any new competition -- not a single film debuted in wide

Moses that reportedly cost more than $100 million to make, was in 
fourth place with $11.5 million, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' had legs -- many of them. In fifth  
place, it lost just 1 percent of its audience in its seventh week 
for a $10 million gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had two other films in the Top 10. The big ape movie  
``Mighty Joe Young'' was sixth with $8.7 million and ``Enemy of the 
State'' was at No. 8 with $5 million, behind the horror film ``The 
Faculty,'' which took in $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek: Insurrection'' and ``Jack Frost'' rounded out the  
list, with $4.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	In its seventh week, ``Enemy of the State'' was close to hitting  
the $100 million total gross already exceeded by four other Disney 
films of 1998: ``A Bug's Life,'' ``Waterboy,'' ``Armageddon'' and 
``Mulan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Disney expects to have well over $1.1 billion in North  
American grosses for the box office year running from Jan. 5, 1998 
through Sunday. That would put it ahead even of Paramount, which 
scored with the blockbuster ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a titanic comeback, or actually a comeback from  
`Titanic,''' quipped Phil Barlow, president of Disney's Buena Vista 
Pictures Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the decade of the '90s, this will be the fifth time that  
this studio has finished first in box office share,'' he said. ``We 
have been No.1 or No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd bottle it if I could. If I knew what was going on I'd be  
really rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies are thriving generally, thanks in part to the soaring  
number of screens, Barlow added. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sorts of records are being shattered. People are going to  
movies more than they've ever gone ... and you've got the 
megaplexes,'' he said. ``God movies and good theaters -- it's kind 
of an unbeatable combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the take for the top 12 weekend films was down from the  
same weekend last year -- $106.4 million compared to $107.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several films opened in limited release to qualify for Oscar  
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing by Heart,'' an ensemble romance starring Sean Connery,  
Gena Rowlands, Angelina Jolie and Gillian Anderson of ``The 
X-Files,'' had a strong $28,000 on a single screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hi-Lo Country,'' a Western with Woody Harrelson, had a  
meager $6,363 on three screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' the literate, fictional tale of how the  
Bard got his inspiration, was on track to be the year's first 
sleeper hit. Although it finished out of the top 10, the movie 
earned $3.2 million in its fourth weekend, a 23 percent increase 
over the previous weekend. The 299 locations where it was shown 
took in more than $10,700, on average. 
</P>
<P>
	The war film ``The Thin Red Line,'' playing on just two screens,  
had $376,326 in ticket sales, jumping an enormous 68 percent in its 
second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the well-reviewed ``Down in the Delta,'' the  
first directing effort of noted author Maya Angelou, was tanking 
even though it played on just two screens, with ticket sales down 
27 percent in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Patch Adams,'' $20.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Stepmom,'' $15 million.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Ohio State coach John Cooper has made his  
appeal to the voters in The Associated Press poll: If No. 2 Florida 
State barely beats No. 1 Tennessee in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, 
consider the Buckeyes for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden says it won't work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,''  
Bowden said Sunday. ``John might have the best team in the nation, 
but if Tennessee wins, it will be the national champion. And if we 
win, we will be national champions. That's the way it was drawn up 
this year, and I sympathize with John because I've been in his 
place before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new Bowl Championship Series setup, the Fiesta Bowl  
winner automatically finishes No. 1 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' 
poll. No. 3 Ohio State, 11-1 after a 24-14 win over Texas A&AMP;M in 
the Sugar Bowl, cannot be considered for the title in the coaches' 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP media poll, which has no such restrictions, will be  
released early Tuesday after the 70 voters cast their ballots. It's 
certainly a longshot, but at least the Buckeyes would have a chance 
to share the title. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Seminoles win, they would improve to 12-1, and they also  
have a win over Texas A&AMP;M -- 23-14 in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Florida State defensive end Tony Bryant: ``They lost one  
game. We lost one game. They won their bowl game. I think the 
Fiesta Bowl should decide who the national champion is, but it's 
not up to us. We can just hope and pray that if we win, we will be 
national champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEART-TO-HEART:* On the Monday after Florida State's 24-7 loss  
to North Carolina State, coach Bobby Bowden had a rare 
``heart-to-heart'' with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have not responded if they wanted to,'' Bowden said  
Sunday on the eve of the Fiesta Bowl . ``But they wouldn't have 
been around very long afterwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, the Seminoles responded by winning their next 10  
games and squeezed their way into a title showdown against No. 1 
Tennessee only after losses by the two teams ranked ahead of them -- 
Kansas State and UCLA -- on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said if his players didn't respond, he was set to go with  
a youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit them with the fact that they, us, we, were trying live  
off last year's reputation, or the year before, or the year before, 
or the year before,'' Bowden said. ``The biggest enemy you have 
when you're successful is overconfidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lineman Corey Simon said Bowden could have saved the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we had to step it up,'' Simon said. ``The coaches  
didn't have to say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BCS FUTURE:* The Bowl Championship Series got through its first  
season with a minimum of controversy and a maximum of interest -- 
thanks largely to last-game losses by previously undefeated Kansas 
State and UCLA that set up a Tennessee-Florida State matchup in the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the BCS' designated title game is the Sugar Bowl  
Jan. 3, 2000 at New Orleans. The Rose and Orange bowls will be 
played Jan. 1, the Fiesta Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2000 season, the big game shifts to the Orange Bowl  
Jan. 1, 2001. The Rose and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Sugar Jan. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 2001 season, the top game moves to the Rose Bowl Jan.  
3, 2002 -- the first time the game will be played at night. The 
Sugar and Fiesta bowls are Jan. 1, the Orange Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO. 1 VS. No. 2:* Florida State will be playing in a No. 1 vs.  
No. 2 game for the fifth time in the 1990s. The Seminoles are 2-2 
entering Monday night's Fiesta Bowl against top-ranked Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 1996, but then  
lost in the Sugar Bowl rematch and the Gators won the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Florida State beat No. 2 Nebraska 18-16 in the 1994 Orange  
Bowl, and won the '93 national title. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Notre Dame beat No. 1 Florida State 31-24, Nov. 13, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami beat No. 1 Florida State 17-16 Nov. 16, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXTRA POINTS:* The Fiesta Bowl marks the 32nd time No. 1 has  
played No. 2 since the AP poll began in 1936. It's also the first 
1-2 game since Florida State beat No. 1 Florida 24-21 Nov. 30, 
1996. ... The No. 2 team has won 10 of the last 16 1 vs. 2 games. 
... Florida State is 2-1 in Fiesta Bowls, 2-0 under coach Bobby 
Bowden. The Seminoles lost to Arizona State in the first Fiesta 
Bowl in 1971, then beat Nebraska twice in Tempe -- 31-28 in the 1998 
game and 41-17 in the '90 game. ... Florida State played eight bowl 
teams this season, including BCS teams Florida and Texas A&AMP;M. ... 
Tennessee also has wins over two BCS teams -- Syracuse and Florida. 
... The Seminoles have held five opponents to under 100 yards 
passing, and 10 teams were unable to complete 50 percent of their 
passes. ... Vols tailback Jamal Lewis was lost for the season in 
the fourth game, but Tennessee still led the SEC in rushing as 
Travis Henry posted five 100-yard plus games. ... Vols quarterback 
Tee Martin completed an NCAA record 23 straight passes in a win 
over South Carolina. ... The Seminoles are 97-12-1 in the 1990s, 
the best record in the nation. The Vols, at 89-19-2 are fourth, 
behind Nebraska and Florida.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Hastert Keeping Low Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- His new title will be speaker of the House,  
but so far Illinois Rep. Dennis Hastert has done precious little 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild-mannered six-term conservative's low profile since his  
stunning rise to power two weeks ago presents a stark contrast to 
that of his loquacious predecessor, Rep. Newt Gingrich, who weighed 
in on virtually every issue and generated no shortage of 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert ascends to the speakership this week, assuming a  
position behind only the vice president in line to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are expectations that the speaker will be available, but  
it's certainly not codified anywhere that the speaker has to be,'' 
said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University expert on Congress. ``We 
would expect the speaker to be more vocal, particularly when the 
party does not have the White House, because there has to be 
somebody out there saying something just to brace up the morale of 
the opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief meeting with reporters last week in Batavia, Ill.,  
one of his few public appearances, Hastert scolded his House 
colleagues. ``To heal the wounds of Congress we need to get to 
work,'' Hastert said. ``We need to start to achieve things. And I 
think that's what will restore the American people's faith in 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert has used what little time he has had concentrating on  
preparing the House for smooth operations. He has spoken with 
almost every GOP member, said Hastert's spokesman, Pete Jeffries. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffries said another reason his boss has avoided the spotlight  
is Hastert does not want to seem presumptuous. Although it is a 
near certainty that Republicans will nominate him Tuesday as 
speaker, to be followed by formal election the next day in the 
House, Hastert is taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even after he officially takes the gavel, little change  
is likely in Hastert's approach. University of Virginia political 
scientist Larry Sabato ventured that Hastert's obvious 
behind-the-scenes approach to the job will make him among the 
least-recognizable congressional leaders of modern times. 
</P>
<P>
	The low profile is true to Hastert's longtime style as a  
behind-the-scenes deal-maker. And he's made clear in his few public 
comments that he plans to let more effective and telegenic 
communicators do the talking for the party, while he stays ``in the 
shadows'' forging a strong record of accomplishments for the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's nuts-and-bolts focus signals a return to a  
pre-Gingrich speaker model, observers said. ``He'll be much more 
inclined to see that the trains get there on time,'' said Hastert's 
old mentor, former House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	And most are happy with that, agreeing that the best leadership  
Hastert can provide the House -- and his party -- is to stay his 
current course. ``There was a time for a visionary. Now it's time 
to get things done,'' said fellow Illinois Republican Tom Ewing, a 
close Hastert friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, with House Republicans' majority cut down to 223-211  
split, ``He's going to have his hands full just getting one train 
to run on time,'' Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed, a GOP consultant and one-time executive director of  
the Christian Coalition, said perhaps the greatest gift Hastert's 
style will bring Republicans is that he does not offer Democrats an 
automatic star for negative political ads in the 2000 election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have spent a lot of the last four years running down  
rabbit trails with fire hoses putting out fires, usually caused by 
some leader's tactical blunder,'' Reed said. ``Denny, to borrow a 
phrase from an earlier time, is an altogether fortuitous return to 
normalcy.''

<HEADLINE>  DaimlerChrysler Pushes New Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG showed off an unusual van-like  
car Sunday that will become its first production entry in what the 
industry calls ``crossover vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser will go on sale in early 2000 and  
will sell for well under $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bull-nosed Cruiser is small on the outside, it has a  
generous amount of interior space when the three passenger seats 
are folded, which executives hope will appeal to a wide array of 
drivers. It offers access through four doors and a large rear 
hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every automaker is looking at crossover vehicles that  
combine the attributes of cars -- usually better handling and 
performance -- with the utility of minivans, sport utility vehicles 
and pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first to hit the market, the Lexus RX300, is a  
car-based SUV that has been a big hit for Japanese automaker Toyota 
Motor Corp. Toyota's competitors have taken notice, and this year's 
North American International Auto Show features a variety of 
crossovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of what exactly the Cruiser is went unanswered by  
DaimlerChrysler officials after it was unveiled at the Detroit 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This car is too cool to categorize,'' co-chairman Robert J.  
Eaton said. ``We believe the PT Cruiser will truly break the 
barriers of conventional automotive design and function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's announcement at the Detroit show was a surprise, though  
Eaton said the company has long planned to put such a vehicle into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The front-wheel-drive Cruiser will be powered by a 2.4-liter  
four-cylinder engine but a V6 may eventually be offered as an 
option. It will be offered with manual and automatic transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's bulbous look brought comparisons to Volkswagen's New  
Beetle, which Eaton dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different kind of thing,'' he said. ``We didn't  
want to do another traditional passenger car. We specifically 
wanted to get out of the envelope, out of the box, and we think we 
did that.''

	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG showed off an unusual van-like  
car Sunday that will become its first production entry in what the 
industry calls ``crossover vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser will go on sale in early 2000 and  
will sell for well under $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bull-nosed Cruiser is small on the outside, it has a  
generous amount of interior space when the three passenger seats 
are folded, which executives hope will appeal to a wide array of 
drivers. It offers access through four doors and a large rear 
hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually every automaker is looking at crossover vehicles that  
combine the attributes of cars -- usually better handling and 
performance -- with the utility of minivans, sport utility vehicles 
and pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first to hit the market, the Lexus RX300, is a  
car-based SUV that has been a big hit for Japanese automaker Toyota 
Motor Corp. Toyota's competitors have taken notice, and this year's 
North American International Auto Show features a variety of 
crossovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of what exactly the Cruiser is went unanswered by  
DaimlerChrysler officials after it was unveiled at the Detroit 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This car is too cool to categorize,'' co-chairman Robert J.  
Eaton said. ``We believe the PT Cruiser will truly break the 
barriers of conventional automotive design and function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's announcement at the Detroit show was a surprise, though  
Eaton said the company has long planned to put such a vehicle into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The front-wheel-drive Cruiser will be powered by a 2.4-liter  
four-cylinder engine but a V6 may eventually be offered as an 
option. It will be offered with manual and automatic transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's bulbous look brought comparisons to Volkswagen's New  
Beetle, which Eaton dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a totally different kind of thing,'' he said. ``We didn't  
want to do another traditional passenger car. We specifically 
wanted to get out of the envelope, out of the box, and we think we 
did that.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Debt Moves Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler has delayed the planned  
consolidation of its two financial services divisions while it 
evaluates the businesses on which the merged unit should focus, an 
executive said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. merged in November,  
co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said an announcement about the 
consolidation of Chrysler Financial Corp. and Daimler's debis would 
be made in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomas T. Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's North  
American operations, said the complexity of the consolidation has 
slowed it down. He declined to reveal the new target date. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chrysler Financial is involved only in automotive  
financing, debis is diversified with business in such areas as 
train systems and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debis is in lots of businesses, so we're trying to see how to  
focus it and determine which businesses to stay in,'' Stallkamp 
said during in an interview at the North American International 
Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on consolidating the automotive financing side of the  
business is virtually completed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Seek SLOC Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A coalition of community activists has  
repeated its call for the resignations of top Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee officials if probes into bribery in Salt Lake's bid find 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Impact 2002 and Beyond Coalition also asked that  
SLOC president Frank Joklik, senior vice president Dave Johnson and 
legal counsel Kelly Flint not conduct Olympic business until the 
four investigations are complete and it is decided if they should 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also wants SLOC to open its documents and meetings to  
the public and abolish all consultants' pay -- specifically 
targeting former SLOC president Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch resigned after pleading no contest to spouse abuse, then  
signed a $10,000-a-month consulting contract with SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to have no more surprises,'' coalition  
director Glenn Bailey said Saturday. ``We should be aboveboard, 
open, we should know what's happened and what kind of work is being 
done to get us to 2002 successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, SLOC vice president of communications, said any  
changes would come after the investigations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and FBI, U.S. Olympic Committee,  
International Olympic Committee and SLOC's ethics board are all 
investigating claims that Salt Lake's bid committee tried to buy 
the votes of IOC members who selected the site of the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee members have acknowledged giving $400,000 in  
college tuition to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC 
members. Other perks for IOC visitors included free medical care, 
expensive gifts such as guns and skis, and at least one child of an 
IOC member received an internship in city government. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition represents a range of minority, poverty and  
disability rights groups including Justice, Economic Dignity &AMP; 
Independence for Women and Utah Issues. It is the second time in a 
month the group has called for resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's members were less than optimistic that the probes by  
the Olympic agencies would be thorough or have real bite. They also 
called for the state's Tax Commission to audit SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Utahan I am offended by the actions of (SLOC),'' Barbara  
Toomer of the Disabled Rights Action Committee said. ``Just because 
everybody does it, is not an excuse. ... They're acting like a 
bunch of lemmings jumping off a cliff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition members repeated their call for the resignation of  
two members of SLOC's board of trustees -- construction company 
owner Alan Layton and Snowbasin ski resort owner Earl Holding -- for 
apparent conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton's company has contracts with SLOC and Holding's resort  
has benefited from a federal land swap and government funding for a 
new access road tied to the Games, the group's members complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey sent a letter Dec. 31 to Gordon Hall, chairman of SLOC's  
ethics panel, Gov. Mike Leavitt and Mayor Deedee Corradini asking 
that the investigation look beyond whether laws to a ``broader, 
more universal context of the Olympic principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics board determined last year there were no  
improprieties involving Holding or Welch's consulting contract.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Looking For Another Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have followed every  
step in coach Vince Tobin's blueprint for restoring a tattered 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	First, they swept away the team's negative history. Then they  
accomplished what even diehard fans considered unthinkable at the 
start of this year -- a first-round playoff victory over the Cowboys 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they face what may be an insurmountable object -- the 15-1  
Minnesota Vikings, at the Metrodome no less.. 
</P>
<P>
	His team's intensity and effort in a 20-7 domination of Dallas  
on Saturday impressed Tobin, but not the fact that the Cardinals 
won a playoff game for the first time in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got work to do. We're not in a celebrating mood,''  
Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, one of the NFL's charter franchises, carried a  
losing image from Chicago to St. Louis to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last winning season before this year's 9-7 was in 1984,  
their last playoff appearance in 1982 and their last playoff 
victory in 1947, an era when the NFL championship was decided in 
one game. Until Saturday, that was the only postseason win since 
the franchise was founded in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all history to Tobin, who says he doesn't care about the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tobin doesn't mind discussing his two years as defensive  
coordinator at Indianapolis and the similarities between the Colts 
and Cardinals -- unpopular owners, fan apathy and players who felt 
they were destined to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the year before Tobin left for the Cardinals, the Colts  
earned a wild-card spot, won two games and fell four points short 
of beating Pittsburgh in the AFC championship game and earning a 
Super Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin has something similar in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our future is this week against Minnesota, or next year,  
whenever next year starts,'' he said. ``You can't live on what 
you've done in the past, but I am proud of where the franchise is, 
where the organization is, the way the team is thought of around 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big part of the goal when I got here was, `Why couldn't the  
Cardinals be a class operation that other teams would want to 
emulate?' and that wasn't the way they were thought of when we got 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin took a 4-12 team to 7-9 his first year in Arizona. The  
Cardinals skidded to 4-12 last season, but Tobin continued to 
insist his club was better than its record, which included two 
one-point losses and three in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, homegrown stars like quarterback Jake Plummer, wide  
receiver Frank Sanders and linebackers Jamir Miller and Ronald 
McKinnon turned it around this year, producing an NFL-record seven 
victories in eight games decided by three points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	And the players learned to think about the future.  
</P>
<P>
	They found it in Texas Stadium, where they hadn't won since  
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first playoff appearance, the NFL's youngest defense  
sacked Troy Aikman four times, pressured him into 22-of-49 passing 
and three interceptions, and held the Cowboys to 96 yards rushing. 
It was only the sixth time in 17 games the Cardinals accomplished 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, who rose from 29th to 13th in total offense over  
the course of the season, scored touchdowns after their two biggest 
plays of the year, a 59-yard one-handed catch by Sanders and a 
74-yard run by Adrian Murrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Jacke, who won Arizona's last three games with field goals  
on the final play, was perfect in two attempts in this one. 
</P>
<P>
	On defense, the Cardinals stopped the Cowboys three times on  
fourth down and shut them out until the final 3:33. Cornerback 
Aeneas Williams had two interceptions, safety Tommy Bennett had one 
and Miller had two of the four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aikman is the type of quarterback who gets frustrated,''  
Miller said. ``And if you can get to him and hit him, then you can 
get inside his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Something Tobin accomplished with his squad long before it began  
the playoff run.

<HEADLINE> Harrelson's Eyes Show Emotions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woody Harrelson admits he has expressive eyes.  
He's just not sure it's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could say some people say I look kinda crazy,'' Harrelson  
says in Sunday's Daily News. ``People who don't even know me, they 
say, `You look crazy in your eyes.' I don't see it, but I have that 
said enough times that I have to give it some weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star of numerous film including ``Natural Born Killers,''  
``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ``Kingpin,'' Harrelson can be 
seen in two holiday season releases: ``The Thin Red Line'' and 
``Hi-Lo Country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrelson got his start and won an Emmy playing bumbling  
bartender Woody Boyd on ``Cheers.'' Social activism accompanied his 
movie success. He has protested against laws criminalizing the 
cultivation of hemp and against logging in old growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the first to admit many movie fans have no sympathy for  
actors who use their celebrity to back social causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually people just want you to shut up,'' Harrelson said.

<HEADLINE> Drexler Expects NBA Lockout To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Clyde Drexler expects the NBA lockout to end with  
an abbreviated season to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very much surprised if there is not a season,''  
Drexler, the former NBA star who retired after last season and now 
coaches his alma mater, the University of Houston, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at a 41-game season and playoffs. The owners  
really wanted that. The players wanted a full season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drexler, who played in the NBA for 15 years and was voted one of  
the 50 greatest players, said the players' union is solidified and 
won't crack. The drop dead day for canceling the season is 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players' union represents the voice of the players,'' he  
said. ``I don't think there will be a (full) vote. Don't try to 
divide the union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How about his Dream Team teammate Michael Jordan? Will he return  
if the lockout ends or will he retire? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no guess on Michael,'' Drexler said the day after a  
blizzard struck Chicago. ``I guess he's not around with all this 
snow. He's probably somewhere where it's sunny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he told me, I wouldn't betray his trust like some of  
his other friends. I won't mention any names,'' he said with a 
laugh, referring to Charles Barkley. Barkley recently said that 
Jordan, his good friend, would retire.

<HEADLINE> Olympians Surprised at Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- To some Olympic athletes, the most surprising  
thing about the scandal surrounding Salt Lake's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games is the apparent naivete of the American public. 
</P>
<P>
	A. J. Kitt, a member of the American alpine skiing squad and an  
Olympic competitor for the past 12 years, said public perception of 
the Games is ``way out of sync'' with reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in America, people perceive the Olympics and  
Olympic athletes as though they're heaven-sent,'' Kitt said. 
``There are no angels in the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitt was among several current and former athletes interviewed  
by the Standard-Examiner about the scandal that has prompted four 
investigations into accusations that local bid officials bribed 
International Olympic Committee members for their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes told the newspaper they weren't at all surprised by  
the news reports that IOC members and their relatives received 
scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors from Salt Lake 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bower, a 1968 Olympic competitor in Nordic skiing and the  
present manager of the Utah Winter Sports Park, agrees with critics 
who think the Olympic bidding process should be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wonders why some people appear so surprised that money  
and politics dominate the Olympic site selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC probably takes it to a little higher level, but if I'd  
been in one of those key positions with SLOC, I'd probably have 
done the same thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah news media reported as early as February 1995, that Salt  
Lake Olympic boosters were spending an average of $15,500 on each 
IOC member visiting the area during the bid. The expenses included 
air fare, deluxe hotel rooms, meals, and gifts worth up to $200 -- 
the 1995 IOC limit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until November, when news broke that Salt Lake had  
offered scholarships to IOC family members and IOC member Marc 
Hodler publicly criticized the practice as bribery, that the issue 
erupted into the worst corruption crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some former Olympians are wondering why Hodler, a longtime IOC  
member and influential figure in International Ski Federation 
(FIS), chose to voice his allegations in 1998, when he clearly knew 
about the questionable practices long before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marc Hodler has made a great living from being the chief guy  
in the FIS and the IOC for a long time,'' Kitt said. ``It's curious 
to me the way this whole thing came out, and why he decided to 
start pointing fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Voelker, a former Olympian who is now works at Deer Valley  
Resort in Park City, said the scandal will likely pass and won't 
take away from the Olympic ``spirit'' of international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's unfortunate that we (Salt Lake and Utah) are  
being pointed at,'' she said. ``Because we're the next host, people 
could think we we're the state and the city that started all this, 
but I think that's baloney.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Stunned by Playoff Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Tex. (AP) -- Chan Gailey's first year as Dallas Cowboys  
coach ended in a playoff disaster that has shaken the organization 
to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Cowboys won the NFC East with a 10-6 record,  
nobody expected a collapse against the Arizona Cardinals in the 
playoffs. The Cowboys had beaten Arizona 16 of the last 17 times 
they played. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-7 beating wasn't as close as the score indicated.  
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Deion Sanders said it might be time for a big player  
shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look in a mirror and be happy with the way we  
played,'' Sanders said following the loss. ``It's time for some 
guys to step up or step out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona, Dallas looked like the 6-10 club last year that  
got Barry Switzer fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to call ourselves bigtime players, then we  
have to make big plays,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys missed wide receiver Ernie Mills, who has the speed  
to stretch a defense. Mills was lost for the season with an injury 
a month ago. Also, Dallas played without Chris Warren, signed to 
give Emmitt Smith some rest at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the way Dallas played neither player could have helped  
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is a long way from being the team that won three Super  
Bowls in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to think this is the same Cowboys as the old  
days and it's not,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman, who was sacked 
four times and intercepted three times by the Cardinals. ``It's 
not. We rely on different people now, and for a few of the people 
the door of opportunity is shut. We are looking through a different 
window now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys still need help on the offensive line, more speed on  
offense, and a pass rush. In the offseason, they must sign 
linebacker Randall Godfrey, placekicker Richie Cunningham and 
punter Toby Gowin, wide receiver Patrick Jeffers, running back 
Sherman Williams, and Mills, whose contracts have expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive guard Nate Newton is an unrestricted free agent and  
the Cowboys likely won't pursue him. Cornerback Kevin Smith's fate 
also is to be determined. He was healthy, but didn't play against 
Arizona as Kevin Mathis took his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a heck of a season and there is a lot to be proud of,''  
Aikman said. ``We're not satisfied, but there was a lot to be proud 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys suffered a total breakdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a total team loss from the top to the bottom,'' Jones  
said. ``We're very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jones said he was pleased with the first year under  
Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about our coach and what he brought to the table  
with our players and quarterback,'' Jones said. ``Next year should 
be an exciting one and we'll study what went wrong and address our 
needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Michael Irvin said it hurt the way the Cowboys  
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hate to think we had to lose a playoff game to do some  
soul searching,'' Irvin said. ``We should have done a whole bunch 
of soul searching before we got into the playoffs. I just need to 
sit down and deal with this right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys hadn't lost a home playoff game since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
	Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis tried to look on the bright  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some positives to build on for next year,'' Ellis  
said. ``Our overall record and record in the (division, 8-0) was 
good. At this time last year we were a losing team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said the Cowboys will be studied from top to bottom in  
the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost seven times this year and we will go and evaluate why  
and where we did poorly and try to correct it for next year,'' 
Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to give the team a goodbye speech, but stopped short.  
</P>
<P>
	``I started to evaluate the season and then stopped and just  
talked about the game,'' he said. ``I thought the guys were too 
disappointed to take what I was saying about the season. I will 
address the season later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Daryl Johnston said that despite the premature ending,  
it was a good year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first year under a new system and we probably did  
better than people expected, going 10-6,'' Johnston said. ``We'll 
be back next year after we have extra time to work on our new 
offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said changes in personnel could be coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Surely some changes will be made,'' Smith said. ``Whatever it  
takes I'm all for it. I feel we have a good system.''

<HEADLINE> Springer Bouncer Is Chicago Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jerry Springer's onstage bouncer, Steve Wilkos,  
is a moonlighting Chicago cop who can forget about becoming the 
next Serpico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never going anywhere on the police department  
undercover,'' because he's so widely recognized, Wilkos says in 
Sunday's New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	His shaved head and imposing size (6-foot-3, 225 pounds) add to  
Wilkos' prominence on the Springer show, where he is the first to 
jump in and break up the frequent scuffles between combative 
guests. Being well known for quelling trouble isn't all bad for his 
regular job though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps being a little bit of a celebrity, because it calms  
situations down,'' Wilkos said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: 1998 Was Less Violent Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The year ended with a war simmering between  
the United States and Iraq. But a cease-fire by Basque separatists, 
a letup of terrorism in Greece and the end of Liberia's vicious 
civil war are among events that contributed to a sharp drop in the 
number of violent conflicts worldwide, think tanks that track the 
world's warfare reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual survey of 192 nations and territories, the  
National Defense Council Foundation counted 60 conflicts. That 
represents a drop of seven from 1997 but remains well above the 35 
conflicts happening when the Cold War ended in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alexandria, Va.-based council, which promotes greater  
awareness of defense matters, tallies all violent situations that 
result in regional instability. These include even major criminal 
activity and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most specific and paramount danger to international peace  
at present is the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons,'' warned Andy Messing Jr., NDCF's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theoretically, if the participants in any one of these 60  
conflicts obtain weapons of mass destruction, they can turn a 
relatively minor imbroglio into a cataclysmic situation involving 
neighboring states and even the entire world,'' Messing said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's list includes cross-border wars, such as between  
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and civil wars such as those in Afghanistan, 
Sri Lanka, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the former 
Zaire. Countries with major internal insurgencies include 
Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy and Panama were destabilized by mafia and other  
drug-related violence. ``There is a continuing rise in drug 
trafficking worldwide, polluting capitalism and destroying 
democracies,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report described the situation inside Iraq as ``execution of  
political prisoners, political unrest, Kurdish insurgency, Turkish 
military incursion, combat with American and British forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the hot spots listed are far from daily headlines: a  
separatist movement in Namibia's Caprivi Strip, separatist violence 
in Senegal, an insurgency in Tajikistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries removed from the 1997 list because their conflicts had  
subsided or turned largely nonviolent include Bangladesh, the 
Central African Republic, Greece, Papua New Guinea, Spain and 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's criteria for selection is based on the level of  
disruption of the socioeconomic and security fabric of a country, 
caused by both internal and external conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The count differs from that of another Washington-area think  
tank, the Center for Defense Information, which lists only 
conflicts resulting in major combat and omits items like major 
criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not finalized our annual count, but it will be in the  
low 20s,'' said Daniel Smith, the group's associate director. Last 
year's count was 26, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said U.S. involvement in efforts to resolve many of those  
crises was on the rise, contributing to defusing conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration played mayor roles in settling the Northern  
Ireland issue and in preventing the escalation of violence in 
Kosovo,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States was much more active in Africa in general  
and in the training of a number of national battalions there to 
assume the burden of peacekeeping operations,'' the retired Army 
colonel said. ``We also were instrumental in the settlement of the 
Peru-Ecuador border dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on the number of violent conflicts, CIA  
spokesman Tom Crispell said it depends on ``what your criteria is 
for definition of conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency maintains its own count, which in the past several  
years has hovered in the mid-20s. The CIA's final figure for 1998 
will be available this month.

<HEADLINE> Gotti Jr. Tries To Soften His Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILL NECK, N.Y. (AP) -- The priciest jail cell in New York state  
overlooks Long Island Sound: a $700,000, six-bedroom Colonial with 
tennis courts, a swimming pool and a boat dock. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, an electronic bracelet around his ankle, resides its  
lone inmate: John ``Junior'' Gotti. The reputed mob boss with the 
infamous surname landed under house arrest on Oct. 1 after spending 
nine months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a pleasant 1998 for 34-year-old Gotti: he was  
indicted and jailed, nearly went bankrupt, pondered a plea bargain 
and prison term, learned his father had throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The future is not much brighter: Gotti faces a Feb. 2 trial on  
an assortment of charges in a high-profile federal mob case. A 
conviction could mean 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Gotti, whose father, known as the Dapper Don, ascended to  
boss of the Gambino crime family after orchestrating the December 
1985 murder of ``Big Paul'' Castellano, is anything but down, 
according to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to fight the case and feels he's going to win,'' said  
attorney Bruce Cutler, who helped Gotti's father win three criminal 
acquittals before a 1992 conviction for murder and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fighter, like his father,'' Cutler said. ``The apple  
doesn't fall far from the tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fruit, authorities say, is just as rotten: Gotti Jr. stands  
accused of extortion, loan-sharking, phone card fraud, and beating 
and robbing a drug dealer. The last charge infuriated him: ``You 
have no honor!'' he hissed at prosecutors when they accused him of 
a common street beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Honor was always a hot button issue for the Gotti family. ``I'm  
gonna call 'em as I see 'em,'' John Sr. once bragged on a 
government wiretap. ``That I gotta do 'til the day I die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But law enforcers say there are differences between father and  
son: Where John Sr. inspired fear, Junior draws ridicule. Where 
John Sr. was battle-tested, Junior is inexperienced. And where John 
Sr. was philanthropic, Junior is greedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old man really wasn't that money conscious,'' says ex-FBI  
agent Bruce Mouw, whose Gambino squad helped jail Gotti Sr. ``The 
money came in, the money went out. The father was more concerned 
with power and control of people. Junior is just the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other differences, including at least one in Junior's  
favor: his ability to avoid government bugs. Gotti Sr.'s mouth 
helped land him behind bars; Junior has been more discreet during 
his six years as boss, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Gotti's image has softened in recent months as he's  
spent more time in the public eye. Gangster Gotti -- the 
iron-pumping dumbfella in a designer sweat suit -- is out; Gentleman 
John, Big Brother John and Papa John are in. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, appearing more collegiate than criminal, attended recent  
court sessions wearing wire-rimmed glasses and carrying a 
briefcase. Before one hearing, he stopped to help a woman pick up 
$10 worth of change from the courthouse floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti's mother, in an unprecedented phone call to the Daily  
News, told the tabloid, ``I wish every mother in America had a son 
like my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is no boss,'' she insisted. ``Don't you think I would  
know it? He's my son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gotti was finally released to home arrest on $10 million  
bail, posted by family friends and his sister Victoria Gotti, the 
best-selling novelist, his lawyers detailed a happy family reunion. 
Gotti and his wife of eight years, Kim, have four children: Frank, 
8; Nicolette, 7; John, 6; and Peter, 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say he had been a fixture at his kids' school events,  
and young Gotti has even gone the extra mile for his family at 
Christmas time. In 1996, he visited a Toys R Us in Queens and came 
up with the year's toughest toy find: Tickle Me Elmo dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumb luck, his lawyer said. Store workers took an oath of  
omerta, opting not to comment on the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	So who is Junior Gotti?  
</P>
<P>
	John A. Gotti -- he's not actually a junior, since dad is John J.  
-- was born Feb. 14, 1964, his parents' first child. After 
graduating from a military high school outside New York City in 
1982, he apparently went into the family business. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials say that business was the mob,  
although his father claimed to be a plumbing supplies salesman. 
Junior owns a trucking company where he often puts in 14-hour days, 
attorney Cutler has said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were minor dust-ups with the law: A 1985 arrest for  
slugging an off-duty policeman, a driver's license suspension in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``John (Sr.) had his run-ins too,'' Mouw says. ``So he's a chip  
off the old block there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junior allegedly became a made man in a Christmas 1988 ceremony  
at his dad's Little Italy home-away-from-home, the Ravenite Social 
Club -- an induction later recounted by Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano 
in the book ``Underboss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, young Gotti was arrested in a brawl outside a Long  
Island nightclub. A grand jury refused to indict him when witnesses 
said they could not identify the assailants. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ``Dapper Don'' went away for life, authorities say his  
son stepped up to run the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nepotism at its finest,'' says Mouw.  
</P>
<P>
	Although his alleged time atop the Gambinos is just one year  
short of his father's reign, the younger Gotti has never earned the 
respect of mob experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A joke,'' Ronald Goldstock, ex-head of the New York State  
Organized Crime Task Force, observed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gotti was a thug, but not as stupid as the son,'' mob expert  
Howard Abadinsky agreed recently. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs that Junior hasn't grown up. In April 1997, he  
was arrested for hassling a pair of undercover narcotics cops. The 
charges were dropped, but the idea remained unbelievable -- imagine 
Carlo Gambino chasing down two NYPD detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti still visits his father for advice. Much as John Sr.  
denied involvement in the Castellano hit on a government bug, John 
Jr. -- aware his conversation was being taped -- pleaded innocent to 
shaking down the Manhattan strip club Scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Supposedly it's a big men's club ... All the celebrities go  
there,'' John Jr. told his father in a Nov. 23, 1996, talk at 
Marion. ``I've never been there in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sr. responded with a good word for his eldest: ``... What a  
joke, what a joke, what a joke ... There's no such thing as a 
mob.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Gotti finally hit the legal big leagues when  
his indictment was announced. He was jailed until his attorneys 
convinced a judge that he deserved bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, repeating a technique used against Gotti Sr. and  
other mobsters, were expected to use turncoat Mafiosi to testify 
against the son. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedom has not come cheap for Gotti. He acknowledged borrowing  
$125,000 from his brother-in-law, Carmine Agnello, to cover his 
staggering legal bills. Federal authorities tied up his 
income-producing properties, alleging they were purchased with 
mob-tainted money. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, Gotti has little privacy. His phones are tapped and he  
can't leave the house except for medical emergencies. He is not 
permitted to own a beeper or a cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	On Christmas Day, with the electronic bracelet on his ankle,  
Gotti hosted a family celebration. By Christmas 1999, he could be 
behind bars again. Even if he beats the pending case, Gotti will 
remain under scrutiny by law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	It took seven years and four cases, but they finally convicted  
his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to be the boss of a family,'' Mouw says, ``you  
have to pay the price.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Soros Urges IMF Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund should be  
transformed into a global central bank to help prevent new 
financial crises from wrecking economies around the world, American 
financier George Soros said Monday in the London-based Financial 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Markets can move like a wrecking ball, knocking over one  
economy after another,'' Soros said in an op-ed article. ``The 
swings cannot be avoided altogether, but they need to be brought 
under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes to the IMF were necessary because it had become ``part  
of the problem rather than the solution.'' But he strongly 
disagreed with those calling for the IMF's abolition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If global financial markets are inherently unstable we need a  
stronger regulatory framework rather than the dismantling of 
existing institutions,'' Soros wrote. ``To be specific, we need to 
convert the IMF into something resembling an international central 
bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soros said the IMF should act as lender of last resort, and only  
for ``a select group of countries that are eager to obtain such 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the countries would have to maintain sound economic  
and banking policies. Countries which failed to meet those 
conditions would continue to have access to the IMF on terms 
similar to those which currently are available. But in a crisis, 
the IMF would be allowed to impose conditions not only on the 
country involved but also on the creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Soros said that would eliminate the ``current imbalance in favor  
of creditors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major criticisms of the billion-dollar IMF rescue  
packages for Asia and Russia in the past year was that much of the 
money went to bail out international bankers who made bad 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, runs the $20 billion  
Quantum group of hedge funds, which were rattled by the turbulent 
global economy last year.

	Midwest Storm Leaves 36 Dead  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicagoans dug out from their biggest snowstorm  
in more than 30 years Sunday while thousands of already delayed 
travelers across the Midwest waited for airlines to get their 
planes de-iced and back in the air. At least 36 deaths had been 
blamed on the storm, 11 of them in Illinois. About 22 inches of 
snow had piled up from Chicago across northern Indiana as the storm 
spread snow, ice, slush and rain from the Missouri Valley to the 
East Coast.

	Mrs. Dole Eyes White House Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is planning to step down as  
president of the American Red Cross in a move her supporters hope 
will lead to a run for president of the United States, according to 
Newsweek magazine. The magazine quotes one of Dole's close advisers 
as saying her decision is a ``first step'' toward a possible bid 
for the Republican nomination. Red Cross officials would not 
confirm the report but announced late Sunday that Dole will make a 
``major'' announcement Monday afternoon in Washington. Mrs. Dole's 
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, was the GOP presidential nominee in 
1996 and she has consistently scored high in public opinion polls 
as a potential candidate. 

</P>
<P>
	Censure Gaining Strength in Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate plan that may lead to the censure of  
President Clinton is gaining momentum. Proposed by one Democrat and 
one Republican, the plan would give the House prosecutors and the 
White House each one day to present the senate with their cases. 
After asking questions, senators would vote on whether charges 
against the president, even if true, were grave enough to remove 
him from office. If a two-thirds majority isn't reached, the Senate 
could adjourn the trial with a simple majority, then move to a 
possible censure motion against the president.

	Clinton Backs Health Care Credit

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing a $1,000 tax

five-year, $6.2 billion package that the president and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will announce Monday.

	Mars Probe To Arrive in Dec.  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA Sunday launched a spacecraft  
headed for the fringes of the Martian south polar cap to search for 
frozen water. The Polar Lander is due to arrive at Mars in December

	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG unveiled a trio of concept  
cars and trucks Sunday that represent the automaker's efforts to 
find near-term alternatives to conventional gasoline power. The 
Dodge Power Wagon is an oversized pickup packed with a 7.2-liter, 
turbocharged diesel engine designed to run on a synthetic 
diesel-type fuel derived from natural gas. Also unveiled was the 
Chrysler Citadel, a sport sedan with a hybrid powertrain, which 
uses a V6 engine to drive the rear wheels and an electric motor to 
drive the front wheels. And the Dodge Charger R/T uses a 
supercharged, 325-horsepower V8 engine powered by compressed

	TOKYO (AP) -- The Nikkei shed 426.28 points to close Monday's

common European currency, by Japanese investors wanting to acquire 
euro-denominated assets pushed the currency up against the yen, 
traders said. Still, many players were reluctant to trade the new 
currency against either the dollar or the yen ahead of the opening

	TEMPLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Former boxer Jerry Quarry, a popular  
heavyweight who fought Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson, has died 
at 53. Among the highlights of Quarry's career were two fights 
against Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. Quarry earned 
his biggest payday, $338,000, by fighting Ali when Ali returned 
from his banishment in 1970. Quarry finished his pro career with a 
53-9-4 record. But by the age of 50, the pounding he had taken in 
the ring turned him into a confused, childlike man whose relatives

	Snow, Ice Affect Midwest Travel  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A huge snowstorm blew across the Midwest on  
Saturday with whiteout conditions and drifts up to 8 feet high, 
canceling hundreds of airline flights, forcing motorists off roads 
and keeping mail deliverers from their appointed rounds. By 
Saturday evening, the storm had dumped 17 inches at Chicago's 
Midway Airport, 12 inches in Milwaukee and 11 inches on Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport in Romulus. It was 13 inches deep in western 
Indiana's Parke County, and 10 inches of new snow had fallen in 
southwestern Ohio and Eldora, Iowa. Wind gusting to 40 mph created 
blizzard conditions and northern Indiana's LaGrange County pulled 
its plows off the roads because snow was drifting 5 to 8 feet deep. 
At least a dozen deaths throughout the region were blamed on the 
storm.

	DOVER, N.J. (AP) -- For the fourth time since Dec. 24, a  
casino-bound bus has been involved in a crash on a New Jersey 
highway. No one on the bus was injured in Saturday's multi-vehicle 
accident on the Garden State Parkway, and police said the bus 
continued on its trip to Atlantic City. A 13-year-old boy riding in 
another vehicle was in critical condition after icy conditions 
caused the pileup. He was taken by ambulance to Jersey Shore 
Medical Center. Ice storms struck the state Saturday night, causing 
a rash of accidents on New Jersey roads, including nearly a dozen 
on the Parkway alone.

Laden's secret Afghanistan encampment on Dec. 22, seems the closest 
the exiled Saudi billionaire has come to admitting a role in the 
deadly attacks. ``Our job is to instigate, and by the grace of God, 
we did that, and certain people responded to this instigation,'' 
bin Laden says in the Jan. 11 issue of Time magazine.

	BEIJING (AP) -- A strong earthquake struck Sunday in a  
mountainous stretch of southwestern China where residents were 
recovering from two earlier quakes, a government seismologist said. 
No one was believed to have been killed or injured in the 
preliminary magnitude-5 quake, which hit Yunnan province's Ninglang 
region around 1 a.m., said the seismologist. The quake was an 
aftershock from twin quakes, one with a magnitude of 6.2, that 
jolted the region in November. The aftershock, which struck 1,200 
miles southwest of Beijing, was strong enough to cause moderate 
damage.

(8-1), the defending conference champions, faced a vocal, hostile 
crowd at Pauley Pavilion in only their second road game of the

	Mrs. Dole May Quit Red Cross  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a step her political supporters hope will  
lead to her running for the White House, Elizabeth Dole is reported 
to be stepping aside as president of the American Red Cross. 
Newsweek magazine quotes one of Dole's close advisers as saying her 
decision is a ``first step'' toward a possible bid for the 
Republican nomination. Red Cross officials would not confirm the 
report but announced late today that Dole will make a ``major'' 
announcement tomorrow afternoon in Washington. Mrs. Dole's husband, 
former Sen. Bob Dole, was the GOP presidential nominee in 1996 and 
she has consistently scored high in public opinion polls as a

White House each one day to present the senate with their cases. 
After asking questions, senators would vote on whether charges 
against the president, even if true, were grave enough to remove 
him from office. If a two-thirds majority isn't reached, the Senate 
could adjourn the trial with a simple majority, then move to a 
possible censure motion against the president.

<HEADLINE> Vols' Holdsclaw Likes New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw isn't shy about her desire to  
play professional basketball in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to play here,'' Holdsclaw said after No. 2 Tennessee  
defeated No. 15 Rutgers 68-54 before a record crowd of 15,735 for a 
women's college game at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Astoria, Queens, Holdsclaw is expected to be the top  
pick in the WNBA draft in April. The Tennessee All-American had a 
season-low eight points before 100 friends and family, but she 
wasn't concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a season-low five points, but the next night I might  
have 30,'' she said. ``I know what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does New York Liberty coach Richie Adubato. But New York has  
the sixth pick in the 12-team draft. The last-place Washington 
Mystics have the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to get Chamique,'' Adubato said. ``Obviously, she's  
the cream of the crop. She's a multitalented player. We'll just 
have to see what happens with the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the demise of the American Basketball League, Holdsclaw is  
sure to land in the WNBA rather than go overseas to play 
professional basketball. But the likely influx of such ABL stars as 
Theresa Edwards, Natalie Williams, Jennifer Azzi, Jennifer Rizzotti 
and Katie Smith may affect the upcoming draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll be the No. 1 pick, but if I'm not, that's  
cool,'' Holdsclaw said. ``They can pick me No. 6 so I can come to 
New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the WNBA does not allow regional draft picks. Any  
changes in the draft rules would be made by the WNBA Operating 
Committee, said league spokesman Mark Pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Adubato said the committee would address the influx of ABL  
players and other issues within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless, I think she'll be the No. 1 pick,'' said Tennessee  
coach Pat Summitt. ``I think she'll have a great impact (in the 
WNBA). At 6-foot-2, with the versatile game she plays, she will 
bring excitement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw leads the Lady Vols in scoring (21.9) and averages 8.7  
rebounds. She guided Tennessee to a 39-0 record and its third 
consecutive NCAA title last season. Holdsclaw led Christ the King 
to four consecutive state high school championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with teammate Kellie Jollie, Holdsclaw has a chance to  
become the first player, male or female, to win four consecutive 
NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw was raised by her grandmother in an Astoria housing  
project. She played pick-up games with St. John's star Ron Artest 
growing up. She likes the idea of playing pro ball before friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have to make a major adjustments, because I'm from  
here,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I know where everything is. I have a lot 
of friends if I need somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt expects Holdsclaw to get her wish sometime soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully that will work out for her, if not the first year, I  
think eventually.''

<HEADLINE> Kings' Murray Out 8-10 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Right wing Glen Murray, second in  
goals, assists and points for the Los Angeles Kings, is expected to 
miss 8-10 weeks after tearing a ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray left the ice on a stretcher with 7:12 remaining in the  
first period of Saturday night's 4-2 victory over Colorado with a 
severely sprained right knee. He was taken to Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center for X-rays, which were negative, and an MRI exam, 
which revealed the sprain and damage to his medial collateral 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Left wing Steve McKenna will undergo abdominal surgery Monday at  
Centinela Hospital. He's expected to miss 10-12 weeks, the team 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenna has missed 24 of the past 25 games because of the  
abdominal strain. He was injured Nov. 5 and returned to the lineup 
after missing 14 games. He aggravated the injury Dec. 9 and has 
missed the past 10 games.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Mars Lander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A Mars lander equipped with a robot  
arm and shovel rocketed away Sunday on a 470 million-mile quest to 
uncover frozen water near the planet's South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Mars Polar Lander took off aboard a Boeing rocket at  
exactly 3:21 p.m. The rain that managers had feared stayed away, 
allowing NASA to meet the instantaneous launch window despite an 
overcast sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, the final rocket motor fired, kicking  
the Polar Lander out of Earth orbit and putting it on an 11-month 
course for Mars. Launch managers cheered and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``My birthday is tomorrow and this is just about the best  
birthday present I've ever had,'' said project scientist Richard 
Zurek, who is turning 52. ``Right now, I'm feeling a lot younger 
than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is bound for the frosty fringes of Mars' south  
polar cap. It's due to arrive in December when it's late spring and 
the sun never sets. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be virgin territory: No spacecraft has ever ventured so  
far south on Mars. As a result, scientists' expectations are high. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal is to find water ice in the Martian soil. Where  
there's water, NASA's top space scientist says, there could be 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to follow the water if you're looking for life,''  
said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of reason to believe there's water on Mars in  
the form of ice,'' he added. ``But until you actually land there 
and find it and measure it, you can't say for sure. That's one 
thing I think this mission will demonstrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander -- 3 1/2 feet tall and 12 feet wide -- has three  
legs as well as a 6 1/2-foot robot arm with a scoop on the end to 
scrape beneath the Martian surface. The collected dirt will be 
heated, allowing any water that's present to vaporize and be 
detected by a laser. 
</P>
<P>
	It carries no life-detection equipment. The only real way to  
confirm life on Mars, Weiler says, is to fetch rocks and soil. NASA 
plans to launch a soil-return mission in 2005; the samples would 
reach Earth in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander also is equipped with a pair of probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes also will hunt for water but at  
a much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is a companion to NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter  
launched last month. The two missions cost $327 million and Deep 
Space 2 another $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has landed spacecraft on Mars only three times: the two  
Vikings in 1976 and Pathfinder in 1997. All three landed in the 
Martian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings came down on three legs, the same as the Polar  
Lander will. The Pathfinder, cushioned with newfangled air bags, 
bounced down amid boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler acknowledges that the Polar Lander's Dec. 3 touchdown at  
a latitude of about 75 degrees south -- which will be photographed 
by an on-board camera -- won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on 
air bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is appealing, though, he said, is the fact that ``we're  
landing in an area that we've never landed in before, where we 
think there will be some frost, if not ice, in the layered terrain. 
Maybe a very interesting color scheme. We really don't know what 
we're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what they're going to hear, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is equipped with a tiny microphone. Many  
believe the only sounds that might be heard in the thin Martian 
atmosphere will be the movement of the robot arm and the internal 
systems of the lander. There's a possibility, however slight, that 
the sound of dust or sand blowing against the lander also might be 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the fun part of science,'' said Weiler. ``We don't know  
what we're going to hear. Except I don't think we'll hear Elvis. At 
least I hope not.''

<P>
	The Polar Lander also is equipped with a pair of probes that  
will peel away minutes before touchdown and slam into the Martian 
surface at 400 mph to 500 mph, some 60 miles from the lander. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the lander, the twin probes also will hunt for water but at  
a much greater depth: They could penetrate as deep as 3 feet. The 
question is whether they will survive the impact and radio back 
data. It's a high-risk experiment called Deep Space 2 that's part 
of NASA's New Millennium program to test new technologies for 
future missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is a companion to NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter  
launched last month. The two missions cost $327 million and Deep 
Space 2 another $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has landed spacecraft on Mars only three times: the two  
Vikings in 1976 and Pathfinder in 1997. All three landed in the 
Martian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings came down on three legs, the same as the Polar  
Lander will. The Pathfinder, cushioned with newfangled air bags, 
bounced down amid boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiler acknowledges that the Polar Lander's Dec. 3 touchdown at  
a latitude of about 75 degrees south -- which will be photographed 
by an on-board camera -- won't be ``as sexy as bouncing around on 
air bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is appealing, though, he said, is the fact that ``we're  
landing in an area that we've never landed in before, where we 
think there will be some frost, if not ice, in the layered terrain. 
Maybe a very interesting color scheme. We really don't know what 
we're going to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't know what they're going to hear, either.  
</P>
<P>
	The Polar Lander is equipped with a tiny microphone. Many  
believe the only sounds that might be heard in the thin Martian 
atmosphere will be the movement of the robot arm and the internal 
systems of the lander. There's a possibility, however slight, that 
the sound of dust or sand blowing against the lander also might be 
picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the fun part of science,'' said Weiler. ``We don't know  
what we're going to hear. Except I don't think we'll hear Elvis. At 
least I hope not.''

<HEADLINE> Health Clubs Change With Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 1999, health clubs are driving members up  
the wall and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen for activity that blurs the line between exercise and  
adventure is leading clubs to set up climbing walls inside, and 
taking members outside for club-led climbing trips and other 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clubs are taking members on biking excursions, mountaineering  
excursions, triathlon excursions -- the movement toward adventure is 
interesting and exciting,'' said John McCarthy, executive director 
of IHRSA, a Boston-based association of health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for something more daring than standard weight  
training and aerobic dance also is feeding interest in 
high-intensity, military-style workouts -- ``boot camps and GI Jane 
classes,'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association does not have numbers on clubs with such  
programs, but word from the field indicates they are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem to be more hyped on doing something different -- a  
bit more extreme,'' said Ivan Greene, a professional climber who 
runs the climbing wall and the outdoor climbing expeditions at New 
York City's Sports Center at Chelsea Piers. 
</P>
<P>
	The indoor wall is 150 feet long, reaches 65 feet at its peak,  
and includes sufficient grips and overhangs to prepare participants 
for the outdoors, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indoor climbing gives them the ability to try climbing in a  
safe, fun environment,'' he said. ``And it takes the edge off -- no 
pun intended -- climbing in the outdoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club normally takes its expeditions to the Shawangunk  
Mountains cliffs about 90 minutes north of New York. The club has 
sent other trips to Mexico and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sports Center also offers kayak training in an indoor pool,  
with participants eventually kayaking the Hudson River and New York 
Harbor, touring the George Washington Bridge and the Statue of 
Liberty from the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Something similar is happening on the opposite coast. The Frog's  
athletic club in San Diego takes members on outdoor team-event 
expeditions, said Roger Bates, the club's chief executive officer. 
Members are divided into three to five person groups for climbing, 
mountain biking, ocean and river kayaking, orienteering and 
rappelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We charge a lot of extra money for that, but participation is  
phenomenal,'' Bates said. ``We get 30 to 50 people sign up and it's 
overbooked.'' It's adventure with creature comforts, he said -- ``We 
set up the camp, cater it and lay out the equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club also runs an extensive outdoor exercise program modeled  
partly on the Navy SEAL physical training regimen, Bates said. ``We 
run them through the surf, and they do pushups on the beach,'' he 
said. ``We build obstacles out there, and they have to hang on 
things and climb on ropes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People like exercising outside, and the club can set up a  
specific program so members ``don't have to think about what is in 
their workout,'' Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of 1999's exercise trends will have participants acting  
like Indiana Jones. But many are battle-based. A survey of 15 
program directors in the United States and Canada found boxing- and 
martial arts-based classes among the top trends. The club officials 
said funk/hip hop and high-impact aerobic dance were on the way 
down. The results were in a group exercise leaders' magazine 
published by IDEA, a San Diego-based association of health and 
fitness professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	And personal training is growing, said the American Council on  
Exercise, another fitness professionals' group based in San Diego. 
Personal trainers are expanding beyond the rich, to offer services 
to people with more moderate incomes, said council spokesman Mark 
Anders. 
</P>
<P>
	To do this, trainers are offering fewer visits spread over a  
specific period, such as six months, instead of a standard two 
visits a week.

<HEADLINE> Computing Gets `iMac Look' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The iMac is not merely a popular computer  
that single-handedly helped pull Apple Computer Inc. back from the 
brink. It's the new fashion trend in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by the desktop machine's recent climb to No. 1 in  
retail sales, computer designers are rolling out a new breed of 
products wrapped in similar translucent casing through which inner 
circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	They range from computer mice to joysticks that seem like tools  
from an alien space ship. And veteran industry watchers expect 
Apple to sell other computers, including a laptop due out next 
spring, that take cues from the iMac's design. 
</P>
<P>
	Even chip maker Intel Corp., which Apple publicly roasted in  
advertisements last year, is prodding other big computer makers 
like Compaq to reshape the clunky, beige machines on most desks. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that there haven't been other attempts to change the  
traditional computer look. Sony several years ago introduced a 
sleek, black desktop that never really took off. But the 
jellybean-like iMac, which comes equipped with a built-in monitor, 
seems to be transforming computer fashion the way Swatch started a 
new craze in watches. 
</P>
<P>
	And the iMac offers more than a new look. It also appeals to  
computer users who crave simplicity. The iMac's connectors are 
located conveniently on the side, instead of the back, and the 
machine can quickly be hooked up to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's $1,300 iMacs accounted for 7 percent of all PCs sold at  
retail in the United States in November, giving it the top-selling 
spot and helping to double Apple's overall retail market share to 
10 percent, market researcher PC Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures suggest the iMac has helped Apple stem a defection  
of Mac customers to personal computers that run on Microsoft's 
Windows operating system, a trend that contributed to two years of 
red ink at the once-prosperous computer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive,  
hopes to try to extend the recent success to other products. Some 
analysts say he has little choice in an industry increasingly 
dominated by cheaper Windows machines, which cost as low as $400 
excluding the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has concluded the only way to differentiate himself is  
industrial design and ergonomics,'' said Tim Bajarin of Creative 
Strategies Research International, a Campbell, Calif. consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement over the technology design trend is evident at  
the MacWorld Expo computer show, opening here Monday. The number of 
exhibitors is up 15 percent to 420 this year, reflecting an 
increase in companies making iMac-related products, said show 
manager Rob Scheschareg. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan-owned Mace Group Inc. is showing off four products from  
its Macally unit -- iMouse, iStick game joystick, iBall trackball, 
and the iHub for connecting peripherals -- all encased in bluish, 
clear plastic like the iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple wasn't commenting on its future plans for see-through  
computers. A spokeswoman said the company won't use the show to 
unveil details of a new low-cost laptop computer due out next 
spring. But the industry is buzzing with speculation the new 
portable will sport a stylish, translucent looked modeled on the 
iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard it's quite different from any portable we've ever  
seen,'' Bajarin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is taking a more conventional route to boost demand  
for its machines: Speeding them up. The company is expected to 
introduce a new iMac with a more powerful microprocessor and 
possibly drop the price of the current version, which is equipped 
with a 233-megahertz chip. The new iMac reportedly will debut in 
February for a price similar to the current $1,300 ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also is set to roll out its new line of G3 professional  
desktop systems, code-named Yosemite. The new models will sport 
speedier microprocessors and higher-capacity storage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jobs is not expected to change one oft-criticized feature of  
the iMac: Its lack of a floppy drive, a turnoff to those dependent 
on disks for storing and transferring files. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's success with the iMac, it remains an open  
question whether the company can sustain its momentum and become a 
major rival again to makers of Windows-based machines. One 
lingering concern is whether software makers will continue to 
develop exciting new programs for the Mac.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Interior Secretariat denied rebel  
claims that the government is waging a war on Indians and guerrilla 
supporters in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a war does not exist,'' the secretariat said in a press  
statement released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatista rebels on Friday accused the government of  
offering Chiapas Indians only ``war and destruction'' and blamed it 
for the Dec. 22, 1997 massacre of 45 Indian villagers in the 
Chiapas hamlet of Acteal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several state police officers have been arrested for failing to  
stop the massacre or helping supply weapons to the pro-government 
group that allegedly carried out the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government blamed the rebels, who rose up in 1994 demanding  
greater democracy and Indian rights, for a lack of progress in 
peace talks that have been stalled since 1996.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori has denied  
allegations by an opposition legislator that he has cancer and said 
he is in perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftist Congressman Javier Diez Canseco told reporters last week  
that Fujimori may have cancer and was using his frequent trips 
abroad to consult with cancer specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	``My health is very good from top to bottom,'' Fujimori told  
reporters on Saturday. He called Diez Canseco's comments a 
tasteless joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Fujimori's health have circulated since May 1997,  
when the government said that doctors had successfully removed a 
benign tumor from the president's tongue and advised him not to 
speak for several days.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- In an effort to combat police  
brutality, Rio's police force will be monitored by a civilian 
review board for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have long been campaigning for this as a means of  
controlling extreme police brutality,'' said James Cavallaro, the 
director of the Brazil office of Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board will offer a toll-free number for citizens to  
file anonymous complaints against police for abuses like murder, 
torture, beatings and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights activists have long complained that Brazil's poorly  
trained and low-paid police routinely beat, torture and execute 
criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The review board is the idea of Rio de Janeiro state Gov.  
Anthony Garotinho. He has vowed to curb abuses by the city's police 
force, which has a reputation for violence and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Julita Lemgruber, a respected sociologist who will head the new

	Details were still sketchy about the meeting in Costa Rica  
between U.S. State Department officials and members of the 
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a 
powerful guerrilla insurgency that plans to enter negotiations with 
the government on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials only confirmed the meeting after it was revealed  
Sunday in a Colombian newspaper.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico City authorities invited thousands of  
city residents to literally take the cake Sunday -- a mile-long 
concoction of traditional holiday pastry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapped around several blocks of the city's ancient downtown,  
authorities hope the cake is big enough to put it in the record 
books as the biggest `rosca' ever baked. 
</P>
<P>
	Roscas, narrow wreaths of sweet bread baked with dried fruit,  
are traditionally eaten in Mexico on Jan. 6 for the Three Kings' 
Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to custom, a slice is given to the first poor person  
who asked. But this year, thousands of city residents lined up 
along the tables where the bread was laid out by over 300 
participating bakeries to get a slice. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the `Rosca of the Millenium,' the cake -- baked in  
two-foot sections -- was served along with tiny cartons of milk to 
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	A notary public was on hand to measure the cake, which city  
authorities estimated at just over one mile.

<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops hired Steve  
Spurrier Jr. as an assistant Sunday, rounding out his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier, son of University of Florida coach Steve Spurrier, was  
hired away from his father's staff. Stoops, who was Florida's 
defensive coordinator when he was hired by Oklahoma to replace John 
Blake, said the younger Spurrier has developed into a solid coach.

<P>
	``Over the past few years he has developed outstanding  
communication skills and the ability to recruit tremendous 
student-athletes,'' Stoops said. ``Our players and program will 
really benefit from his knowledge and enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier, 28, played receiver at Duke University, graduating in  
1994 and beginning his career as a graduate assistant at Florida 
that year. He became a full-time member of his father's coaching

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Rev. Dan Yeary surveyed his congregation,  
swollen by about a hundred large young men and out-of-towners 
dressed in orange, and made an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our choir could not learn Rocky Top in time for this,'' Yeary  
said, referring to the song that accompanies every Tennessee score. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of their battle for the national championship,  
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and Florida State coach Bobby Bowden 
joined in prayer Sunday at North Phoenix Baptist Church. Each coach 
gave personal testimony about his faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Tennessee team also attended, surrounded by fans  
whose rental cars were festooned with orange flags and pompoms. 
Balloons -- orange and white for Tennessee, garnet and gold for the 
Seminoles -- were attached to some pews. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden and Fulmer sat across from each other in neighboring  
pews. Tennessee and Florida State fans sat side by side. Though the 
coaches were non-partisan in their testimony, Fulmer couldn't 
resist wearing a gaudy orange tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day before a national championship, with all the stress  
and all the pressure, the leaders of these two teams have chosen to 
be in the Lord's house,'' Yeary said to the applause of his 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee kicker Jeff Hall, a member of the Fellowship of  
Christian Athletes on campus, took the stage to tell Yeary about 
his devout upbringing and how he has changed his priorities in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	While in high school and during his freshman year at Tennessee,  
Hall said, he put his faith ``on an even keel with football and 
social life.'' Now, he said, he understands the proper order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to praise God so I could play football,'' he said,  
``and now I want to play football so I can praise the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeary then let Hall in on a little secret. The reverend said his  
son also is a kicker, and Yeary said that has led him to root for 
all kickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pull for me tomorrow, then,'' Hall said, laughing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Long-Term Care Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is proposing an  
unprecedented $1,000 tax credit, at a cost of billions, to 
compensate 2 million American families struggling to provide 
long-term care for elderly or disabled relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for a wide range  
of activities that tending to others requires, is part of a 
five-year, $6.2 billion package that the president and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton will announce Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of it becomes reality without Congress, which last year  
rejected the president's attempt at HMO reform through a ``Patients 
Bill of Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a draft proposal obtained by The Associated Press  
over the weekend, Clinton's four-part initiative also proposes that 
the government offer federal workers and retirees private long-term 
care insurance, in the hope that other employers would do the same. 
The White House estimates that 300,000 government employees would 
participate in a model program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will ask Congress for $625 million in grants, over a  
five-year period, to state and local ``agencies on aging,'' created 
by the 1965 Older Americans Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used to set up information and referral  
programs and to provide direct services to millions of daughters 
and sons coping with elderly parents at home. Services would 
include the same kinds meant to be compensated for by the proposed 
new tax credit: counseling and training for extraordinary care 
needs, such as feeding tubes; adult day care for dependents of 
working caregivers; and respite care, to fill in when a caregiver 
goes on vacation or just needs a break. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistance would be equally available to parents of disabled or  
chronically ill children and anybody else providing family care to 
a person, of whatever age, with three or more conditions that limit 
their ability to live as others do. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component of Clinton's plan would, at a cost of $10  
million, launch an information campaign to ensure that all 39 
million Medicare beneficiaries realize they are not covered for 
most long-term care. Documentation would advise them what to look 
for in supplementary private insurance and that they might be 
eligible for Medicaid long-term care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Fleischer, spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee  
Chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the proposals had ``a lot 
of potential'' and would have a good chance of congressional 
approval if they are not accompanied by tax hikes. He said the 
ideas were part of House GOP ``Contract with America'' bills passed 
by the House in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, whose 90-year-old father died last month  
in Tennessee after a long infirmity, will speak for the initiative 
and its certain appeal to aging baby boomers in a series of forums 
around the nation. The administration will need to persuade a 
Republican-controlled Congress, with its own ideas for tax cuts and 
changes in the health-care system, to approve the long-term care 
programs and the money to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House insists it can be done without touching the  
federal budget surplus, which Clinton has pledged to reserve for 
shoring up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the five-year, $5.5 billion cost of the tax credit would be borne 
by that standby of Washington policy-makers in search of an easy 
cost offset: tightening ``corporate welfare'' by closing loopholes 
in the tax code.

<P>
	The other three prongs are meant to be worked into the fiscal  
2000 budget within agreed spending limits, the official said. ``The 
president has to make choices about his priorities, and this is one 
of them. It will not come out of the surplus,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the director of Clinton's Office of Management and  
Budget said the tax credits will not overburden spending limits in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's budget will be consistent with last year's,'' said  
OMB's Jack Lew. Speaking on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Lew said all 
tax cuts would be accounted for when the overall plan is completed 
in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	According to White House estimates, the $1,000 tax credit, which  
phases out for upper-income couples at $110,000 and at $75,000 for 
unmarried taxpayers, will be available to about 2 million 
Americans. The grants are expected to go to some 250,000 families 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5 million Americans need long-term care due to chronic  
or serious illness, disability or simple old age. The number is 
growing as the baby boom generation nears retirement. By 2030, the 
number of Americans age 85 and older will jump from the current 4 
million to 8.4 million, and almost half of whom need assistance 
with daily activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Health policy experts have long advocated government help for  
stressed-out family caregivers as a way of avoiding expensive 
nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> Infertile Couples Want Grade A Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Some infertile couples want strictly  
Grade A eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's biggest fertility registries has been  
focusing more advertising on newspapers at Ivy League schools as 
couples increasingly seek out eggs they hope will grow into brainy 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many parents are willing to be more flexible on the health  
history than on academic achievements and signs of intelligence,'' 
said Teri B. Royal, director of the Los Angeles-based OPTIONS 
National Fertility Registry. While prospective parents choose 
donors based on physical characteristics, intelligence ``is 
probably the most sought-after attribute,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of couples requesting advertising at the Ivies has  
nearly doubled each year since OPTIONS opened for business in 1992, 
Royal said. She said she believes the public has grown more open to 
alternative methods of reproduction, including people who went to 
the Ivies, once bastions of tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fertility agencies said they don't tally the number of  
people who want Ivy League donors and that their official policy is 
to discourage that sort of targeted search. However, advertising 
managers at Ivy League newspapers say such ads are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to land an Ivy League donor is neither easy nor cheap.  
OPTIONS represents one alumna who spent more than $15,000 in 
advertising at the top schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The response rate to the OPTIONS advertisements is about 75  
percent lower among Ivy coeds than among young women at other 
schools, Royal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the students that go to the Ivy League schools come  
from families that have at least a minimum of wealth and generally 
are not looking through want ads or employment ads to supplement 
their income,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they are interested, however, young women from the Ivy League  
or elsewhere can make anywhere from $3,500 to $5,000 for 
contributing ova. Other advertisements have offered more, some as 
much as $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Jersey couple who went through OPTIONS to get a donor say  
parents should only go so far to try and product a genetically 
perfect child. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Lasley and Marc Brahaney, himself a Princeton graduate,  
describe their 1 1/2-year-old son, Charlie, as ``brilliant,'' -- 
despite that the egg donor wasn't an Ivy Leaguer. They did note, 
however, that she got a 1,270 on her SATs, earned A's in college 
and has an IQ of 146. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a much more of an emotional connection than for me to  
genetically engineer this thing,'' said Ms. Lasley, 45. ``There is 
that temptation ... but once you get this child, it doesn't matter. 
You just love them, no matter what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Ivy League donor doesn't guarantee an Ivy League kid, Royal  
notes. She advertises in other places, as does the Columbia 
University Presbyterian Medical Center. In an effort to serve 
clients who request it, however, the hospital began running 
advertisements in the Columbia Daily Spectator last semester when 
the paper changed its policy and began accepting such ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Scott, director of the Institute for Reproductive  
Medicine &AMP; Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, 
N.J., said that no matter how intelligent the donor, medical 
science cannot pinpoint the origins of genius, or reproduce them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an age-old debate, nature versus nurture,'' said Scott.  
``We've certainly had an occasional recipient who's very concerned 
with educational levels, but health is usually the overriding 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some who carry the supposedly elite eggs find the topic somewhat  
amusing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the ads are looking for me,'' joked Karen Abrecht, 20,  
a tall Yale junior with brown hair, blue eyes and love of history. 
``They must think that for some reason the genes I would have to 
offer would somehow be better, even though it's never been proven 
scientifically.''

<HEADLINE> Memories of Ice Storm Still Fresh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The sounds were frightening, alarmingly  
like the noises of battle. Trees and limbs broke with loud cracks, 
then fell with thundering crashes like mortar rounds. Ice on the 
branches shattered as it hit the crust of frozen snow, rattling 
like machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
	All day, all night.  
</P>
<P>
	A year later, reminders linger of the ice storm that left  
hundreds of thousands without electricity: topless trees along the 
interstate, ragged limbs still dangling, prodigious stacks of 
firewood in yards. Newly purchased generators sit in garages and 
barns, ready for a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they're never going to be caught short again,'' said  
Gil Steward, sales manager of a Lewiston business that sold 550 
generators in the aftermath of the two-day ice storm -- more than 
five times the number he normally sells in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began with a seemingly harmless light rain the evening of  
Jan. 7, 1998. But the freezing rain soon formed an inches-thick 
veneer of ice that caused branches to sag, then snap under the 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was over, 700,000 of the state's 1.2 million residents  
were in the dark. Some had no power for as long as two weeks. A 
federal disaster was declared and damage was estimated at $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the only consolation of the storm was that temperatures  
didn't drop to the brutally cold subzero range, as often happens in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just lucky it didn't get real cold,'' said Clark  
Hatto, whose family survived without electricity for a period that 
he recalls lasted exactly ``seven days and seven hours.'' They kept 
the gas stove burning day and night. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern Maine was among the hardest-hit areas, where nine miles  
of H-shaped wooden power-line supports broke like toothpicks under 
the enormous weight of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Maine Power, the state's largest electric utility,  
replaced more than 3,000 poles after the storm. The utility is 
still trying to recover $50 million of its $65 million storm cost 
from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine wasn't alone in the misery. About 70,000 homes and  
business were left in the dark in New Hampshire, and Canada was hit 
even harder. At least two dozen people died in Quebec and Ontario, 
where nearly 1 million customers were left without power. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maine, at least a dozen deaths were linked to the storm,  
including seven carbon monoxide poisonings from heaters and 
generators used in poorly ventilated areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Restoring power was the biggest challenge. Central Maine had to  
learn literally overnight how to organize and run a major 
construction effort in the middle of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The company brought in nearly 3,900 people from as far away as  
North Carolina who worked 18-hour shifts for 23 straight days, said 
President Sara Burns. To keep the troops fed, Central Maine 
provided as many as 1,500 lunches a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Work crews devoted much of the spring and summer to clearing  
felled branches and trimming trees, but outages of such magnitude 
could occur again, said Central Maine spokesman Mark Ishkanian. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we ever had an ice buildup like we did last year, no amount  
of tree trimming would prevent the kind of devastation that 
happened last January,'' he said. ``Aesthetically, it wouldn't be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who lived through the ordeal remember acts of kindness  
that softened the harsh impacts. 
</P>
<P>
	People came out of dark houses to give line workers food and hot  
coffee; strangers picked up their tabs at diners and cafes. One 
woman organized 250 people to bake cookies for the utility workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get over the way people treated us, especially in  
those terrible conditions,'' said line supervisor Richard 
Harrington, who was so impressed by Mainers' spirit that he became 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	When Harrington returned to Lavallette, N.J., after working two  
weeks in Maine, a half dozen letters of thanks were waiting for 
him.. 
</P>
<P>
	He persuaded his wife, Abby, to return with him for a huge  
lobster feed offered outside the State House in Augusta in July, 
where Gov. Angus King thanked the repair crews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harringtons have been living in Maine for three months and  
are building a home in Rockport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard to believe, but it's true,'' he said. ``It's  
all been a positive experience since.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Dole To Leave Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is planning to step aside as  
president of the American Red Cross in a step her political 
supporters hope will lead to her running for president, Newsweek 
magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reports in its Jan. 11 edition, portions of which  
were released Sunday, that one of Mrs. Dole's close advisers 
described her decision as a ``first step'' toward a possible 
campaign for the Republican nomination, but also called it a 
``nonpolitical event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross officials would not confirm the report but announced  
late Sunday that Mrs. Dole would make a ``major'' announcement 
Monday at 2 p.m. EST in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek had reported that she was expected to meet over the  
weekend with the executive committee of the Red Cross prior to a 
Monday announcement of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, was the GOP  
presidential nominee in 1996 and she has consistently scored high 
in public opinion polls as a potential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Cox, national campaign manager of Draft Elizabeth 2000,  
declined to say whether he knew anything about Mrs. Dole leaving 
the Red Cross. ``If indeed that is the situation, it's 
encouraging,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox added that he plans to be in Washington on Monday before  
spending the rest of the week in Vermont and New Hampshire to 
campaign for the Dole draft movement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dole family adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
leaving the Red Cross is ``a not-unexpected prelude to the next 
phase of her life,'' which could include her running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Mrs. Dole have said she is considering whether to  
seek the presidency, but likely would not decide until later this 
year. She is considered a strong prospect for a vice presidential 
nomination regardless of whether she seeks the GOP nomination for 
president, Republicans activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	They add that her departure from the Red Cross has been expected  
for several months.

<HEADLINE> NASA Probe Makes Flight Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA engineers made a 24-minute firing of a  
spacecraft's engines Sunday to put the probe in line to reach the 
asteroid 433 Eros by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in February 1996, the spacecraft is to orbit Eros to  
study so-called near-Earth asteroids, the planet's closest 
neighbors except for the moon. Eros could collide with Earth in a 
few million years. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft originally was scheduled to begin its orbit of  
Eros next week, but scientists aborted the first attempted 
reorientation burn on Dec. 20 because of fears its engine had 
surpassed safety limits. The burn at 12 noon EST Sunday increased 
the spacecraft's speed by about 2,100 mph to make its speed roughly 
that of the asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called NEAR for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, is  
the first in NASA's Discovery program, which aims to conduct more 
short-term, inexpensive missions. NASA has capped the near-Earth 
asteroid project's spending at $150 million.

<HEADLINE> How Does Internet Impact Language? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Have you been LOL lately?  
</P>
<P>
	No? You must not be Internet savvy. But beware: The expression --  
which means ``laughing out loud'' -- could creep into non-Net 
communication before long. 
</P>
<P>
	How the computer revolution is changing and evolving language  
was among the topics discussed at the recent annual meeting of the 
Modern Language Association. 
</P>
<P>
	One researcher looked at the evolution of an early discussion  
list on the Arpanet, the predecessor of the Internet. The 
discussion list was much like the Internet news groups of today, 
with messages passed among members by computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan C. Herring of the University of Texas, Arlington, said she  
was surprised by many of her findings, mainly that computer 
correspondence did not lead to reduced sentence complexity, poor 
grammar or an abundance of typos. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should reassure parents who think their children's  
grammar will suffer because of the Internet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, contrary to popular belief, computer correspondence did not  
appear to lead to a homogenous style among users. Instead, writers 
tended to cultivate their own style, perhaps to compensate for the 
impersonal nature of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Herring also found that computer correspondence tended to become  
less formal, and in fact, less polite, than other communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at the archived messages of about 100 computer  
science professionals in the discussion group from 1975 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet provides an interesting laboratory for examining  
language changes, Herring said, noting how computer talk is 
crawling into general use. Take the ``smiley,'' the combination 
colon and end parenthesis that indicate a happy face in Net-speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smiley faces have been around for a long time, where they were  
right side up,'' she said. ``The Internet turned them sideways. Now 
I see more and more people putting them in letters and notes that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers looked at the more subtle ways the World Wide  
Web impacted language. Lisa Gerrard of the University of California 
at Los Angeles examined nearly 200 Web sites created by women, with 
a primary audience of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the sites challenged traditional stereotypes -- or tried  
to tweak them. For example, she noted, references to ``chicks'' and 
``bimbos'' were used in an empowering way. A search of the Web 
shows such women's sites as www.brazenhussy.com, www.chickclick.com 
and www.riotgrrl.com 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Rivers of Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, spoke on  
the use of French on the Internet -- or the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a French search engine on the World Wide Web until  
February 1996, Rivers said. Today, only 2 percent of what is 
available on the Internet is in French. Most of what's on the Net 
is in English. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers said the lack of diverse languages on the Web posed the  
question: If a language isn't a part of the Internet, can it 
survive? 
</P>
<P>
	``The very fact that we're not positive on the matter is  
frightening in itself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ruins Dig Up Past for Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The bare-chested man arches the bow and aims his  
arrow at the sky. Atop a downtown drawbridge, the sculpture of the 
Tequesta Indian and his family guards the mouth of the Miami River. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it also stands sentinel over an archaeological dig wedged  
among downtown skyscrapers. What is likely prehistoric ruins from 
the extinct tribe have been unearthed on land slated for a 
high-rise condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of a circle made up of dozens of holes carved into  
bedrock limestone has captured the imagination of city dwellers. 
Daily, people show up at the fenced-in site to watch researchers 
sifting the black dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even get dirty helping hunt for animal bones and pieces of  
pottery. 
</P>
<P>
	For a city with a largely transient population, where  
native-born Floridians are almost as rare as manatees, the 
five-month dig has created a sense that there is more to Miami than 
neon, drug-related killings and gaudy tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows the public to get a glimpse of what life was like so  
long ago,'' said John M. Ricisak, historic preservation specialist 
with Miami-Dade County. ``Even people who have lived here all their 
lives have the idea that the history of the area is brief, that it 
doesn't extend more than 100 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lori Glick, a 32-year-old actress, was fascinated by the  
Tequesta statue she saw outside the window of the apartment she 
recently moved into. Like many who volunteered to dig, she was born 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, there is this discovery right outside where I  
live,'' said Ms. Glick, speckled head-to-toe with mud after 
spraying down artifacts. ``It's really interesting to learn about 
the history of Miami from all this and how other people may have 
lived. I try to imagine how it must have looked like back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spectacular, said Ricisak.  
</P>
<P>
	Before skyscrapers, he said, the Tequesta could see the sun rise  
over Biscayne Bay and set over the Everglades. Here, fish were 
plentiful and the river offered easy transportation into the 
wetlands. Giant flocks of birds filled the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mouth of the Miami River would have been a preferred place  
to be if you were a prehistoric hunter and gatherer,'' Ricisak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unearthed so far have been stone tools, beads, shells and  
evidence of animal sacrifice. One of the carved holes in the circle 
faces directly east, toward Biscayne Bay, and is in the shape of an 
eye with a stone pupil. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on the purpose of the circle has focused on the  
possibility it was a celestial calendar on the order of Stonehenge 
or perhaps evidence of a breakaway band of sophisticated Mayan 
Indians from Central America. The latter theory is based on the 
discovery of small axes made of basaltic stone -- a material not 
native to Florida but found in the Caribbean basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers, though, believe the oval outlines the foundation of  
some type of Tequesta religious building and that many of the 
carved holes probably held posts. The tribe lived in South Florida 
before being wiped out by war and disease once Spanish explorer 
Ponce de Leon arrived in 1513 on a quest for the Fountain of Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just enough clues to make us have a lot more  
questions,'' said Bob Carr, director of Dade County's Historic 
Preservation Division and leader of the dig. 
</P>
<P>
	Pottery shards date the site at least 2,000 years, but the  
prehistoric circle probably goes back to around 1100. Just before 
Christmas another clue surfaced: the complete remnants of a 5-foot 
shark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests it was buried for a purpose. It was buried as an  
offering,'' Ricisak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tools and a number of exotic stones found indicate the  
Tequesta were involved in trade. That the building is built on a 
perfect east-west axis to mark the equinox may mean it was used to 
mark the seasons or for religious purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here the indigenous people in Florida had the intellect... to  
create this particular feature,'' Carr said. ``The Spanish 
described them as these primitive heathens, and what we are doing 
is redeeming that misinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site was discovered last summer by a construction crew  
readying the site for the high-rise. A delay in issuing building 
permits allowed archaeologists to pursue a fruitful dig. They still 
have a few weeks left before building begins, and the site is full 
of good will as Miamians show up to help. 
</P>
<P>
	One was 16-year-old Georges Solomon, who came by bus from the  
inner city in search of a better way to spend a day of his 
Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have played a video game or watched television, but I  
thought I'd come out here instead,'' he said. ``I came out here to 
learn, to learn about history.''

<HEADLINE> Germann Is Big Fish in `Ally' Pond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Considering his role as sharkish lawyer Richard  
Fish, Greg Germann should keep his own lawyer on call. With all the 
scenes he gets to steal, he could be nailed for grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Or to put it another way: Germann, playing Ally McBeal's boss at  
a certain loopy Boston law firm, is having more fun than the law 
allows. And why not? He's part of the most focused-on, 
buzzed-about, argued-over series in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in its sophomore season, ``Ally McBeal'' (whose pilot airs  
on Fox tonight at 8 p.m. EST, followed by another repeat at 9 p.m.) 
is an irresistible irritant in the national psyche. The unisex 
restroom ... resident chanteuse Vonda Shepard ... dancing twins and 
that infernal dancing baby. Objection! 
</P>
<P>
	Overruled! Viewers love, hate, can't get enough of  
lawyer-flibbertigibbet Ally (series star Calista Flockhart) and her 
delightfully exasperating world. 
</P>
<P>
	In this well-stocked pond, Germann gets to play the big Fish -- a  
remarkable mix of airy self-obsession, Yuppie smarm and cold-fish 
directness. Not to mention his fetish for wattles, those folds of 
flesh that drape from the throats of certain-age women. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a jerk, for lack of a better word -- but don't quote me,''  
says Germann, grinning at the very idea of Fish. ``I always think 
of him as a 10-year-old boy, who's always forward-moving, to his 
own detriment sometimes, and not really thinking about how his 
behavior might affect other people or fit into social conventions. 
I just love it!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germann, who cleaned apartments for four years until he found  
success in Manhattan theater, had reluctantly moved to Los Angeles 
to pursue TV. There he landed supporting roles in two short-lived 
series: the NBC drama ``Sweet Justice'' (1994-95) and the Fox 
sitcom ``Ned and Stacey'' (1995-97). 
</P>
<P>
	Then, two years ago, he lucked into a show cooked up by David E.  
Kelley, a brilliant writer-producer already hailed for blending 
thorny issues with loony plot twists on ``Picket Fences'' and 
``Chicago Hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting more and more excited,'' Germann recalls. ``Then  
we did the pilot, and I thought it was great. At that point, I was 
certain we were doomed. I thought, `This probably won't find an 
audience. It's not a drama, it's not a sitcom.' But I thought it 
would be fun to do 13 episodes. Then we'd be done.''

	Wrong. Then Germann was wrong about another thing: the  
prospective appeal of Fishisms, the epigram-like observations that 
Richard Fish is fond of tossing off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is alone. It's just easier to take, in a  
relationship.'' Or: ``Make enough money and everything else will 
follow.'' Not only did Fishisms become a running joke for the 
character and a signature of the show, they were even destined to 
adorn a line of camisoles and men's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Germann recognized this as a budding franchise?  
</P>
<P>
	``No! Because I'm an idiot! When I first read the term  
`Fishism,' I thought, `It doesn't sound right to me.' Luckily for 
me, I kept my mouth shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, Germann is happy to speak up about another  
matter. He is clearly bemused by one offshoot of his series' 
polymorphous appeal: viewers' spirited debate over what ``Ally 
McBeal,'' and Ally in particular, truly stand for. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only has Ally been anointed as a cultural phenomenon, she  
was also snapped up for the Zeitgeist Follies as a symbol. But of 
what? America's sweetheart? Feminist icon? Feminist washout? The 
polemic rages on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ally -- she's pretty quirky,'' Germann says. ``She's a mess.  
She's clearly got problems, whining about her job and not having a 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, know plenty of women who -- well, you could say  
they're whining, or you could say they just don't know how to 
balance a career and a personal life. But I kinda don't understand 
how people are looking at this show to depict reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a strange thing about commercial television: Viewers are  
conditioned to see the characters on network series as role models, 
reflecting not who the viewer is, but who the viewer longs to be. 
So if Ally doesn't measure up to one ideal or another, this lapse 
gets the audience stirred up. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want her character to be stronger,'' Germann says.  
``Why? What would we gain? Then they say, `Her skirts are too 
short. Lawyers don't dress like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He sighs. ``I'm thinking: `This is a TV show! Sometimes we act  
out fantasies. We sing, we dance. We're just trying to do a show 
that's sexy and fun and silly, that has a heart.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Consider that a Germannism.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Lose Heat After Va. Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WYTHEVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A leaking natural gas line exploded early  
Sunday, destroying two nearby buildings and leaving several 
thousand people without heat in icy weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters were slightly injured in the fire and were  
treated and released from Wythe County Community Hospital. There 
were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the gas leak was not immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	A motorcycle shop and a house were destroyed. No one was in the  
destroyed business, a motorcycle shop, and the man who lived in the 
house was at work. His four cats were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me if I was in the house, I would have been killed  
because my bedroom was right next to the substation,'' said Stuart 
Crigger, who rented the house where only a brick chimney was left 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
	After the explosion, United Cities cut off service to all  
customers -- about 1,500 homes and businesses, said Judy Moss, 
spokeswoman for United Cities Gas, which owns the line that 
exploded. Some customers were expected to be without heat and 
cooking fuel until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wytheville is about 65 miles west of Roanoke in western  
Virginia.
