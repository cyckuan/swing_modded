<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs Further Structural Reforms: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
stressed the need for further structural reforms in Bangladesh if
the country is to achieve greater economic efficiency, growth, and
international competitiveness while reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
In its annual Outlook report issued here Thursday, the bank
noted that in the early 1990s, the government of Bangladesh
launched a comprehensive set of structural reforms aimed at
strengthening fiscal and monetary management, fostering private
sector development, and liberalizing the external trade and
foreign exchange rate reigns.
</P>
<P>
Such reforms resulted in a relatively stable macroeconomics
environment, with improvements in economic growth, savings and
investment, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Outlook report, between 1995 and 1999, the GDP
growth rate of the country averaged 5 percent compared with 4.7
percent in the preceding five years. The agriculture sector
maintained an average growth rate of 3 percent, and the country
achieved near self-sufficiency in rice production in those years
without flooding.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, growth in the industry sector averaged
6 percent, mainly because of robust manufacturing performance,
while the service sector grew at an average of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export sector showed an average annual growth rate of about
16 percent in dollar terms because of strong trade in garments and
knitwear products.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh succeeded in attracting significant foreign direct
investment, which increased from about 80 million U.S. dollars in
1995 to about 400 million dollars per year for 1996 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, this strong growth trend in GDP was slowed when severe
floods hit in the third quarter of 1998, disrupting industrial
growth in particular, the report said, adding that with the help
of a bumper winter harvest, GDP grew 4.4 percent in 1999 which was
"better than the immediate postflood estimates of 3.3 percent,
though lower than the 5.2 percent growth of 1998."
</P>
<P>
The report said the country's macroeconomics outlook for 2000
remains positive, with reasonably high GDP growth of 5 percent and
inflation limited to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the report warned that the growth performance in recent
years considerably below the 7 percent per annum target of the
Fifth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002). Stepping up the growth rate of
the economy, while maintaining macro-economic stability should
remain the major priority of the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook report expressed concern at the high fiscal deficit,
deterioration in the financial position of state-owned enterprises,
sluggish revenue collection efforts, fragile balance of payments,
and the low levels of foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Concern is also expressed at the slow pace of economic reforms.
The report stressed those macroeconomics imbalances need to be
corrected by keeping the fiscal deficit and inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the government of Bangladesh should
attempt to reach a political consensus on a National Fiscal Policy
that will ensure an increase in revenue collection, reduce
expenditure on unproductive sectors, and contain the fiscal
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The report also emphasized the importance of good governance in
accelerating the pace of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The ADB hoped that the government will accelerate the pace of
economic reforms and pave the way for sustained and rapid economic
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A joint declaration on
strategic partnership between Russia and India and some other

</P>
<P>
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin is expected to visit
India toward the end of this year for the summit, said Ivanov in a
statement here, adding that active preparations were under way for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Putin pays most serious attention to developing Russian-Indian
relations," said Ivanov, who arrived here on Wednesday for a two-
day visit. "Our country pays great importance to the forthcoming
summit."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Russia is keen to coordinate efforts
with India in settling key international issues and actively
combating trans-border terrorism and religious extremism.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two countries in the sphere of security
was "very topical," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Ivanov on Thursday
evening called on Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
earlier held talks with Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Bans Importation of Meat From Japan, S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government ordered
Thursday a temporary ban on the importation of meat, meat products
and by-products originating from Japan and South Korea, which is
believed to be inflicted with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).
</P>
<P>
Philippine Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in a
statement that he issued the order following official reports from
the Office of International des Epizootie (OIE) confirming an
outbreak of FMD in the said countries.
</P>
<P>
FMD-susceptible animals include all cloven-footed animals such
as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer.
</P>
<P>
Angara said he has ordered the Bureau of Plant Industry to
immediately suspend the processing, evaluation and issuance of
Veterinary Quarantine Clearance for applications relevant to the
importation of meat products in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said he has also ordered quarantine inspectors and officers
to confiscate all shipments into the country of affected products
originating from the two countries at all major sea and air ports.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary ban will prevent the entry and spread of FMD in
the country and will remove the fear of the consumers over the
safety of the meat they are eating," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
In March, Angara issued an administrative order to preserve
Mindanao's status as an FMD-free region following a recent
outbreak of the disease in some parts of Luzon and the Visayas.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the order will fasttrack the bid of Mindanao to be
recognized by the OIE as FMD-free even as he stressed that FMD
cases in Luzon an the Visayas have already been contained.
</P>
<P>
"A recognition from the OIE is needed to give Mindanao a chance
to enter the global market," he said.

<HEADLINE> BP Tanzania to Lower Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- BP (British Petroleum
Company) Tanzania will lower the prices of four petroleum products
beginning from Friday after Tanzania has been hit heavily by the
ever increasing fuel prices over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
An average drop of 21 Tanzanian shillings (one U.S. dollar
equals about 810 shillings at present) per liter would be made as
the company has imported a certain amount of petroleum from the
United Arab Emirates, said a statement issued by BP Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The retail price for diesel will drop by 36 shillings from 518
shillings per liter to 482 shillings, and the super petrol will be
sold at 543 shillings per liter instead of 564 shillings, a drop
of 21 shillings.
</P>
<P>
Kerosene price will drop by 20 shillings per liter from 420
shillings to 400 shillings and the industrial oil price will go
down by seven shillings.
</P>
<P>
According to BP Tanzania, the lowering of fuel prices is
attributed to lower crude oil prices and last month's decision by
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
increase production by 1.7 million barrel per day.
</P>
<P>
"The crude oil prices in the international markets have fallen
by 2.7 percent to 25.33 U.S. dollars a barrel," the company said.
"In other places, crude oil for June settlement fell by 50 cents
or 2.1 percent to 23. 33 U.S. dollars a barrel on the
international petroleum exchange."
</P>
<P>
Although BP Tanzania claimed that the new prices would not
affect government taxes collection, other oil companies refused to
follow its step.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the light of the new arrival, they might not
lower the prices immediately until the business situation forces
them to do so.
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices in Tanzanian pump stations early this month
rose to a historic high level, inflicting a heavy blow on local
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The prices of super petrol and diesel were raised by 20
Tanzanian shillings up to 565 and 518 shillings per liter
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank attributed the fuel price hikes in Tanzania to
oil price hikes in the world market, but saying that some of the
taxes charged by the government on fuel were too high and needed
further streamlining.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania imposes six different taxes on imported petroleum
products, namely import duty Tanzania Petroleum Development
Corporation (TPDC) margins, TIPER processing fees, Road Toll,
Excise Duty, Energy Fund and Windfall Profit tax. In addition,
there is city services levy for Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian oil marketing companies were accusing that the
government levies and taxes were behind the unpredictable
escalating prices of petroleum products. All these taxes were
approximately 150 percent above the landed prices, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the consumer of the products would not enjoy
anything from the liberalization of the oil sector unless world
prices drop drastically.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals put the
frequent price increases of petroleum products on the unstable
prices of the commodities at the world market, a factor which
local marketing companies have no way to control.
</P>
<P>
According to Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance
Peter Ngumbullu, the treasury is contemplating to review petroleum
products price structure to ensure that fuel is sold to consumers
at realistic and affordable prices.

<HEADLINE> IT Dealers Urged to Avoid Dumping Obsolete Equipment in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking official of the
Ghanaian government Thursday called on Western and African
information technology (IT) dealers not to dump obsolete but
new-looking communication equipment on African continent.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana News Agency quoted Owuraku Amofa, deputy minister of
Communications, as saying during a preview of the incoming African
Telecommunications Exhibition and Conference to be held in Ghana's
capital Accra that Africa could not afford lagging too far behind
in the information age.
</P>
<P>
Amofa noted that the just-ended African Telecommunication
Summit had decided to support the African Telecommunication Union
and make it strong and viable to fight for the development of the
IT base of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He urged African IT users, scientists, engineers and
technologists to resist the temptation of looking up to others for
their needs.
</P>
<P>
They should rather endeavour to be innovative and creative so
as to initiate efforts that would enable them to find solutions to
African problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on IT specialists to tax people to manufacture simple
 communications gadgets that could be used in the rural
telecommunications industry at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
Tim Gross, general manager of the exhibition and conference,
said more than 6,000 people are expected to visit the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors are expected from West Africa, South Africa, United
Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the exhibition and conference is to bring IT
users and other people together and expose them to the latest
technology.

UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 140 women
parliamentarians from 90 countries will take part in the Third
Meeting of Women Parliamentarians in Amman, Jordan, U.N. said on

<HEADLINE> EU to Encourage Development of Rare Disease Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union started on
Friday to encourage firms to produce medicines for rare diseases
in Europe, diseases like malaria and sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, said it had set out an assortment of incentives including a
guaranteed exclusive right to market the drugs for up to 10 years
and possible exemption from a 200,000 euro (183,000 U.S. dollars)
fee for approval for the drugs to be marketed across the union.
</P>
<P>
Companies may now apply to the European Agency for the
Evaluation of Medicinal Products to designate drugs as "orphan
drugs" which treat diseases that affect fewer than five in every
10,000 people in the EU.
</P>
<P>
These medicines will benefit patients in the developing
countries as well as in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the United States that has had legislation regarding
orphan drugs since 1983, the EU will have representatives of the
patients to sit on a new committee for orphan medicinal products
that will decide whether a medicine meets the requirement to be
classified as an orphan drug.

<HEADLINE> Miami Police Chief Resigns After Elian Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Miami police chief William O'
Brien resigned Friday after mayor criticized him for involvement
in the raid to snatch Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez from the home of
his relatives in the city.
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to be the chief of police in a city that has someone
as divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo as mayor," O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came a day after Mayor Joe Carollo, who sided
openly with Elian's Miami relatives, fired the city manager who
refused to dismiss O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
Carollo had demanded that City Manager Donald Warshaw dismiss O
'Brien for failing to warn the mayor about the raid to seize the 6-
year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
The city in Florida plunged into turmoil as angry people took
to the street in protest of the raid and some protesters
complained that police abused them.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been created to investigate police involvement
in the federal government's seizure of Elian and any police
brutality that occurred during the protests.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people were arrested and tear gas was used to
disperse crowds after the boy was seized.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief William O'Brien said he issued the order to clear
his officers from around the house before armed federal agents
raided the house.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, 56, said he was retiring because "the healing's got to
start. The healing's got to start for this community."
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to be the lightning rod of divisiveness in this
community," he said.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands Friday awarded
the country's second highest honor to the Dutch man who blew the
whistle on a fraud scandal that triggered the fall of the previous
European Commission last year.
</P>
<P>
Paul van Buitenen, a member of the financial control unit of
the European Union's executive body, was on the Queen's birthday
honors list that was learned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch man's 1998 report to the European Parliament alleged
more widespread fraud than formerly acknowledged in the European
Union and the report led to the ultimate resignation of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Van Buitenen got the Knight of the Order of Oranje-Nassau at a
ceremony in Luxembourg to celebrate the Queen's day, a public
holiday in the Netherlands to mark the birthday of Queen Mother
Juliana.
</P>
<P>
The previous commission, under the presidency of Jacques Santer,
had to resign collectively early last year after failing a
confidence vote in the 600-strong European Parliament.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Most members of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) registered evident economic growth in
the first quarter of this year, breaking away from long-time
economic logjam, according to latest CIS official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the quarter rose in all CIS

transportation and trade -- where production increased 9.5 percent
year-on-year in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
In most CIS nations industrial output continued to grow in the

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Appeal for $450 Million for Reconstruction After Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Government of
Mozambique next week will ask donors for 450 million U.S.dollars
to help restore basic services after floods destroyed much of the
country's infrastructure, a release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
To be held in Rome from May 3-4, the International
Reconstruction Conference follows the massive flooding in February
and March which killed 650 people and caused severe economic
hardship for about two million people in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The funding will help restore and improve education, health
care, infrastructure and agriculture as well as revitalize the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano,
the aid will help "secure a better future for the thousands of
children, women and elders who still do not have a roof over their
heads."
</P>
<P>
One of the costliest reconstruction challenge will be to
rebuild the country's road and railway networks, at a cost of
about 120 million U.S. dollars, while the resettlement of more
than half a million people remains one of the most immediate tasks,
estimated at 24.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before the flooding, Mozambique was regarded as a unique
success story among African economies. Although recovering from a
16-year civil war that ended in 1992, the country's economic
growth rate was about 10 percent in 1999, the release said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday denied reports
that it had stationed a military force in neighboring countries of
Zimbabwe to help evacuate whites from Zimbabwe if violence
escalated.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office spokesman in London said in a telephone
interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency that the press reports
were false.
</P>
<P>
According to a Reuters report citing a German newspaper,
European Union members including Britain were said to have
deployed military troops in South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana
to help with the evacuation of whites.
</P>
<P>
"We do have a civil contingent plan which allows for the
evacuation of British citizens in the case of a crisis. We have
one for Zimbabwe. But to say we have troops is untrue and is
unnecessarily alarmist," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a small number of British military personnel in South
Africa for training. This is the only military personnel we have
in those countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already indicated that it will help with the
evacuation of its citizens if the violence in Zimbabwe escalates.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 10 lives have been lost in the 194
cases of political violence in Zimbabwe as the parliamentary
election draws near.
</P>
<P>
Violence has also erupted at white-owned farms, and to date two
white commercial farmers have died during clashes with war
veterans who were invading the farms.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission on
Human Rights concluded the 56th session here Friday following
broad debates on various issues of human rights during the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the nature of the struggle for human rights that
there will be debates and dissension, and that great battles will
be fought over policies, strategies and beliefs," High
Commissioner Mary Robinson said in her statement at the closing
meeting. "This session, like those that have preceded it, has
indeed seen such debates, and assessments will vary on particular
issues."
</P>
<P>
"I do think, however, that there was a genuine spirit of co-
operation and dialogue which brought results from which we can
take heart," she added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chairman of the 56th session Shambu Ram Sinkhada
outlined the important achievements of the current session. The
commission has decided:
</P>
<P>
-- To appoint for a period of three years a special rapporteur
whose mandate will focus on adequate housing as a component of the
right to an adequate standard of living;
</P>
<P>
-- To appoint for a period of three years a special rapporteur
on the right to food;
</P>
<P>
-- To request the UN Secretary-General to appoint, for a period
of three years, a special representative who shall report on the
situation of human rights defenders in all parts of the world and
on possible means to enhance their protection;
</P>
<P>
The commission has adopted a decision on enhancing the
effectiveness of the mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights.
It has decided to approve and implement comprehensively and in its
entirety the report of the inter-sessional open-ended Working
Group which includes a substantial set of measures and
recommendations aimed at rationalizing the work of the commission;
</P>
<P>
The commission has also adopted the Chairman's resolution on
the question of draft optional protocols to the Convention of the
Rights of the Child on involvement of children in armed conflict,
as well as on the sale of children, child prostitution and child
pornography.
</P>

"It is rather exceptional for the commission to adopt the same
year two international human rights instruments," said Sinkhada.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Proposed Changes on ABM Treaty to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Collins, speaking to reporters at a breakfast, refused to
discuss the details of the proposals, but stressed that Russia was
told that the U.S. does not intend to pose a threat to Russia's
nuclear weapons system.
</P>
<P>
"We have told them we do not intend to expand to the point
where there is a threat" to Russia's nuclear weapons system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Collins indicated that Moscow has declared any changes, even
the ones proposed by the administration to permit deployment of
100 launchers with improved radar, would violate the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
But the diplomat added that Russians, however, "do not walk out
the door." "On the other hand they are making clear they are
prepared to discuss the problem of missile threats from emerging
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on Friday that the U.S. has
presented Russia with the document on the changes of ABM Treaty,
saying that Washington wants 100 missiles at each of two sites to
shoot down incoming missiles form "rogue" states.
</P>
<P>
Collins added that the changes will open the door to a wider
defense system, but the system will be "a very limited one."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin are
due to meet on June 4-5. The ABM treaty and other arms control
issues will be high on the agenda of their first summit.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions between the two presidents in June will
determine how far we will go into negotiations," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that the United States calls for
talks on an expanded system to begin as soon as next March after
Clinton's successor is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said his country agrees

ABM) with the United States but continues to oppose any changes to
the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this treaty, although it was concluded in 1972,
still remains in force and still remains very topical, and wish it
can be and it should be preserved as the basis for our relations
in the sphere of strategic stability," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia proposed "a constructive alternative for the
ABM Treaty collapse," and would pursue cooperation with the United
States on addressing the threat of theater missile defense.

<HEADLINE> First Preparatory Meeting to Be Held for World Conference Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory committee to the
World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia
and Related Intolerance will hold its first session here in Geneva
on May 1-5.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long meeting, the preparatory committee is
expected to take key decisions on the agenda, dates, venue and
rules of procedure for the World Conference to be held next year
in South Africa, the United Nations Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner Mary Robinson will open the meeting on May 1.
She has said that the preparatory process is almost as important
as the conference itself, as it will see countries and civil
society review how they are implementing their commitments to
fight discrimination and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the first World Conference Against Racism
was voted unanimously at the UN General Assembly on December 12,
1997. The General Assembly has emphasized that the world
conference should focus on practical steps to eradicate racism by
considering how to ensure that international standards and
instruments are applied in efforts to combat it.

<HEADLINE> EU to Probe Nintendo Distribution Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Friday that it had warned Japan's home video games maker Nintendo
over its way of distribution in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said
that the 15-nation bloc had evidence that the prices for Nintendo
game-consoles had been kept artificially high.
</P>
<P>
The union sent the Japanese company a statement of objections
warning that its way of dividing up the market for Nintendo game-
consoles and video games appeared to break EU anti-trust rules.
</P>
<P>
Sending out a statement of objections is a formal step in EU's
anti-trust investigations.
</P>
<P>
Nintendo is the world's second largest maker of home video
games and produces the popular hand-held Game-Boy consoles.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union, said
that seven importers of Nintendo games into Europe had
participated in a cartel-like arrangement with the aim of carving
up the European single market.
</P>
<P>
It added that Nintendo had made it more difficult for retailers
to compete on price.
</P>
<P>
The commission started to look closely at Nintendo's
distribution in Europe as early as in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It noted that consumers in EU member states were unable to buy
lowly-priced Nintendo products. Prices of some products can
differ by as much as 100 percent from one member state to another.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap Narrows But Global Trade Position  Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trade gap narrowed
unexpectedly in February, despite the strong pounds. But the
global trade position is getting worse,according to the latest
official figures.
</P>
<P>
The country's global trade deficit was 1.4 billion pounds in
February, smaller than the 1.7 billion pounds gap in January.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in February reflected growth in exports of
manufactured goods, and falls in capital and intermediate goods
imports with non-European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
While statisticians in the Office for National Statistics said
the trend in the trade deficit is worsening, economists warned
that Britain's global trading gap would not be closed while the
pound stood at its current level.
</P>
<P>
The pound has climbed 15 percent against the euro since 1997,
but has changed little against the dollar and has declined 10
percent against the yen. Most economists expect the deficit will
be above 17 billion pounds in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the trade situation is bad and getting worse, and
it is hard to see the situation improving with sterling as strong
as it is," said Neil Parker, UK economist with the Royal Bank of
Scotland.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Prices Drop By 3.6pc On Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- New car prices in Britain fell by
3.6 percent last month, according to the Alliance &AMP; Leicester Bank.
</P>
<P>
The drop is the biggest monthly fall since A&AMP;L began its index
of new car prices last October which tracks what people actually
pay for new cars rather than the advertised prices.
</P>
<P>
In the year to February 2000, prices were down just 1 percent,
though the A&AMP;L said it would not be clear until next month whether
the big drop in March "was spurred by the Competition Commission's
report".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the commission called for a 10 percent - 12
percent fall in prices to bring them in line with the Continent.
</P>
<P>
Nick Stace, a spokesman for the Consumers' Association,said: "
Even 3.6 percent is nowhere near enough and consumers can still
get massive reductions by buying overseas."
</P>
<P>
The A&AMP;L said the biggest falls were in luxury cars,such as the
Mercedes S-class and BMW 7-sries, down by 13.2 percent. People
carriers were down by 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices for family cars, such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall
Vectra; executive cars such as the BMW 5-series and the Mercedes E-
class, are holding up by 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A Society of Motor Manufacturers &AMP; Traders spokesman said: "
This shows the market is becoming more competitive.There are a lot
of good deals around."

<HEADLINE> UK To Use Phone Deal Windfall To Cut Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Telecom companies have paid the
government 22.5 billion pounds (36 billion U.S. dollars) to run a
new generation of mobile phones, Metro,a British daily, reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The windfall will be used to pay off part of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
After seven weeks of bidding, the five mobile phone licences
were snapped up by Vodafone AirTouch, BT, Orange and One2One, as
well as the Canadian company TIW.
</P>
<P>
The total sum they paid is more than five times the highest
forecast for the auction which some observers fear will led to
higher phone charges.
</P>
<P>
The public sector union Unison urged Chancellor Gordon Brown to
spend the windfall on state services. But Brown said he would not
spend the money on tax cuts or extra funding for education or the
NHS (National Health Services).
</P>
<P>
"The cash proceeds of the auction will be used to reduce the
Government's net debt and therefore interest costs, not for tax
cuts or higher public spending," a Treasury spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Deployment of Force in Zimbabwe's Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday denied reports
that it had stationed a military force in neighboring countries of
Zimbabwe to help evacuate whites from Zimbabwe if violence
escalated.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office spokesman in London said in a telephone
interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency that the press reports
were false.
</P>
<P>
According to a Reuters report citing a German newspaper,
European Union members including Britain were said to have
deployed military troops in South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana
to help with the evacuation of whites.
</P>
<P>
"We do have a civil contingent plan which allows for the
evacuation of British citizens in the case of a crisis. We have
one for Zimbabwe. But to say we have troops is untrue and is
unnecessarily alarmist," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a small number of British military personnel in South
Africa for training. This is the only military personnel we have
in those countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already indicated that it will help with the
evacuation of its citizens if the violence in Zimbabwe escalates.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 10 lives have been lost in the 194
cases of political violence in Zimbabwe as the parliamentary
election draws near.
</P>
<P>
Violence has also erupted at white-owned farms, and to date two
white commercial farmers have died during clashes with war
veterans who were invading the farms.

JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The wave of farm seizures by
Zimbabwe' s black war veterans is unlikely to spread abroad,
former Namibian agriculture minister Anton von Wietersheim said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German radio station Deutschlandfunk,
he said the likelihood of such occupations happening in Namibia is
much lower because commercial farming in that country is only 43
percent in white hands in comparison to 70 or 80 percent in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Von Wietersheim said he found it "frightful" that the
governments of Namibia and South Africa had not clearly condemned
the land conflict in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Everyone involved will have to realize there is not enough land
for every rural dweller to have his own farm and a proper reform
of land ownership has to take place in all these three countries,
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Police Destroy Impounded Narcotic Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan police Friday
afternoon destroyed all the narcotic drugs impounded in the past
two years at the damping site of Kampala City Council.
</P>
<P>
The drugs included eight kilograms of heroin, 1.148 kilograms
of cocaine, 8.797 kilograms of cannabis resin and 600 kilograms of
cannabis (marijuana).
</P>
<P>
"The cannabis were produced in Uganda, and other drugs were
trafficked from Asia and South America to Europe," Johnson Ayela,
detective super- intendant of Uganda Anti-Narcotics Unit, told
Xinhua on the spot.
</P>
<P>
According to Ayela, a total of 17 drug-trafficking cases were
dealt with by the police in 1998 and 1999, involving 18 foreigners
and 326 Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
These were "group crimes" and all the criminals have been
convicted in accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current law of Uganda stipulates that the maximum penalty
for drug- traffickers in the country is 54 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
"This is very lenient for them," the officer said, noting that
"the Ministry of Internal Affairs will improve and strengthen the
law, and will crack down on drug-trafficking activities more
forcefully."
</P>
<P>
Narcotic drugs have not spread in Uganda so far, but
international drug- traffickers have been using Uganda as a
transit station to transfer drugs to Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is always on the alert to fight drug-trafficking and is
willing to join the rest of the world to crack down on the
international crime, Ayela said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Burundian Army to Support Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The full support of the
Burundian army will be crucial for ending the conflict in the
country, former South African president and mediator for Burundian
civil war Nelson Mandela said in Burundi's capital Bujumbura on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no agreement which can work if the army does not
agree with it, " he was quoted by South African Press Association
as saying at a military academy when he was paying a lightning
visit to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an overhaul of the Burundian army, which is
dominated by the Tutsi minority, to integrate the majority Hutu
rebels is one of the thorniest issues in the marathon peace
negotiations to end the seven-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he is confident that peace negotiations are going
forward and a solution is in hand.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt about the signature of the peace agreement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Before delivering the speech at the military academy, Mandela
had met with Burundian President Pierre Buyuya and Defense
Minister Cyrille Ndayirukiye.
</P>
<P>
The mediator is also expected to meet diplomats and parliament
members including Speaker Leonce Ngendakumana later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit followed an upsurge of fighting that claimed at
least 67 civilians and rebels in the past three days on the
outskirts of Bujumbura and in the southern province of Makamba.

HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- About 5.1 million Zimbabwean

parliamentary elections, said Chairman of the Delimitation
Commission Justice Wilson Sandura on Friday.

This is the highest number of people registering to vote since

<P>
The commission needs the total number of voters so that it can
demarcate constituencies according to the number of registered
voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sandura, the commission needs at least three
months to complete its work, but President Mugabe wants the

LUANDA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Senegal has accepted direct talks,
mediated by Guinea-Bissau, with the Casamance separatist movement,
Guinea-Bissau's Interior Minister Antonio Artur Sanha announced on
Thursday after meeting with the visiting Senegalese counterpart
Mamadu Niang.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here on Friday, the Senegalese
newly elected president Abdoulaye Wade will travel to Bissau on
Saturday. Wade has twice postponed the visit to Guinea-Bissau,
which he has said will be destination of his first trip abroad as
president.
</P>
<P>
Sanha said Senegal's recent violation of Guinea-Bissau's
northern border had not been discussed during the talks with
Niang, adding that the issue will be settled through diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that on April 11, a Senegalese aircraft fired
four rockets into the Guinea-Bissau territory.
</P>
<P>
Troops in Senegal were at the time allegedly involved in
operations against the Casamance separatist guerrillas active in
southern Senegal's Casamance province bordering on Guinea-Bissau.
</P>

Bissau authorities addressed an official protest note to Dakar
although no one was hurt in the bombing, according to a report by

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Parliament Ends Debate on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament, the
Assembly of the Republic, Friday ended its debate on the
government's plan and budget for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government accepted many of the suggestions made by the
deputies, including the need to revise the plan and budget later
in the year, said Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi agreed with deputies' concerns that contracts for
repairing infrastructure damaged by the February/March flooding
should be granted in the first instance to Mozambican companies
rather than foreign ones.
</P>
<P>
The government also accepted the need to strengthen
"post-privatization monitoring", he said, noting that workers have
complained of the "anomalous situations" created by the new owners
of privatized companies disregarding their contractual
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The government, he pledged, would "look into the causes of
this."
</P>
<P>
The deputies had also complained of the poor quality of much
rehabilitation work, particularly on roads. The government would
insist on proper supervision of all publicly funded building work
to ensure compliance with the relevant technical norms, Mocumbi
said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation that dishonest employers deduct
the social security contributions from workers' wages but never
send the money to the National Social Security Institute (INSS),
Mocumbi promised to strengthen the control mechanisms to ensure
that workers' social security contributions are indeed delivered
to.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi stressed the government's commitment to halt the
spread of HIV, the virus that causes the lethal disease AIDS
(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). All available methods would
be used "to transmit the message and transform people's behavior,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must all know how to take preventive measures, so that
this virus does not destroy all the investments we are making," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the debate, the major change agreed upon is to take the
elimination of the tourism tax out of the budget law, and give it
a bill of its own.
</P>
<P>
The tourism tax is a three percent tax charged on all
accommodation, meals and other services provided by hotels,
restaurants and similar establishments, and a two percent tax
charged on travel agents and tourism operators.
</P>
<P>
However, 50 percent of the revenue raised by this tax went to
the state treasury, and the other 50 percent to the National
Tourism Fund, set up to stimulate the growth of tourism in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
With the imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT) on exactly the
same services as from June 1999, there is a serious danger that
the tax burden on the Mozambique tourism industry would make it
less competitive.
</P>
<P>
The budget, and a resolution approving the government plan,
will be voted on next week.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Renamo (Asistencia Nacional de
Mozambique)-Electoral Union coalition boycotted the entire debate
on the budget and plan, and the discussion therefore involved only
deputies of the ruling Frelimo (Frente de Libertacao de
Mozambique) and members of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The inflow of foreign direct
investment (FDI) to Ethiopia has shown an increasing trend over
the last several years, Ethiopian Investment Authority General
Manager Tadesse Haile has said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying on Friday
that the inflow of FDI increased from 4 million U.S. dollars in
1993 to 178 million U.S. dollars in 1998.

In recent years, the FDI inflow of Ethiopia was comparable to
that of Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and even Kenya and Mozambique,
Tadesse said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the period between July 1992 and January
2000, a total of 5,349 private investment projects with a combined
investment capital of about 46. 2 billion birr (about 5.75 billion
U.S. dollars) were approved.
</P>
<P>
Of the approved private investment capital, 37.7 percent was
distributed in manufacturing, 18.2 percent in real estate, 14
percent in agriculture, 12 percent in construction, and 4.1
percent in hotels and tourism, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Free Another 480 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran will release another 480 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) next week, under an agreement between the
Iranian government and the International Committee of Red Cross
(ICRC).
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, these POWs have been
interviewed and registered by the ICRC, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iran repatriated about 2000 Iraqi POWs earlier this month under
the agreement achieved between the Iranian government and the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The recent move was to fulfill due international commitments and
also for humanitarian reasons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and its neighbor Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to
1988, causing great casualties and economic damages to both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of POW exchanges by the two countries, Iran has
released 57,712 Iraqi POWs, and 39,417 Iranian POWs have also been
set free, according to figures from Iran's Commission for the
Prisoners of War.
</P>
<P>
Iran claims that Iraq still holds 3,206 Iranian POWs, while Iraq
insists there are still 20,743 Iraqi POWs held in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Intercept Boats Violating Marine Laws in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced the interception
of boats which fail to respect the country's maritime standards and
regulations or pollute seawater in the Persian Gulf, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ports and Shipping Organization said in a statement
released on Thursday that such boats would not be allowed transit
in the Iranian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that over the past few months a number of
boats navigating in the Gulf waters had ignored the security
standards and had repeatedly violated marine laws.
</P>
<P>
Failure to carry on the special signals, navigating with the
lamps turned off, abusing of the Iranian flag by carrying it
illegally as a way to cheat the Iranian marine officers are listed
as some of the offenses committed by certain foreign boats.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an Iranian public court at the Kish Free
Trade Zone earlier this month issued a ruling authorizing
interception of oil tankers polluting the Iranian waters in the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling came after the zone administration lodged a
complaint with court seeking compensation from oil tankers for the
damage inflicted on the environment of the Kish island.
</P>
<P>
Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)
intercepted a dozen of oil tankers in the Gulf in recent month for
being involved in smuggling oil from Iraq and violating Iranian
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Iran will not permit the use of Iranian territorial waters for
the smuggling of oil, an IRGC officer stressed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Minister Tells Britain: Put Up Money or Shut Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwe Minister said here on
Friday that the British government should either put up the money
to help solve his country's land reform crisis or hold its tongue.
</P>
<P>
"The British should own up to what the government promised to
do, or otherwise they should shut up," a Reuters report quoted
Zimbabwean Local Government Minister John Nkomo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo, who is currently visiting Britain as the head of a
delegation of Zimbabwe ministers, met British officials on
Thursday in a bid to resolve the crisis in his country which has
seen thousands of black Zimbabwean war veterans occupying white-
owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said it was now time for Britain, the former colonial
power in Zimbabwe, to make good its obligations and stop behaving
like the colonial ruler it once was.
</P>
<P>
"We are a sovereign country, we determine what is going to
happen in Zimbabwe, when and how. We are no longer a colony of the
British," Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 14 people have been killed in
nine weeks of escalating political tension in the former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has demanded that Britain pay
for land he plans to take from white farmers for redistribution to
blacks.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Tuesday, before
holding talks with the Zimbabwe delegation, that Britain was ready
to boost aid to Zimbabwe by 36 million pounds (56.7 million U.S.
Dollars) over the next two years to support the land transfers.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that farm occupations and the violence must end
first.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Britain Deadlocked on Funding Land Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Britain failed to
agree on key points relating to Zimbabwe's land reforms at a
meeting in London, Zimbabwe News Agency said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The high level talks were held on Thursday at which both
parties, while agreeing on the importance and urgency of land
reforms in Zimbabwe, did not come up with a concrete agreement on
the British funding of the land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe said it would not remove war veterans from the 1,000
white- owned farms which they had been occupying in the past two
months, while Britain was insisting that it would not provide
financial assistance until the former liberation fighters
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
Despite these major disagreements, both sides felt that the
meeting allowed for frank and serious discussions on the land
reform program which had been the root cause for the deteriorating
bilateral relations between Zimbabwe and its former colonial
power.
</P>
<P>
In separate telephone interviews with Zimbabwe News Agency from
London on Friday, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira and a British Foreign Office spokesman admitted that
the two countries had reached an impasse in the negotiations for
funding.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said, "We had very long discussions which lasted
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
In the end we were not able to agree with the British on some
key points,

the major one being the withdrawal of war veterans from the
farms."
</P>
<P>
He said, "They insisted that must be the first step and we said
the first step should be to finance the resettlement on 118 farms
as was agreed at the donor conference in 1998. We also want them
to finance the acquisition of 841 farms that had been designated
for resettlement."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office spokesman was adamant that his
government would only provide the funding if the Zimbabwean
government ordered the former freedom fighters from white-owned
commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the prevailing volatile situation in
Zimbabwe was not conducive for financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "the problem at the meeting was that we
could not agree to provide funding for the program until there is
an end to violence and the occupation of farms. No international
donor will want to contribute funds under the current atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"Britain and other donors are willing and we want to provide
funds for the land reform program, but it can't happen when the
atmosphere is intimidating. If people were expecting immediate
funding, then I can say there was a deadlock because we are clear
that the violence and occupation should stop," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Zimbabwean delegation managed to reassure
Britain that Zimbabwe's fifth parliamentary elections since
independence in 1980 would be held as soon as the Delimitation
Commission concluded its work and that it would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed satisfaction with the reassurance,
saying the British government would contribute observers to the
Commonwealth and European Union teams to monitor the elections.
@@@On the exact amount of fund Britain would provide if the
conditions were met, he said the total amounts would be determined
at a donor conference.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said 36 million pounds was readily
available for several programs, including the land reform program,
as long as the violence and farm occupations ended.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, through the amendment to the constitution, would
compulsorily acquire land without compensation.
</P>
<P>
At present, 4,500 white farmers own about 70 percent of high
quality farm land in Zimbabwe. The southern African country of
12.5 million needs more than one billion U.S. dollars for the
second phase of the land reform program.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Make Breakthrough in Gene Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have successfully
used gene therapies to save the lives of several infants who might
otherwise have died of a severe immune disorder, the journal
Science reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The achievement, the first unequivocal success in gene therapy,
comes after a decade of widely heralded promise followed by dashed
hopes for the revolutionary treatment, which involves adding
working genes to cells.
</P>
<P>
In a report carried on Friday's issue of Science, Dr. Alan
Fischer, a professor of pediatric immunology at the Necker
children's hospital in Paris, and his colleagues describe the
course of the treatment on two babies, aged 11 months and 8 months
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The patients could not grow a complete immune system. The only
other treatment for the condition, a form of severe combined
immune deficiency, or SCID, is a bone marrow transplant, which
works just 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, patients with SCID, must live in germ-free bubbles
or fall prey to the ever-present microorganisms that most people
can easily fend off.
</P>
<P>
The French researchers first extract bone marrow from a patient,
then sort a set of blood stem cells from the marrow. The cells are
mixed with a virus containing a replacement gene, which helps
carry the working gene into the cells. Then the cells containing
the healthy gene are transplanted back into the patient. After a
certain period, the genetically corrected cells proliferate and
displace cells with the defective genes.
</P>
<P>
Three months after their gene therapy, the babies went home
from the hospital, living like any other children. Ten months
later, their immune systems were normal. Untreated infants born
with SCID who are not kept in a sterile bubble become ill within
months and die before their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
The success proves that gene therapy can work, researchers said
in the report, but the patients had a disease that is especially
suited for the treatment. The researchers cautioned that the
method might not be immediately applicable to other diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a footnote, the researchers say that they have now
successfully treated a third baby, who was a month old at the time.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations to Cooperate Against Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Maritime policy officials from 16
Asian countries and Hong Kong concluded their two-day meeting here
Friday, pledging to work together to combat piracy in the region's
waters.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the regional conference unanimously adopted a
document called the "Asia Anti-Piracy Challenges 2000" and the "
Mode Action Plan" in an effort to promote cooperation and
coordination, Japan Coast Guard chief Shogo Arai said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
At the "Regional Conference on Combating Piracy and Armed
Robbery against Ships," participants had "valuable" discussions on
the importance of international cooperation and coordination to
eliminate attacks at sea, Arai said.
</P>
<P>
The "Asia Anti-Piracy Challenges 2000" spells out the need for
Asian countries to help each other in the fields of personnel
training and upgrading of equipment and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The document also calls for aggressive exchange of information
among the countries as well as periodic meetings among their
maritime officials to further facilitate and strengthen
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The "Mode Action Plan" calls for the reinforcement of self-
protection measures in terms of technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the creation of an effective system of
reporting attacks to authorities, cooperation among relevant
authorities within a government, and establishment of an
international network for the information exchange.
</P>
<P>
The conference to tackle piracy was first suggested last
November by then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in Manila at
an informal regional summit.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau,
more than 30 percent of worldwide piracy cases in the first three
months of this year took place in waters off Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cargo Spaceship Docks With Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian cargo spaceship
Progress M1-2 successfully docked with Russia's orbital space
station Mir at 1:29 a.m. Moscow time on Friday (2229 GMT Thursday),
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The docking was conducted in automatic mode by commands from
the Mission Control Center in Korolyov, near Moscow. Experts at
the center said it went without a hitch and the modernized control
system of the spaceship with new software performed well.
</P>
<P>
When making sure that the docking module was tightly sealed,
astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri opened inner
hatches and entered the cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The cargo spaceship, launched from Kazakhstan's cosmodrome
Baikonur on Wednesday, delivered to Mir a payload of 2,037
kilograms, including water, air-oxygen mixture, food, fuel, spare
parts and disposable materials for the operation of the station.
</P>
<P>
The Progress M1-2 is tanked with 1.5 tons of rocket fuel while
spaceships of the previous generation were capable of carrying
less than one ton. The extra fuel is necessary to put the station
to a much higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, the current mission should
remain on Mir until June, but the Mission Control Center does not
rule out the possibility of a prolonged mission till August.
</P>
<P>
The center said that the main task of the crew is to prepare
Mir for long-term operation, which will remain in operation at
least till the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Talks are now underway with the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center to prepare a new extended mission to Mir, said the center.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Supports Conservative Crackdown on Reformists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Friday turned to the conservatives and voiced support
for their unprecedented crackdown on the reformist allies of
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation at Tehran
University, Rafsanjani defended both the conservatives'
condemnation on a conference in Berlin titled "Iran after the
(February) elections" and the closure of a large number of
reformist publications.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the Berlin conference as a "shameful tool" of
assembling a motley of Iranian dissidents including writers,
liberals and jurists with the idea of denouncing every aspect of
Islam and Islamic statehood, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the current chairman of the powerful advisory and
arbitral State Expediency Council, called on political, security
and judicial forces in the country to probe into the Berlin
conference on April 7-9 to find out the real objectives of the
Germans for holding such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a centralist but close to the conservatives, lost
his reputation in the February parliamentary elections with his
name at the bottom of the list of 30 elected in Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives made a hue and cry against the
conference and accused the reformists who attended the conference
of advocating "U.S.-style reforms" in Iran, which were strongly
rejected by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who favors
limited reforms within the Islamic principles and values.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated judiciary has detained investigative
journalist Akbar Ganji and issued an arrest warrant for the
reformist cleric Hassan Yusefi Eshkevari for their participation in
the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives also launched nationwide protest rallies and
demonstrations against the results of the February parliamentary
elections, in which Khatami's reformist allies won a landslide
victory.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Guardians Council has nullified the results of
12 constituencies, depriving nine reformists of their eligibility
and forcing others to the runoff. It also delayed the confirmation
of the result of Tehran constituency in which reformists won 29 of
the total 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
The hue and cry over the Berlin conference was followed by the
closure of 16 reformist dailies and periodicals, almost all of the
reformist mouthpieces, leaving the reformist camp without a voice
for the second round of the parliamentary elections on May 5.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want even a single paper to be closed down, but the
situation was brought about by the Americans and the (Iranian)
judiciary was forced to carry out its duty," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the tension following the closure of reformist
publications as a "transient wave", he said that the wave should be
allowed to pass so that the Islamic Republic of Iran would be able
to have progressive and informative print media.
</P>
<P>
Reformists and students throughout the country lodged strong
protests against the crackdown on reformist press and accused the
conservatives, who still dominate most of the state organs, of
preventing the formation of the new reformist parliament on May 28
and undermining the reform programs of President Khatami.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Rise in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Americans' incomes, which
include wages, interest and government benefits, increased by 0.7
percent in March, the fastest pace since January, the Commerce
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's personal income outpaced spending, which rose 0.5
percent, for the first time since October, when Americans' incomes
grew by 1.2 percent and their spending went up 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage
of after-tax income, rose slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a
record low of 0.2 percent in February, worse than the government
previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
In February, income rose 0.4 percent, while spending grew by a
torrid 1.4 percent, the fastest pace since 1994.
</P>
<P>
With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, stock markets gains and
low inflation, Americans have been feeling in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, consumer spending, the
engine of the roaring economy, rose at an annual rate of 8.3
percent, the biggest jump in nearly 17 years, the government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the speeding economy, which grew at a 5.4 percent
rate in the first quarter, and keep inflation under control. Given
the outlook of continued strong growth, many economists expect the
Fed to raise interest rates for a sixth time on May 16.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce report showed that Americans' wages rose by a
strong 0.7 percent in March following a 0.3 percent increase the
month before.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that spending on nondurables, such as
food and fuel, rose 1.4 percent in March, down from a 2.1 percent
increase in February. But spending on durable goods, such as cars
and washing machines, fell 2.5 percent after a 3.3 percent
increase the month before.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Court Orders Cult Group to Pay Huge Money in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A local court in Fukuoka Prefecture,
southwestern Japan, on Friday ordered the Ho-no-Hana Sampogyo cult
and its founder Hogen Fukunaga to pay 27 people 227.2 million yen
(2.1 million dollars) in damages for swindling them of money in
the name of ascetic practice fees, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The conduct of Fukunaga and the cult members is beyond the
limit allowed as ascetic practice and is illegal, Presiding Judge
Motoaki Kimura said in handing down the ruling, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kimura said Fukunaga and the cult members forced the plaintiffs
to pay huge amounts of cash by plunging them into anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Fukunaga, 55, and senior cult members defrauded the plaintiffs
by falsely diagnosing serious ailments such as cancer based on
inspections of the soles of people's feet and claiming that
payments of millions of yen would cure the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
They defrauded the plaintiffs by telling them to undergo
expensive training sessions and selling them religious goods such
as hanging scrolls to cure the alleged illnesses, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs include housewives and workers from seven
prefectures who contacted the religious group after reading
Fukunaga's books.
</P>
<P>
Ho-no-Hana, founded by Fukunaga around 1980, was recognized by
the Shizuoka prefectural government in 1987 as a religious group
eligible for preferential tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
Ho-no-Hana has an estimated 2,000 regular followers. It is said
to have collected some 100 billion yen (943 million dollars) from
the believers.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,100 people across Japan have filed suits against Ho-no-
Hana at seven district courts, seeking a total of 5.2 billion yen
(49.1 million U.S. dollars) in damages. Fukuoka District Court's
ruling was the first in these cases.

<HEADLINE> Aging Process Reversed in Cloned Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadian and U.S. scientists have
achieved a medical milestone by reversing the aging process in
cloned calves, Canada's National Post newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The cloned calves have cells that appear younger and enable
them to live to an age of 30, 15 years longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
Youthful tissue will be created from the cells of elderly human
patients to treat degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's and diabetes, as well as heart, liver and kidney
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The discovery raises the prospect of taking cells from aging
people and producing rejuvenated replacement parts for their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Lansdorp of the British Columbia Cancer Agency, one
of the researchers collaborating on the work, confirmed the cloned
calves had their "genetic clocks" turned back.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that the cloning process can send old cells
into what is being described as a "backwards time warp", he and
his American colleagues said in a study to be published Friday in
the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are yet to make sure why the cloning process
transformed old cow cells into cloned animals that appear to have
longer lifespans, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Try Best for Safe Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the Sulu hostage crisis
since the 20 hostages were abducted from a diving resort in Sabah,
Malaysia, the military said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces chief of staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila asking about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimim said he assured them that the government will exert all
efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as possible,
but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not include the relatives of the kidnappers
residing in the area who are expected to help secure the hostages,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim note that government soldiers have sealed off the area
to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (
ARMM),who was appointed as chief negotiator, is negotiating with
the kidnap group for the safe release of the hostages, including
18 foreigners and two Filipinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth day of the Sulu hostage-crisis, he added, Misuari
and his emissaries are trying to establish contact with the
kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Court Fines Japanese Fishing Ship Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The court of Russian far east city
of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on Friday announced the captain of
Japanese fishing trawler Meisi Maru-128 guilty and imposed a fine
of about 3,000 U.S. dollars on him.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Japanese captain was charged with illegal
trespass of the Russian state border, illegal fishing, illegal
catching in an exclusive economic zone of Russia and abuse of
authority, and all the charges were found tenable, said the court
office.
</P>
<P>
The maximum possible punishment for this was a prison term of
three years, but the court took extenuating circumstances into
account and the captain pleaded guilty. His wrongdoings were
regarded as medium gravity, said a court official.
</P>
<P>
Before the verdict comes into force, the captain will have to
remain in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky for seven days, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trawler was stopped in the water near the Russian Komandor
islands in the Bering Sea on November 24, 1999. During the pursuit,
Russian border guards opened fire at the vessel which was trying
to flee to neutral waters. None of the crew members was hurt.
About 215 tons of fish illegally caught in Russia's exclusive
economic zone were found aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the trawler captain began on Wednesday, while
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori is scheduled to arrive in St.
Petersburg on Friday for an informal meeting with Russian
President-elect Vladimir Putin, also their first meeting, to
discuss bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, another Japanese fishing trawler, Daitoku Maru-7,
was stopped by Russian border guards in the area of the South
Kuril islands, with 97 tons of fish, 75 tons of which are
expensive Alaskan pollack, on board. It may be confiscated under a
court decision and its captain Yoshida Herue may be held
criminally responsible after investigation, reported the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Recently, conflict incidents between Russia and Japan over
fishing in the border water areas have kept rising. Moscow has
protested to Tokyo the intrusions of Japanese fishing ships into
Russian exclusive economic waters for illegal fishing.

<HEADLINE> Former French FM Calls Israeli Pullout Good News For Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette said Friday that the Israeli decision to pull
out of southern Lebanon is good news for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time of celebration for Lebanon. It has been years
that you are waiting for this... Many people have died for this,"
Agence France-Presse quoted de Charette as saying in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks in Beirut for marking the fourth
anniversary of the ending of the Israeli "Grapes of Wrath"
operation against Lebanon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that an Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of July,
will change the situation in a positive way for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Lebanon itself guarantees the security on its
border with Israel and decide whether it needs any outside help or
not.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France should not get involved in Lebanon
unless it is invited in a precise way by all the countries and
forces concerned.
</P>
<P>
Israel has asked the United Nations to send peacekeeping troops
to southern Lebanon and has invited France to lead such a force.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 35,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, is opposed
to a unilateral pullout of Israel from southern Lebanon and
sceptical about a subsequent U.N. peacekeeping there.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Gaoqi International Airport is located in the northeastern
part of Xiamen Island, opposite the Jinmen Islands, and is 12
kilometers from downtown.
</P>
<P>
Authorities note that the new airport will not only create good
transport conditions for Xiamen and the southern part of the
province, but is an early preparations for direct navigation
between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.

<P>
The airport will have an annual handling capacity of 12 million
passengers and be able to accommodate large aircraft, including
Boeing 747-400s, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Gaoqi International was built in 1982 on the site of the former
Gaoqi Airport, which was constructed before the founding of the
People's Republic of China, and began operations in 1983 with an
annual handling capacity of 350,000 passengers.

Taking the rare books printed in the Song Dynasty (960-1279)
for example, their value exceeds that of the entire collection of
books from the same period now kept in the libraries in the United
States, and most of them are the sole existing copies.
</P>
<P>
The Weng collection of rare books dates from Weng Xincun (1791-
1862) during the reign of Emperor Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911). Weng Xincun passed the highest imperial examinations
in 1822, and later was appointed as minister of the Board of Works
and the tutor of Emperor Tongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Weng purchased the collection from his countryman Chen Kui, a
well-known bibliophile at the time, and started the family
collection.
</P>
<P>
Chen Kui's collection (the Jiruilou collection) boasted "Bai
Song Yi Chan" books of Huang Pilie, one of the most important book
collections in the Qing Dynasty, famous hand-copied books, proof
books, and manuscripts of the Song and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties.
There were tens of thousands of these books
</P>
<P>
After Weng Xincun, his descendants handed down the book
collection.

<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the family collection was inherited by Weng Tongshu (
1810-1865), son of Weng Xincun, and preserved for four generations.
In the early 1950s, Weng Zhixi, the great-grandson of Weng Tongshu,
donated his collection to the Beijing Library, the predecessor of
the National Library.
</P>
<P>
Weng Tonghe (1830-1904), the youngest son of Weng Xincun, once
served as the tutor of Emperor Guangxu, and as tutor he often
visited the markets of Beijing, and collected many rare editions
including the block-printed edition of Ji Yun from the Song
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The major part of the family collection came into being during
this period of time. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Weng Tonghe'
s book collection was listed as one of "Nine Famous Collections"
of late Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the sons and grandsons of Weng Tonghe handed down
the collection for four generations. Weng Wan'ge, the son of his
great-grandson, is now in possession of the cream of the
collection.
</P>
<P>
Secretly treasured, the collection of Weng Tonghe is on a par
with the collection of the Xu Family in Dezhou in Shandong
Province, and that of Yuan Family in Xiangtan in Hunan Province.
These were also on the list of Nine Famous Collections of the late
Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, however, no traces could be found of part of
the Weng collection, including the block-printed edition of Ji Yun
from the Song Dynasty, which disappeared more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the collection was transferred to the descendants of
the Weng family, who emigrated to the United States in the 1930s
and 1940s to avoid the war in China. Most of the books are in fine
condition after six generations of careful preservation.

<P>
Though there were numerous famous book collections in China,
the Weng collection alone has survived historical vicissitudes.
Both the catalogue provided by the Weng family and the catalogue
published by the Eastern Library of Princeton University have
proved that this collection is undoubtedly the largest and best
preserved private collection left in possession of overseas
Chinese. It is also the most important book collection of the Qing
Dynasty abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Weng collection consists of block-printed editions of the
Song Dynasty (11 kinds), block-printed editions of the Yuan
Dynasty (four kinds), block-printed editions of the Ming Dynasty (
12 kinds), block-printed editions of the Qing Dynasty (26 kinds),
famous hand-copied books and manuscripts (27 kinds), and sole
existing copies and treasured private copies of rare books.
</P>
<P>
As these volumes remained unknown to the world a century ago,
the exhibition of the book collection in 1985 at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York greatly amazed the academic and
historical relics communities both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Its academic value far exceeds that of the collections of
American libraries, including the state library of the United
States and the Harvard Peking Library. The Weng collection has
attracted great attention from public and private institutions
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Through more than two years of laborious negotiations, in the
later half of 1999, China Guardian Auctions Co., Ltd. finally
obtained the consent of Weng Wan'ge, who agreed to send his 80
kinds of ancient editions back to China and authorized the company
to be the sole agent of a book auction.
</P>
<P>
This month, the Shanghai municipal government bought the books
and is preserving them in the Shanghai Library.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An Air Philippines flight from the
southern Philippine city of Cebu made an emergency landing shortly
after noon Friday at an airport here when its air-conditioning
system allegedly conked out, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA report said no one among the 60 passengers and
crewmembers of the Boeing 737-200 flight 2P-774 was hurt during
the emergency landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
</P>
<P>
However, the emergency landing caused almost an hour delay in
the departure and arrival of at least eight international flights.

40 p.m. a radio message from the pilot, Rey Galang, saying that
the air-conditioning system A on the plane was in trouble and

<HEADLINE> 150 Computer Virus Strikes Reported in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 cases of Chernobyl
computer virus strikes on Wednesday have been reported in
Singapore, Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dreaded Chernobyl virus struck again on Wednesday, its
first anniversary. TCS said a check with the Singapore Emergency
Response Team, SingCert, showed that 31 cases of virus attack were
reported and at computer company Hewlett Packard the number was
110.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard was quoted as saying that the number was much
lower this year because PC owners are probably more aware of the
virus attack. Hewlett Packard told a local newspaper that all
complaints from users were that their computers could not be
started up.
</P>
<P>
The damage this year was limited compared to the tens of
millions of computers paralyzed worldwide last year.
</P>
<P>
There are two strains of the Chernobyl or CIH virus. One
strikes on the 26th day of every month and the other on April 26
each year, the day of Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The computer is
either paralyzed or its data destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Projects Stressed in Ethnic Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Construction of infrastructure
projects has been highlighted to boost the development of
agriculture, energy and transport in the central China province of
Hunan, which is densely populated by ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
At a regular work conference of the province on ethnic affairs
held today in this capital city of Hunan Province, officials vowed
to accelerate the construction of infrastructure projects in
ethnic regions in order to help their economy.
</P>
<P>
The province is densely populated by Miao, Dong and Yao ethnic
groups, most of which live in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to building an irrigation system to
facilitate high-yield agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Research institutes in the province have set up a high-tech
demonstration park in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
in western Hunan to show local people how to grow high-quality
peanuts and kiwi fruit.
</P>
<P>
At the picturesque Zhangjiajie scenic resort, local ethnic
people have been organized into groups to raise milk cows and grow
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has approved 600 million yuan (about
72 million US dollars) for constructing hydro-power projects in
these ethnic regions. Some 900 million yuan (about 108 million US
dollars) will be spent on upgrading rural power-grid networks.

<P>
MACAO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Beginning from May the Macao Branch
of the Bank of China will join the Macao Branch of Portuguese
Banco Nacional Ultramarino to act as the cashier of the treasury
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>

government would have the right to decide whether the Portuguese
bank should continue to be cashier of the region's treasury.

After its inauguration on December 20 last year, the Macao SAR
government set up a special working group to study the tellership
of the regional treasury and put forward suggestions to the chief

<HEADLINE> China to Spend 220 million Yuan on Afforestation Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 220 million yuan
(about 27 million U.S. dollars) popularizing afforestation
technology to boost its ambitious drive to green its mostly arid
western regions, an forestry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China plans to turn more than 340,000 hectares of cultivated
land back to forest and more than 430,000 hectares of bare
mountains and lands in western China this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the harsh conditions in the areas make it extremely
difficult for trees and grass planted to survive, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration mapped out a program to
employ 187 items of technologies, which has received strong
financial support from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lieke, director of the SFA's Science and Technology
Department, said that investment in afforestation technology will
increase along with the growth of afforestation funds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the technology will raise the survival rate of
tress and grass planted in the western areas to more than 80
percent, and help establish a sound system of supervision and
management in afforestation.

<HEADLINE> China Reduces Early Rice Acreage by Nearly 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The acreage of early rice in
China is expected to drop more than 600,000 hectares this year,
down nearly 8 percent from last year, a recent survey by the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture indicates.
</P>
<P>
However, the acreage of quality early rice is expected to
increase dramatically to 3.53 million hectares, up 14 percent, or
650,000 hectares, over last year, accounting for some half of the
total early rice acreage.
</P>
<P>
An agriculture ministry official attributed the changes in the
early rice acreage mainly to the government's move to abandon
price protection for poor quality early rice while increase the
purchase price for quality rice.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature is
planning to make drastic changes in the Patent Law to better
protect inventors and in line with international treaties.
</P>
<P>
The Draft of the Amendment to the Patent Law was proposed to
the 15th meeting of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee for the first round of discussion.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the deepening reform and opening-up, new
problems have come to the surface in patent protection," said
Jiang Ying, administrator of the State Intellectual Property
Office.
</P>
<P>
She explained to the NPC Standing Committee that it is
necessary to make amendments to the Patent Law to promote the
active function of patent system in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Many experts in intellectual property rights protection agreed
that some regulations in the Patent Law can no longer meet the
needs of reform in state-owned enterprises and government
institutional reform.
</P>
<P>
For example, the examination and approval of patent
applications and the solving of patent disputes takes a long time
that the rights of patent owners cannot be protected promptly. (

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 foreign and Chinese
scholars today discussed the "third way" theory adopted by some
Western countries at a two-day international symposium -- "The
Challenges of 21st Century and The Third Way" -- organized by the
Institute of European Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Worldwide scholars must study perspectives of the "third way"
with a global view, Li Shenming, CASS vice-president, said at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In mid 1990s, some European and American countries started to
pursue the "third way" theory, which is different from the two
traditional ways for social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The "third way" theory has aroused interest among social
scientists around the world.
</P>
<P>
Some well-known experts from China, France, Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States delivered speeches at the
symposium.

According to regulations in the Agreements on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights issued by the World
Intellectual Property Organization, patent right includes that
other people are not allowed to "offer the sale of patent products
" without permission from the patent owner. "Offering for sale"
refers to the promise of selling products through advertisement or
putting products on display in shops or exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment also include punishing those who make
false declaration of patent that are not their own. The draft
includes regulations to simplify and improve patent application
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will be thrashed out at least twice before it
finally goes before the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Since the first patent was approved in 1985, China has received
more than one million patent applications.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Patent Law has played an important
role in encouraging inventions and innovations and promoting
foreign economic and technological exchanges.

Experts said that the amendment to the current Patent Law will
help create a better environment for China to enter the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Praises Health Education Campaign for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing sent a
letter today to a national teleconference on health education for
farmers, urging local governments at various levels to fully
understand the importance of this effort.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, especially those living in poor and remote areas,
still lack basic medical knowledge and live an outdated, unhealthy
life-style and he urged that more medical knowledge be made
available to them.
</P>
<P>
Farmers should be guided to advocate science and eliminate
superstition, develop a scientific and civilized life-style, and
consistently enhance their level of health, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide campaign, known as "National Health Education
Action for 900 Million Farmers," was launched in 1994 by the
National Committee for the Patriotic Public Health Campaign, the
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the then
Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television.
</P>
<P>
Since then, publicity activities of various kinds, including TV
broadcasts, posters, seminars, and exhibitions, have been
conducted throughout the country to increase farmers' awareness of
health and medicine.
</P>
<P>
At today's teleconference, a new leading group composed of
officials from the four old sponsors and three new sponsors
including the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Aid-
the-Poor Office of the State Council participated.

<HEADLINE> Rare Books Return to China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A batch of very rare Chinese
books, state treasures which have been lost for the past 150 years,
returned today to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
After one and a half centuries of secret preservation, the Weng
's family transferred the 542 precious ancient books, which had
been maintained by an insurance company in New York City for at
least 50 years, to the Shanghai Library.
</P>
<P>
Some of the block-printed books are first editions as well as
the only existing copies in the world, Qi Gong, chairman of the
National Committee for Cultural Relics Authentication and
Preservation (NCCRAP), said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them have extremely high academic value," said Qi,
also director of the Central Research Institute of Culture and
History.
</P>
<P>
"With reference to the state classification for cultural relics,
many books from the Weng's collection are state treasures which
have never been seen in the world's libraries, including China's
National Library," said Ji Shuying, senior member of the NCCRAP
who has studied rare Chinese books all his life.
</P>
<P>
"Scholars have wondered about the existence of Weng's
collection for more than 100 years," said Fu Xinian, son of a
famous bibliophile and also a senior member of the NCCRAP.
</P>
<P>
Some 79 books, including a block-printed edition of Ji Yun from
the Song Dynasty (960-1279), are the only existing copies in the
world, and remain in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The major part of the Weng's collection was accumulated by Weng
Tonghe (1830-1904), tutor of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911).

<TEXT>
<P>
After generations of preservation, Weng Wan'ge, the son of Weng
Tonghe's great-grandson, is now in the possession of the cream of
the collection.
</P>
<P>
Through two years of laborious negotiations, China Guardian
Auctions Co., Ltd. in late 1999 obtained the consent of the
octogenarian Weng, who agreed to send his ancient editions back to
China, and authorized the company to be the sole agent of the book
auction.
</P>
<P>
Roughly half a century ago, Weng Wan'ge transported the Weng's
collection from Shanghai to the United States as war raged in
China.
</P>
<P>
As these volumes remained unknown to the world, the exhibition
of the books in 1985 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
greatly amazed the academic and historical relics communities
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The books' academic value far exceeds the collections of
American libraries, including the state library of the United
States and the Harvard Peking Library.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Chinese scholars Ren Jiyu, Wang Shixiang, and Jin
Chongji have appealed to the government many times to buy back the
rare books.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government finally bought them at a cost
of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, the state bought 102 kinds of precious
ancient books from a Hong Kong collector.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Guardian company auctioned off the only extant
copy of another block-printed book of the Song Dynasty, which was
obtained by a Chinese organization with a bid of 1.33 million yuan
(160,240 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lifts Ban on Food Staffs to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman has disclosed that Washington, in the past few days, lifted
the ban imposed on railway spare parts and food stuffs to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Washington has increasing concerns in Khartoum and Khartoum has
increasing concerns in Washington, which we should consider through
a balanced dialogue", he added while speaking to reporters on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Osman called on Washington to be impartial so as to
help boost the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's foreign policy has always been transparent, clear,
realistic and unbiased, he stressed, terming the Sudanese ties with
its neighboring African, and Arab, Asian and European countries
as " very good ", mutually beneficial, normalization-oriented and
interference-void.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies reported recently that the U.S. embassy in
Khartoum, which closed down since February 1996 after Sudan failed
to hand over convicts of the abortive assassination attempt in
Addis Ababa of Ethiopia against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
resumed work as of last week.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, U.S. sent a diplomatic mission to Khartoum to
take charge of its affairs in Sudan, which had been handled by the
American embassy in Nairobi since l996. But the mission was stalled
in the wake of the terrorist attacks on U.S embassies in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam in August 1998 which killed 12 American nationals
among 224 others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the U.S. launched air raids on an alleged
chemical factory near Khartoum said to be owned by Saudi
millionaire Usama Bin Laden, the acclaimed sponsor of anti-American
actions.
</P>
<P>
Washington, moreover, accused Sudan of fomenting terrorism while
it disagreed to Khartoum policy in the southern conflict between
the Muslim majority and the Christian and heathen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and his U.S.
counterpart Bill Clinton exchanged messages on bilateral detente.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Dispatch Its Own Mideast Envoy: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Middle East Envoy will
be dispatched to the region next week to push forward the
deadlocked peace talks between Israel and Syria, Israel Radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, Nikolai Kartuzov, will meet with government
officials in Jerusalem, Beirut and Damascus, the report quoted
Russia's Ambassador to Israel Mikhail Bogdanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before his meeting with Israel's Foreign
Ministry Director General Eytan Bentsur, the ambassador hoped that
the traditionally good relations between Russia and Syria will
facilitate the work of the envoy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks resumed last December after a 45-month
stalemate, but only to hit a snag again in January after two rounds
of talks in the United States failed to resolve their disputes over
the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Kartuzov will join a force of special envoys sent by major world
powers or organizations, such as U.N. Envoy Terje Larsen, who is
currently visiting the region, U.S Special Coordinator Dennis Ross,
who is due to arrive in Israel this weekend to oversee the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks in Eilat; and European Union Envoy Miguel
Moratinos, who has been conducting shuttle diplomacy between the
Mideast countries in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
This move, according to geostrategic analysts here, shows that
Russia is trying to regain its influence in the Middle East region.
Since it co-sponsored the Madrid peace conference with the U.S. in
1991, Russia attempted and accomplished few things in the peace
tracks.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the United States, which provides military and
economic aid to relevant countries as "peace dividend," has been
the dominant power in the region.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries, however, have kept complaining that the U.
S. is too partial to Israel regarding the peace issues. In
contrast, these countries regard Russia as a traditional ally with
more fair stands.
</P>
<P>
In this strategic concept, Russia co-organized with Americans
the first Mideast multinational talks in more than three years in
Moscow this February.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that Russia is inclined to selling its
advanced arms to Arab countries, to counter-balance the enormous
military aid Israel received from Washington in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Russian newspaper revealed earlier in the month that Russia is
expected to conclude a 500 million U.S. dollars arms deal with
Syria to modernize its forces, including providing 30 Sukhoi-27
fighters and possibly the very advanced long-range S-300 air
defense missile system.
</P>
<P>
However, Bogdanov categorically denied the reports on Friday.

of unexploded ordnance.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Still Susceptible if Politics not Stable: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Indonesian
Central Bank (BI) Syahril Sabirin said here Friday that the
Indonesian currency of rupiah is still susceptible if the country'
s political condition remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
"the strength of rupiah depends upon the confidence and the
confidence depends upon the political stability which is created
by the government," Sabirin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah dropped to a six months low against the U.S. dollars
on Thursday, hitting 8,005 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the falling of rupiah to the slow progress
of the government's program for economic restructuring within the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
But Acting Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Stanley Fisher was optimistic that the rupiah would regain
strength if the Indonesian government continues to carry out the
economic reform program it has announced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of the National Economic Council (DEN)
Anggito Abimanyu said that the weakening of the rupiah was caused
by a negative market sentiment following the removal of two
cabinet ministers on Tuesday by President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
But he further said that market reaction will not be permanent,
saying that the stability of the rupiah was absolutely depends
upon the government.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the country's battered financial market
took another beating recently as doubts over the government unity
and economic competence sent the rupiah and stocks sliding to
their lowest level within six months.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Stocks dropped 1.7 percent to 510.24 points on
Wednesday morning trade session, their lowest level since late
September.
</P>
<P>
Both stocks and the rupiah have now lost all the gains they
made in the aftermath of Wahid's October election which marked
Indonesia's transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah on Friday traded at 7,850 per U.S. dollars (buying)
and 8,000 per dollars (selling).

<HEADLINE> Ghana Takes Measures to Deal with Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Finance Minister Kwame
Peprah, faced with mounting pressure to arrest the rapid fall of
the west African country' s currency cedi, has outlined short and
long-term measures to address the shortage of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Peprah told a press conference in Ghana's capital Accra on
Thursday that all buyers of foreign exchange in Ghana would now be
required to provide identification which will be processed for
records at the Central Bank, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides, no single individual or company will be allowed to
purchase more than 2,000 dollars in a single transaction or on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it would be an offence for any foreign
exchange bureau to pay at exchange rates different from those
advertised on their notice boards.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian currency has suffered a steep plunge against the
major currencies, resulting in a sharp rise in prices of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
For example the dollar was exchanged at 2,400 cedis in March
1999 is selling at more than 5,000 cedis in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Peprah who blamed the problem partly on the craving by
Ghanaians for imported goods, said a special tax will be slapped
on identified non- essential imported items in addition to other
stern measures to prohibit dumping by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision for public institutions to buy
Made-in-Ghana products currently restricted to the civil service
is to be extended to the entire public sector.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said all retained export earnings are to be repatriated
into Ghana and kept in Ghanaian registered bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
He said government would get tougher on an existing law that
prohibits travellers from taking out foreign exchange of more than
3,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the initiatives announced in this year's
budget to set up a Parliamentary Oversight Committee on the
performance of revenue collecting agencies with special powers to
deal with delinquent or corrupt officials, and the establishment
of a special task force to plug revenue loopholes, will be
immediately implemented.
</P>
<P>
He charged all revenue collecting agencies to mount "pay your
tax" campaigns and asked them to submit proposals for expanding
their tax bases within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On cutting government expenditure, Peprah said restrictions on
the use of mobile phones by public officials, participation in
overseas conferences and the proposed 25 percent cut in fuel
allocation to ministers and other government officials, are all
to be rigidly enforced.

In his diary, Shiro claimed that the man who sued him took part
in war crimes, including one particularly horrific incident in
which he forced a Chinese civilian into a sack soaked in petrol
fastened with hand grenades. He then ignited the sack and kicked
it into a pond in front of what was then Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents has showed that the invasion of Japanese
troops in 1937 injured and killed 35 million Chinese people.

The Nanjing Massacre is believed to be one of the biggest

</P>
<P>
"China demanded no compensations from Japan after winning the
eight-year anti-invasion war, but Japan's right-wing forces tried
again and again to deny historical facts," Shiro said. "Japan lost
not only the war, but also its morality and justice."
</P>

Huang Hua, former Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier said
today that he will go to UN Commission On Human Rights to disclose
outrages made by Japanese troops in China 63 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, 88, was a soldier in the Japanese army that
occupied Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In
the following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians.
</P>

He recorded the atrocities in a secret diary published in 1996.
He was then sued by a former soldier named in it who was described
as a war criminal. Earlier this year, Shiro was convicted by the
Japanese Supreme Court.

<P>
"I will not give up my struggle, I will continue to appeal for
worldwide support for justice and truth through the UN," Shiro
said today at a gathering sponsored by the China Human Right
Development Foundation.

that being loyal was more important than our lives," he told some
one hundred Chinese scholars, officials and journalists attending

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World Biggest Container Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world
biggest container producer, with its output sharing 70 percent of
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by an international shipping research
organization show that China produced 1.06 million TEUs last year,
compared with the world gross output of 1.35 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The production of southeastern Asian countries and West
European countries in 1999 reached 132,000 TEUs and 96,000 TEUs
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that the significant increase of China's
container production resulted from the rapid development of China'
s container shipping over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
China's container shipping industry has kept a 30-percent
growth in business annually since the early 1990s, partly
attributable to the country's rapid development in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The country now has more than 150 shipping companies dealing
with container transport, which are equipped with more than 600
ships and 300,000 TEUs.

<HEADLINE> Has E-commerce Spring Arrived? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Has E-commerce arrived in China?
The latest issue of the country's most authoritative news weekly "
Outlook" provides some answers.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the cold spring of this year, E-commerce has been
very hot in the Chinese capital of Beijing, with one meeting after
another devoted to the topic.
</P>
<P>
Some people have even gone so far as to acclaim that the spring
of China's E-commerce has already arrived, said an article in the
May 1 issue of the magazine, which is to hit newsstands early next
week.
</P>
<P>
The article related that over the past two years, Internet
fever in China has shifted from pursuance of portals, to hits and
to E-commerce of the present.
</P>
<P>
More and more companies have announced their plans to plunge
into the E-commerce. So far, the number of Chinese companies that
intend to do business-to-commerce (B-to-C) on the Internet have
grown to over 500 from about 100 in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth China International E-commerce Summit held in
Beijing recently, Song Ling, director of the Information Promotion
Department of the Ministry of Information Industry, poured some
cold water on the B-to-C fever.
</P>
<P>
Chinese E-commerce companies should, first of all, focus their
capital and personnel on the business-to-business, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Has E-commerce Spring Arrived? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The view was shared by some companies, since the business-to-
business (B-to-B) style of E-commerce will avoid the existing
bottlenecks of Internet authentication, payment and delivery.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the current fever of E-commerce in China
is, to a large extent, limited to the academic circles of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics suggested that only about one in a thousand
Chinese enterprises have gone onto the Internet and the number of
domain names owned by businesses have grown to only 48,000.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Ministry of Information
Industry, the E-commerce in China can only be said to have entered
into a stage of preliminary development, while problems such as
poor awareness of the importance of E-commerce, lack of business
and legal infrastructures permeate.
</P>
<P>
The article held that it is imperative for the government to
make clear its intentions as soon as possible as to how the E-
commerce should develop, if E-commerce is to grow in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government should also put into place laws and regulations
on how E-commerce is to be taxed, the criteria of on-line payment
and delivery, as well as the security of information and the
Internet, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Support Efforts to Enter WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislators, who are
here attending the 15th session of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), have voiced their support in the
government's efforts to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At today's panel discussions, top lawmakers including Li Peng,
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, deliberated the report on
the progress of China's bid for entry into the WTO, which was
delivered on May 25 by Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation on behalf of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The speakers fully confirmed and supported the government's
efforts over the past more than 13 years for resuming the status
as a founding nation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
and joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Last November's signing of the Sino-US agreement on China's
entry into the WTO was of great importance to China's early
accession to the WTO and promoting economic and trade development
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
China's entry will make the WTO the world's largest
multilateral organization and boost global trade and the
establishment and improvement of a new world trade system.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmakers reached a consensus that being underdeveloped,
China could only join the WTO with the status of a developing
nation. China must adhere to the principle of maintaining balance
between rights and duties and follow the principle of opening up
the market gradually to safeguard China's economic security and
state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO will also benefit the country's
reforms, economic development and the promotion of economic and
trade relations with foreign countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Budget Austerity to Bite into Turkish Defense Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Public and financial pressures have
prompted Ankara to postpone one of its major defense industry
projects, the co-production of third generation main battle tanks
(MBTs) valued at approximately seven billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project was originally scheduled to be finalized in the
selection of tender winner on July 14, but it will be delayed
another four months, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are testing the competing tanks. Since they are not
configured in the way Turkey wants them to be, we need enough time
to make a thorough assessment of the results of the trials to see
whether the tanks will meet our requirements, " a defense industry
source said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a four-month postponement from July to November, the
source said that the final selection may even slip into early 2001.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that shortages in financing for the MBT scheme,
rather than technical evaluations are behind the delay.
</P>
<P>
As in the case of the nuclear power plant deferred several
times, major defense projects in Turkey are expected to fall victim
to budget austerity which has stemmed from a stand-by agreement
between Turkey and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has to abide by IMF principles to pursue a strict
economic program, including the dropping of a chronic high
inflation in the country, over three years until 2002 in exchange
for loans by the global financial organization.
</P>
<P>
The military spending has been a source of high inflation that
is running at a high of 65 percent annually. Turkey has suspended
until the end of June the tender for its 4-billion-dollar-cost
attack helicopter project, which several big western munitioners
are competing for.

LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA will take no action against Leeds after Galatasaray striker
Hakan Sukur was hit with a coin during their UEFA Cup semi-final
tie at Elland Road.
</P>
<P>
Both legs of the tie were marred by violent incidents,
including the stabbing deaths of two Leeds fans in Istanbul and
unrest before the return leg at the West Yorkshire club.
</P>
<P>
Hakan Sukur, a Turkish international, fell to the ground after
apparently being struck by an object thrown from the crowd during
the second half of the match, which ended in a 4-2 aggregate
victory for Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
It had been suggested that Leeds could receive a fine or ban
over the incident.
</P>
<P>
But Slovakian referee Lubos Michel made no mention of the
incident in his match report, despite being handed the coin by
Hakan Sukur.
</P>
<P>
"The incident wasn't mentioned in any of the three official
reports we got and we have not heard either from Galatasaray on
the subject," a UEFA spokesman told The Express newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The transfer of PSV Eindhoven
striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to Manchester United is in serious
doubt after a training ground injury to the player.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, Van Nistelrooy reportedly broke
down in training on Friday, suggesting that his proposed 18.5
million pounds British record transfer might now fall through.
</P>
<P>
The move was put on hold on Thursday after the Dutch star
failed to meet demands concerning further fitness tests on his
right knee.It is understood that the same injury has now recurred.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday afternoon, the English
champions said: "Manchester United is very disappointed that the
transfer of Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV Eindhoven cannot proceed
at the present time."
</P>
<P>
The statement continued: "As reported on Tuesday further tests
were necessary for Manchester United to proceed with the transfer.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions that have been held between all parties failed
to reach agreement as to the extent of these tests and, as a
result of these differences in opinion, we cannot proceed at the
present time."
</P>
<P>
PSV and Van Nistelrooy were unhappy about United's conditions
because they felt they might hamper the player's rehabilitation in
time for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Neither party has yet commented on the latest injury to Van
Nistelrooy.

<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit welcomed on Thursday the
result of the first round of the presidential election with Sezer
winning 281 votes, saying that "it's expected that the votes would
be dispersed in the first round. But Sezer's score is promising.
I'am optimistic."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba conferred Thursday
evening with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his
accompanying delegation to participate in the second session of the
Egyptian-Zambian Committee held in Lusaka early in the day.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting with Chiluba, Moussa dispatched a
message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on bilateral
relations and the African affairs.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif Thursday said
that Egypt will celebrate the second anniversary of launching its

</P>
<P>
"This project along with other gigantic media projects ushered

Sharif said in statements on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Sudanese Education Minister Abdel Baset Abdel Maged has

</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:

Mubarak's political advisor.

<HEADLINE> Four SLA Soldiers Killed in Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Four soldiers of the Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and another three injured in
Hezbollah's suicide attacks in south lebanon Friday morning,
Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were part of the fiercest attacks the guerrilla
group launched in years on Israeli troops and their military ally
SLA in south Lebanon Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah staged the suicide attacks on the position of
Aramta in the central sector of the occupied zone. It was reported
that Hezbollah occupied Aramta and destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
In the attacks, Hezbollah raided 26 Israeli and SLA's positions
alongside the border with Katyushas and bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio admitted that one Israeli soldier was wounded in
Hezbollah's raids.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes retaliated at 0800 a.m. local time with four
air raids in the region of Iglem Tufaah and at 1000 a.m. local time
in Jabal Suyout.
</P>
<P>
Retaliation attacks between the Israeli troops and Lebanese
resistance guerrillas intensified after Israel formally notified
the United Nations that it will pull out its troops from south
Lebanon by July after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has stressed that his country
will harshly retaliate if the resistance continues firing Katyushas
to northern Israel or causes any casualties after its withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a war of attrition aimed to oust the Israeli forces
from the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia-Australia-East Timor Meeting Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The venue (of the meeting) could be in Kupang (capital of
Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province), Dili (capital of East
Timor) or Darwin (Australia)," Wahid told reporters after an one-
hour meeting with the visiting East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao said he will convey Wahid's proposal to Australian Prime
Minister John Howard during their upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his support for the Wahid administration's efforts
to establish democracy in Indonesia and recognized the country's
need for international aid.
</P>
<P>
"I stayed in Jakarta for seven years and more or less, I know
some of the problems of Indonesia. East Timor, which has a
population of 800,000 needs international aid. Indonesia, with a
population of 200 million, also needs help," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao, who was jailed in East Jakarta for seven years, came
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said his present visit to Jakarta, his second, was made to
strengthen East Timor's relations with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony for more than 400 years. On
August 30 last year, more than 400,000 East Timorese took part in
a U.N.-sponsored ballot and overwhelmingly voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
The territory is now under U.N. administration, before getting
a full independence.

<HEADLINE> Manila Foresees Lower Rice production for 1st  Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that due to natural disasters, rice and corn production for
the first quarter of this year may be lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara told reporters that the
cause of poor production in paddy during the planting season
between October 1999 to March 2000 was due to natural calamities
such as the eruption of Mayon volcano, whose 7,037 hectares of
rice land were hit by ashfall.
</P>
<P>
According to Angara, flashfloods in southern Mindanao and the
Caraga region in mid-February until early March also adversely
affected over 20,000 hectares of paddy growing areas, which
contributed to the overall reduction in palay yield.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, National Food Authority (DFA) said it is expecting a 5.
4 million metric tons (MT) of rice production for the first
quarter of this year, which is lower than the 5.7 million MT rice
requirement of the country for the same period.
</P>
<P>
NFA Deputy Administrator Gregorio an bared that President
Joseph Estrada has approved for the importation of some 300,000 MT
of rice to fill-in the shortfall of about 350,000 MT of rice this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Tan said, despite poor production of rice in the first
quarter, the government is targeting paddy production to reach 12.
5 million MT this year which is higher than last year's record of
11.8 million MT.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Address Problem of War-affected Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) have committed to addressing the
problem of war-affected children, Ghana News Agency reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a declaration entitled "ECOWAS and the Protection
of War- Affected Children" which was released in Ghana's capital
Accra Thursday at the beginning of a two-day ministerial
conference on the war-affected children in West Africa, the
foreign ministers identified problems facing children after
conflicts as deprivation of education, training and culture, which
make them less productive to society.
</P>
<P>
They have therefore called on all parties involving in wars in
the region to immediately demobilize children below the age of 18
in their custody, allow them access to appropriate reintegration
structures made available by ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed efforts being made to build and strengthen
drug control capabilities of countries such as Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Guinea Bissau, where drug abuse was identified as major
consequences of the armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> ILO Says 90 Percent of World Workforce Not Covered by Pension Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 90 percent of the world's
working-age population is not covered by pension schemes capable
of providing adequate retirement income, the International Labor
Organization (ILO) said in a report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bad management of many of the existing pension schemes makes
matters worse and renders much of the world's population exposed
to the risk of poverty after retirement, said the ILO in its
report -- Social Security Pensions: Development and Reform.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said that even where the coverage is nearly universal
and the schemes are well managed, as in the advanced
industrialized countries of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly North American and
Western European countries and Japan and Australia, major problems
in financing pensions will arise in the coming years as
populations age and as countries seek to diversify the risk to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
"OECD countries already spend an average 10 percent of their
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on old-age retirement benefits, which
exceeds their total spending on health care," said Colin Gillion,
ILO Director of the Social Security Department and editor of the
report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OECD pension plans are "generally excellent,
but expensive," adding that the best way to deal with aging
populations is to delay the age of retirement and to increase the
number of women in employment.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report finds that the U.S. pension system, and to a
lesser extent, that of the United Kingdom, carries more risk for
its members than those of West European countries, because the U.S.
and UK systems rely more heavily on occupational- and privately-
funded schemes rather than complete government financing.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the pensions schemes in other parts of the world,
the ILO report said that schemes in countries of the former Soviet
Union have become practically worthless with the collapse of
national economies.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the schemes in general are very weak and badly
managed. Those in Asia have been weakened by the continent's
financial turmoil in late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Retirement schemes in Arab States and the Middle East are
relatively young and face major problems in dealing with the high
percentage of foreign employees who are not permitted to join the
schemes.
</P>
<P>
Many schemes in Latin America and the Caribbean are performing
poorly, with at least eight countries converting their schemes to
other systems, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Index Closes Below 18,000 in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange closed below 18,000 Friday for the first time
in six months.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section lost 45.47 points, or 0.25 percent, from Thursday's close
to end at 17,973.70.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, however, added 4.65 points, or 0.28
percent, to 1,648.87.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 612.95 million
shares from Thursday's 542.32 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Overall trading was sluggish as investors stayed on the
sidelines ahead of Japan's Golden Week holiday season, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market will open only on Monday and Tuesday
next week.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the course on Wall Street made the Nikkei
index move in a volatile manner, traders said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Asia Basketball Super
League (ABSL) is set to be staged in June and July, it was
announced here Friday by Carl Men Ky Ching, president and chairman
of the board of the Asian Basketball Association (ABA).
</P>
<P>
The 2000 ABA is sure to excite local fervor in basketball all
over the region as five All-Star teams and one American NBA team
participate in one of Asia's most anticipated sports events.
</P>
<P>
The NBA team, named NBA Ambassadors, is composed of reigning
NBA players and this is the first time that a NBA team enters a
Asian basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
The competition is to begin its operation on June 8 and end on
July 13.
</P>
<P>
But unlike NBA, ABSL, sanctioned by the Asian Basketball
Confederation, is comprised of different teams from Asia rather
than from different national and regional teams.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it will be more exciting for Asian basketball fans
from different countries and regions to watch the league and
support their teams.
</P>
<P>
There will be six teams representing countries and regions from
China, Korea, Japan, Chinese Taipei, China's Hong Kong and NBA
Ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The six teams will first play in a four round regular season
and the two best-placed teams of the regular season will play for
the winning trophy under the best of three series format in
Beijing and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> China Imports 500,000 Tons of Fertilizer from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest agricultural
production company signed a contract with the U.S. Phoschem in
Beijing today to buy 500,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The China National Agricultural Production Group Corporation
said it will import chemical fertilizer to meet the domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation(MOFTEC), said at the signing ceremony that the United
States has long been China's major chemical fertilizer provider,
and he expected the two nations to improve their trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-U.S. trade will provide a lot of business opportunities,
which will benefit both China and the United States," Long said.
</P>
<P>
Eugene Martin, Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. Embassy,
hopes that the signing of this contract will bring about more open
trade in fertilizer business.
</P>
<P>
Phosphate fertilizer is a scarce commodity in China's domestic
market. The import of 500,000 tons of high-quality fertilizer
should satisfy the needs of the country, according to the All-
China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
A ton of phosphate fertilizer costs about 170 U.S. dollars on
the international market.

<P>
China has had considerable international competitiveness in
building large telecommunications facilities, the spokesman said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up rational and
sustainable development of both conventional and renewable energy
sources to meet the country's growing demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Energy Research Society (CERS), China is
carrying out a series of energy reforms focusing on developing
natural gas and electricity in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Energy industry will vigorously develop petroleum, gas and
nuclear power and other new and renewable energy sources, said a
senior expert with CERS
</P>
<P>
He noted China will launch a series of strategic drives in the
next century. In the coal sector, the focus of production will be
shifted to China's western region. Efforts will be made to expand
the Shenfu and Dongsheng coal fields between Shaanxi and Inner
Mongolia, and improve coal transportation.
</P>
<P>
The country will speed up the construction of terraced
hydropower stations in river valleys and the construction of power
stations near coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In developing the petroleum industry, priority will be given to
oil and gas exploration in western China and in offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
In this way, a network of energy-supply bases will be set up
nationwide. Namely, Sichuan, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region and
Xinjiang will focus on gas development. Petroleum will be largely
produced by the major oilfields of Daqing, Shengli and Xinjiang as
well as the offshore oilfields.

<HEADLINE> Hotline Helps Deal with Complaint Against Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 26,000 complaints
against policemen have been registered by China's police watchdog
in the first 50 days since a hotline was used by Chinese police to
handle complaints from the public to improve their services.
</P>
<P>
Sun Mingshan, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security,
told reporters today that 3,348 complaints, or 13 percent of the
total, are justified.
</P>
<P>
Most of the complaints center on abuse of power, improper use
of police cars and improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
On March 1 this year police registered a special telephone
number -- 110 -- for the general public to voice their complaints
about policeman in efforts to improve the 1.5 million policemen's
performance in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The 110 number was first introduced in the 1950s in China by
the police to accept reports from the public for emergency help.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 policemen will be fired each year if they do not
improve their performance, according to a decision announced last
February by the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Israel Updates 2000 Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid increased export
expectations, Israel has updated its economic growth target for
2000 to 3.5-4 percent from the initial three percent.
</P>
<P>
The new figure, however, is still significantly lower than the
pace set from April last year, when growth accelerated at an
astonishing eight percent, the local newspaper Jerusalem Post
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A 3.5 percent growth rate, said the report, means that
unemployment should settle at roughly 8.7 percent in annual terms
this year -- effectively ending four consecutive years of growth in
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate could be even lower during the fourth quarter
of the year. Unemployment last year hit 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most economists believed that the government's initial three
percent forecast was much too low, as they targeted the 3.5-4
percent range. The international Monetary Fund last week said that
it expects the Israeli growth to reach 3.8 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Vered Dar, deputy-director of the Israeli
Treasury's Macroeconomics Department, as saying there has been good
indicators since the second quarter last year, showing a very
promising trend of growth.
</P>
<P>
The economic official, however, cautioned against being over
optimistic about such predictions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli industrial exports enjoyed an encouraging growth rate in
the first quarter of the year after a slowdown in the second half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Manufactures Association earlier this
week said that the country's export, excluding diamonds, was up 5.5
percent (4.57 billion U.S. dollars) during January-March compared
to the previous quarter, and a nine-percent rise on the 1999
average.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan is to convene a
session of the Security Council in the middle of next month to
decide on international peacekeeping efforts in south Lebanon after
the Israel Defense Forces' July pullout.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said Thursday Annan will by then
receive a full report from his special envoy, Terje Larsen, on his
current visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan is to recommend how the U.N. will fulfill its mandate in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, accompanied by senior officials, cartographers, lawyers
and experts from U.N. headquarters in New York, met Thursday night
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, following lengthy talks
earlier in the day with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's ultra-orthodox religious Shas party's mentor Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef is refusing to meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak unless
he gets solid assurances on the party's educational network and its
private radio stations, a senior Shas figure said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of a meeting with Rabbi Yosef, Barak Thursday had to
make do with a three-hour conversation with Shas chairman Eli
Yishai, and two members of Shas's policy-making Council of Torah
Sages. Two-thirds of the meeting was devoted to a survey of the
peace process by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the left-wing Meretz parliamentary faction decided
Thursday to leave the government if Barak transfers funds to Shas,
contrary to the Meretz-controlled Education Ministry guidelines.
</P>
<P>
But Meretz said it would stay in the coalition "for a specified
time" in order to support the peace process, and in any event its
support for peace was assured. Meretz said it will hold Barak
responsible for any developments in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security cabinet's Thursday morning meeting focused
on the withdrawal form Lebanon, with senior IDF officers offering a
series of withdrawal scenarios. No decisions were understood to
have been taken on the issue, however.
</P>
<P>
Amos Malka, director of Military Intelligence, and his research
section head Amos Gilad said Iran and Syria, reportedly the backers
of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, have an interest in continuing
hostilities against Israel, and none in seeing quiet along the
northern border.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence officers told the ministers that the main arm
of hostility to Israel will continue to be Hezbollah, operating
directly or under cover of Palestinian groups. Its main target will
be IDF soldiers, though civilians along the northern border could
also be hit because of the intertwined civilian and military
network in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Major General Moshe Ya'alon was named the next IDF deputy
Chief of General Staff on Thursday, replacing Major General Uzi
Dayan. Ya'alon is expected to assume the post in September.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon, currently top officer in Central Command, will be
replaced by Major General Yitzhak Eitan, who was until recently
Commander of Judea and Samaria. Eitan is to replace Ya'alon in the
coming months, the IDF spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
These moves were recommended by Chief of General Staff Shaul
Mofaz. Barak, who is also Defense Minister, approved the
appointments.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Trade Registers Deficit with U.S., Japan and EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus had a crude trade deficit
of more than 190.0 million Cyprus pounds (323.0 million U.S.
dollars) in its business dealings with the U.S. during 1999, the
Financial Weekly newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Imports from the U.S. during the year totalled 212.5 million
pounds (361.3 million dollars), while total exports reached a mere
21.8 million pounds (37.1 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The imbalance left a crude deficit of 190.7 million pounds (324.
2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of the American products were reexported.
Only 90.4 million pounds (153.7 million dollars) worth of imports
from the U.S. were for home consumption.
</P>
<P>
Trade with Japan was also heavily tripped against Cyprus. Japan
sold the island commodities valued at 132.6 million pounds (225.4
million dollars), while not taking even 1.0 million pounds (1.7
million dollars) worth of Cyprus products.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) continued to be the the main source of
supply of goods to Cyprus, accounting for 57.3 percent of the
country's total imports.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' exports to the EU reached 217.1 million pounds (369.1
million dollars), constituting 40 percent of its total exports. The
gap was a huge 819.6 million pounds (1,393.3 million dollars) in
favor of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The island had a favorable account in its trade with Arab
countries. Imports from Arab countries reached 91.4 million pounds
(160.0 million dollars) while exports amounted to 113.6 million
pounds (193.1 million dollars).

provides a single gateway to up-to-date information on important
health topics, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, children's
health and related information on health services.
</P>
<P>
"Whether people are looking for information on a particular
health topic or interested in finding information on important
life events such as pregnancy, they can now find what they are
looking for in one place," he said.
</P>

All the information on the site is subject to a rigorous
quality assurance process and is assessed by medical experts and
consumer representatives, he added.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Calls for Meeting with Howard, Gusmao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Friday took a step to mend his country's strained relations
with Australia by calling for a three-way meeting with Prime
Minister John Howard and East Timorese leader Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, the Australian Asociated Press (AAP) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking just days after Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi
Shihab announced a delay in Wahid's first trip to Australia, Wahid
said the planned meeting could take place in Australia, Indonesia
or East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The call came less than a day after Howard's widely reported
comments that relations between the two countries may never be the
same after the freeze that set in following the post-ballot
violence in East Timor, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Canberra for talks with Howard next week,
Gusmao will bring the message that Wahid wants to discuss issues
affecting the triangular relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I have proposed to Xanana Gusmao to talk with Howard when he
meets him in Canberra on the possibility of the three of us having
a meeting either in Darwin or Kupang or somewhere else that we
agree on," Wahid told reporters after a meeting with Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
"I would like the three countries to cooperate for mutual
interest and the benefit of the three nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shihab's announcement on Monday that Wahid's visit would be
delayed was seen as a snub by many Australian observers, the AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who is on a visit to France, said on Thursday he was
not surprised Wahid's trip had been postponed as it would take
time to repair the damage done over East Timor.

"President Putin will be visiting India in the first 10 days of
October," Mishra told the press here after he signed with his
Russian counterpart Sergei Ivanov a protocol on cooperation
between the Security Councils of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who is now President-elect of the Russian Federation,
will formally take his office in May.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to the visit. The agreement on
strategic partnership between Russia and India will give concrete
substance to the relationship and make it truly a relationship of
partners and allies," said Ivanov, secretary of the Russian
National Security Council, who arrived here on Wednesday for a two-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
Besides the joint declaration on strategic partnership, Putin
and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would also sign a
number of important documents during their Summit, said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov has met Vajpayee, Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh and Defense Minister George Fernandes and held talks
with Mishra during his stay.
</P>
<P>
The protocol signed Friday would be beneficial to security of
both countries, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would exchange information on issues concerning
strategic stability in the world, including development of nuclear
weapons, anti-ballistic missile systems and other missile
technologies, Ivanov told the press.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Encourages Commercial Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has stressed the need to improve commercial agriculture to
eradicate poverty, local newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to get rid of abject poverty by improving the
agricultural sector," Vice President Omar Ali Juma said at the
beginning of a three-day inspecting tour of the rural districts of
the Dar es Salaam Region on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He called upon small-scale farmers to come together and prepare
to secure loans for their agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
"The government can no longer provide agricultural subsidy, but
will create an enabling environment for small-scale farmers to
secure capital through loans to facilitate production in the
agricultural sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma also urged small-scale farmers to employ the experts
posted to various localities so as to double their outputs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he assured Tanzanians that with the implementation
of the debt relief program recently approved by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the government is going to
invest heavily in social services and the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Poor budgetary allocation for the agricultural sector,
resulting from the withdrawal of input subsidies in mid 1990s,
caused a steady decline in the production of food and cash crops.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is Tanzania's economic backbone, employing over 80
percent of the estimated 31 million population.
</P>
<P>
The sector earns over 70 percent of Tanzania's foreign exchange
while contributing about 50 percent to the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Dismal performance in the agricultural sector has intensified
poverty. The 1999 UN Human Development Report says 51 percent of
Tanzanians live on less than one U.S. dollar per day.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Drafts Criminal Law Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has drafted
a radical bill designed to harmonize penalties relating to sexual
offences, curb police torture and facilitate quick disposals of
criminal cases, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Law Amendment Bill, already received Cabinet
approval, is expected to be published by Attorney-General Amos
Wako before next week.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes that those convicted of rape be sentenced to
life imprisonment, and torture and canning of prisoners will be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
The bill examines a total of 95 areas related to the Penal
Code, Evidence Act and Prevention of Corruption Act. Most of the
draconian and dehumanizing laws and practises are to be scrapped
and replaced.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes that confessions by suspects be done in an
open court, and that any confession done to police will not be
acceptable in court.
</P>
<P>
If the bill sails through parliament, then corporal punishment,
a form of punishment universally considered outdated, degrading
and inhuman, will be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, newspapers which break the privacy rule
by publishing stories of defilement and rape should face a fine of
500,000 shillings (around 6,750 U.S. dollars), while anyone who
spreads a report of the case is liable to a fine of 10,000
shillings (around 1,350 dollars).

<HEADLINE> New Treatment for Sleeping Sickness Discovered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A cheaper and faster treatment for
the troublesome endemic sleeping sickness has been discovered in
Angola by a Swiss researcher.
</P>
<P>
According to a medical report carried by the Angolan news
agency Angop, the short time of treatment and hospitalization
reduces some 30 percent of the cost of drugs and represents a
practical economic advantage, especially in the poor regions with
high rate of sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss researcher Christian Burri had tested 125 patients
who were injected with "melarsoprol" drug during 10 days instead
of the usual 26 days according to the former treatment system.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the new treatment is as efficient as the
old one, showing the same side effects, and have recorded less
number of people quitting.
</P>
<P>
The sleeping sickness is one of the most worrying illnesses
prevailing in the southwest African country, where around 120,000
people are affected, mainly in the north parts of the country.

JAKARTA -- Indonesian Attorney General's Office (AGO) Thursday
seized documents believed to contain information on assets
allegedly illegally amassed by former president Soeharto, but
delayed the seizure of his commercial assets.

Five state prosecutors confiscated documents concerning the
activities of the Supersemar Foundation, one of seven tax-free
charitable foundations set up by Soeharto during his 32-year rule.
"We are seizing letters and (other) documents, especially those on
Supersemar Foundation," Ris Pandapotan Sihombing, head of the
investigative team from AGO, was quoted by national newspapers
Friday as saying. The move followed an approval from the South

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Expected to Grow 10 Percent This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade is expected
to see a 10-percent growth this year, according to an article in
the latest issue of the country's most authoritative news weekly,
Outlook, coming on May 1.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, China's foreign trade was above
expectations considering the slump in the economy since early last
year. Official statistics showed a 40-percent jump, with gross
imports and exports up to 98.2 billion U.S. dollars for the three
months.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, exports increased 39 percent to 51.7 billion U.S.
dollars and imports rose 41 percent to 46.5 billion U.S. dollars,
leaving a trade surplus of 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's healthy foreign trade can be attributed to several
factors, says the article, which was written by Pei Changhong, a
researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The first factor is that growth was recorded compared with the
slump in the same period last year when foreign trade grew only by
0.3 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Second, continued improvement of the world economy is expected,
which will help increase China's imports and exports. According to
the International Monetary Fund, the global economy is forecast to
grow 4.2 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Expected to Grow 10 Percent This Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first two months, China's trade with its Asian partners
grew by 46.8 percent on an annual basis. China's trade with the
European Union, the United States and Canada grew at a rate of 41.
7 percent, 33.6 percent and 37.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Third, export-promotion measures taken by the central
government since early last year have begun to produce desirable
results, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the sustained development of the Chinese economy helped
expand domestic demand, which in turn led to increases in the
country's imports.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, China's gross domestic
product (GDP) witnessed a growth of 8.1 percent, while retail
sales grew 10.4 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated that China's imports grew 54
percent in the first two months of the year, though imports slowed
a bit in the third month.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that if the above-mentioned factors don't
change much for the rest of the year, China will see a year of
relatively high growth in its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The author also cautions against being overly optimistic in the
country's foreign trade, stating that there still exists
uncertainties in the global and U.S. economies.
</P>
<P>
However, China's foreign trade is expected to hit two-digit
growth. The growth rate of its exports is expected to exceed 10
percent while that of imports about 10 percent this year, with
trade surplus estimated at more than 25 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Complains of Israeli Statements on Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is demanding Israel to
clarify its two ministers's call for Turkish recognition of an
alleged genocide mounted against Armenians during the period of the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Charge D'affaires Moshe Kamhi was summoned to the
Turkish Foreign Ministry on Tuesday over Israeli Education Minister
Yossi Sarid's statements that the alleged Armenian genocide should
be inserted into the Israeli high-school curriculum, reported
Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, in the wake of Sarid's statements, Israeli
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said that the incidents in the
Ottoman Empire involving Armenians could not be called anything
but "genocide."
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the alleged Armenian
genocide on Monday, it was reported, Armenians in Moscow, Tehran,
Brussels, Yerevan and Athens staged demonstrations in front of
Turkish Embassies.
</P>
<P>
Armenians claim that 1.5 million of their people were
slaughtered between 1915 and 1923 during the Ottoman Empire as part
of a genocidal campaign aimed at forcing out eastern Turkey's
Armenian population, while Turks argue that there was no systematic
slaughter and that many Armenians fled the country of their own
volition during war and civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has been cautional over Armenian allegations,
until this year has always refrained from making official
statements on the sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
Although nongovernmental organizations and private institutions
have touched on the subject from time to time, it appears to be the
first time for Israeli ministers to make such public statements in
support of Armenian claims.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, upset by the facts, has stepped up efforts to understand
whether the two ministers' remarks in two consecutive days signal a
policy change or if they are merely the personal views of the
individual ministers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a Muslim-populated country, maintains close ties, both
political and military, with the Jewish state despite grievances
from the Arab and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Israeli diplomatic sources in Ankara told the
English newspaper that there was no policy change whatsoever on the
Israeli side and that the ministers' statements should be evaluated
as individual comments.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Turkish diplomat said that Turkey still
request a prompt clarification from Tel Aviv.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts Anew in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A fresh firefight broke out Friday
morning between government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation
Front(MILF) rebels in the southern Philippines, breaking a month-
old shaky ceasefire, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Local military spokesman Lito Aso was quoted as saying that
skirmishes erupted around 10:00 a.m. at Buldon, Maguindanao
province between elements of the 3rd Infantry Battalion (3IB) and
some 300 MILF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Aso maintained that MILF rebels harassed the detachment of the
3IB in Bubong, eventually resulting to the firefight. Fierce
fighting is still ongoing, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Aso, one soldier is wounded on the government side
in the initial clash, while casualties on the MILF side is yet to
be determined.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, thousands of residents from at least three
towns, namely Buldon, Barira and Matanog, evacuated to safer
grounds to avoid being caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
Reports said MILF rebels fortified their positions around Camp
Abubakar, MIF's biggest base in Central Mindanao, and along
segments of the Narciso Ramos highway to thwart off any offensive
action from the military.
</P>
<P>
Apart from army soldiers, some three battalions of marine
forces were earlier deployed several kilometers away from the
peripheries of Camp Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> 7 Catch Legionnaire's Disease at Melbourne Aquarium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Health officials Friday
confirmed three more cases of the potentially fatal legionnaire's
disease, believed to have been caught at a new aquarium in
Melbourne in southeast Australia.
</P>
<P>
The new cases mean a total of seven people are believed to have
been infected when they visited the 33-million-Australian dollar (
19.8 million U.S. dollars) aquarium during school holidays two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the three new cases, a 58-year-old man is now in a critical
condition in intensive care at a hospital, while two women, aged
61 and 79, are in a critical condition at another hospital,
according to the Victoria state Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
Of the four earlier cases, two people are recovering while the
other two remain in a critical condition, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The department expects results from tests for the legionnaire's
bacterium on the aquarium's air-conditioning cooling towers to be
completed in a week.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Food Crops to Gain Bumper Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A press release issued by the ministry, available here Friday,
said production of major food crops including paddy, wheat, maize
and millet are expected to increase 8.4 percent, reaching a total
production of 6.98 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The release attributed the growth to the increased availability
of agriculture inputs including fertilizer, expansion in
cultivated land area, good monsoon and low agriculture disease.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation area has increased by 2.11 percent and reached
3.32 million hectare, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The production of food crops in the last fiscal year grew by a
meager 1.64 percent, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The bumper growth in the production of major food crops is
expected to prop up the overall agriculture sector growth, thereby
increasing the Gross Domestic Production (GDP), which is expected
to grow 5 to 6 percent in the current fiscal year, compared with 3.
3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As Nepal is an agrarian country, agriculture production has
been the backbone of its economy. About 80 percent of the country'
s 22 million population is dependent on agriculture for their
employment and income.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cargo Space Ship Docks With Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian cargo space ship
Progress M1-2 successfully docked with space station Mir at 1:29 a.
m. Moscow time on Friday (2229 GMT Thursday), reported Russian
news agencies.
</P>
<P>
The docking was automatically conducted and went without a
hitch, said experts from the Mission Control Center in Korolyov,
near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Right after the docking, astronauts Sergei Zalyotin and
Alexander Kaleri made sure that the docking module was tightly
sealed, opened inner hatches and entered the cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The freight aircraft, launched from Kazakhstan cosmodrome
Baikonur Wednesday, delivered to Mir a payload of 2,037 kilograms,
including water, air-oxygen mixture, food, fuel, spare parts and
disposable materials for the station.
</P>
<P>
Progress M1-2 is tanked with 1.5 tons of rocket fuel, while
spaceships of the previous generation were capable of carrying
only less than 1 ton. The extra fuel is necessary to put Mir into
a much higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said the current mission should remain on Mir
until June, but the Mission Control Center does not rule out the
possibility of prolonging it until August.
</P>
<P>
The center's press service said that the main task of the crew
is to prepare Mir for long-term operation and the space station
will remain in operation until the end of this year at least.
</P>
<P>
Russia had planned to desert the 14-year-old Mir around March
for the sake of saving funds until a Netherlands-based MirCorp
agreed to lease it and finance the new mission in February.
</P>
<P>
Talks are now underway with the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
Center to prepare a new extended mission to Mir, said the press
service.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Force Kings To Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (Xinhua) - Point guard Kobe Bryant
Thursday night led the Los Angeles Lakers' to the second victory
over the Sacramento Kings in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, seemingly improving with every game, scored 22 of his
career playoff high 32 points in the first half Thursday night as
the Lakers rolled to a 113-89 victory over the Kings and a 2-0
lead in their first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
Game 3 in the best-of-five series will be played Sunday at Arco
Arena in Sacramento, where a fourth game will be played Tuesday
night, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Basketball funs call the Game 1 was the magic and acrobatic
show by Bryant, while the Game 1 the dominating and spectacular
show by Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers center, who had 46 points, 17
rebounds and five blocked shots in the Lakers' 117-107 victory in
the opener.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal tonight had 23 points, 19 rebounds, six assists and
three blocked shots in Game 2, and Glen Rice added 18 points.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers took command by outscoring Sacramento 16-3 in the
final seven minutes of the second quarter for a 56-41 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
The Kings appeared thoroughly demoralized before the third
quarter was over, and understandably so, considering the Lakers
led by as many as 23 points before settling for an 83-64 lead
entering the final period.
</P>
<P>
Before Game 2, Lakers' coach Phil Jackson asked his players to
remenber how close the Kings came to upsetting Utah Jazz in the
first round last spring, extending the Jazz to overtime in the
fifth and deciding game.
</P>
<P>
"That was after Utah won the opener 117-87," Jackson told the
Lakers, warning them that the Kings are not dead yet.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Kings) got a lot of credibility, they got a lot of
confidence out of it." Jackson added.
</P>
<P>
The Kings realized a victory in Game 2 is a must if they are
going to have a realistic chance at upsetting the Lakers, who
entered the playoffs heavily favored to win their first
championship since 1988.
</P>
<P>
After consecutive losses to the powerful Lakers, the Kings'
chance is slim and they have to do a better job in Game 3 Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Higher GDP Growth Rate This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists are cautiously
optimistic about China's economic performance in 2000, predicting
that it will surely be better than last year, with the growth rate
of gross domestic product (GDP) expected to reach 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
An analytical report released here today by veteran economists
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) pointed to a
stable world economic situation and the continuation of the
government's current macro-control policies.
</P>
<P>
Value added to the agricultural sector is projected to grow 2.9
percent this year, with a 8.8 percent rise anticipated for the
manufacturing sector, and 7.6 percent growth rate for the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
The report says that fixed asset investments will amount to 3.
226 trillion yuan for the year, up 8 percent, lower than the
government-scheduled growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is hopeful that the down-hill economic situation will turn
around by this year," said noted economist Liu Guoguang in a
written speech.
</P>
<P>
It still takes time to overcome deflation rising since late
1997, the report warns, predicting that the retail sale price
index will remain negative in 2000. However, exports will make
greater contributions to GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for optimism is that China has gained some
experience in coping with deflation over the past year, and that
the government has also turned to stimulating both the consumption
and investment demands through the pro-active fiscal policy, the
report says.

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers, who had
kept a nearly perfect sheet at home this season, forgot to show up
on Thursday as the Milwaukee Bucks took a 104-91 victory to win a
playoff game for the first time in 10 years.

</P>
<P>
The Bucks shot 53 percent (41-of-77) for the game and got 44
points from their bench as they leveled the best-of-five first-
round series at one game each.
</P>
<P>
With Milwaukee leading by 24 after three quarters, the fourth

</P>
<P>
Austin Croshere scored 16 points to lead the Pacers, who were a
league-best 36-5 at Conseco Fieldhouse during the regular season
only to give away the home-court advantage with Thursday's

<HEADLINE> Caves Inhabited By Human 15,000 Years Ago Discovered in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered caves used by ancient people beings 15,000 years ago in
Eshan County, southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Yuxi City Cultural Relics Management
Bureau discovered traces of fire in places two meters underground,
and unearthed one-meter-thick calcified ashes at the caves in
Shulin Village, Eshan County.
</P>
<P>
They also collected some fossilized teeth of mammals such as
the giant tapir, the Chinese rhinoceros, horses and South China
porcupines, as well as burned bones and chewed bones.
</P>
<P>
Based on the rough bone tools excavated in the area,
researchers inferred that the ancient people lived in these caves
prior to the Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
Eshan County is located in an area with karst landforms and
numerous caves. Evidence of ancient people living 15,000 to 10,000
years ago were found in 1993 in Tadian town's Laolong Cave, some
10 kilometers away from the Shulin Village caves. From the Laolong
cave, various stone and bone tools, items made of horns and animal
fossils were excavated.

<HEADLINE> hke042822 --Bangladesh to Sign Accord with EC on May 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Community and
Bangladesh are going to strike a high-profile Cooperation
Agreement on May 22 to reinvigorate cooperation in a broad
spectrum in areas like aid, trade and economy, Head of EU
Delegation in Dhaka Antonio De Souza Menezes was quoted Friday by
The Bangladesh Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil will sign the long-
cherished accord with the EC at its headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"This would give a tremendous boost to the relations between
Bangladesh and the Community," the EU ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperation Agreement between the continent and the country,
a follow-up to Commercial Cooperation Agreement signed in 1976,
would extend cooperation in trade and commerce, economy,
environment, science and technology, human resources, information
and culture.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Menezes said after the signing of the agreement, a
task force would be set up to identify the priority projects and
their implementation.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement might not increase the volume of EC's aid for
Bangladesh, but it would widen the scope of cooperation between
the two parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
About Bangladesh's plea for zero-tariff access of its products
to the EU markets, he said the EC is always sympathetic to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
A trade review meeting of the World Trade Organization would be
held in Geneva from May 2 to 4 when Bangladesh's trade policy
would be scrutinized as well as progresses made in compliance with
rules of the WTO evaluated.

<HEADLINE> StanChart Takes over ANZ Grindlays in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd (ANZ) Thursday formally announced that it has agreed to
sell its Grindlays banking operations in South Asia and the Middle
East to Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart) for 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars in cash, The Daily Star newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The integration process in Bangladesh will start soon and take
two to three years, local banking sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the deal, StanChart will emerge as the largest
foreign bank in the country with access to 60,000 new customers
through 14 branches of Grindlays Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Standard Chartered's image as a leading international bank in
the country, when combined with the network and resources of ANZ
Grindlays, will be further enhanced, and the future is really
exciting," StanChart Chief Executive Sethu Venkateswaran said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of StanChart said that a consultant team would be
entrusted to complete the process and to decide the fate of credit
card and other "banking products" of Grindlays Bank in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition would not have any immediate impact, and
clients of both banks have nothing to worry, they added.
</P>
<P>
Grindlays Bank, which started operations in the country in 1905,
emerged as the largest bank in early 1990s, attracting more than
22 billion taka (423 million U.S. dollars) deposits and earning a
profit of over 1 billion taka (19 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
StanChart, which started business in the country in 1948,
attracted deposits of 11 billion taka (212 million dollars) and
earned a profit of more than 700 million taka (13 million dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
StanChart also purchased the UBS International and Nakornthon
Bank in Thailand recently.

<HEADLINE> Yungang Grottoes Applies for World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Yungang Grottoes, one of the
largest and oldest cave formations in China, is expected to apply
to the World Cultural Heritage List this year.
</P>
<P>
The package of literary documents, photographs, slides, and
videotapes required for the application is almost completed, but
the biggest obstacle lies in the surrounding environment of the
grottoes, according to Li Zhiguo, head of the Yungang research
institute.
</P>
<P>
While some projects aimed at improving the environment in the
protected areas have been finished or are underway, still more
needs to be done and further funding is necessary, Li said.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) is required to
relocate local residents and enterprises near the grottoes,
according to the archeologist.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500-year-old grottoes include 252 caves and more than 51,
000 Buddha statues, which are representative of the early stages
of Chinese stone-carving.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems have long held Yungang back from
becoming a World Cultural Heritage site designated by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
since it was listed as a candidate for the prestigious list back
in 1986. The Chinese government has since spent about 200 million
yuan (24 million US dollars) to build a new highway to divert the
heavy flow of coal trucks on a state-level highway near the
grottoes.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant reserves of both natural scenery and
cultural relics, but inadequate management of such sites of
interest, including the sub-standard environs of such places, is
the weightiest challenge facing all applicants to the World
Heritage List, said Guo Zhan, consultant of the Department for
Protection of Monuments &AMP; Sites of the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
There are currently a total of 631 natural or cultural heritage
sites worldwide, including 23 in China.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expands Hotels to Accommodate Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a massive
project to expand the existing hotel capacity to more than 20,000
rooms to accommodate increasing tourists, the official Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the tourism ministry plans to build at least 7,000
rooms at a cost of 22 billion rupees (300 million U.S. dollars),
the newspaper quoted tourism ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sri Lanka has 13,641 hotel rooms of which 2,178
were constructed during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, is blessed
with resource base for ecotourism as well as historic and cultural
sites. The government aims to attract one million tourists in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 2,215 rooms were under construction and
approvals had been granted for 3,000 more while new proposals had
been received for a further 2,100 rooms.
</P>
<P>
During the last five years, the government had laid emphasis on
infrastructure development with a concerted program to push
tourism which was declared as a thrust industry.
</P>
<P>
A series of concessions and relief measures were also given to
the industry. These included exemption form the Goods and Services
Tax for two years, reduction of income tax from 35 percent to 15
percent, duty free imports for hotel refurbishing, transport and
rescheduling of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the island country's fourth largest foreign exchange
earner, next to garment, foreign remittances and tea.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Sri Lanka's tourist earnings hit an all-time high of
254 million U.S. dollars with record 436,440 tourist arrivals.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Thailand to Enhance Cooperation in Drug Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thai anti-narcotics
authorities have held their 4th Cross-Border Meeting on Narcotics
Law Enforcement Cooperation in Kengtung, a border town in Myanmar'
s eastern Shan state, to seek ways of enhancing cooperation in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, held on Monday and Tuesday, was at grass-
roots level and senior officers level, official newspaper The New

</P>
<P>
Attended the meeting were the Myanmar delegation, led by
Colonel Soe Win, secretary of the Myanmar Central Committee for
Drug Abuse Control and director-general of the Myanmar Police
Force, and the Thai delegation, headed by Sorasit Sangprasert,
secretary-general of Narcotics Control Board of Thailand.
</P>

</P>
<P>
In January 1999, Myanmar and Thai anti-narcotics authorities
agreed at a cross-border meeting in Myanmar's border town of
Tachilek to step up the drug suppression cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Later in March that year, leaders of the two countries
announced in Chiang Rai of Thailand a long-term joint drug
suppression plan under which senior officials from anti-narcotics
agencies from both sides would hold regular talks aimed at
exchanging views and laying out concrete programs on joint drug
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand are also among the six signatories to a
memorandum of understanding on sub-regional cooperation in drug
abuse control initiated in New York in 1993. The other four
signatory nations are China, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam involving
the UNDCP.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Aznar Sworn in for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar took oath for a second term before King Juan Carlos on
Thursday and announced the makeup of his new cabinet later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, who won an outright majority in a general election last
month, made considerable changes to the new cabinet by expanding
it from 14 ministries to 16, adding a technology and science
ministry and splitting the former economy and finance ministry
into two.
</P>
<P>
Aznar retained eight of his former ministers in his new lineup
with three of them staying in their original posts: Interior
Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs
Juan Carlos Aparicio, and Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato, who is
also second prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He named Mariano Rajoy, former minister of culture and
education, as his first vice prime minister overseeing political
issues.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Alvarez Cascos, former first vice prime minister, was
appointed minister of development.
</P>
<P>
Josep Pique, former minister of agriculture and energy, was
named as minister of foreign affairs to replace Abel Matutes, who
is going to retire.
</P>
<P>
With an average age of 47, most of the cabinet members have
high academic credentials of law or economics and three of them
are women.
</P>
<P>
In his brief speech announcing the cabinet lineup, Aznar
pledged to continue the policies of developing economy and keeping
social dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the members of the new government will be sworn in
by King Juan Carlos on Friday and hold the first cabinet meeting.

<HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS: Amato Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- As Giuliano Amato was sworn in on
Wednesday as head of Italy's 58th government since World War Two,
Italy's "Dr. Subtle" also knows there are lots of challenges in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
It is a tough situation in which Amato has been chosen prime
minister. The ruling center-left coalition was defeated in local
elections on April 17. As a result, the Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema resigned. The independent Amato became the coalition's best
bet. Although the center-right coalition is the minority in
parliament, they still plan to hold the general election early,
which of course places pressure upon Amato's government.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, Italians will be called to vote in a referendum that
aims to scrap the proportional representation element of the
electoral system. Some small parties oppose such a reform because
they could lose their seats in parliament, so the small parties in
the center-left coalition will cooperate with the center-right
coalition against Amato, which could cause instability in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The third challenge is Amato's economic and social reforms.
Amato promised to change the systems of annuity, social security
and medical care, but such reforms have been rejected by Italy's
three labor unions. If Amato continues his plans of reform, it may
arouse the middle and lower class Italian people's anger and could
affect the center-left coalition's success in next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
Amato is no stranger to tough tasks, and he earned the nickname
"Dr. Subtle" for his skills of handling the economy the last time
he was premier. He can count on his skills, experience and
prestige to hold the coalition together, but there is a long road
ahead for him to run, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Remains at Record High in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate remained at a record high of 4.9 percent for the
second consecutive month in March, the Management and Coordination
Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan's jobless rate for all of fiscal 1999, which
ended March 31, was 4.7 percent, the highest since comparable data
became available in fiscal 1953, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In March, the jobless rate for men rose 0.1 percentage point to
a new record high of 5.2 percent while the rate for women also
climbed 0.1 point to 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed in March rose 220,000 from February to
a record 3.49 million people, 70,000 higher than the previous
record in April last year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the number of jobholders totaled 63.45 million
in March, down 390,000, or 0.6 percent, from the year before.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released on the same day, the Labor
Ministry said the seasonally adjusted ratio of job offers to job
seekers improved in March to 0.53, up 0.01 point from February,
meaning there were 53 jobs offered for every 100 job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest unemployment data, Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said the record-high joblessness over
two straight months does not directly indicate a setback to the
country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The favorable effects of economic recovery do not appear
immediately in the jobless rate," the top government spokesman
told a press conference.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes to Bring Home Thomas Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Former chairman of the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) Surjadi expressed optimism the
country's shuttlers would be able to bring home the Thomas Cup.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after watching simulation matches at Padjajaran
Stadium in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of Jakarta, on
Thursday, Surjadi said PBSI officials and experienced shuttlers
must share their experience with younger members of the team.
</P>
<P>
Surjadi said the team manager would be required to boost the
players' motivation and fighting spirit in playing their best and
decide the right strategy in each match.
</P>
<P>
"A team manager must not panic in a critical situation. As the
leader of the team, he must be able to take action in his capacity
which can please all members," he added.
</P>
<P>
PBSI has yet to name a team manager for the Thomas and Uber
Cups. The two team events will be played simultaneously in Kuala
Lumpur in May.
</P>
<P>
Separately, general chairman of the PBSI Subagyo Hadisiswoyo
was pessimistic about the chances of the Indonesian women's team,
even reaching the Uber Cup final.
</P>
<P>
"We must be realistic. We are only targeting our shuttlers
making the semi-finals. If they can reach the final, it's will be
a blessing from God," he said.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles player Hendrawan said he would face the toughest
challenge of his career as the first singles player.
</P>
<P>
"I will have to face Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark, Wong
Choon Han of Malaysia and Xia Xuanze of China. I have equal
chances against all of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Discussing his preparation, the world number two said: "I was
very exhausted in the last two weeks due to the hard training we
underwent. I'm sure I can improve my condition in the remaining
two weeks," he added.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang points to the physical resemblance between the clam-dragon
and the crocodile. "The clam-dragon looks very much like an angry
crocodile, and the number of claws of the two animals are exactly
the same," he said.
</P>
<P>
The powers of the crocodile are also identical to those of the
dragon as it was described in ancient Chinese books, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
"Ancient Chinese discovered that the activities of crocodile
are closely related with climate; they believed crocodiles roared
for rain, and then rain came in response to the crocodiles'
demands," Wang said. "That's why ancient Chinese people worshipped
the dragon as a god of thunder and rain."
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jiexiang, a research fellow with the Institute of
Archeology under the Academy of Social Sciences in central Henan
Province, said that discovery of fossilized crocodile bones along
the Yellow River showed that crocs lived there 6,000 years ago. "
But ancient Chinese don't call the animal a crocodile, rather they
named it for the thunderous roaring sound it makes, and that name
was 'dragon'," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The boa constrictor snake was thought to be the dragon
prototype about 4,500 years ago. Crocodiles had migrated to south
China by then because of changed weather, and the ferocious boa
became a common sight in the Yellow River, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the snake-like images of dragons discovered in ancient
cultural relics in central and northeast China areas as the basis
for his theory about the change in the dragon's ancestry.
</P>
<P>
He Xingliang, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, echoed Zheng's views, saying, "The image of
Chinese dragon has evolved through the centuries to finally become
a sacred symbol for the whole Chinese nation."

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists say
studies prove that the crocodile is the prototype of the dragon,
a sacred, mythical animal which has long been a symbol of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Their conclusion was based on research of the earliest image of
the Chinese dragon, which was formed out of clam shells about 6,
400 years ago. Archeologists unearthed the sculpture in 1987 in an
ancient tomb in the Yangshao relics in Puyang city, Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that information gleaned from this rare find
is expected to settle the question of the dragon's origin.
</P>
<P>
China is known as the "land of the dragon" and the Chinese
people regard themselves as "children of the dragon." For
thousands of years, the dragon was widely worshipped here, and
each emperor of ancient China deified the dragon, then proclaimed
himself the "son of the dragon" to establish his supreme authority.
</P>
<P>
But for centuries, no one knew exactly how or where the legend
started. Scholars speculated that the ancient Chinese modeled the
dragon after the boa constrictor or lightning. In the 1930s, noted
scholar Wei Juxian offered the theory that the crocodile was
actually the creature honored by the ancients.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dayou, an archeologist who has studied the clam-dragon
sculpture for more than ten years, has found solid evidence in
support of Wei's view.
</P>
<P>
"The ancient people selected long and pointed clam shells to
make up the dragon's teeth and talons, used round black-white
clams for eyes and red ones for tongues. This indicated that our
ancestors created this dragon based on some prototype rather than
out of sheer imagination," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gov't to Lease out Islets to Private Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to rent 10,000 small uninhabited islands to local and foreign
investors, an official said here.
</P>
<P>
The islands would be rented out to bring in foreign exchange
revenue and help even out population distribution, national
newspapers Friday quoted Director general of coastal areas,
beaches and small islands Rohmin Dahuri as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This would put idle resources to good use," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing islands in remote areas would also enhance security
against trespassers, Dahuri added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 17,508 islands, of which around 10,000 were
uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
Interested parties could use the islands as bases for their
fleets of fishing ships operating in economic exclusive zones, for
the cultivation of seaweed and fish or for maritime tourism and
conservation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our islands contain endemic species or species that
are only found there," he said, adding "International conservation
agencies are very interested in preserving them."
</P>
<P>
Dahuri said foreign investors from Japan, Hong Kong of China,
Singapore and Australia had expressed interest in renting islands,
particularly for tourism purpose.
</P>
<P>
The islands would most likely be rented out under a 35-year
lease similar to the method by which the government awards forest
concessions to foreign logging companies, Dahuri said.
</P>
<P>
The plan to rent out the islands must still be approved by the
coordinating minister for economy, finance and industry, and the
provincial administrations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks More Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- To attract more tourists from
China, the Indonesian government is considering elimination of the
"clearing house" process, reduction of visa entry fees and lifting
the limit on the number of travel bureaus able to bring in
tourists from that country.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed these issues several times in the cabinet
meeting and President Abdurrahman Wahid has given the green light.
We expect to settle all the issues this year," State Minister of
Tourism and Arts Djaelani Hidajat was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the issues were the main obstacles in attracting
tourists from China which is a major potential market for
Indonesian tourism.
</P>
<P>
The "clearing house" process was instituted by the Soeharto's
New Order regime in a bid to "prevent the spread of communism to
Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
On the question of the entry visa, Hidajat said that the fee
should be reduced to a reasonable level, "maybe 10 U.S. dollars or
25 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
Currently the entry visa for Chinese wishing to visit Indonesia
is set at 40 U.S. dollars, while Indonesians who wish to enter
China must pay 100,000 rupiah (12.5 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Now, only 12 travel bureaus are licensed to bring in tourists
from China.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, any legal travel bureau will be allowed to
bring in as many Chinese tourists as they wish," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
The government has targeted earnings of 5 billion U.S. dollars
from the 5.1 million foreign tourists who will arrive this year,
based on an average stay of 10 days, and spending of 98 U.S.
dollars per day per tourist.
</P>
<P>
Based on 1998 and 1999 data, inbound tourism in Indonesia is
expected to grow at an annual rate of 7 percent, reaching 6.9
million in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Over 6 Mln Children Given OPV in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 6 million under five-year old
children have been given oral polio vaccine (OPV) in activities
observing the country's national immunization days (NIDs) in the
last five years, said a high-ranking Myanmar health official.
</P>
<P>
Of the total number of children, 95 percent had been given the
vaccine yearly, Myanmar Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein
told a prize presentation ceremony of the photo competition on
NIDs held here on Thursday, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success to assistance rendered by about 40,
000 health staff all over the country and over 180,000 volunteers
involved in the polio eradication activities.
</P>
<P>
Success has also been achieved, exceeding the target due to
collaborative efforts of health staff and volunteers of non-
governmental organizations, he noted, adding that people have been
organized and educated about the effectiveness and worthiness of
NIDs activities through means of mass media.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a country uniquely situated between polio-free
countries (China and Laos) and those with widespread polio virus
transmission (India and Bangladesh).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, along with other countries in the world, is
endeavoring to eradicate polio by this year and has launched
yearly the NIDs activities at the same time with its neighbors
such as Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Thailand and
China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
The country is adopting some basic strategies to achieve the
eradication of poliomyelitis -- high levels of routine
immunization coverage for three doses of OPV, NIDs, a sensitive
acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system and mop-up
immunization campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Inflation Hits Four-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's inflation hit a four-
year high of 2.8 percent in the first quarter 2000, clearing the
way for another interest rates rise next week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said Friday that prices
rose 0.9 percent in the quarter, up from 0.6 in the fourth quarter
last year, and the equal highest quarterly rise in four and a half
years.
</P>
<P>
That lifted price rises for the year from 1.8 to 2.8 percent,
the highest annual increase since June 1996 when the Howard
government first came to power.
</P>
<P>
Almost half the increase was caused by higher petrol prices,
which rose 7.8 percent in the quarter, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Other significant factors included rising house prices, which
were up 1.6 percent, and the prices of cigarettes, education,
fresh vegetables, pharmaceuticals and vehicle insurance.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, the biggest increase was again petrol
prices, which were up 24.1 percent, with house prices also up 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar plunged two-tenths of an Australian cent
on news of the figures, which were not as bad as some analysts
were predicting.
</P>
<P>
However, another rate rise of at least 0.25 percent now appears
certain next Wednesday, after the Reserve Bank of Australia board
meets on Tuesday.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala City and many parts
of the country are being covered by a dense cloud of smoke caused
by 35 forest fires that continue for a second day, said reports
reaching here from Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The ashes from the fires continue to fill the atmosphere of the
capital and five other area departments or provinces in the north,
south and west, said the National Seismology, Vulcanology,
Meteorology and Hydrology Institute (Insivumeh).
</P>
<P>
Experts said the clouds and smoke mix with carbon monoxide (CO2)
, other suspended particles, and nitrous oxide (NOx) which can
result in major ailments affecting the lungs and general health of
Guatemalans. The situation will not change until the forest fires
affecting the northern department of El Peten are extinguished,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 450 forest fires so far this summer have razed more
than 10,000 hectares of forest in the country, authorities claimed.
</P>
<P>
Besides El Peten, the western and northern areas in Guatemala
are suffering from another 20 fires of medium intensity. Due to
strong winds and lack of rain, several of the fires are burning
out of control, said the National Forest Institute (Inab).
</P>
<P>
Inab official Jorge Luis Giron asked private enterprises to
lend their aircraft to help combat the fires.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Terrorists Warned Following Death of Peace-Keeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Lieutenant-General Juan
Ortuno, the new commander of the international Kosovo peace-
keeping forces (KFOR), issued a warning recently against Albanian
terrorists following the death of a Russian peace-keeping soldier.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandar Sijomin, the Russian parachutist, missing since
April 16, was found dead Wednesday. His fellow soldiers came
across his body in Glogovac, about 20 kilometers away from
Pristine where Sijomin was in service.
</P>
<P>
"Attacks targeting peace-keeping soldiers will be considered an
offense against all peace-keeping troops," said Ortuno, referring
to the killing of Sijomin.
</P>
<P>
"Peace-keeping forces will not tolerate attacks on its Russian
troops," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A group of Albanian terrorists reportedly opened fire on
Russian troops camped 50 kilometers west of Pristine. The Russian
troops fired back in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The next day, several Albanians surrounded a Russian jeep in
the city center of Pristine and tried to turn it over. The peace-
keepers fired shots into the air to warn them away.
</P>
<P>
Albanian terrorists have been hostile to the 3,500 Russian
troops since last October when they were sent into Kosovo as part
of the international peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
KFOR has about 45,000 troops -- 39,000 in Kosovo -- and the
others mostly in support roles in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Ortuno, the Eurocorps chief, took over as KFOR commander on
April 18 as the five-nation European military organization was put
in charge for the next six-month rotation at KFOR headquarters.

BUDAPEST, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor and his visiting Austrian counterpart Wolfgang Schussel
agreed Thursday to further develop strategic relations and
meaningful cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following his meeting with
Schussel, Orban said it is essential for the two nations, both of
which have just completed a change of government, to hold a
meeting at this level.
</P>
<P>
No problems, but a bright future of bilateral cooperation
exists between the two states, Orban said, while stressing his
satisfaction over Austria's support of Hungary's entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Schussel said Austria hopes to further promote the
good-neighbor relationship and close cooperation with Hungary.
Despite the changes in some fields, Austria's new government has
been consistent in principal policies, including the policy of EU
expansion, he added.
</P>
<P>
Schussel meanwhile wished a successful conclusion to the
negotiations on Hungary's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Schussel also announced financial aid of 1.5 million-shilling (
100,000 U.S. dollars) for the eastern areas of Hungary, which was
hard hit by floods this month.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will increase its overnight rates by 25 basis points
effective next Tuesday in a bid to pre-empt any adverse effects
from an expected rise in U.S. interest rates, the Business World
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura
as saying that the increase will help protect Philippine financial
markets ahead of the May 16 Meeting of U.S. Federal Reserve policy
makers.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe that the United States will
raise its interest rates," Buenaventura said. "As a consequence,
we felt it prudent that the Philippines also raise its rates."
</P>
<P>
Effective next Tuesday, the overnight borrowing rate will rise
to 9 percent from 8.75 percent while the overnight lending rate
will rise to 11.25 percent from 11 percent, said Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the rate increases are expected to damp
speculative pressures building on the Philippine peso and channel
more funds into the central bank's borrowing facility.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the need to pre-empt a possible rise in U.S.
interest rates reflects the central bank's vulnerability to peso
fluctuations in light of a recently adjusted inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Philippine government and the
International Monetary Fund agreed to cut the country's inflation
target for 2000 to 5-6 percent from an original 6-7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Seize Soeharto Foundation's Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office (AGO) Thursday seized documents believed to contain
information on assets allegedly illegally amassed by former
president Soeharto, but delayed the seizure of his commercial
assets.
</P>
<P>
Five state prosecutors confiscated documents concerning the
activities of the Supersemar Foundation, one of seven tax-free
charitable foundations set up by Soeharto during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
"We are seizing letters and (other) documents, especially those
on Supersemar Foundation," Ris Pandapotan Sihombing, head of the
investigative team from AGO, was quoted by national newspapers
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move followed an approval from the South Jakarta District
Court for the AGO to confiscate the assets of Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Sihombing, who is director of special crimes at the AGO, said
despite the approval from the court, the team would not yet seize
the Granadi building, where Soeharto's charity foundations were
based.
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the reasons for the reluctance.
</P>
<P>
AGO spokesman Yushar Yahya, however, denied that authorities
had breached the court's ruling for refusing to seize the Soeharto-
owned building.
</P>
<P>
"This is a gradual step before confiscating the assets of the
foundations, including the Granadi building," he was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 78, has been named a suspect for issuing decrees and
government regulations to amass funds through the foundations.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has said the corruption probe
into Soeharto is expected to be wrapped up by August this year,
but it was not clear whether the former president would end up in
court or not.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has repeatedly said he would pardon
Soeharto who has denied any wrongdoing, if a court rules him
guilty.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peso Weakens After Rebels Announce Peace "Tax" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian currency peso has
weakened against the U.S. dollar after a rebel guerrilla force
announced Wednesday that it would collect what it called "a peace
tax."
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed Wednesday in the interbank market at 2,002
pesos, a 12-peso rise against the 1,990-peso quotation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A currency broker said that transactions tripled when the
market reacted to a worsening political situation, which made
buyers acquire the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's
biggest guerrilla force, announced Wednesday that it would levy a
tax to persons and businesses that owned, or would earn, more than
1 million dollars a year. The announcement was rejected by
President Andres Pastrana, legislators and labor guilds.
</P>
<P>
Describing the announcement as "ridiculous and absurd" and a
kind of intimidation against the citizens, Finance Minister Juan
Camilo Restrepo said it created anxiety among investors.

According to today's China Daily, the Chinese life insurer will
provide personal, accidental and health insurance for people
engaged in aeronautic designing, manufacturing, experimenting,
launching and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that China launched its first spacecraft
last year and will conduct more spacecraft experiments in future.
</P>
<P>
China used to have only property insurance policies
safeguarding the space projects, while those people working in the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official: Hostages' Release a Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine military
official has denied a report that eight Malaysians had been freed
in Sulu Province Thursday by their hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
Jose Calimlim, vice-chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines said in an interview with the local ABS television
Thursday night that the report was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The rumor floated after Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous
Region reportedly received word of the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The eight Malaysians are among the 21 people abducted by
terrorists from the resort island of Sipadan in the Malaysian
state of Sabah Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said that he had spoken with Misuari and the governor
also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Philippine government has appointed
Misuari as chief negotiator for the safe release of 21 hostages,
who are now believed to be in Sulu province, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Misuari told reporters here that President Josep Estrada has
given him a "general and comprehensive" mandate to negotiate with
the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to help facilitate the safe and quick
release of these people," said Misuari.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the president has instructed the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to fully
cooperate with him to ensure the welfare and safety of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Thursday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said the government will not accede to any ransom
demand from the kidnapers.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, head of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF),
said he will consult with the Office of the President regarding
any ransom demand but added: "Offhand, I do not like to entertain
any financial demand" from the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The MNIF, once the country's largest Muslim rebel group, signed
a peace treaty with the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said that as part of his strategy and to ensure that
the government negotiates from a position of strength, he will
place on alert some 2,000 to 3,000 MNLF members in the area where
the hostages are held.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the hostages seized at Sipadan island
include Malaysians, Filipinos, Germans, French and Finnish
nationals, South Africans and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the governments of the foreign nationals kidnapped
have agreed not to make this an international issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian, Finnish, and German ambassadors have
told Secretary Domingo Siazon of the Department of Foreign Affairs
that they are leaving it to the Philippine authorities to handle
the situation.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Australia and
Indonesia nose-dived Thursday, with Indonesia's Foreign Minister
suddenly canceling a meeting with the Australian ambassador hours
after Prime Minister John Howard toughened his stance on Jakarta,
the Age newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who was on a visit to Paris, declared that Australia's
relationship with its huge neighbor would never be the same after
the East Timor crisis and this was "not a bad thing," the Age said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also acknowledged that Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid's decision to drop plans to visit Australia this month was
evidence that the relationship between the countries remained
strained.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that he would not try to change Wahid's
mind and would not offer to travel to Jakarta to soothe Indonesia'
s feelings, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relationship with Indonesia, Howard said: "It
will never be the same, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
</P>
<P>
Australia's ambassador in Jakarta, John McCarthy, had been
scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted analysts as saying that while the Foreign
Ministry is expected to reschedule the meeting with McCarthy,
relations between Australia and Indonesia will remain frozen until
Wahid's visit, which is now not likely to take place until July at
the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona Receives One-year Cup Ban after Semi-final Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona will be banned to play
in next season's Spanish Cup following their semi-final no-show
against Atletico Madrid, the country's football federation (RFEF)
announced in Barcelona on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The club had argued that they could not play the tie as
injuries and international call-ups, along with the rule that puts
a limit of three on the number of youth team players eligible, had
left them without a full lineup.
</P>
<P>
The RFEF rejected Barcelona claims on Thursday, awarding the
tie to Atletico Madrid and imposing the maximum punishment in
their power for failure to fulfil a fixture.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona will be banned from the Cup for a season and fined
two million pesetas (11,010 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The club have already said they would appeal to the courts if
necessary in an attempt to overturn the decision which was widely
expected after the farcical strike on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona blamed the RFEF for the cancellation because they had
failed to move the match to their preferred date of May 16.
</P>
<P>
Atletico Madrid, who won the first leg 3-0, were awarded the
tie and a berth in the final against Espanyol on May 27.

<HEADLINE> Euro Slumps Again After Interest Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The euro sank to yet another
record low against the United States dollar Friday, its third
within a week, despite Thursday's increase of the benchmark
lending interest rate by the European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
The single currency once fell to 0.9030 dollars on the New York
foreign exchange market, compared with 0.9031 dollars a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the ECB raised interest rates by a quarter
percentage point to push its main lending rate up to 3.75 percent,
along with raising its other two key rates by a quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
The bank last increased its rates by a quarter-point on March
16 and enacted an earlier quarter-point hike on February 3 to beef
up the single currency now being used as credit units in 11 of the
15 European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the ECB's announcement of rate hike Thursday, the
euro hit a record low against the dollar of 0.9150 cents.
</P>
<P>
The euro has been in a downward spiral since its inauguration
on January 1 last year, plunging almost 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, said average
inflation in the euro zone rose to 2.1 percent in March, the
highest since the euro was introduced. An overheating economy can
spur inflation and raising interest rates tends to cool things off
by making it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
Some market analysts noted that the 0.9030-dollar area provides
strong technical support traced down from the dollar-German mark
charts. The euro is now at a 14-year low in dollar-mark
relationship.
</P>
<P>
But the 90-cent area may become an attack target by dealers
after German Bundesbank President Ernst Welteke reportedly said
that he could hardly imagine the euro falling well below 90 cents
this year.
</P>
<P>
Welteke's remarks triggered speculation that the ECB might
intervene to keep the euro close to 90 cents.

LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein chairman Mitchell
McLaughlin said Friday that the Irish Republican Army will never

Downing Street on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Blair's visit to Northern Ireland last
week, during which he met all of the parties to try to gain a
sense of whether there could be agreement on a way to get the
peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish officials have been working to try to find
some plan to move the process forward, in the absence of all-party
meetings in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the impasse between unionists and republicans over the IRA'
s refusal to decommission and under what circumstances the
suspended power-sharing government could be reinstated remains
unbroken.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Leader David Trimble has said there must be"
action" on IRA decommissioning if he is to go back into government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But McLaughlin repeated his party's position: Sinn Fein was
working to remove guns from society but could give no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
He said if there was to be progress there must be fresh
thinking on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are no guarantees for Sinn Fein. There are no guarantees
for anybody else, but there is this certainty, that if we maintain
the present approach on IRA disarmament, there will never be IRA
disarmament," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein's view, which we have restated over and over again,
is that we have already taken valuable steps in the direction of
removing all of the guns," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reports First Drop after 18-month GDP Growth Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's gross domestic product
fell for the first time in 19 months with a 0.4 percent drop
recorded in February from January, Statistics Canada reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But compared with the same period of last year, the economy was
still 3.8 percent higher in February after 18 consecutive monthly
gains, said the official statistical agency.
</P>
<P>
Weaker manufacturing was one of the major factors bringing the
monthly growth down.
</P>
<P>
Among 22 major industry groups, 17 "retreated in February,"
with manufacturing in the automotive industry tumbling 1.9 percent
in the month, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Automobile exports fell 17.3 percent, while car and truck
production declined by 6.5 percent. The agency also said "the
number of cars and trucks sold fell 4.4 percent."
</P>
<P>
Among gainers of the month were the financial sector, up 1.4
percent; power production, 1.1 percent; transportation services, 0.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Asks Court to Split Microsoft in Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government asked a
federal court Friday to split Microsoft Corp. into two separate
companies to curb its monopoly power over the system that runs
most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, joined by 19 states, asked that the
giant software company be split into one company to produce the
Windows operating system and another to handle other software
applications, like spreadsheets and databases. The government
asked that the companies be barred from reuniting for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page proposal was submitted to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson after the close of financial markets this
afternoon. Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft repeatedly broke
federal antitrust laws intended to maintain fair competition by
using its monopoly power in computer operating systems to crush
rivals.
</P>
<P>
In advance of Friday's filing, Microsoft founder and Chairman
Bill Gates had said consumers will suffer if his company is broken
up by the government. "We wouldn't have Windows today if it hadn't
been for the Office group and the Windows group working together,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if accepted by the judge, would bar Gates, and
officers and directors of the current company from owning stock in
more than one of the new companies.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said that "this is the right remedy
for the right time. Our proposal will stimulate competition,
promote innovation, and give consumers new and better choices in
the marketplace."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has said it plans to appeal Jackson's ruling and
company executives have insisted that no laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
The government plan also contained restrictions on Microsoft's
business practices. Neither new company would be allowed to
threaten personal computer manufacturers for using rival products
or to withhold licenses and technical support needed to use the
former Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
The new operating system company would be required to disclose
key software codes of Windows to companies that write application
programs that must be linked to that computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
The company also would be barred from designing software for
the purpose of interfering with or degrading the operations of
rival products. It would be required to treat all hardware and
software makers equally with respect to pricing, licensing of
Microsoft products and access to required technical codes.
</P>
<P>
In a move aimed at evidence introduced that Microsoft used the
operating system to promote its Internet browser and to smash
rival Netscape's browser, the Justice Department asked for a ban
on tying future use of Windows to any other Microsoft products.

<HEADLINE> CEPAL Considers L. American Education Insufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) said Friday that the
regional achievements have been insufficient, albeit spectacular.
</P>
<P>
There have been spectacular advances in education in Latin
America in the last 30 years, with a rise in the coverage in the
basic, secondary and college levels, and of the resources
allocated to the area, said the CEPAL in a communique published
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The region is at a disadvantage to enter the economy of
knowledge that prevails in the globalized world, added the CEPAL
communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique quoted a new book by Martin Hopenhayn, a
philosopher, and Ernesto Ottone, a sociologist, of the CEPAL, who
make an urgent call to reform education in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hopenhayn and Ottone said that there is a consensus on the
central role of education to reduce poverty, promote citizens'
action, protect the groups of the highest social vulnerability,
and to achieve more fairness in the access to well-being
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
They also foresee the danger of the education system becoming "
irrelevant" if it is not renewed in depth.
</P>
<P>
An outstanding effort was made in the region to expand the
education system: illiteracy was reduced from 46.5 percent in 1950
to 12.1 percent in 1990; basic education coverage reaches now 90
percent of children between six and 12 years of age, medium level
education grew; and the number of university students grew between
1950 and 1994 from 250,000 to 8 million.
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL says that the region lives in an intermediate level
between postmodernity and premodernity, and so it faces a double
challenge.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, it has to assume the commitments imposed upon
education and the emerging society of knowledge, that forces to
redefine the curriculum, the styles of teaching, the operation of
the educational system, and the articulation of the formal system
with other sources of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
To teach to learn, not to repeat knowledge. On the other hand,
the endemic problems of low educational achievement, low level of
approval, high rate of basic schooling, and low rate in medium
level education, and the social segmentation of the quality of the
education.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Premier Arrives in Russia for Working Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- New Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori arrived in Russian city of St. Petersburg on Friday
evening for a three-day working visit and will hold an informal
meeting with Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin on bilateral
ties Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first overseas trip by Mori after coming onto post
of cabinet head earlier this month. Before Mori, none of Japanese
prime ministers selected Russia as the first state to visit.
</P>
<P>
Putin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Culture
Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi, Trade Minister Mikhail Fradkov and
Communication Minister Leonid Reiman, also arrived in St.
Petersburg on Friday evening, reported Russian media.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Putin and Mori planned for Saturday will focus
on July's Group-8 summit in Japan's Okinawa, deputy chief of the
Kremlin staff Sergei Prikhodko said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss cooperation between the two
states in economic, trade, military and high-tech fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before departing from Tokyo, Mori told journalists the main
purpose of his visit is to establish reliable personal relations
with Putin and to promote Japanese-Russian ties, but detailed
talks on territorial problem won't be expected.
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday interview with Russian RTR television channel,
Mori said the sides would exchange opinions on all aspects of
bilateral relations and the two countries have great
potentialities to expand economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the task of improving future relations in order
to open up prospects in the next century. The peace treaty must be
signed. It is important that Russia and Japan think everything
over and move ahead," he said, describing Japan's relations with
Russia as "very good."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have a frank exchange of opinions with him (
Putin)on the preparations for the July summit of the G-8 and on
how Japanese-Russian relations will be built up in the 21st
century," said Mori, vowing to continue the line of his
predecessors Ryutaro Hashimoto and Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
"The development of cooperation between our countries in
various fields, primarily the conclusion of a peace treaty, and
the establishment of truly stable relations between Japan and
Russia are in the interests of both states and simultaneously
contribute to stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world community as a whole," he stressed,
</P>
<P>
Putin and Mori will meet again in the Ice Palace in St.
Petersburg at around 6:30 p.m. Moscow time (1530 GMT) Saturday to
attend the opening of the World Ice Hockey Championship, which
will start with a Russia-France game.
</P>
<P>
Mori will leave for Rome on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Wins Confidence Vote in Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new Prime Minister Giuliano
Amato won a confidence vote in the Lower House Friday evening with
319 ayes to 298 noes and five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Before a make-or-break Lower House confidence vote in his
government, Amato delivered a speech in which he stressed that he
was not driven by ambitions to lead the center-left at next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
The former Socialist, who was sworn in as premier by President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Wednesday, told the Lower House after a 13-
hour-long confidence debate that a system which confuses premier-
ship with leadership is a sick political system. "I can assure you
that I don't care what my role will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amato was chosen to lead the center-left through to the end of
its legislature in April 2001 after the resignation of Massimo D'
Alema, who quit in the wake of the coalition's humiliating defeat
in regional elections held on April 16.
</P>
<P>
Amato also softened his line on electoral reform, ahead of May'
s referendum on abolishing proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
If won, the referendum would require parliament to remove the
present 25 percent of the Lower House elected proportionally,
thereby strengthening the two-party system, boosting government
stability and diminishing the power of smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
Amato told his nine-party-strong coalition that a new electoral
law would only be enacted if necessary, "but not at all costs, and
in any case, respecting the outcome of the referendum."
</P>
<P>
Previously, Amato had insisted that electoral reform was a top
priority, and would have to come no matter what the referendum
results.
</P>
<P>
The full Lower House consists of 630 members, which would
normally require a minimum majority of 316, but the speaker does
not vote, and 10 MPs did not attend the vote for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The next step will then be a confidence vote in the Senate,
where the center-left coalition enjoys a solid majority.
</P>
<P>
The Senate confidence debate is scheduled to begin Tuesday
while the vote will be held Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly for Amato, he will become the third
government leader in the legislature, brought in with the general
election of April 1996, following Premier Romano Prodi and Massimo
D'Alema, and his government will be the 58th since World War Two.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Fears of higher interest rates
sent the blue chips lower on Wall Street Friday but the technology
stocks continued their recovery.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
154.19 at 10,733.91  in the third consecutive session. The index
lost 110.14 points this week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 86.63 at 3,860.66 but the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 12.49 at 1,452.43.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite ended the week up 216.78 points or bout 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks plunged after the Commerce Department
reported that Americans' income rose 0.7 percent in March, the
fastest pace since January but personal savings rose only slightly
to 0.4 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that Americans still spent much more money
and strong spending will increase pressures on inflation.
Investors feared, therefore, the Federal Reserve Board would raise
interest rates again to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times in an effort to
ward off inflation. Analysts expected the Board to raise the rates
again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
But the investors favored tech stocks, driving the Nasdaq index
higher. Among the stocks leading the Nasdaq's advance were Intel,
Applied Materials and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 6.29 at 644.16. But the American Stock

<HEADLINE> KLM Announces End of Alliance With Alitalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 28 (Xinhua) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced
Friday evening that it was pulling out of its strategic alliance
with Italian carrier Alitalia, citing uncertainties surrounding
the future of Milan's troubled new airport Malpensa 2000 as the
main reason for its decision.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by KLM said that the Dutch carrier had
decided, "after careful consideration," to break its accord with
Alitalia, judged to be "unsustainable" because of the "continued
uncertainty" about Malpensa and the Italian airline's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
It said that continuing the alliance would constitute an "
unacceptable business risk under the present circumstances, a risk
which would endanger the financial position of KLM, its
profitability and its attractiveness to other potential partners."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that, under the terms of the accord,
Alitalia was supposed to be privatized by June 30, 2000, but "the
Italian government has indicated that this will not be possible."
</P>
<P>
It also said that Alitalia would be "obliged" to return the 200
billion lire (about 102 million U.S. dollars) which KLM
contributed towards the costs of upgrading Malpensa, originally a
small military airport.
</P>
<P>
The development of Malpensa into a fully operational hub was a
crucial feature of the alliance signed by KLM and Alitalia in May
last year, which gave KLM the option of terminating the accord if
the airport failed to take off.
</P>
<P>
The airport has been dogged by problems ever since its official
launch in the autumn of 1998, with environmental concerns playing
a major part in its failure to become fully operational, since
noise pollution levels have been found to be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia CEO Domenico Cempella immediately called a meeting of
the company's top management to discuss the KLM decision.
</P>
<P>
Just at the beginning of this month, Alitalia, KLM, KLM's long-
time partner Northwest and Continental announced that a colossal
four-way alliance called Wings would soon be taking off, but KLM
underscored today that the Malpensa issue had also limited "the
future development of the alliance between KLM and Northwest."
</P>
<P>
Civil aviation sources in Rome said later that, although the
timing of the KLM announcement might seem to be linked to reports
earlier in the day indicating that the debate between Italy and
the European Commission over Malpensa's flight scheduling could
still drag on for some time, the real reason was disagreements
over the merger proposals being discussed by the two airlines in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
Reports that they planned to move well beyond a strategic
commercial alliance to an exchange of shares and a full merger
started circulating earlier this month
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, even though operational integration
with Alitalia was well under way and there seemed to be few real
hurdles in the merger talks, the real reason for rebuffing the
Italian airline may be that KLM is now headed for an alliance with
British Airways, which, with Germany's Lufthansa, was Malpensa's
main opponent.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, the transport ministry and government officials in
Rome voiced surprise that the Malpensa case was cited as the
reason for breaking off the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Italian Transport Undersecretary Luca Danese told reporters
that the coming "hours and days" would show whether KLM's
arguments were "a pretext."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there were novelties such as to justify this
decision," he told reporters, also recalling the merger talk of
recent days.
