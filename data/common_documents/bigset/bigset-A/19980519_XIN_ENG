<HEADLINE> China Tea Production Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's tea production and export
is picking up, according to an official from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At an tea exhibition, which opened here today, the official
noted that the country produced 610,000 tons, or eight billion
yuan-worth of tea last year, accounting for one fourth of the
world's total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country exported 200,000 tons of tea, earning
300 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
China is the home of tea and also one of the largest tea
producers in the world. Affected by the international tea market
and the price rises of domestic means of agricultural production,
the country suffered a drop in tea output during the 1993-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
One third of China's tea is exported every year, and 90 percent
of green tea and 10 percent of black tea on the world market comes
from China, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
As European countries and the United States are the main buyers
of Chinese tea, the Asian financial crisis has not affected China's
tea exports much, noted the official.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the ministry, the five-day '98 China International
Famous Tea, Tea Products and Tea Culture Exhibition is expected
to promote cooperation between China's tea producers and their
overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 firms from both at home and abroad are attending
the exhibition.

<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- European Union Commission President
Jacques Santer said on Monday more work had to be done to complete
an EU-U.S. deal reached in London earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which waives U.S. sanctions on EU, Russian and
Malaysian firms involved in a disputed $2 billion gas deal with
Iran, was reached at London talks between Santer, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and the current EU President British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously still some further steps which need to
be taken before the deal can be completed and implemented, but I
am hopeful these can be concluded as soon as possible," Santer
said at a press conference after the summit meeting held in Downing
Street.
</P>
<P>
The commission president said the deal, which ended the EU-U.S.
dispute peacefully, meant that "European companies and businessmen
can conduct their business without the threat of U.S. sanctions
hanging over their heads."
</P>
<P>
"It's a deal which is good for the EU, which shows it can
act together, united in important foreign policy issues. And it
is good for the transatlantic relationship, which can now
develop free of this long-standing dispute," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Disappointed over G-8's Response to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Foreign Ministry
Monday summoned the heads of missions of the Group-8 countries to
convey its deep disappointment at the "very muted response" by the
just concluded G-8 summit to India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 summit concluded on Sunday in Birmingham, England, with
a condemnation of India for carrying out nuclear tests, but
without approving any package of sanctions aimed at New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday evening, the Foreign Ministry
said Pakistan appreciated the efforts of some of the G-8 leaders,
who advocated a stronger outcome of the summit, but it regretted
that others had chosen to dilute the G-8 statement.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that these countries were influenced by narrow
economic interests despite a clear record of Indian military
adventurism in the region and its hegemonistic designs, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It was emphasized that the policy of appeasement was always
counter-productive since it encouraged and emboldened the habitual
transgressors, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 statement claimed to have enhanced and strengthened
non-proliferation regimes and international peace, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it added, the Indian tests had left the
Non-proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in
shreds and irrevocably damaged peace and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 group comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> No Breakthrough for Mideast Peace Process: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
dismissed reports from the Israeli press that a breakthrough in
Middle East peace process is imminent, saying "gaps still remain
to be closed."
</P>
<P>
Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, was reacting to reports from Israel Radio, which said
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was ready to accept the
U.S. proposal of withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank but
only on the condition that Palestinians were willing to forgo a
third promised redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"You may have heard reports from the Israeli press that suggest
a breakthrough is imminent, that an agreement has been reached. I
am here to tell you that is not the case," Indyk told an annual
conference of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, a
major Jewish lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an agreement. We are working seriously with
Prime Minister Netanyahu. There are still gaps that remain to be
closed and (there is) still difficult going," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu wound up a five-day trip to the United States Sunday
with a fiery speech to the American Israeli Public Affairs
Committee, underscoring Israel's right to determine its own
security needs and to decide for itself the scope of a troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in London for
a U.S.-EU summit, is meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official traveling with President Bill Clinton in London
played down expectations that the Albright-Arafat talks would
generate a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"This is another meeting in a series to see whether we can
narrow the gaps between the parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday and Thursday, Albright met with Netanyahu in
Washington in a fresh effort to persuade the Israeli leader to
accept the U.S. proposal on withdrawal. But the two-day talks end
in failure with no progress made for reviving the stalled peace
process in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Mayor of Paris Detained for Suspected Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The wife of Mayor of Paris Jean
Tiberi, Xavier Tiberi, was detained Monday morning by judicial
police for an alleged salary fraud.
</P>
<P>
Xavier Tiberi is being questioned by a public prosecutor of
Essonne in eastern France, in the compound of the economic and
financial direction of the judicial police located in Versaille,
south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
She was accused of receiving illegally 210,779 francs (42,156
U.S. dollars) of false salaries from the former president of the
cabinet of the regional parliament of Essonne, Xavier Dugoin, in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Both Tiberi and Dugoin, who is now a senator, are from the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) once led by President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The scandal caused a chain reaction when Georges Quemar,
manager of personnel of the City Hall of Paris from 1983 to 1989
-- during which time Chirac was the mayor -- told the local daily
Parisien that up to 300 "fictive jobs" were also created in Paris
at that time by the staff of the city government.
</P>
<P>
These false jobs cost the state from 80 to 100 million francs
(16 to 20 million U.S. dollars) each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Elisabeth Guigou said in a television
interview that if he had committed the offense, the president of
the republic should be brought to justice like other citizens.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Denies Involvement in Alleged Rigging of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on Monday
strongly denied any involvement in alleged activities to rig the
results of the May 11 elections in favor of the ruling party's
presidential candidate Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to earlier reports that an alleged attempt
to manipulate the results of an unofficial quick count of votes in
favor of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party's candidates has been
uncovered in the southern province of Zamboanga del Norte.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the computer programs of the National
Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), the sole non-governmental
organization accredited to conduct the quick count, was founded
"tampered" in the province to favor De Venecia.
</P>
<P>
"I deny any involvement, much less authorship. As your
president, my paramount interest more than any other citizen's is
for the elections to be accepted as generally credible to our
people and the international community," Ramos told a meeting with
presidential and vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramos said he had directed officials to
prevent any undue or illegal interference or any irregularity that
would jeopardize the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also assured frontrunning candidate Vice President Joseph
Estrada that there will be a proclamation of the next president in
June. Estrada is the standard-bearer of the opposition LAMMP
(Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) Party.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Comelec Chairman Bernardo Pardo urged all
losing candidates to concede and gracefully accept the will of the
people to fast-track the healing of wounds caused by the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said that accepting the defeat will make it easy for the
Comelec and the nation to complete at the earliest possible time
the election process which will lead to the proclamation of
winners.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results issued by the Namfrel Monday
afternoon, Estrada maintains his seemingly insurmountable lead
over his nine rivals with 7.16 million votes or 37.5 percent of
the 19.1 million votes counted.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia trailed far behind Estrada with only 2.9 million
votes, and Senator Raul Rocco came in third place with 2.6
million.
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel is expected to wrap up its unofficial counting
Wednesday. But it is still unknown whether the group is able to
count all the estimated 27.2 million votes.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec estimated earlier that 80 percent of the 34 million
registered voters cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Five of Estrada's rivals, including former Manila mayor Alfredo
Lim and former presidential economic adviser Emilio Osmena, have
conceded defeat to the emerging winner.
</P>
<P>
But De Venecia insisted earlier that he would not throw the
towel before the start of the canvassing of votes by Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, the victory of Senator Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo of the ruling party has already been a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel update showed that Arroyo garnered nearly 8.5
million out of the 1.9 million votes counted, far ahead of her
closest rival Senator Edgardo Angara, Estrada's running mate who
got only 3.7 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the bicameral Congress has already been
convened into the National Board of Canvassers to canvass the
votes for the president and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
The board will begin on May 25 the canvassing of election
returns from more than 100 provinces and big cities, and the
official results are not expected to be known within one or two
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Sea Waters Around Cyprus Not Contaminated: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- There has been no contamination of
the sea surrounding Cyprus, according to a Cypriot Fisheries
Department announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said that systematic tests for checking the quality of sea
water show no problems in the sea around the island.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Department official Loizos Loizides also told Cyprus
News Agency that "there is no indication of contamination of the
sea surrounding Cyprus," explaining that the flow of sea currents
make it impossible.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following recent press reports about
the dumping of dangerous toxic waste in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
International environmentalist organization "Greenpeace" has
accused the Israeli authorities of allowing continuation of the
dumping of coal ash, contaminated by toxic heavy metals, in the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Mediterranean Office has claimed that a committee
at the Israeli Ministry of Environment had given special permits
on May 11 to "Israel Electricity Company" for dumping an
additional 15,000 tonnes of coal ash.
</P>
<P>
It said that the same committee "gave the U.S.-owned
fertilizer company Haifa Chemicals a permit to dump 60,000 tonnes
of toxic sludge in the Mediterranean until next October."
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace called on the Israeli government to ban all sea
dumping, noting that the U.N. has declared 1998 as the
"International Year of the Oceans."

<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military authority
did not agree with the calling for President Soeharto's
resignation, saying it does not have a legal basis under the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense and Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto
said here Monday, "ABRI (Armed Forces) feels and understands that
the House Speaker's hope for President Soeharto to step down
constitutes an individual opinion and stance, although it was
conveyed collectively."
</P>
<P>
Such opinion had to be put forward before a plenary session of
the House of Representatives (DPR), official Antara News Agency
quoted the general as saying at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Harmoko said earlier in the day that the
leadership of DPR hoped that President Soeharto would be wise
enough to step down for the sake of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Wiranto said the urgent tasks and obligations the
government had to carry out immediately as part of its
responsibility was a cabinet reshuffle, total reform and
overcoming the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
To assure smooth reforms, ABRI suggested setting up a council
of reform whose members are government authorities and public
figures, particularly consisting of university students as well as
outspoken figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out its tasks, the council will work along with the
DPR intensively, he added.

The media conference was attended by all the armed forces'
chiefs of staff, secretary general of the Ministry of Defense Lt.
Gen. Soeyono, chief of the army's strategic reserve command Lt.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Denmark into Top 4 at Thomas Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Both Defending champions
Indonesia and runners-up Denmark booked berths in the semi-finals
after their respective second group matches at the 20th Thomas Cup
Badminton Finals here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia of Group B won over South Korea 4-1, only losing the
second doubles match due to what the team's manager Agus
Wirahadikusumah later described as "mental problem" of one player.
</P>
<P>
"Losing the second doubles means that we had to make more
efforts to improve. We never rely on the selection of players to
win. We will field the best team in best performance in the
semi-finals, either against China or Denmark," he added.
</P>
<P>
Denmark defeated Sweden 4-1 in Group A after losing one of the
singles matches. Denmark's world number four and Olympic champion
Poul Holst-Larsen, 32, was out of form when conceding 15-5, 16-17,
8-15 to 18th-ranked Swede Thomas Johansson, three years his
junior.
</P>
<P>
Danish head coach Henrik Lyngby later said he had predicted the
match against the 1.90-meter-tall Swede to be a "difficult one".
</P>
<P>
China defeated Hong Kong, China 5-0 to join Denmark in an
unscalable two-win lead and the top two spots of the group.
</P>
<P>
Denmark will play China on Wednesday to decide the group
winners.
</P>
<P>
"We will not play tricks to select opponents. We always rely
on our strength and preparations to win. If we can beat Denmark
in our next meeting, we'll certainly do so," said Chinese head
coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
Four-time champions Malaysia whitewashed lowly-rated
Netherlands 5-0 on Monday to join in Indonesia in an unbeatable
position to take the top two spots of Group B.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia are to meet each other on Wednesday, the
final day of Thomas Cup Finals group competitions, to decide who
will be the group winners.
</P>
<P>
"We did what we'd expected of us. Ong Ewe Hock did quite well
in the first singles, which gave Malaysia a good start," said
Malaysia's head coach Morten Frost from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is a strong team and it gives all the other teams a
lot of pressure. If everything is going to work on Wednesday
(when Indonesia meet Malaysia), they can take two points from the
doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be happy if we can split a doubles from the match," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Group competitions for Uber Cup Finals will enter the final day
on Tuesday. Indonesia take on South Korea and the Netherlands face
England in Group B while China meet Denmark and Japan play Hong
Kong, China in Group A.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia can not for sure beat South Korea tomorrow, as the
South Koreans are very strong in the singles. Indonesia and China
are the teams in the limelight while the hidden South Koreans are
in fact a real threat to many," Li Yongbo predicted.

<HEADLINE> Frontrunner in Philippine Presidential Race Denies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada, who has been leading in an unofficial count of votes in
the May 11 presidential polls, on Monday denied reports about the
people supposedly being considered for posts in an Estrada
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Estrada called the reports "part of a disinformation campaign"
intended to cast him in bad light even before he could be formally
proclaimed the winner of the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Estrada cited in particular the reported designation of
prominent lawyer Estelito Mendoza as secretary of justice, and
Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson as national security adviser
and concurrent director general of the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that Lacson was not being considered for either of
the two positions and that Mendoza had already informed him that
he was not interested in the justice portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's critics and rivals have accused him of using former
cabinet members under former president Ferdinand Marcos. Both
Mendoza and Lacson were senior government officials in the Marcos
era.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada said there would be no de facto vice
president in the incoming administration, obviously in reference
to the alleged nomination of his running mate, Senator Edgardo
Angara, to the position.
</P>
<P>
The vice president disclosed that a five-man selection
committee, composed of Senators Angara and Orlando Mercado, is
responsible for submitting to him the names of Cabinet nominees.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to submit three names for each
Cabinet position, selected on the basis of merit, qualifications
and integrity. The nominations will be submitted on or before May
30.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest partial and unofficial results from a
non-governmental organization, Estrada further widened his
commanding lead with a total of 7.16 million votes, or 37.4
percent of the 19.1 million votes already counted by the group as
of 15:31 local time Monday.
</P>
<P>
His closest rival, Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose
de Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, mustered only 2.9
million votes.
</P>
<P>
Five of Estrada's nine rivals have conceded their defeat. But
De Venecia and other candidates said they would not concede until
the official results were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The bicameral Congress will begin on May 25 to canvass the
election returns being sent to it from across the country. The
official results for the presidential and vice-presidential
elections are not expected to be known within two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Takes Over Ailing Finance Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand governor
Chatumongol Sonakul announced Monday that the central bank is
taking over seven ailing finance companies.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as another critical measure the government
took to reform the country's financial sector after the closure of
56 financial institutions last December.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the seven firms share problems such as
liquidity crunch, large amount of debts, high proportions of bad
loans and ebbing confidence from creditors and depositors.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had ordered all commercial banks and financial
institutions to increase their capital by the end of September and
August 15 respectively. But so far less than half have
successfully raised funds.
</P>
<P>
Union Asia Finance Plc and Nava Finance Plc, which were among
the five largest of the 91 finance firms before the crisis, failed
in their recapitalization attempt.
</P>
<P>
The two firms are among the seven ailing institutions to be
taken over by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said liquidity crunch has reduced the chances of other
Thai finance companies to successfully raise capital before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank governor, new managers have been
sent to perform the takeover. The central bank has a plan to merge
the seven financial firms with a state-own finance company and
form a new commercial bank, Chatumongol said.
</P>
<P>
He also reassured creditors and depositors of the seven firms
that the government offers fully guarantee on their deposits and
liabilities in these firms.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Blair Phone Pak PM on Nuke Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair jointly telephoned Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Monday evening to exchange views on
the outcome of the Group-8 Summit's deliberations on the situation
arising out of India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Both the leaders informed the Prime Minister that this serious
development was given full consideration by the G-8 countries,
said an official press release issued by the Pakistan Information
Department.
</P>
<P>
They said this was reflected in the final statement issued at
the end of the Summit, which called for strengthening the global
non-proliferation regime and enhancing regional and international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif, in his response, while appreciating the
close consultations between Pakistan, the United States and
Britain on such a vital issue, conveyed his deep disappointment at
the final statement which had emerged from the G-8 Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the great powers to condemn India and apply
across-the-board sanctions would send wrong signals to India, he
said, adding that in fact, it may act as an encouragement.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the Prime Minister thanked both U.S. President
Clinton and UK Prime Minister Blair for this personal exchange of
ideas on an issue which was of vital importance to the security of
Pakistan, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Project to Alleviate Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Monday
launched a 70-million-U.S.-Dollar community action project (CAP)
to alleviate rural poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project sponsored by the World Bank was launched in Kadoma
of central Zimbabwe to alleviate poverty in the country's 26
poorest rural district councils over the next five years, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It will be one of the government's poverty reduction
strategies under the poverty alleviation action plan which
emphasizes community participation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the three-day workshop to prepare for the
implementation to CAP, Public service, Labour and Social Welfare
Minister Florence Chitauro said that the project to start in July
is part of the government's effort to improve the living standard
of people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"The project seeks to promote participatory and collaborative
planning and implementation of projects through community
partnerships with rural district councils, government agencies,
non-governmental organizations and the private sector," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Projects eligible for funding under CAP include rehabilitation
and renovation of primary education and health facilities,
construction and rehabilitation of roads, small dams, irrigation
schemes, and water supply and sanitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide for the construction of
community halls, granaries, agricultural depots and markets,
grazing schemes, agroforestry and alternative energy sources such
as solar.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said CAP will be based on the government policy of
decentralization of some government roles to rural district
councils, which would promote the participation of the community
and minimizing bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Drums Up His Party for Hard Re-Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BREMEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday
called on his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party
to show unity and self-confidence in an increasingly difficult
campaign to win another four years in power in the September
national elections.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the toughest election in history.... We want to
win and we will win," said Kohl in a two-hour keynote speech at a
party convention that opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Defying the continued backward standing in opinion polls, Kohl
insisted that his current center-right ruling coalition led by the
CDU remained the best option for the voters when compared with a
possible coalition of the leftist Social Democratic Party (SPD)
and the Greens, which he said would lead to instability and a loss
of international trust for Germany.
</P>
<P>
The CDU represented the best chance for Germany to remain
strong and competitive in the world, to realize the "jobs for all"
target, to conduct much-needed structural reforms of the welfare
state, to fight crimes and to push ahead the European integration
process, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
"Our strong point will be the fact that we know for what we are
combating," Kohl told some 1,000 delegates present at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The strong message from Kohl was meant to boost confidence of
both himself and his party at a time when opinion polls showed
that public support for the CDU remains some 10 percentage points
behind that for the SPD with only four months to go before the
national elections on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, the CDU parliamentary leader, said that he
hoped the two-day party convention, which would also formally
adopt an election platform, would help finally turn around voters'
mood in favor of Kohl, who is seeking an unprecedented fifth term
in office since 1982.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Under Mounting Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Limited foreign exchange reserves
coupled with last week's suspension of trade on the tobacco
auction floors have put the Zimbabwean Dollar under pressure, the
Foreign Exchange Association of Zimbabwe (FEAZ) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, FEAZ President
Zibusiso Nkomo said that the reluctance to sell by most tobacco
farmers due to depressed prices, had resulted in little inflow of
foreign currency into the market, thereby putting the already
strained local currency unit under more pressure.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with limited foreign currency offloaded from the
Central Bank has not helped the market, Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
"There had been very high expectations of a firm Zimbabwean
Dollar when floors opened, but now the situation is the opposite
and no one wants to be caught unaware and as a result there is a
rush for forex," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said that foreign currency reserves are currently at
about two months import cover, a situation he said was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar has been sliding and is now pegged at
between 18.1 and 18.6 to the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, there is hope that the situation might improve next
week when tobacco floors reopen.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco farmers suspended trading at all floors on Friday
protesting against depressed prices of just over one U.S. Dollar
per kg, almost half the price for last season.

<HEADLINE> French Union Blames Air Force for Losing UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The French union Force-Ouvriere (FO)
Monday blamed the French air force for losing a war plane contract
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the United States last
week.
</P>
<P>
The UAE bought 80 American F-16 fighters to replace the
French-made Mirage and Rafale combat aircraft which used to equip
the air force of the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
The FO said the position of Rafale would have been stronger to
win the contract if the French air force had announced the
purchase of such fighters this year.
</P>
<P>
"The French industry should be in time to persuade the air
force, which shows strong interest in the Rafale, that the
principal user of this plane, the French air force, is well
determined to acquire it," said the FO's metallurgical branch.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Accepting Withdrawal Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied Monday that he had accepted the U.S. plan on a
13.1 percent withdrawal during his talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
At a hurriedly-arranged news conference in his office here,
Netanyahu said the press reports that he had reached agreement on
the redeployment in his talks with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Middle East Envoy Dannis Ross in the past
week were "incorrect."
</P>
<P>
"During these talks, there were things that were published
incorrectly that I agreed to withdraw from 13 percent (of West
Bank). This is incorrect, there was no agreement on it, nothing
has been finalized," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. press report quoted Israeli officials earlier Monday as
saying that Netanyahu had agreed to accept the U.S. plan on
condition that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) agreed to
cancel the third pullback and enter the permanent talks
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he and Albright basically discussed the
"concrete fulfillment" by the PNA of all its commitments. He said
that only when both sides made concessions and fulfilled their
respective commitments, could the way be paved for future progress
in the peace talks in order to achieve a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
He added that he also discussed the issue of redeployment and
the holding of final-status talks with the U.S. officials. He said
although "various new ideas" were discussed at the Washington
talks, no breakthrough was achieved on the size of further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that the redeployment should only be
carried out on condition that it would not endanger Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the leaks and denials on the pullback
could be a tactic used by the Israeli leader in a bid to soothe
the anger of his right-wing coalition partners, who have
threatened to topple the government if Netanyahu accepts a 13
percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to see the reaction from the Palestinian side on
his proposal for canceling the third pullback. In fact, the PNA
on Monday rejected this idea, saying it would insist on Israel's
execution of the third pullback.
</P>
<P>
At the same conference, Netanyahu lashed out at the recent
wave of Palestinian violence that was sparked by the widespread
marches held in the Palestinian territories to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Nakba, the Palestinian term of catastrophe
referring to the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were reportedly killed and hundreds of others
injured in the first day of clashes beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the PNA for organizing and inflaming the Nakba
protests in an attempt to pressure Israel. He said the term of
Nakba reflected that the PNA had not yet recognized the existence
of Israel as a state, adding that such violence should be
condemned by Arab leaders if they hoped to advance the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Angolan Refugees to be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The representative of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to Angola, Zobida
Hassin-Ashagire, announced here Monday that 200,000 Angolan
refugees abroad will be repatriated within this year.
</P>
<P>
Zobida made the announcement at a press conference held here
Monday, saying that it needs 23 million U.S. Dollars for the
repatriation but the UNHCR has only raised 5.6 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some donors have promised to provide four million U.S.
Dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zobida argued that the money provided by the international
community is far from enough for the repatriation and there are
great difficulties facing the organized repatriation of the
Angolan refugees.
</P>
<P>
She also disclosed that the UNHCR has taken various measures
to cut expenditure and channel the savings into the repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has suspended some of its programs in the post-war
reconstruction in Angola and reduced by half the staff of its
offices in Luanda and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Zobida announced that the UNHCR together with Angola's
neighboring countries where the Angolan refugees are living will
soon launch a series of publicity campaign to make those in exile
know what is going on home.
</P>
<P>
She added that so far, there are over 10,000 foreign refugees
staying in Angola, 9,000 of whom are from Congo and 1,000 from
Rwanda. Three thousand of these foreign refugees said that they
are willing to return home.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR first set up offices in Angola in 1976. Now, their
main job is to help the war-ravaged country reconstruct the
destroyed infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals, roads and
bridges, and provide various seeds for farmers across the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Over the 20-year long civil war, a total number of three
million Angolans had become refugees, and nearly 700,000 of them
fled to the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
During the three years after peace, only some 100,000 Angolan
refugees have been repatriated. The process is slow because
there are a lot of landmines in the homeplaces of the refugees
and some roads are blocked and money is wanted.

ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here Monday China regards its relations
with Italy as an important part in its China-European relations.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a meeting with Chairman of the Italian
Chamber of Deputies Luciano Violante.
</P>
<P>
Li, the chief of the Chinese top consultative body, said the
Chinese government attaches great importance to its friendly
relations with Italy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the relations between the two countries have
developed smoothly in the political, economic and trade, cultural,
scientific and technological fields, and the two countries have
identical or similar views on many international issues, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Violante said China is becoming a more and more important
country in the world, and without China's participation, the
solution of many issues in the world, especially those in Asia,
cannot be imagined.
</P>
<P>
Developing good relations with China is very important for
Italy, Violante said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian parliament leader said the Italian Chamber of
Deputies is ready to strengthen its relations with the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Li invited Violante to visit China and Violante accepted the
invitation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Namibian President Slashes at G8 over Refusal to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The group of eight countries
were "defending their own interests" when considering debt relief
for African countries, Namibian President Sam Nujoma said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to the G8 meeting at the weekend during which
leaders failed to take concrete measures on third world debt to
the rich countries.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese official said Sunday that the G8 leaders had been
divided on the debt issue. The group only recommended that
debtor countries take internal measures making them eligible for
a debt reduction system adopted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far, only six countries have been declared eligible --
Uganda, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Guyana, Cote d'Ivoire and
Mozambique -- and only Uganda has seen its debt effectively
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing at the southern African economic
summit underway in Namibian capital Windhoek, President Nujoma
said that Namibia was not prepared to forget the legacy of
colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Namibia would only welcome genuine investment from the
international community which would build up the country and
would guarantee repatriation of profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruthless exploitation of the country's natural resources
which does not benefit Namibians will not be allowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Southern African leaders' calls for debt forgiveness for
impoverished countries have dominated the high-level summit,
which drew more than 800 senior government officials and business
leaders from 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba on Sunday joined Nujoma in calling for debt
write-off for African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday recommended extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for a further period
of six months until November 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the situation
in the Israeli-Syrian sector has remained quiet and there has been
no serious incident.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the present quiet in the Israeli-Syrian
sector, the situation in the Middle East continues to be
potentially dangerous and is likely to remain so unless and until
a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East
problem can be reached.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed the hope that determined efforts will
be made by all concerned to tackle the problem in all its aspects,
with a view to arriving at a just and durable peace settlement, as
called for by the Security Council in its resolution 338 adopted
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF, established in 1974, is aimed to monitor the
disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces.

UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Hennadiy Udovenko hopes that the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will play a new role in fulfilling the new
century's agenda.
</P>
<P>
In a message Monday to the Second WTO Ministerial Conference
now being held in Geneva, he said the future activities of the WTO
should be directed to establishing favorable conditions for the
development and diversification of international trade.
</P>
<P>
It should also be directed to strengthening commercial and
economic cooperation among countries on the basis of equality,
mutual benefit and generally accepted principles of international
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This, in turn, will help to foster more harmonious relations
among countries, enhance economic activity, and improve employment
opportunities and living standards of people around the world," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The WTO conference on May 18-20 marks the 50th anniversary of
the creation of the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the system, eight rounds of multilateral trade
negotiations have been held with "each of them making a
significant contribution to the reduction of levels of
protectionism and the lowering of tariff and non-tariff barriers
hindering international trade and international investment flows,"
the president said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Human Rights Commission Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
human rights commission and ombudsman opened here Monday with an
aim to establish human rights commission and office of the
ombudsman in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada
stressed the importance of popular participation to ensure the
implementation of human and democratic rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of democratic institutions alone is no
guarantee for the full implementation of the constitutional
provisions on human and democratic rights unless there is full
popular participation in the process of their implementation,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ethiopian federal constitution has mandated
the House of People's Representatives to establish a human rights
commission and office of the ombudsman to realize human and
democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
"With the services of these institutions, it is hoped that we
will be in a better position to investigate alleged human rights
violations," said the president. "We also hope that public
confidence and trust in democracy will be enhanced."
</P>
<P>
In his written speech to the conference, Executive Secretary
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) K.Y.
Amoako said that "human rights cannot be restricted in scope to
basic civil and political rights, important as these are in
themselves, but must be expanded to include economic, social and
cultural rights as well as the right to adequate standards of
living, the right to education, the right to work and equal pay
for equal work, and the right of minorities to enjoy their own
culture, religion and language."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "poverty is not only debilitating
physically and mentally, but it is also the worst form of human
rights violation," saying that "without some advance in its
eradication, it would be difficult to envisage an environment in
which the basic demo and civil rights of Africans, and their
rights to food security and to development, are ensured."
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim said in his written speech that the issue of
human rights is one that is at the center of the current concerns
of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the forthcoming assembly of heads of state
and government scheduled to take place in two weeks in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, will adopt the draft protocol on the
establishment of an African court on human and peoples' rights.
</P>
<P>
He also informed the participants that the OAU is in the
process of finalizing arrangements for the first ever ministerial
meeting on human rights in Africa, which will be hosted by the
Angolan government in Luanda from October 26 to 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 delegates from about 70 countries drawn from
Africa, Asia, Europe and America are attending the five-day
conference which is organized by the Ethiopian House of People's
Representatives.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Takes over Town from Junta in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The forces engaged in the mop-up
operations against the remnants of Sierra Leone's dislodged
military junta has won a new victory by taking over a town in the
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG and allied civil
defense group Kamajors Sunday recaptured the diamond-rich town of
Gandon, the last stronghold of the junta remnants and allied
rebels in the Kono district, the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, 92 junta troops were killed and 24 others
captured, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The recapturing of Gandon by ECOMOG has completely put the
junta forces in disarray as the area was used as a base for
launching ambushes on a nearby major highway and other towns in
the east.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted local people as saying that after the fall
of Gandon Town, the junta forces have resorted to attacking
villages and killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The atrocities of the junta and rebel allies have forced
people to flee to take refuge in another town, where the
situation is serious because of absence of aid agencies to supply
relief items.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG soldiers have to reserve the people with food from
their rations.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force drove the junta out of the capital
Freetown in mid-February and has since been carrying out a mop-up
exercise in the north and east of the country where remnants of
the junta and allied rebels are in hide.

UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly
President Hennadiy Udovenko said Monday that the continuing
relevance and growing importance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
is especially evident at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Ministerial Meeting of the NAM Coordinating
Bureau to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, on May 19-20, he noted
that the NAM represents about two-thirds of the U.N. membership
and its constructive involvement in world affairs has been "a key
factor" in assuring progress in revitalizing the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"Facing a drastically changed environment of the post-Cold War
era, the movement has met the new challenges by reaffirming its
fundmental principles and refocusing its energies in the quest for
a more just, secure and equitable world," the message said.
</P>
<P>
"As an organization representing the greater part of humanity,
you serve as a mouthpiece for many of those nations that have
often had their voices drowned out by the loud chorus of global
politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the Cartagena meeting will mark
another important step in advancing the NAM cause, especially as
it is preparing for the next NAM summit.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Have Joint Telecom Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
are working on a joint telecommunications strategy to accelerate
the region's integration in the field, South African Post and
Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
By June 1, 2000, a regional framework will be in place that
will be attractive to local and international investors, Naidoo
said. He is attending the southern Africa economic forum in
Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
"It will include a data bank of African expertise, human
resources and capacity-building in information technology and
telecommunications," South African Press Association quoted
Naidoo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The countries had already begun coordinating the region's
regulatory environments for the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Less than one percent of Africans have access to a telephone
and those that do can not always get a dial tone, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that regional markets and frameworks have to be
developed because individual countries are too small to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
African countries are also developing the African
telecommunications development fund to provide finance for
regional projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to wire the continent and give it a backbone
with cellular satellites, submarine lines and land lines," Naidoo
said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend developing not only telephony but access to the
internet and through that tele-medicine, tele-health,
tele-agriculture and tele-education," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Blocking Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday accused the United
States of continuing to hinder the work of the United Nations
Sanctions Committee by impeding the implementation of contracts
concluded under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity, said
the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson has created bogus
pretexts to delay the implementation of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
The contracts involve importing medicine, soap, spare parts for
agricultural, industrial and water projects, but Richardson raised
the suspicion that the contracts may allow Iraq to import products
which could be used for military purpose, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The suspended contracts for the second and third phases of the
oil-for-food deal have shown the hatred and enmity of the U.S.
administration to the Iraqi people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said there are 36 contracts suspended at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee for buying items for the ministries
of trade, health, agriculture, industry and education.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq can sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food and
medicine. Iraq began to carry out the deal in December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's distribution plans of the goods must be approved by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The deal is an exception of U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. of blocking the approval of
contracts it has concluded with foreign companies under the deal.

<HEADLINE> France, Egypt Make Peace Appeal on Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
his Egyptian counterpart, Hosni Mubarak, Monday made a joint
appeal for relaunching the Middle East peace process and proposed
an international conference on it.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued after holding a summit in the Elysee
presidential palace, the two presidents stressed that the
Palestinians have the right to establish their own independent
state.
</P>
<P>
"We propose a conference by countries resolved for peace. This
conference should maintain and confirm all the principles and
agreements which already exist... and seize the protagonists to
give a new hope, a new elan to the peace process," they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the security of Israel cannot be guaranteed
except by a "just, lasting and global" peace arrangement of its
conflict with Palestinians and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"We, Presidents of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the French
Republic, express our extreme concern over the persistent impasse
in which the Middle East peace process is situated in all its
parts... particularly in the Palestinian part," they said.
</P>
<P>
They praised the United States for the latest peace efforts it
has been making after Israel and Palestinians, and paid homage to
the Palestinians for their "latest positive reaction" to the U.S.
peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We launch a pressing appeal to the Israeli government so that
it responds now in a positive and constructive manner to these
(U.S.) proposals," they said.
</P>
<P>
They warned Israel that any more delay will result in more
frustration among the Palestinians and will lead "inevitably" to
violence and instability in the Palestinian territories, as the
past few weeks have shown.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm solemnly our attachment to the peace process
launched in Madrid. We think firmly that security cannot be
assured except by the establishment of a just, lasting and global
peace in the Middle East," said the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
They said that a peace agreement between Palestinians and
Israel should be based on the 242, 338 and 425 resolutions of the
United Nations Security Council, as well as the the principles
reached upon in Madrid, mainly an exchange of land for peace and a
realization of the legitimate political rights of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"For us, that should lead to the accomplishment of the right
for the Palestinian people to establish their own independent
state on the basis of their right to self-determination," they
said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Mubarak also called on Israel to "strictly and
loyally" respect the agreements signed in Oslo between the former
government of Israel and Palestinians, and abstain from unilateral
measures countering these agreements, in particular colonization
of Arab lands by Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
They also appealed to Israel, Lebanon and Syria to resume peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
They finally called on the United States, the European Union
and Russia to take up their responsibilities and "persevere in
their efforts to overcome the obstacles which block the resumption
and the success of the peace process."

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on Factions to Accept Different </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Monday called on Iranian rival political factions to accept
different viewpoints over the country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Khatami told the annual gathering of Friday prayers leaders in
the holy city of Qom, central Iran, that "different tastes" are
acceptable under the present system, the evening newspaper Kayhan
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We should accept different tastes so that our young
generation will realize that their social positions, identities
and security are guaranteed," he said, adding that it is natural
for the people to have different tastes and it is impossible for
all of the people to have only one taste and to think in a single
way.
</P>
<P>
But the president stressed that people with "different tastes"
should abide by laws, particularly the country's constitution, in
order to make sure that the system would not be damaged by the
"different tastes."
</P>
<P>
Khatami criticized certain people and groups for not
tolerating different views of others, saying that a group of
people even showed harsh reaction to a speech by chairman of the
State Expediency Council, former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani at the Friday prayers congregation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some people angrily lashed out at Rafsanjani at a
Friday prayers congregation when the former president openly
defended the moderate Tehran Mayor, Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who
had been temporally detained for 10 days by the conservative
judiciary on embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives and the coalition of leftists and moderates
lined up against each other over Karbaschi's detention, forcing
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step in to prevent
further escalation of tension.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the mayor's release under Khamenei's order, the
rival factions are continuing to criticize each other and some
hard-liners even violently attacked their rivals.
</P>
<P>
With the continuing factional struggle, the conservative Majlis
Speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, on Sunday strongly called on
political factions in the country to set aside their differences
in order to form a united front against "enemies' conspiracies."
</P>
<P>
"We should all be alert and refrain factional disputes so as
to prevent a third party from entering the scene with the purpose
of harming the principles of the (Islamic) revolution," he
stressed.

ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here Monday that Turkey is very concerned about the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the presidential palace said Demirel has sent a
letter to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton which calls for more
efforts to help remove the obstacles blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Demirel pointed out that through his contacts with the leaders
of the Arab countries and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, he
found that the Arab world is "deeply concerned" about the
situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The worsening atmosphere would help the extreme force increase
in the region, he was quoted in the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is willing to make contributions and spare great
efforts in providing support for the removal of the obstacle that
blocks the Mideast Peace Process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's statement is regarded as an effort to help ease the
hard feelings harbored by Arab countries against Turkey's close
ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a time when the U.S. recent efforts to
revive the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, which has been
stalled for 15 months due to Israel's hardline policies, have
failed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegate to the
international conference on human rights Monday called on the
interanional community to pay full attention to the contributions
and roles in human rights played by the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the human rights forum organized here by the
Ethiopian House of People's Representatives, Zeng Jianhui,
Chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's
Congress of People's Republic of China said that international
community should "take into full consideration the changes of the
world situation and carry on, develop and assimilate all
outstanding achievements of civilizations of the East, the West,
the South and the North."
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we should listen attentively to the voice of
the Asian, African and Latin-American countries that have just
obtained their independence in recent 20 to 30 years," the
Chinese delegate said.
</P>
<P>
"Their demands, efforts and experiences in promoting and
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms should be taken
into full consideration. Only by doing so, international human
rights could achieve sustained and comprehensive progress."
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that since the establishment of the United Nations
organization, the developing countries, with their own views and
experiences, "have injected powerful vitality into the
development of concepts and practice of human rights of the U.N.
system, facilitating the formation of new concepts and norms of
human rights of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"The Proclamation of Teheran, the Declaration on the Right to
Development as well as Resolution 32/130 of the General Assembly
entitled New Concepts of Human Rights, are the most outstanding
examples of the developing countries' contributions to the
conceptual development of human rights," said the Chinese
delegate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "for many years, the developing countries
have been advocating that, firstly, economic, social and cultural
rights and civil and political rights are indivisible and equally
important."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, the collective human rights such as the right of
peoples to self-determination, the right to development, peace
and environment are indispensable part of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, while dealing with human rights issue, the U.N.
system should first seek to resolve large-scaled gross violations
of human rights by all forms of racism, colonialism and
hegemonism. It shall also seek to overcome the obstacles to the
realization of economic, social and cultural rights in the
developing countries as a result of unjust international economic
order.
</P>
<P>
"Fourthly, the basic approach for international community to
promote human rights is international cooperation, which should
be based on profound knowledge to problems of different societies
as well as full respect to their current economic, social and
cultural situations.
</P>
<P>
"The above positions of the developing countries stand for the
great progress in the field of human rights by international
community and reflect the common aspiration of people in the
world," said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
He also said: "Since the end of cold war, on the one hand, the
force of peace and justice are increasing -- the issue of
development receives more attention; multipolarization and
international cooperation are gaining momentum."
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, cold war mentality still exists. Problems
of poverty, hunger and malnutrition as a result of
underdevelopment in many developing countries remain serious," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
"These problems not only affected progress of mankind and
world development, but also become major challenges to the
development of world human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Confronting with the challenges and looking forward to the
21st century, we believe that on the one hand, the international
community should properly grasp and handle the relationship
between universality and particularity of human rights, deal with
all human rights in a more comprehensive and balanced manner, and
conduct practical international human rights cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we can create favorable international conditions
for all countries, especially the developing countries to realize
all human rights and fundamental freedoms," Zeng added.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, based on their national conditions,
governments should adopt practical measures to promote and
protect human rights of their own people," Zeng said. " In this
regard, we believe that the establishment of national human
rights institutions is one of the effective measures."
</P>
<P>
"The Vienna Declaration and Program of Action reaffirms the
important and constructive role played by national institutions
for the promotion and protection of human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Each state has the right to choose the best suited framework,
according to its particular needs, to establish or strengthen
national institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of national institutions does not have to
follow a fixed pattern," the Chinese delegate said. "Instead of
rigidly adhering to the form of governmental department or
paraofficial institutions, each state may adopt different forms
according to its concrete conditions."
</P>
<P>
"What matters is the real and effective promotion and
protection of human rights by the institution," Zeng emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"China has always attached great importance to the question of
human rights and has actively supported and joined in the efforts
to promote human rights by international community," he said in
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, China has been making its own contribution to
enrich the connotation of human rights and to promote the full
respect for human rights."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate added that "China is ready to make
unremitting efforts to bring a world of peace, stability,
economic development and full enjoyment of human rights into the
21st century with the international community."

<HEADLINE> No Bargaining on Border Areas Occupied: Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government will
not enter into negotiations when its border has been violated
with the northwestern part of its territory occupied, Ethiopian
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ethiopian News Agency, the Ethiopian
foreign minister said that the Eritrean government and the ruling
party should heed to the decisions of the Ethiopian government on
the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of forces from
occupied territories of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful dialog is unthinkable unless Eritrea relinquishes
occupied areas and subsequent reestablishment of the status-quo
is carried out, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, current Chairman of the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) President
Hassen Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti and a U.S. envoy have begun
consultations with senior government officials including
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Foreign Minister Seyoum
to bring about a negotiated settlement to the dispute. The third
party has also had contacts with the Eritrean government.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor for war... we are looking for peace and
sustainable mutual development," Seyoum said, adding that "this
is our firm stand to which we are committed."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum is expected to brief the diplomatic corps here Tuesday
on the border brawl between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the agency
said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report on health and
the environment released Monday warned of increasing human health
risks due to poor environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Environmental Change and Human Health, was
jointly released by the World Resources Institute, the United
Nations Development Program, the U.N. Environment Program and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report described how, despite vast improvements in human
health and longer life spans, premature deaths due to
environmental causes are occurring in alarmingly high numbers in
poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an estimated one in five children in
the developing world will not live to see their fifth birthdays
because of environmentally-related diseases or ailments.
</P>
<P>
These include acute respiratory infections due to indoor air
pollution from poor cooking fuels, diarrhea related to poor
sanitation and unsafe drinking water supplies, and malaria.
Pesticide poisonings also claim over 3.5 million lives a year in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The report called for improved environmental management to
eliminate these health risks, and strategies for governments,
development agencies, policy groups and communities to halt
further deterioration.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Pledges to Play Active Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
pledged on Monday that he will continue to play an active
role in advancing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration of his second term as president of
the state, Weizman said that the relations between Israel and
its neighboring Arab countries and the Palestinians are currently
"at a low point."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the whole peace process "needs help" and
he will do his best to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also noted that he will make efforts to solve some
social problems, including bridging the gaps between secular and
ultra-orthodox segments of society.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was reelected to a five-year term by the Knesset
(parliament) on March 14.
</P>
<P>
Although the presidential duties in Israel are mostly
ceremonial, Weizman is so popular in the country that his
influence on the political spectrum should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Born in Tel Aviv in 1924, Weizman is the second president
in his family, following the footsteps of his uncle, Chaim
Weizman, the renowned scientist and Zionist leader who was
Israel's first president.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was one of the founders of Israel Air Forces. And the
high point of his public service came during his tenure as
defense minister from 1977 to 1980, when he played a pivotal role
in the Camp David negotiations leading to the signing of the
peace treaty with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreak Kills 20 People in Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of cholera
has amounted to 20, Dar es Salaam city council health officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who are busy chlorinating some of the wells in
the city, said that cholera has resurfaced at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been affected by the epidemic since
early this month following a water crisis which lasted nearly 10
days, they said.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, a section of water pipeline in the west outskirts of
the capital city was washed away by floods, cutting off tap water
supplies to more than one million residents and forcing many to
fetch water from contaminated shallow wells.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that people should boil drinking water, wash
fruits and vegetables before eating, clean houses and refrain
from eating snack along the street.
</P>
<P>
They said that observing hygiene is of prime importance for
controlling the epidemic in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam City Health Commissioner, Dr. Job Laiza, has
advised residents to report immediately to nearest emergency care
centers whenever they noticed cholera symptoms, saying most
deaths occurred as a result of delayed treatment.
</P>
<P>
The government has released essential drugs in different
centers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that cholera has so far claimed 319 lives
and affected 10,000 others in various parts of Dar es Salaam
since last year.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- About 132 million women in 28
countries in Africa including Ethiopia have undergone female
genital mutilation, president of the Ethiopian Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Seyoum Yoseph said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth Annual Conference of the society in

with abduction, rape and early marriage as "grave problems" in
Ethiopia, saying that the moral, psychological and social impacts
that such harmful practices inflicted on women are being observed
daily.

Atrocities on women are compounded by the ever increasing
maternal mortality caused by complications of pregnancy and child
birth, he said.

According to the Minsitry of Health of Ethiopia, maternal
mortality rate in Ethiopia, estimated at 700 per 100,000 live

<HEADLINE> Lagos Adopts New Measure to Improve Fuel Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The state government of Lagos, the
economic hub center of Nigeria, Monday announced the introduction
of a new method to sell fuel in a fresh effort to relieve the
lingering fuel scarcity.
</P>
<P>
State Administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa told transport
operators at the state secretariat that from now on the "odd and
even" vehicle registration number would be adopted in the sale of
fuel in the state.
</P>
<P>
The order would take effect from Tuesday with vehicles whose
numbers start with even figures, he said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, all vehicles on essential services, including those
of the armed forces, police, customs, immigration, prisons, fire
brigade and ambulances, would be exempted from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Embassy vehicles and all commercial vehicles are also exempted
and special filling stations would be designated for the latter.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Marwa has warned filling stations to
be ready to use all their pumps to dispense fuel, adding that
those with faulty pumps had been given 24 hours to repair them.
</P>
<P>
The arrangment would be backed by an edict "though the measure
is for a temporary period till the fuel situation normalizes".
</P>
<P>
Fuel shortage has been haunting about Nigeria, the leading oil
producer in Africa, in recent years due to the poor situation of
its refineries.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been getting worse in the past few months
when fuel scarcity, coupled with erratic power supply, brought
losses to businesses estimated at millions of U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
The daily life of Nigerians, especially the low incomers, has
also been seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
As the former national capital which still remains as the
business center of the country, Lagos suffers most.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government started from early last year imported
petroleum products to feed the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
However, as fuel is sold at a very low official price, part of
the shipment has been diverted to neighboring countries for
better profits, leaving the fuel scarcity to continue at home.
</P>
<P>
While the whole country was moving to improve fuel supply,
Marwa launched his "Operation 72 Hours" a week ago in a bid to
end the scarcity.
</P>
<P>
According to Marwa, enough fuel was already in hand and 2,000
personnel had been mobilzed to ensure normal distribution of
fuel, and the scarcity could be killed by Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Filling stations resumed business after the measure and long
queues could be seen everywhere around a filling station.
However, as of Monday, the queues are still as long as several
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Marwa had to admit the failure of the 72-hour promise he made
for the availability of fuel.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the failure to the panic buying by motorists for
storing at home for future use although "it is a time bomb
waiting to explode".
</P>
<P>
It is still early to forecast the fate of the
"odd-and-even-number" measure, but people are expecting not to
waste much time queuing in front of a filling station when the
supply is seemly ensured.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Monday that his government was encouraged by
the new findings in the death of former President Samora Machel.
</P>
<P>
The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission recently
declared that it had found out "new evidence" proving that the
armed forces of "the apartheid regime" were involved in the
assassination of former Mozambican president 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is positive that the South African government
continues probing into the causes of the Mbuziji tragedy," the
Mozambican News Agency Monday quoted Prime Minister Mocumbi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the revelation of the South African Truth and
Reconciliation Commission "again proves our longstanding view,
i.e. the armed forces of 'the apartheid regime' had been involved
in the Mbuziji incident."
</P>
<P>
According to a release issued by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission of South Africa Monday, one investigator of the
commission has found out new evidence proving that members of the
former South African armed forces were involved in the
assassination of Mozambique's first president Samora Machel and
one officer of South Africa's former military intelligence and
two members of former army will be secretly tried in Cape Town on
June 4.
</P>
<P>
For security, the names of the three to be tried were not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was
established in 1995 in a bid to probe into the political crimes
during the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
Samora Machel and his entourage were all killed when their
special Tupolev 134 plane crashed on its way home on October 19,
1986, in South Africa's Mbuziji, five kms away from Mozambican
border town of Namaacha.
</P>
<P>
It has been 11 years since the tragedy took place, but so far
there is still no definite explanation for the causes of the air
crash.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office announced
Monday that the six-nation Contact Group has agreed to ease
sanctions on Yugoslavia after Belgrade opened a dialogue with
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on a political settlement of
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign office said in a statement that the Contact Group
steering peace efforts in former Yugoslavia agreed not to put into
effect the proposed measure to stop new investment in Serbia
announced on May 9 in London.
</P>
<P>
"The Contact Group is encouraged by the fact that President
Milosevic has taken personal responsibility for the start of
dialogue, and now looks to him to show that he has made a clear
choice to work with the international community rather than to
face the deepening isolation which otherwise confronts him," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The group, which comprises the United States., Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia, earlier held a meeting last Saturday in
Birmingham and welcomed the talks between Yugoslavia President

establish a Working Group to continue the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Contact Group also agreed it would
review at its next meeting later this month implementation of the
freeze on the funds held abroad by the Yugoslavian and Serbian
governments, and other measures of sanction will also be reviewed.

Meanwhile, the group expressed serious concern about the
continuing violence on the ground in Kosovo and agreed to press
both sides to reject violence and give dialogue every chance to
succeed, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Strong Economic Upswing in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by 3.5 percent to four percent in real terms in the first
quarter of this year when compared with the same period a year
ago, the German Economics Ministry announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth was attributable mainly to the continued
export boom as well as clearly revitalized domestic investment and
private consumption, the ministry said in the latest economic
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union ruled out any
boycott on Israeli exports, an official of the 15-nation body said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Colli Carbo, spokesman for European Commissioner Munuel
Marin who is in charge of relations with the Middle East, made the
remark in response to a statement by Israeli Prime Minister

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, returning from a five-day Washington trip, said the
group could deny itself a role in the Middle East process if an
Israeli goods boycott came out.
</P>
<P>
"That will put an end to any attempt of the EU to have any kind
of facilitating role in the peace process," said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Despite any signs of Israeli goods being barred, the commission
spokesman said the E.U. is investigating a series of alleged
frauds involving imports.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had launched an investigation into a
labeling fraud regarding orange juice, which was labeled as `Made
in Israel' but was produced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Castro Blasts U.S. Sanctions Against Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro has
condemned the United States for its unilateral sanctions against
developing countries and urged the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to prevent "economic genocide."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the WTO meeting here Tuesday to mark the 50th
anniversary of the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Castro said that up to now the U.S. had
made some 40 decisions to impose economic sanctions against 75
countries, which represent 42 percent of the world population.
</P>
<P>
On the WTO's future activities, Castro did not agree to launch
new rounds of negotiations in the coming years, arguing that the
competitiveness of the developing countries would be weakened if
negotiations on areas dominated by the developed countries began.
</P>
<P>
"The third world countries have been losing everything," he
said. "We must convert the WTO into an instrument of struggle for
a better and more just world."
</P>
<P>
His speech received warm and long applause from the audience,
many of whom are trade ministers attending the ongoing second WTO
ministerial conference.

MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry stated
on Tuesday that Russia intends to firmly adhere to its commitment
regarding the nonproliferation of missiles and weapons of mass

</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a news

importance of the commitment both in Moscow and in Birmingham,
Britain, where the president attended the Summit of Group Eight.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States agreed to take measures to
strengthen controls over weapons of mass destruction and exports
of dual-purpose technology at the Birmingham summit, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, Russia has strengthened its control
over exports of sensitive Russian goods and technology, under the
instruction of the president, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trading companies should request permission for the
export of Russian goods and services when there is a possibility
the goods and services can be used to make missiles or weapons
of mass destruction, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rakhmanin said that special export control agencies
will be set up among all enterprises dealing with the supply of
missiles or nuclear technologies.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Beijing Furniture Market Fire Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The overheating of the coil of an
electric bell triggered the May 5 fire that destroyed the
Yuquanying Furniture Center, the largest furniture market in the
Chinese capital, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau concluded, after a thorough investigation, that the
overheated coil in an electric bell in the northern hall of the
furniture center made combustible objects around it catch fire,
including a sofa underneath the bell.
</P>
<P>
The center complex, covering 17,000 sq m, is located in Fengtai
District, some ten km from Tiananmen Square. The fire razed the
center to ground. The first batch of compensation of five million
yuan (about 620,000 US dollars) has already been paid by Huatai
Insurance Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Firefighting inspections have been conducted among the city's
seven furniture centers and 15 other key working units since the
fire disaster. The inspections found the firefighting facilities
in these units to be in poor conditon, and efforts have been made
to strengthen firefighting work there.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Face Denmark in Semi-finals at Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
will play Denmark while runners-up China take on South Korea in
the semi-finals after group competitions closed at the 17th Uber
Cup Badminton Finals here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the top place of Group B after a 3-2 victory over
three-time runners-up South Korea Tuesday afternoon and South
Korea took the second place.
</P>
<P>
And England downed the Netherlands 4-1 to take the third place
of Group B.
</P>
<P>
China, runners-up from last championships, scored an easy 5-0
win over Denmark Tuesday evening and won the top place of Group A.
Denmark, who had lost to China four times, finished second in the
group.
</P>
<P>
Denmark fielded a comparatively weak side against China Tuesday
evening, in an obvious move later confirmed by its head coach
Henrik Lyngby to reserve for a semi-final show-down with Indonesia
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have a chance against Indonesia out there,
although with difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
It cost China's world number three Gong Zhichao 27 minutes to
beat her Danish opponent Mette Sorensen, ranked 14th in the world.
The 20-year-old Gong lost 1-2 to Japanese Yasuko Mizui, now ranked
31st in the world, in China's only setback so far at the current
world women's team championships.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not quite used to the wind over the court," she said
after her win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Beating hosts Hong Kong, China 5-0 in a marathon-style match
Tuesday evening, Japan took the third place of Group A.
</P>
<P>
"Denmark have a very strong first doubles pair," Imelda
Wigueno, Indonesia's Uber Cup coach, said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After a close three-game Indonesian win over the Danes in the
Japan Open early this year, the coach predicted her team to have
only a 50-50 chance in the two doubles in a semi-final clash with
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Mia Audina, 18, Indonesia's Olympic silver-medalist from the
1992 Games in Barcelona, declined to predict her chance against
Gong Zhichao if they face each other in the final.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cup group competitions will close on Wednesday. Last
championships' runners-up Denmark will play China to decide Group
A's winners as the two had already booked berths in the
semi-finals. And semi-finals qualifiers Indonesia and Malaysia
will clash for the first place of Group B.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Direct Sales (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Direct sales entered into China eight years ago and soon became
a common practice in more than 30 cities.
</P>
<P>
Experience, however, showed that direct sales were
a negative element disturbing economic order and affecting
social stability. Li explained that China is still in the
initial stage of the socialist market economy, with the market
still not fully developed and consumers' psychology not yet mature.
</P>
<P>
Some people marketed fake and shoddy goods at prices several
times higher than in normal stores, engaging in illegal
competition and evading taxes; others lured direct sellers by
promising high returns, and then absconded with the money that
the gullible people paid them.
</P>
<P>
Some direct-sale enterprises marketed commodities banned by the
State. They smuggled raw materials from abroad and sold them after
packaging the products as domestic goods. Some actually promoted
direct sales with superstitious activities, phoney religions,
gangsterism and indecent behavior.
</P>
<P>
The result was rampant social problems, such as street violence
and family breakups, said Zhou Xiaozheng, a professor at the
Sociology Department of the People's University of China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Bans Direct Sales (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Direct sales have now been
basically banned in China.
</P>
<P>
This is not directed against foreign enterprises or investors,
Li Bida, director of the Fair Transaction Bureau of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), said in an
interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales by domestic enterprises have also been
forbidden, Li added.
</P>
<P>
While foreign direct-sales enterprises, after receiving
approval, may engage in chain store and retail business, domestic
ones should change to normal store management. Work on this aspect
will be finished by the end of October this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAIC is taking active measures to help direct sellers become
employed in other sectors and try to minimize their losses. Most
erstwhile direct sellers are now in normal business, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Though China has banned direct sales, foreign investors will
still be encouraged to participate in retail sales and material
distribution in other forms, said Yang Cheng, an official from the
State Administration for Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales, compared with store sales, are a method by which
goods are sold to consumers directly. This form of merchandizing
started in the 1950s, when the US was suffering an economic
depression. Incomplete statistics show that direct sales worldwide
were worth 67.3 billion US dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Ning Bo Completes Gold Double in National Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAODING, North China, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ning Bo from Liaoning
Province, winner of the women's 400-meter individual medley on the
opening day, made a gold double by claiming the 100m butterfly on
the fifth day of the Chinese national swimming championships here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old touched home in one minute 1.75 seconds for the
win, with Ruan Yi finishing second in 1:01.92 and Qiu Jin third in
1:02.35.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very lucky to make a gold double," Ning said. "In
yesterday's preliminaries, I finished a distance 17th place,
squeezing into the semi-finals thanks to another swimmer's
disqualification."
</P>
<P>
Ning was not satisfied with her time though she felt very
excited when standing at the top of the podium.
</P>
<P>
"My personal best was 1:00.08 last year. Anyway, I felt very
good to win the gold today," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan from Jiangsu Province captured the women's 100m
backstroke in 1:03.23, ahead of Wu Xuejia in 1:03.41 and Lu
Donghua in 1:04.77.
</P>
<P>
In the men's events, Wang Guojun won the 1,500m freestyle in
15:49.79 while Du Jie, winner of the 100m freestyle yesterday,
also achieved a gold double after taking the 200m freestyle in
1:51.97.
</P>
<P>
World champion Chen Yan from Liaoning Province dominated the
semifinals in the women's 200m freestyle in 2:02.85.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Direct Sales (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A SAIC investigation shows that more than half of urban
consumers have been cheated by direct-sale goods, and 96 percent
of the consumers believe that the banning of direct sales
protects consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Chinese government had also tried to
develop direct sales, a new commercial activity, in an appropriate
way.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China met with many difficulties in
banning illegal direct sales because of relatively poor
legislation and covert transactions by direct sellers.
</P>
<P>
Four years after the emergence of Guangzhou Yafang, China's
first direct-sale company, the SAIC issued a rule that permitted
multi-level direct sales and approved dozens of enterprises of
this kind, but the collapse of illegal direct sales operations
started only five months later.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided to put a halt to multi-level
direct-sale companies in October 1995, and the SAIC had banned 114
such enterprises by April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The SAIC issued the Regulation on Direct Sales Management in
January last year to show the government's determination to
streamlining the sector. Last September, the administration approved
53 multi-level direct-sale companies and 465 single-level ones.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular banning all direct sales
last month.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Warns of Protectionism in Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore warned on Tuesday of
the rising danger of protectionism in the developed countries in
the face of cheaper exports from Asian countries which are
affected by the current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In his message marking the 50th anniversary commemoration of
the world multilateral trading system, Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said that "even of greater danger are possible errors in the
policy responses of the developed economies" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The crisis-stricken Asian countries will recover through cheap
exports because of their depreciated currencies, Goh noted.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to strong political pressure in the major
markets to protect their affected industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There may be rampant use of safeguards and anti-dumping
actions to protect domestic industries against competition from
the recovering Asian economies," the prime minister pointed out,
adding that recent workers agitation in Europe may be a precursor
to these market closing activities.
</P>
<P>
If the multilateral trading system fails to support the
recovery of the troubled Asian economies, it would reinforce
demands for bilateral and regional arrangements, he said, noting
that at present, more than 100 bilateral or regional agreements
are in place.
</P>
<P>
However, Goh said, regionalism cannot provide the same
efficiency as equal access under a multilateral trading system.
The proliferation of regional trading arrangements could fragment
the world economy into competitive trading blocs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They could in time create economic rifts, and be an underlying
cause for global tension and possibly conflicts," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "It is essential that regional initiatives
reinforce rather than detract from the multilateral trading
system."
</P>
<P>
It will be a challenge for the World Trade Organization (WTO)
to manage relations between regional and multilateral trade
liberalization, and to ensure that regional integration agreements
open up further trade liberalization under the multilateral
trading system, he said.

<HEADLINE> International Condemnation of Indian N-Tests Righteous: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The condemnation by the
international community of India's recent nuclear tests is a fully
righteous one, said Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark when meeting with Takemura Masayoshi, a
representative of the Sokagakkai Party of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that he considered India's tests "a serious matter,"
in particular as they took place in spite of the fact that 140-odd
countries worldwide have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"It is even more unacceptable that India claimed to have
conducted the tests to counter what it called a 'China threat,'"
Qian said, adding that this claim is a "hollow excuse". He went on
to say that if India is not stopped from conducting more nuclear
tests, there will be a possibility of a new round of arms race in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Japanese relations, Qian said that China places great
importance on President Jiang Zemin's fall state visit to Japan,
saying the visit is a major event for the two countries. He said
that he hoped that the top leaders of the two countries can reach
a consensus on Sino-Japanese relations well into the 21st
century. "China and Japan should contribute to world peace and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Masayoshi said that the Japanese side will spare no effort to
ensure the success of Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
On the Japan-US security pact, Qian said that the document
should be confined to the two countries. "Neither the Taiwan
Strait nor other Asian country or region should be placed within
the framework of the pact," Qian said, adding that the Chinese
government is highly concerned over the issue.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Masayoshi said that Japan has already
committed to adhering to the "one China" policy and acknowledging
that the Taiwan issue is an "internal problem" of China, so Japan
should honor its commitment.
</P>
<P>
Masayoshi and his party came to China at the invitation of the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns EU not to Boycott Imports From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu warned Tuesday that European Union's boycott of import
from Jewish settlements would "put an end" to any EU attempt to
play a role in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of financial analysts in Tel Aviv,
Netanyahu said that implementation of the boycott, suggested by
the European Commission last week, would be a clear signal that
the EU was "one-sided" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In its report to EU ministers, the EU executive commission
proposed last Wednesday that those goods produced in Jewish
settlements in occupied territories be excluded from the benefits
of the Israeli-European trade treaty when they enter the EU.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it suspects that many of the goods under a
"Made in Israel", including agricultural products, processed
commodities and flowers, are in fact produced in "east Jerusalem,
the Golan Heights, West Bank and Gaza Strip". Under
Israeli-European trade agreements, those goods "substantially"
manufactured elsewhere than in Israel cannot be exported into the
EU as if originated in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a response last week that
the European Commission's document constitutes an attempt to
prejudge Israel's borders before these have been duly determined
within the framework of negotiations with its neighbors.

<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada hopes to take the lead in
investing in central and western China, visiting Canadian Industry
Minister John Manley declared here today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian enterprises should establish businesses quickly in
central and western China, where significant economic growth is
emerging, he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Chongqing, which became China's fourth
municipality last year, and said it is located in "one of China's
most energetic areas".
</P>
<P>
The minister and representatives from 21 Canadian enterprises
will visit the municipality on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canada plans to open its fourth consulate in China there,
Manley confirmed, and disclosed that former Canadian Consul to
Guangzhou Mary Boyd, who has been promoting Canadian-China trade
in general, would be the consul in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Canadian bank will also set up a branch there.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner businesses participate, the better," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has started to formulate more incentive
policies for investors in central and western regions, where
enterprises from Japan are already doing business.
</P>
<P>
Manley said that he hoped Canada would not be slower than Japan
in investing there. He said that he hoped that Canada's exporting
enterprises would double their presence there by the end of the
century.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stocks Continue to Tumble on Panic Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index continued to tumble Tuesday as both foreign and
local institutions came in heavily to sell on the news that market
leader Hub Power Company Ltd. (Hubco) was entering into a legal
battle with the government for its survival.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling in Hubco shares put pressure on the bourse as
traders panicked and went into heavy selling.
</P>
<P>
While traders are in a pessimistic mood because of the economic
implications of Pakistan proceeding with its possible nuclear
test, the Lahore High Court's decision on lowering the power
tariffs with independent power producer (IPP) Hubco till a time
the court decides the case, further dampened sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that while a debt repayment of Hubco is
coming up on July 10, the summer vacation of the court in July may
mean that the case can drag on for months.
</P>
<P>
The case has been initiated through a petition by a private
citizen who argued that Hubco power tariffs were too high. Till a
decision is taken, the court has ordered that the power tariffs be
fixed at 1.50 rupee per kilowatt hour (KWH) (44.11 rupee to one
U.S. dollar) against the 4.50 rupee per KWH that the state power
utility company currently pays to the IPPs.
</P>
<P>
"Under the tariff given by the high court, Hubco will not be
able to sustain its finances and is therefore facing a battle for
its survival," said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index lost 68.27 points Tuesday to close at
1,306.07 points against Monday's closing of 1,374.34.
</P>
<P>
A total of 87.50 million shares were traded Tuesday against
102.40 million shares traded the previous day. There were 13
gainers and 89 losers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect further pressure in the stock market Wednesday.
Some, however, predict that there may be a technical correction
which will bring the index up to the 1,350 level by the weekend.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy on Smooth Track in January-April Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's economy maintained smooth
operations during the first four months of this year, while the
central government's policies for expanding domestic demand and
investment in infrastructure took effect, according to a monthly
report released by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) here today.
</P>
<P>
During the January-April period, China generated an industrial
added value of 608.7 billion yuan, up 7.9 percent on an annual
basis. However, the growth rate was 3.5 percentage points down
from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the industrial sector should be regarded as a
result of the Asian financial crisis in addition to shrinking
consumption both at home and abroad, said the SSB report.
</P>
<P>
In April, the imports of industrial products increased by 7.2
percent on the basis of the same month of 1997. This growth rate
was 12.3 percentage points down.
</P>
<P>
The country's investment in fixed assets amounted to 271.3
billion yuan in the first four months of this year,
representing a year-on-year increase of 12.2 percent. The
increase was 1.9 percentage points lower than the average
for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
A year-on-year increase of 15.3 percent in investment was
registered in April.
</P>
<P>
During the January-April period, the investment in capital
construction projects grew by 11.7 percent from the same period
of 1997. That in technical renovation and upgrading projects, and
the real estate sector increased by 11.4 percent and 12.7
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's retail sales amounted to 938.8 billion
yuan-worth, up 6.9 percent over the previous year's figure. The
retail markets registered a seven-percent increase in cities and a
6.7-percent rise in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB report, China registered a foreign trade
volume of 27.64 billion US dollars-worth in April, up 6.3 percent
on an annual basis. Included were an export volume of 15.95
billion dollars-worth, up 7.9 percent over the same period of
1997, and an import volume of 11.69 billion
dollars-worth. Compared with the figure for the first quarter, the
increase for exports decreased by 5.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year exports amounted to
56.19 billion dollars-worth, a year-on-year increase of 11.6
percent. Imports stood at 41.29 billion dollars-worth, up
3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, retail prices went down by 1.9 percent, while consumer
prices rose by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
To create an economic rebound as soon as possible, China
should further expand domestic demand and increase the investment
in infrastructure projects. Furthermore, the government should
offer more aid to the enterprises with good market potential and
efficiency, while building a more efficient economic structure
nationwide, the report recommended.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Allays Fears of Drastic Changes in Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday
allayed fears of some local officials that there will be drastic
changes in the socio-economic policies of the government once a
new administration takes over on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that their fears have no basis since all the
presidential candidates in the May 11 elections have committed
themselves to pursue the reforms initiated by the current
government.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with local officials in central Bicol
province, Ramos said front running candidate Vice President Joseph
Estrada had assured him Monday that he will continue
socio-economic programs initiated by the current government.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also confirmed that he has accepted Estrada's offer to
become the emerging winner's "most senior adviser" in the future.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos was quick to stress that his acceptance of the offer
does not mean he is acknowledging the victory at this time of
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
According to an unofficial count of votes, Estrada has gained
37.4 percent of the 19.1 million votes counted, more than double
the votes for his nearest rival Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia who garnered 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Five of Estrada's nine rivals have conceded defeat. But De
Venecia of the Ramos-led ruling party insisted that he won't
concede until the official results come out.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Emphasizes Fire Prevention, Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Public security bureaus at all
levels should strengthen fire prevention and control measures, as
the summer is a high fire-risk season.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin said this Monday in a telephone call to
Jia Chunwang, minister of public security. Jiang, general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China(CPC) called on all Party members to be on the alert against
fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
"It is more important to take preventive measures than fight
fire when it has already broken out," he said, emphasizing that
firefighting equipment should be improved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also recently called on all work units
to step up firefighting preparations in order to wipe out any
factors which may trigger fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
China suffered 31 major fires in the January-April period this
year, resulting in 75 deaths and 58 people injured, according to
the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The direct property losses amounted to 110 million yuan (13.3
million US dollars), 2.7 times the figure for the same period in
1997, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
A forest fire has just subsided in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, and a conflagration gutted a furniture shopping
center here earlier in May.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry issued an emergency circular today
on carrying out Party Secretary Jiang Zemin's important
instruction, and setting out concrete requirements and measures as
regards battling fires.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that fires tend to break out in public
places, oil and chemical industry locations, and other places
where combustibles and explosive substances are stored. It urged
local governments to attach greater importance to firefighting
work and improve firefighting facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The serious forest fire in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has basicaly been brought
under control today, but the coming strong wind tomorrow is
unfavorable to fire extinguishment.
</P>
<P>
Although no flame exists in the blaze area thanks to the
two-hour drizzle early this morning and 5,000 fire-fighters'
efforts, hidden fire here and there can turn into flame any time
with the help of the wind, said a local official.
</P>
<P>
The fire-stricken region will have moderate to strong breeze
in the next three days without any rain today and tomorrow,
according China's Central Meteorological Station's latest weather
forecast.
</P>
<P>
"There fire-fighters are striving to put out extra blaze in the
area, and trying their best to bring the fire under control
tonight," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out on May 13 at a forest farm in Xing'an
League (county), in the middle part of the Greater Xing'an Range,

<HEADLINE> Special Treasury Bonds to Promote China's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The issuing of special treasury
bonds is a significant effort combining financial and monetary
policies to promote the development of the national economy,
according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Ratified by the State Council, the Ministry of Finance began to
issue 45 billion yuan-worth of special seven-year treasury bonds
May 18 to commercial banks, excluding wholly state-owned ones.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the issuance is also a useful attempt
to coordinate financial system reforms with fiscal means.
</P>
<P>
As a new treasury bond species, the concept and issuance of the
special treasury bonds are closely related to China's reforms of
its macro financial system, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the People's Bank of China readjusted the
deposited reserves of financial institutions in March this year,
which move will directly affect the central bank's base money
supply and increase commercial banks' reserves. Commercial banks
can use their increased reserves to buy the bonds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issuance is important for reaching this year's
economic target and promoting the development of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The special treasury bonds are an effective way to raise funds
for investment in water conservancy projects, communications,
telecommunications, environmental protection, new and high-tech
industries, residential housing and other types of infrastructure,
so as to create domestic demand, which is crucial for this year's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with the special treasury bonds in hand,
commercial banks can improve their asset-liability structures and
improve the liquidity of their assets, which will be beneficial
for commercial banks to carry out comprehensive asset/liability
ratio management.

<HEADLINE> 25,860 Workers Retrenched in Malaysia This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- There were 25,860 workers
retrenched between January and May 9 this year in Malaysia which
has been suffering from the regional financial crisis since last
July.
</P>
<P>
Of the number, 90 percent were locals and the rest foreigners,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama Tuesday quoted Human
Resources Minister Lim Ah Lek as saying.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of retrenched workers was in March with
11,649, against 7,392 in February and 1,774 in January, according
to the minister who said the figure dipped to 6,326 in April and
1,749 in the first week of May.
</P>
<P>
About 85.6 million ringgit (22.526 million U.S. dollars) have
been paid out in statutory benefits to retrenched workers in the
first three months of this year, he said, adding the amount was 85
percent of the 100.8 million ringgit (26.526 million U.S.
dollars) due to 17,020 workers laid off by 698 employers.
</P>
<P>
He said the Labor Department was negotiating with employers who
had yet to settle the statutory benefits to their retrenched
employees.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the minister made the remarks after meeting here
the management and workers representatives of Tan Chong Motor
Assemblies SDN Bhd which agreed to give three months and one week
leave from May 25 to August to about 400 workers with 75 percent
salary, annual increment, full medical benefits and full bonus
payments, in its assembly plant which was agreed to shut down
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Tan Chong Motor is the second company after Cycle and Carriage
Bintang Berhad to maintain its skilled workers by offering them
three months' leave with 75 percent salary and other benefits
during the temporary closure of their assembly plants due to
economic constraints.
</P>
<P>
Lim said this demonstrated how companies should act in facing
the current economic situation by adopting a caring attitude and
hold discussions with their workers before making any drastic
move.
</P>
<P>
Tan Chong Motor deputy managing director Tan Hoe Pin was quoted
as saying the company could not predict when it could resume
normal operations since its market had dropped drastically, but
the company would re-negotiate with the workers representatives if
the plant still needed to be shut down after the three-month
period.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Win Group B at Uber Cup Badminton Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia won
the top place of Group B after a 4-1 victory over three-time
runners-up South Korea on the final day of the group competitions
at the 17th Uber Cup Badminton Finals here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea took the second place of the group.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals Thursday afternoon, Indonesia will play
either last championships' runners-up China or Denmark. The two
teams play each other Tuesday evening for Group A's top place.
China had defeated Denmark four times.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's world champion and Olympic gold-medalist Susi
Susanti gave her team a flying start on Tuesday when she beat
South Korean Jim Ji Hyun 11-2, 11-3 in the first singles in just
21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Indonesia's world number three combination Eliza and
Rosiana Zelin lost to South Korea's 19th-ranked pair Ra Kyung Min
and Jang Hye Ock 15-9, 15-10 in their first ever meeting, in 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia however made the tie their way after reaching an
unscalable 3-1 lead by taking the two following matches -- the
second singles and the second doubles. This made meaningless the
final singles match, in which Indonesia's Cindana lost 6-11, 3-11
to South Korea's Lee Kyung Won.
</P>
<P>
"We expected to have some chance in the match against
Indonesia, but they are really a quite strong side," said South
Korea's team manager Kwon Seung Taik.
</P>
<P>
"The second doubles was the key to a possible win, but we lost
it. The Korean pair came back for training only about two months
ago, which was not enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The China is the strongest team, with equal chances both in
singles and doubles," he added.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea is not a weak team and we've well prepared for our
match against them. We fielded the strongest team in the match, we
had to win," said Imelda Wigueno, Indonesia's Uber Cup coach.
</P>
<P>
"Denmark have a very strong first doubles pair," she said.
Indonesia beat the Danes in a close three-game match in the Japan
Open early this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would have a 50-50 chance in the doubles if playing
Denmark in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Mia Audina, 18, Indonesia's Olympic silver-medlaist from the
1992 Games in Barcelona, declined to predict her chance against
China's world number three Gong Zhichao if they face each other in
the championships final.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to think about it because Denmark and China have
to play first (in Tuesday evening's Group A tie.). If we play
China in the final, I will think about that after our semi-final
match," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group B tie Tuesday afternoon, England won over
the Netherlands 4-1 to take the third place and the Dutch women
finished fourth and last in the group.
</P>
<P>
Japan will play hosts Hong Kong, China, Tuesday evening to
decide the third-fourth places of Group A.

KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani arrived here Tuesday as part
of a Gulf tour aimed at unifying Arab stands towards the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his short stay here, Al-Thani will deliver a message to
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah from Qatari Emir
Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani in this regard, according to
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The message also deals with issues of mutual interest of the
two countries and the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Seeks Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba on Monday slashed at the Group of Eight (G-8) leading
industrial nations for not offering concrete steps to alleviate
the debt burden of Africa's impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the three-day southern African economic
summit in Windhoek, Namibia, Chiluba said that the G-8 countries,
who had just ended a weekend summit in Britain, had to step up
action to write off developing world debt, and not just use
words.
</P>
<P>
"We need the G-8 to do 70 percent of practical work (of
cutting debt), and 30 percent of the talking," he was quoted by
Business Day paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the G-8 group of nations - France, Italy, Canada,
Japan, the United States, Britain, Germany and Russia - said they
would speed up and broaden plans to pare developing countries'
debt in exchange for countries adopting democratic and
market-oriented economic policies.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that debtor countries take internal measures
making them eligible for a debt reduction system adopted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's remarks followed comments on Sunday, when he said
western nations and leaders were not giving enough credit to the
political and economic reforms taking place in African nations.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is one of the world's most indebted nations, with a
national debt of around 8 billion U.S. Dollars. This translates
into a debt of almost 1,000 Dollars for each Zambian compared
with an average personal income of less than 500 Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that attempts to modernize the Zambian economy
were being hindered by its repayment of debt.
</P>
<P>
"We need (a cut in our debt) badly," he said. "There's no way
democracy can succeed in a sea of poverty."

HELSINKI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- German veterans Juergen Klinsmann
and Lothar Matthaeus appeared together in their training camp here
on Tuesday to say they had buried past disagreements and were now
focussed on winning the World Cup for Germany.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann, Matthaeus and German coach Berti Vogts held a
meeting on Monday to thrash out any differences of opinion and the
three attended a press conference at the open day of a training
camp on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a big job ahead of us," Klinsmann said. "We are
now looking at this goal and want to be champions again."
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason to look back at the 1994 World Cup. The
success we had at the European championships we want to repeat at
this World Cup," Matthaeus said.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus, 37, was called up to the German squad last week
following the injury to first choice libero Matthias Sammer.
</P>
<P>
He and striker Klinsmann fell out badly when they played
together at Bayern Munich. Matthaeus missed Germany's triumph in
Euro 96.
</P>
<P>
He led Germany to victory in the 1990 World Cup but they were
knocked out in the quarter-finals of the 1994 tournament by
Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Two Oil Giants to Reshape Petroleum Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- As part of the reform of its
petroleum industry, China has set up two giant oil
enterprise groups by integrating upstream and downstream
production in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The two extra-large enterprise groups are based on the former
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National
Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec), with their English names unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the reform plan, the newly-founded CNPC will
control all oil and gas fields, oil refineries and petrochemical
enterprises in 12 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
mainly in north and west China, including the Inner Mongolia,
Tibet, Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions,
Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai
provinces, and Chongqing municipality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly-formed Sinopec will control oil and gas
fields, oil refineries and petrochemical enterprises in 19
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities mainly in the
east and south, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin
municipalities, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian,
Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The former will focus on exploration and production of oil and
gas, whereas the latter will prioritize the production of
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
In line with the reform plan, the State Administration of the
Petroleum and Chemicals Industry has been newly set up on the
basis of the former Ministry of the Chemicals Industry, CNPC and
Sinopec, and is directly under the jurisdiction of the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the two giant oil enterprise groups will
enter the ranks of the world's top 500 companies in terms of sales
revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Several Israeli opposition
parties Tuesday submitted to Knesset (parliament) a number of
no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In its motion, the Labor Party blamed Netanyahu for the failed
U.S.-Israeli talks in Washington, in which Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright once again failed to convince Netanyahu to
accept the U.S. proposal to reactivate the long stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his five-day visit in the U.S., Netanyahu
denied reports Monday night that he has agreed to yield 13 percent
of the West Bank during Israel's second troop withdrawal as
proposed by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Meretz and Hadash parties said in their
no-confidence motions that Netanyahu's hardline stance has made
the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks go nowhere, which
sparked last week's violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were deadlocked after
Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem March last year.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, at least five Palestinians were killed by the
Israeli gunfire in violent clashes as the Palestinians were
marking the 50th anniversary of the loss of their homeland with
the creation of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises in HK Sign Occupational Safety Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-nine member companies of
the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association signed Tuesday the
Occupational Safety Charter.
</P>
<P>
The charter was published in September 1996 with a purpose to
ensure that workers have the rights to enjoy a safe and healthy
working environment while employers have the obligations to reduce
the risk of accidents.
</P>
<P>
It also highlights the worker's obligation to follow safety
instructions and to co-operate with the employers including
reporting potential hazards and risks in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Jacqueline Willis,
commissioner for labor of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, said the significance of the signing of the charter as a
group was that the employers and employees under this group of
companies were taking the concerted initiative to establish a
safety culture and create a safe and healthy working environment
so as to reduce accidents at work.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association at present has
over 1,100 member companies from different sectors, running a wide
range of businesses and employing over 50,000 staff.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the signing ceremony, Lee Kai-fat, deputy
commissioner for labor, said: "We are very pleased to have the
support from 59 member companies of the Hong Kong Chinese
Enterprises Association to come forward together and sign the
charter."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Defends Pretoria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel has criticized the World Economic Forum's
Africa Competitiveness report presented Monday, saying it bore
little relation to reality.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented at the southern African economic summit
under way in Windhoek, Namibia, ranked South Africa seventh in
terms of competitiveness, while Mauritius, Tunisia and Botswana
topped the list.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the value of the report to the continent,
Manuel questioned its "optimism index", which put South Africa at
the bottom of a list of 20 countries surveyed by the
organization, Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The index was derived from interviews with members of
countries' business communities.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said it was inconceivable that South Africa could be at
the bottom of a table headed by Mozambique, where the economic
situation was far poorer than South Africa's.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted what he said was another "logical
inconsistency": the Namibian survey found fear of currency risk
low, while in South Africa it was high. He said this was hard to
explain given that the Namibian Dollar was linked to the South
African Rand on a one-to-one basis.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticisms that South Africa's progress toward
structural economic reform was too slow, he said it was due to
the time lag involved before the effects of economic reform came
through.
</P>
<P>
A recent study had found this period was three to four years,
and South Africa was still within that time frame, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Opens Service Center to Combat Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Year 2000 Service Center was
established here on Tuesday to help Hong Kong's small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tackle the year 2000 (Y2K)
problem, also known as the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the center, set up by the
Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), HKPC Executive Director
Thomas Tang said: "The looming Y2K problem will affect software,
hardware and firmware, from computers for home use to computer
systems for running business."
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the Y2K problem could cause computer
systems throughout the world to crash on January 1, 2000, because
they have not been programmed to recognize the "00."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars is
required for solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the service center will provide the large
number of SMEs, which form the backbone of the Hong Kong economy,
with affordable, efficient and comprehensive solutions to combat
the bug.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, a survey by HKPC last year found that local
awareness of the Y2K problem was fairly low, especially among
SMEs. About 40 percent of the 700 respondents had never heard of
the problem, and 68 percent of those who were aware of the issue
considered it not urgent.
</P>
<P>
Roy Ko, principal consultant of the HKPC Information Technology
Division, said: "Through our partnership with pronounced Y2K
software tool providers such as Platinum Technology, Reasoning
Inc. and Cyrano Inc., the center will provide SMEs with the latest
tools to conduct their Y2K impact analysis, conversion and
testing."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the center will provide training courses as well
as consultancy to address the specific needs of companies on the
Y2K problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the limited number of quality Y2K program experts in
Hong Kong, the "debug" charges are generally quite high. The
center will provide software tools on a usage charged basis,
thereby reducing the financial burdens on SMEs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKPC has also published a "Year 2000 Date Problem
Guidebook" to enhance public awareness of the Y2K problem and
plans to organize a "Year 2000 Solutions Show" in July.

<HEADLINE> A Lebanese Civilian Wounded by Israeli Land Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian was wounded
Tuesday morning in a land mine explosion in south Lebanon, the
country's Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Ahmmed Khelid was wounded when the mine blasted
in the Iqlim Toufah area, just north of the Israeli occupied south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources held Israeli troops responsible for
the explosion, saying this violated the April 1996 ceasefire
accord between Israeli troops and Lebanese resistance forces.
</P>
<P>
The accord, brokered by the United States to end a 16-day
Israeli blitz against Lebanon bars both Israel and Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, from targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israeli troops pounded several villages in the
same region and neighboring valley of Litani river.
</P>
<P>
Israeli attacks came apparently in retaliation for a bomb
blast by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas against a patrol
of the Israeli allied militia South Lebanese Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that one of its units Tuesday
morning donated a bomb targeting a group of SLA members near the
Keferhoun crossing, north of the Israeli occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer border enclave in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between Israeli occupation troops and
Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah have never
stopped.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Foreign Office on New Indian Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Office spokesman said
Tuesday the new Indian threat is "a naked assertion of Indian
hostile intentions towards Pakistan and her hegemonistic policies,
now backed by overt nuclear weaponization."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was referring to the threat made by Indian Home
Minister Lal Krishna Advani to "deal firmly and strongly with
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Advani said Monday after attending a high-level meeting on
Kashmir, "Islamabad should realize the change in the geo-strategic
situation in the region and the world (and) roll back its
anti-India policy, especially with regard to Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said here in a statement that "while the ominous
boom of the Indian nuclear tests has not yet died down, India is
already threatening to destroy peace and security in the region."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his
letter to the G-8 countries this week referred to the possibility
of aggressive military acts against Pakistan, as a fundamental
article of India's policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The serious nature of Advani's statement testifies to the
importance of the prime minister's grave warning to the world
community," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the conducting of five nuclear tests by India last week,
the world leaders and their emissaries have been urging Pakistan
to exercise restraint, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"In the situation manifestly made clear by the Indian home
minister's threat to Pakistan, it is the urgent task of the world
leaders to direct and advice for restraint to India," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that "Pakistan is prepared to defend
itself. India should have no illusion that Pakistan can be
browbeaten. Any Indian misadventure would certainly attract a
swift and telling reply."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan urges the world community to "take a serious note of
the irresponsible Indian threats," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared that
Pakistan would not "sit back" on the Indian new threat that New
Delhi would deal firmly with Islamabad over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"We can't sit back on these threats," Sharif told reporters
after inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Radio
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government took strong notice of the
"very serious threat" of the Indian home minister who said Monday
that New Delhi would take a tough stance over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to take very serious note of this threat," the
prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher on Central Bank Help, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The battered Australian dollar
shot up more than one United States cent in early trade Tuesday
when it received a helping hand from the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA), the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
While that bounce proved short-lived, it then received another
boost when Indonesian President Soeharto expressed his intention
to hold new parliamentary elections, adding that he would not
stand for a new term as president.
</P>
<P>
These events encouraged the local dollar to close at 62.55 U.S.
cents, higher than 62.31 U.S. cents late Monday and well above a
new near-12 year low of 61.69 U.S. cents reached in offshore
dealings early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The RBA jumped into the market shortly after the currency
reached that low around 5 a.m. local time Tuesday, and in a rare
display of candor later admitted it had done so.
</P>
<P>
A central bank spokesman confirmed the intervention but did not
provide details of the time of its involvement or the amount of
currency bought.
</P>
<P>
The RBA has in the past declined to confirm or deny
intervention and it is understood its new openness will not
necessarily be repeated in the future.
</P>
<P>
Traders later said the central bank had stepped in and bought
the Australian dollar at the 61.80 to 61.90 U.S. cent level and
again at 62.50 U.S. cents, sending it as high as 62.70 U.S. cents,
a rise of one US cent off the 5 a.m. lows.
</P>
<P>
Despite the beneficial start to the day supplied by the Reserve
Bank, the currency then began to slip back as regional concerns
and soft commodity prices continued to weigh.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil in Indonesia has been the driving force behind the
Australian dollar's fundamental push into territory not charted
since mid 1986.
</P>
<P>
It again placed pressure on the currency Tuesday, pushing the
unit down to an intra-day low of 62.26 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
However, it was also news from Indonesia that exacted another
turnaround in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
The local unit jumped almost one quarter of a U.S. cent when
Indonesian President Soeharto announced that he would hold new
parliamentary elections as soon as possible and that he would not
stand for a new term as president.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, a foreign exchange manager from St. George Bank,
said Soeharto's announcement implied that some stability would
return to the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency rose against the Japanese yen to 84.87
yen as opposed to 84.17 yen at Monday's close. It also closed at
1.1146 German marks from 1.1124 marks.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Forest Fire Subsides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's State Forestry Bureau (SFB)
said here today that the forest fire which has been raging in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has subsided to a great extent,
but it warned that strong winds are expected, which could fan the
flames once more.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanzhong, director of the bureau's Forest Fire Prevention
Office, said that although the flames were doused by two mm of
drizzle last night and by firefighters' efforts, "the fire has not
been brought completely under control, as the embers may spring to
life again at any time with the help of a strong wind."
</P>
<P>
There will be no rain in the next couple of days in the
fire-stricken region, and moderate to strong breezes are expected,
according China's Central Meteorological Station's latest weather
forecast.
</P>
<P>
"The bureau has asked firefighters to strive to bring the fire
under control tonight, to make sure the expected wind does not
restart the blaze," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,500 people are fighting the fire, which is quite
difficult to put out as the geological structure of the area is
conducive to the existence of underground fire.
</P>
<P>
The SFB has sent another 200-odd pieces of firefighting
equipment to the area, sources say.
</P>
<P>
The forest fire, caused by lightning, broke out May 13,
directly affecting an area of 13,000 ha, of which about 60 percent
is forest land.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, the blaze will not do great harm to the
local environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SFB has sent two groups of experts to the
country's two major forest areas in northern and northeastern
China to help local governments in fire prevention, as small-scale
fires have broken out frequently there recently.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has also warned local governments nationwide to keep
a close eye on forest fires and keep fire-prone areas under strict
control.
</P>
<P>
"With the growth of tree leaves, moisture will increase in the
forests, and that will help to ease the danger of serious forest
fires across the country," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Massive Theft of Weapons Reported in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 weapons,
including automatic rifles and an armored personnel carrier, were
stolen this weekend from a military base in Bloemfontein, central
South Africa, newspapers published here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The theft at the weapon store at 44 parachute battalion in the
Free State Province was discovered early Monday.
</P>
<P>
After hours of checks, army headquarters in Pretoria confirmed
that the stolen weapons included rocket launchers, 93 R-4 and R-5
rifles, several items of specialized parachute weaponry, 60mm
mortars, 12mm machine guns, and "scores" of radios, binoculars
and compasses.
</P>
<P>
Thieves apparently used state-of-the-art equipment to break
into the store room and made their getaway in an Imamba armored
personnel carrier, officials said.
</P>
<P>
One report quoted sources within the unit as saying 500
individual items had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Merle Meyer said counting was continuing to
determine what had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unfortunate incident and we are trying to
establish how it occurred," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said police were investigating how the
thieves got into a restricted area, broke into a guarded store,
and escaped in a personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
Free State army spokesman Margaret Neethling said it was also
reported that slogans were found written in the metallic residue
left by cutting the hole in a steel door. "The slogans allegedly
said `Viva Mandela' and `Kill the Boers (descendants of Dutch
settlers in South Africa)'," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Defense Ministry spokesman said large quantities
of weapons were going missing from military bases.
</P>
<P>
There were suspicions that the weapons were being used for
cash-in-transit robberies or were being stockpiled by a "third
force" to destabilize next year's general election, the spokesman
said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) jointly launched six projects early
this year, the UNDP Beijing Office said today.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to eliminate ozone depleting substances (ODS) through
technology transfer, the projects were set in motion with funds
received from the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol (MP).
</P>
<P>
The funding of the six UNDP MP projects, equivalent to the
amount of 7,426,539 US dollars in total, was approved by the
Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal
Protocol at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
About 70 MP projects implemented in China were funded through
UNDP since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The projects will finance the incremental costs for replacement
of equipment retrofit, safety system, technology transfer,
re-design and prototyping and testing pilot scale production in
six factories.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the projects, about 1,490 tons of ODS will be
eliminated annually from the factories' production. This
contribution to the protection of the Ozone Layer will have both
global and national impact.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Help Democratic Congo's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South African corporations
are planning to set up joint ventures in Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to help the country's economic recovery, the southern
African economic summit in Namibia revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's state power utility Eskom, which also supplies
electricity for neighboring countries, has already sent a team of
experts to see what it can do to help rehabilitate the country's
Inga power project, Business Day paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Monday the key
areas to focus on were building up the state administration, the
central bank and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Work, including training, has already begun following meetings
between the Congolese and South African central banks.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said some South African state corporations had done
preparatory work on recovery programs for the DRC. The two sides
would also work with the World Bank and the European Union on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We must make progress and I am convinced we will get full
cooperation from the government in Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eskom Chairman Reuel Khoza told the summit in Windhoek that
three Inga power projects, near the coast on the Congo River
rapids, had been experiencing a hard time and they were deserted
by their Italian technicians.
</P>
<P>
He said his Congolese counterparts, who were "very responsive"
to Eskom's offer, suggested a joint venture arrangement in
rehabilitating the projects.
</P>
<P>
He said Eskom is exploring the possibility of strengthening
the transmission line from Inga through to South Africa.
"Initially we can consider a bartering policy if they can't pay,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Inga project is believed to have the greatest potential
in the world for hydro-electric capacity and could eventually
produce enough electricity for the whole continent, Khoza said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Israel's Proposal on Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said in Bethlehem Tuesday that he
will not accept Israel's latest proposal on its troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a project-launching ceremony, Arafat said the PNA
can not accept Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
proposal concerning Israel's second and third stage redeployments.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Netanyahu, during his U.S. trip last week,
suggested to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank during the
second redeployment, while the final phase of the handover would
be contingent on full PNA compliance with all of its commitments
to Israel and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, denied he had accepted the 13 percent
redeployment upon his return from the U.S. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
summoned Arafat to London for an urgent meeting on Monday to
discuss the Israel's news ideas, but there was no progress at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's project-launching ceremony was also attended by World
Bank President James Wolfensohn and former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres, whose center for peace is the main contributor for
raising the money.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian investors, along with the World Bank,
have raised 50 million U.S. dollars for development of the
territories under the administration of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The investments will cover high-tech, tourism, agriculture and
infrastructure projects in the PNA territories.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development program (UNDP) and the PNA
inaugurated on Monday a 2 million-U.S.-dollar project founded by
the Japanese government to reclaim agricultural land in the
Bethlehem area.

MACAO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Marine Police Department of Macao
handed over three pieces of smuggled antiques to China's mainland
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The relics include two stone-carved statues and a broken
terra-cotta horse, all believed to be of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) or the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-550).

Experts from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics (SBCR) said
the relics are of high artistic value as they are rare among
findings of the same age.

Macao marine police intercepted the relics last November in a
regular check on a truck loaded with sand. The truck was arriving
from neighboring Zhuhai City to Macao and the relics were found
buried in the sand.

The origin of the relics is still unknown. Police are making
further investigation.

Liu Dongrui, an official with the SBCR, said here on Tuesday
that Hong Kong and Macao remain the two main channels from where
China's antiques are smuggled abroad. He said China has reinforced

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- India's failure to send a
delegation for the 51st world health assembly meeting in Geneva,
which concluded over the last weekend, only confirms lack of
commitment by the government on the health front, Press Trust of
India (PTI) quoted health experts as saying here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The world health assembly meeting was organized to review among
other things, the reasons why Alma Ata charter for health for all
which was based on equity and justice, and recognized health as a
fundamental right was never implemented in its true spirits.
</P>
<P>
Failure of government in sending a delegation for such a
crucial meeting was a major concern and any committed government
would not do it despite problems on the home front, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years after the Alma Ata charter was signed by 116
countries committing themselves to primary health care and "health
for all in the 21st century", India still lags behind and health
indicators such as crude death rate, infant mortality rate and
life expectancy rate do not show a major sign of improvement.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazil Tuesday expressed its
keenness to involve Malaysia in its "Equatorial Orbit Satellite"
program to be launched early next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are not necessarily seeking Malaysian investment for this
project as this will depend on the economic situation here and the
degree of interest shown by Malaysia," Brazil's Strategic Planning
Minister Ronaldo Moto Sardenberg said here. "If Malaysia is
willing to invest in the project like Germany, then it is
welcome."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would benefit from the satellite program which
provides on-line information about the state of a country's
natural resources, the visiting minister told reporters after
calling on Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The equatorial orbit satellites would pass over Malaysia every
100 minutes compared with the polar satellites which pass over the
country every 16 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sardenberg said his talks with Anwar included the Asian
economic crisis and added it is important for Brazil to learn
about how Malaysia is coping with its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Sardenberg arrived here Monday, leading a three-member
delegation for a two-day official visit.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Asia-Pacific Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh has asked for an explanation
from the Indian government about its recent nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday that
Aminzadeh made the call and voiced Tehran's concern over India's
nuclear tests while meeting with Indian ambassador to Tehran
Rajendra Singh Rathore Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, India exploded five underground nuclear tests,
arousing worldwide criticism. The United States, Japan and Canada
have announced to impose economic sanctions on New Delhi over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said that the nuclear tests could have perilous
effect on the environment and could provide a clear excuse to both
the United States and Israel to "fully abuse the current
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the policy of Iran is based on keeping the
Indian Ocean region free from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Indian ambassador said that New Delhi's nuclear tests were
for defensive purposes and preservation of national security
without the objective against any country.

BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao rejected recent U.S. media reports to the effect that
China has involved in the U.S. political fund raising, saying that
China has never sought to affect the U.S. politics through money,
nor never it will.
</P>
<P>
China has made it clear time and again that the Chinese
government always opposes any country to meddle in the domestic
affairs of other countries, and that China's system forbids any
such interference and influence in any form, he said.

The recent reports about China's political donation to the

said, and the Chinese side would like to express its deep
indignation.

<P>
A spokesman with the China Aerospace Corp. has already clearly
stated that the recent accusations by some Americans and the
U.S. media that someone with this company has involved illegal
donations to the U.S. Democratic Party in 1996 are sheer rumors,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, some people in the U.S., unwilling to see
the improvement of bilateral relations, has tried all means, even
by way of slandering, to obstruct and damage bilateral ties, but
their political attempt will never succeed.

<HEADLINE> Israel's GSS Accused of Torturing Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli human rights group on
Tuesday accused the Israeli security apparatus, the General
Security Service (GSS), of routinely torturing Palestinian
detainees.
</P>
<P>
In a detailed report released at a news conference held here,
B'TSELEM, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the
Occupied Territories, said the GSS annually interrogates between
1,000-1,500 Palestinians. Some 85 percent of them are estimated to
be tortured by various methods.
</P>
<P>
The organization demonstrated at the conference some methods
which they said the GSS uses routinely, such as compelling the
detainee to stand with his arms tied behind him and to a pipe
affixed to the wall, covering the detainee's head with his hands
shackled in a painful position.
</P>
<P>
It also said Palestinian detainees are held in cramped and
filthy conditions.
</P>
<P>
The situation Israel now faces can not justify all these
"brutal methods" because many of the detainees are finally proved
to be innocent, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
B'TSELEM released the report a day before the High Court of
Justice is about to rule on the question of whether the GSS may in
principle use interrogative techniques which were described by
human rights groups as torture.
</P>
<P>
A panel of nine justices will hold a hearing Wednesday on six
petitions submitted by several human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the petitions, the GSS claimed that they would
not have uncovered various terror plots against Israel without
using necessary interrogative techniques.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministry Sees No Major Overseas Capital Downturn in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of China's Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Hu Zhaoqing, told a press
conference here today that China does not expect a big slump in
the use of overseas capital this year, though China will have a
hard time maintaining growth of overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Xiuhong, general director of MOFTEC's Foreign
Investment Administration, China used as much as 45.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of overseas capital last year, and as a result,
it would be difficult to exceed this.
</P>
<P>
However, China does not expect a big slump because of the State
Council's tax policies and other government measures, he said,
attributing the slowdown in foreign investment to negative growth
in contracts that has been going on since 1994 .
</P>
<P>
The ability of some countries and regions to invest in China
was also affected by the Asian financial crisis, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In the last four months, China approved 5,704 foreign-funded
enterprises, which was a 6.84 percent drop from the same 1997
period. They involved 13.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
capital, an increase of 12.24 percent, and the amount actually
used was 11.7 billion, up 0.07 percent, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, China had 310,570 foreign-funded
enterprises, with 534.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts.
</P>
<P>
There was fast growth in the first quarter in the use of
foreign capital, but it was down 19 percent in March, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fluctuated in a
narrow range on the Singapore market on Tuesday, as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) continued to decline,
falling by 13.12 points to close at 1278.62 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that the market hit an intra-day high of 1302.66
after Indonesian President Soeharto said in a televised speech
that he would introduce reforms and call a general election in
which he would not stand for presidency.
</P>
<P>
But the STII fell back later as market players were still
concerned about the mass rally protest in Jakarta on Wednesday
demanding the immediate step-down by President Soeharto would make
the situation there even worse.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 164.79 million units,
valued at 306.93 million Singapore dollars (186.02 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overtook declines by 167 to 119, while 307
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
ST (Singapore Technologies) Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 13.6 million units.
It was followed by Singapore Telecom which had 13.21 million
shares traded. RHB Capital warrant99 was next with 8.2 million
units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 70 cents to finish at 31.3 Singapore
dollars. OUB (Overseas Union Bank) Foreign and RothmansI increased
by 30 cents each to end at 5.35 and 7.9 Singapore dollars
respectively. Elec&AMP;E was up by 25 cents to close at 5.6 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Tong Meng was the biggest loser as it declined
by 1.6 dollars to end at 1.2 Singapore dollars. YHS fell by 31
cents to close at 4.94 Singapore dollars, while Thai Prime lost 28
cents to finish at 3.6 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Study Brazil's Offer of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Tuesday that his country would study
Brazil's offer of military equipment and specialized training for
its officers.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Brazilian Minister for Strategic Planning
Ronaldo M. Sardenburg during talks here with Syed Hamid who
described the offer as "attractive" that may open a new era of
military cooperation between the two nations of the South.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested and will study it in detail before making a
decision," Syed Hamid told reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Brazil offered training in management and communications, among
other things. But the defense minister did not elaborate on the
Brazilian offer of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian defense industry makes light arms such as machine
guns and military vehicles, aerospace defense systems and civilian
satellite systems. Brazil is known internationally for its
multiple-launch rocket artillery systems and the AMX light jet
attack aircraft which is in the same category as the British Hawk
light fighter currently used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid noted that the two countries have the same
topography and climate, making Brazilian defense equipment
suitable for military use here.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry in return has offered places for Brazilian
officers at the Armed Forces Staff College, the Land Warfare
Training Center and the Peacekeeping Training Center in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian minister arrived here Monday, leading a
three-member delegation for a two-day official visit. He also met
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses $200 Million Antiques to Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian antiques worth more than
200 million U.S. Dollars have been lost to thieves by six museums
in the country since 1993, including 95 cultural objects,
according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, archeological and historical sites as well as
individual and family holdings worth billions of Dollars have
been looted, Yaro Gella, Director-General of the National
Commission for Museums and Monuments said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that 12 major seizures of 275 objects,
including genuine and fake antiques, with a street value of
nearly 20 million Dollars, were made between October last year
and last week.
</P>
<P>
Gella made the revelation at the International Museum Day
celebrations held Monday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
While lamenting the alarming rate of looting and trafficking
of Nigeria's cultural property, Gella accused some unnamed
members of the diplomatic community of abusing their diplomatic
privileges by engaging in the illicit transfer of antiques
belonging to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This is done through diplomatic bags "that cannot be subjected
to searches," he said, quoted by the Post Express Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He therefore urged the Nigerian Foreign Ministry to deal with the
undiplomatic behaviors of some of the diplomatic community.
</P>
<P>
According to Gella, the looting of antiques from Nigeria
started in 1897 by the British colonial forces, and the looting
of museums and monuments is not limited to Nigeria, but other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
However, "the Nigerian situation is most disturbing because
for every 10 authentic antiquity that leave the shore of Africa
to Europe and America, six are of Nigerian origin," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to take tough measures against
traffickers of the cultural property, saying "it would appear
that the laws are either too lenient as to deter offenders or not
applied at all."
</P>
<P>
The theft and other forms of illegal trafficking in cultural
property has attracted the attention of the highest level of the
government, said Minister of Information and Culture Chief
Ikeobasi Mokelu at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
He warned "those who traffic in our cultural property to
retrace their footsteps as the long arms of the law will soon
catch up with them."
</P>
<P>
Those Nigerians who connive with foreigners to destroy or
distort the country's history through such illicit trafficking
should be treated as the country's enemies, he added.

emphasis on this.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always placed great importance on the
fight against drugs and drug-related crimes, and supports

<HEADLINE> Gowda Criticizes Vajpayee Government's Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian former Prime Minister Deve
Gowda Tuesday criticized the Vajpayee government for taking a
political decision without consensus on conducting nuclear tests
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Vajpayee, copies of which were also released to
reporters here, Gowda asked: What happened in the 15 days between
Inder Kumar Gujral prime minister's stepping down and Vajpayee's
taking over that dramatically changed threat perceptions?
</P>
<P>
He said that previous governments led by the Congress and the
United Front had decided against conducting the tests and had
tried to improve relations with China. As prime minister, Gowda
said, he declined to give clearance for demonstrating India's
nuclear capability not because of the likely reaction from the
international community but because of concern for economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to conduct the nuclear tests is not a military
decision. It is a political decision. The prime minister should
categorically come out with alternative strategies and proposals
planned to overcome the adverse effects of these tests on all
issues, he further said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
India's five successive nuclear tests have caused strong
reaction from the international community and some of western
countries such as the United States, Canada and Japan have imposed
sanctions on India.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Spokesman Says Political Donation Claim Is Slander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Recent accusations by some
Americans of Liu Chaoying's involvement in illegal donations to
the U.S. Democratic Party in 1996 are rumor and slander, a
spokesman of the China Aerospace Corp. (CASC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu is a vice-president of China Aerospace Int'l Holding Ltd.,
which has been claimed by some people in the U.S. and the news
media there to be affiliated with CASC.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that U.S. newspapers have recently reported
that Liu was involved in political donations, but when CASC
investigated the matter, it found that none of the company's
members had been involved in any way in political fund
raising. Liu herself stated clearly that the accusations are
groundless and based on rumor.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that CASC strongly condemns these
fabrications and the groundless reports by the U.S. news media
that have damaged the corporation's reputation.
</P>
<P>
It is CASC's policy not to allow any of its employees to get
involved in any way in the politics of other countries, the
spokesman emphasized.
</P>
<P>
China Aerospace Int'l Holdings is a holding company of CASC and
is registered in Hongkong and listed on the stock exchange
there. It chiefly manufactures and sells electronic products and
communication facilities. Liu is a high-ranking officer and is now
VP for international trade.

<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Heads of State or Government joined
trade ministers here Tuesday in the commemoration of the 50th
anniversary of the operation of the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Those scheduled to make speeches throughout Tuesday include
Swiss President Flavio Cotti, Cuban President Fidel Castro, South
African President Nelson Mandela, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
During his one-hour stopover Monday evening in Geneva,
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that he wanted the third
ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be
held in the United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford to take seven years to finish a trade
round as happened during the Uruguay Round," Clinton said at the
evening session of the second WTO ministerial meeting being held
here on May 18-20.
</P>
<P>
"We should explore whether there is a way to tear down barriers
without waiting for every issue in every sector to be resolved,"
he said. "I am confident we can go about the task of negotiating
trade agreements in a way that is faster and better than today."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton also stressed that whatever approach is taken,
negotiations on agriculture in 1999 and services in 2000 must
proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"Starting next year, we should aggressively begin negotiations
to reduce tariffs, subsidies, and other distortions that restrict
productivity in agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the services talks must cover a wide range of
industries such as express delivery, environmental, energy, and
audio-visual services.
</P>
<P>
He also called for further reductions in industrial tariffs and
said a starting point would be those proposed by the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, such as chemicals and
environmental technology.
</P>
<P>
Clinton further called for a high-level meeting of trade and
environmental ministers to provide direction to future WTO
environmental efforts and a joint high-level WTO and International
Labor Organization meeting to discuss core labor standards.
</P>
<P>
He urged all WTO members to reach agreement by next year on a
government procurement agreement that would provide for open and
fair bidding on government contracts.
</P>
<P>
"This single reform could open up three trillion dollars of
business to competition around the world," Clinton said,
adding: "And I ask every nation in the world to adopt the
anti-bribery convention developed by the OECD (Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development)."

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Land requisition, resettlement, and
other preparatory work for China's largest nuclear power plant
near the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The project that officially began on Feburary 27 on 185 ha. of
land meant moving 10 companies and institutes and some 70
households. Work on a 40-million-yuan emergency exit and testing
and designing of programs have been done recently, and an
11-km-long water supply pipe has been completed.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of construction, from now through 1999,
two 1-million-kw pressurized water reactors will be installed. The
initial concrete foundation work is slated for the third quarter
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two reactors are expected to be showing a profit by 2004
and 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant is a Sino-Russian joint
venture. At the ground-breaking ceremony last month, Vice-minister
of the China National Nuclear Industry Chen Zhaobo, the Russian
Vice-minister for Atomic Energy E. Reshtnikov, and the
Deputy-governor of Jiangsu Province Ji Yunshi all pushed buttons
to start the project simultaneously.

<HEADLINE> World Response to Indian Nuclear Tests Lukewarm: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday criticized the world community for having shown
lukewarm response to India's string of nuclear tests last week.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is carefully watching the response of the
international community to India's crime," Sharif told reporters
after inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Radio
Pakistan. "But unfortunately, it is not strong enough."
</P>
<P>
"Had the world severely punished India, I could have told my
people that now there is no justification to detonate our nuclear
device," he said. "But this is not happening."
</P>
<P>
He said he spoken to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday by telephone and conveyed to
them Islamabad's disappointment over the weak response of the
Group-8 (G-8) countries to India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"I asked them why G-8 failed to condemn India or take strong
action against India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee that India could use its nuclear weapons against its
neighbors, Sharif said the world should take serious note of the
"grave threats" posed by India to the security of Pakistan as well
as the region.
</P>
<P>
"India has done what it has been saying since BJP (Bharatiya
Janata Party) came to power there," he said. "The world community
should take these warnings very seriously."
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Pakistan's response to India's nuclear tests
would be determined by its security concerns and national
interests, the prime minister said everybody knows that Islamabad
possesses nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
"We could have given the matching response straightaway, but we
showed restraint, which should be appreciated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Pakistan would detonate its nuclear device, he said,
"Who does not know we have a nuclear capability."
</P>
<P>
However, he said Pakistan never conducted a nuclear test for it
is a responsible nation and "it can exercise restraint."
</P>
<P>
He said political leaders and parties are asking him to give a
telling response to India's nuclear ambitions. "Under these
circumstances, I will ask (the) international community to tell
what we should do."

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids with High Blood Pressure May Have Enlarged Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Children and adolescents who
have high blood pressure may also have enlarged hearts, a risk
factor for a heart attack, heart failure and stroke, scientists
warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen R. Daniels and his colleagues at the University of
Cincinnati in Ohio said that they found left ventricular
hypertrophy is prevalent in children and young adults who have
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
In a report published in the latest issue of the Journal of the
American Heart Association, the researchers said that they used
echocardiography, an imaging test based on sound waves, to measure
the hearts of 130 patients, aged between 6-23, who had high blood
pressure for an average of two years.
</P>
<P>
They found that 14 percent of the patients had severe left
ventricular hypertrophy, and another 17 percent whose walls of the
left ventricle were abnormally shaped.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that these young patients are on a course for
early cardiovascular morbidity and mortality," the researchers
wrote. They advise children who have high blood pressure should
have their left ventricular mass measured regularly with
echocardiography.
</P>
<P>
The study results underscore the importance of the recognition
and treatment of elevated blood pressure in children and
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
"Weight loss may be an important nonpharmacological method to
help overweight young people with hypertension and left
ventricular hypertrophy," the researchers added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Look For Cause Of Concrete Structural Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Chinese Academy
of Engineering say that the "Alkali-Aggregate-Reaction" is one of
the major causes of many concrete structural flaws in the cities
of Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that cracks have appeared in overpasses, airport
runways, stadiums, and railway bridges not long after they were
built. In one instance, the Sanyuan Overpass in the northeastern
part of Beijing, which was completed in 1984, began developing
cracks in the late 1980s, the biggest of which was 1.4 cm. wide.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found an internal cause of the cracks in what
they called the "Alkali-Aggregate-reaction", a chemical reaction
of alkalis and other chemicals in aggregates of sand, stone, and
concrete.
</P>
<P>
The two cities are located in areas that are undergoing
geological changes and the concrete there contains more active
matters and the water contains more alkalis, explains Wu Zhongwei,
of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), who led the research.
</P>
<P>
He says that bad designs, management problems, poor quality,
and environmental problems like corrosion and sinking foundations
are also important causes of structural damage.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the alkali-aggregate-reaction, also called
"concrete cancer", develops slowly, but can cause a great deal of
damage and is difficult to control, but that the use of low-alkali
cement is an ideal way of preventing it.
</P>
<P>
The CAE's research paper, "Prevention of Damage to Major
Concrete Structures in China", has caught the attention of the
State Council and government departments, and the Construction
Ministry and State Bureau of the Building Materials Industry are
going to revise concrete standards and encourage more low-alkali
cement factories.
</P>
<P>
Construction of northern China's first large low-alkali cement
plant will be completed at a cost of 700 million yuan (84 million
US dollars) in Tianjin later this year. It will produce 1.4
million tons of low-alkali cement a year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not Afraid of Sanctions: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Tuesday that his country is not afraid of sanctions
and whatever response to be taken against Indian nuclear tests
would be "in the supreme national interest."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Radio Pakistan
here Tuesday morning, Sharif said the situation arising from the
Indian nuclear tests "need to be addressed properly which would
not be only in the national interest but in the interest of the
region and the whole world."
</P>
<P>
At this critical juncture, he said, the world should realize
that Pakistan has exercised restraint on this count and thus it
should extend full support so that it could take an appropriate
decision.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his country is fully prepared to defend
itself, adding, "It is ready to meet any test."
</P>
<P>
"We as a far-sighted nation have been analyzing the situation
with patience," he said. "Whatever decisions would be taken would
be in the supreme national interest."
</P>
<P>
Regarding sanctions, he said, "we are used to these and need
not to be frightened."
</P>
<P>
The "righteous and peace-loving nations" should support
Pakistan in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our friends have been with us and particularly we feel
strengthened with the support of our masses," he said.
</P>
<P>
A week after India exploded its nuclear devices, Pakistan has
been keeping its options open over how to respond to India's
tests.
</P>
<P>
Some big powers including the United States and Japan have been
urging Pakistan to show restraint and not to follow India's suit
and they also indicated that severe sanctions would be imposed on
Pakistan if it also goes nuclear.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Begin Offshore Refining of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to begin offshore
refining of its crude oil soon in a view to making full use of
its excessive crude oil output and reducing overdependence on
crude export.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's oil production is expected to hit 3-3.5 million
barrels per day by the year 2000. It now produces 2.455 million
barrels under the framework of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"There will be offshore processing of crude oil," said
Nigerian Petroleum Resources Minister Chief Dan Etete Monday in
the northen city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the major reason why the government has
decided to look outwards for the processing of crude oil is to
enable it to meet the OPEC ceiling by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
" With Nigeria's rely on the sale of crude oil only, we don't
have any outlets into the finished product market unlike other
oil producing countries," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for us to dedicate some of our crude oil, so
that what is required for the country will be brought back for
domestic use and what is left will be for the export market to
earn us foreign exchange."
</P>
<P>
Etete talked about processing crude abroad when Lagos State
Administrator Mohammed Marwa announced to sell fuel to motorists
on the basis of odd and even number of vehicles in the southern
state.
</P>
<P>
There has been lingering fuel scarcity in the country as all
its its four refineries have broken down due to lack of
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The minister however promised to normalize the situation soon.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that by October this year when the
military hands over power to a civilian government, the country
could satisfy the needs of our domestic consumption of petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
By that time, "we will be in a position to export most of the
products," Etete said.

ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister Sartaj
Aziz has said national security is more important than economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
"When it's the question of national security, the economic
problems do not matter," Sartaj said in a recent interview,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are already bearing sanctions and if they are further
increased, we will bear them somehow and the nation will also
fully cooperate on the issue of national security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Pakistan has been offered any good economic package
for not conducting nuclear tests, Sartaj said, "Until and unless
the matter of our security is taken into consideration, any
economic package does not matter as it does not provide an
alternative to our security."
</P>
<P>
"The general impression which emerges from this situation is
that though Pakistan has not conducted any explosion yet,
sanctions have been imposed against Pakistan," he said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday declared that his country would not "sit back" in
face of India's new threat that New Delhi would deal firmly with
Islamabad over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"We can't sit back on these threats," Sharif told reporters
after inaugurating the golden jubilee celebrations of Radio
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government took strong note of the "very
serious threat" of Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani who
said on Monday that New Delhi would take a tough stance over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to take very serious note of this threat," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Islamabad should realize the change in the geo-strategic
situation in the region and the world (and) roll back its
anti-India policy, especially with regard to Kashmir," Advani said
Monday after attending a high-level meeting on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It signifies ... India's resolve to deal firmly and strongly
with Pakistan's hostile designs and activities in Kashmir," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Advani's comments were the strongest anti-Pakistan statement by
any Indian leader Since New Delhi conducted a series of nuclear
tests early last week.

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen in south
China's Guangdong Province, is stepping up its crackdown on
illegal foreign currency trading that has seen a resurgence with
the Southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In one sting operation last weekend, police and foreign
exchange officials raided three private shops that served as a
center of the black market currency business and arrested 32
people (including 17 Hong Kongers) and confiscated 2.28 million
Chinese yuan (274,000 US dollars) and 506,000 Hong Kong dollars
(65,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, illegal currency traders have
gotten so bold as to openly solicit business in front of the
railway station or outside customs offices, with foreigners and
people from Hong Kong being their main targets.
</P>
<P>
Officials warn people not to get involved in illegal trading,
which is often accompanied by cheating and fraud. Chinese
residents who need foreign currency to study abroad or for other
purposes permitted by the government can apply to the local
foreign exchange administration, they said.

PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Indonesian defense minister and chief of the armed
forces, General Wiranto, announced on Monday a resumption of
control of situation by banning all demonstrations against
Suharto. He also rejected the appeal by the president of
parliament for the resignation of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Xavier Tiberi, the wife of the Mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi,
was detained for more than eight hours by police on Monday in an
inquiry of salary fraud in Essonne east of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) condemned the
detention as manipulation of public opinion which was aimed at
destabilizing the president of the republic, Jacques Chirac, who
was the predecessor of Tiberi.
</P>
<P>
-- The crisis in Indonesia Monday saw a double coup, as the
highest authority of the parliament asked Suharto to resign, while
the chief of the army broke his reserve and played the role of
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
General Wiranto announced the forming of a council of reforms
consisting of military leaders and parliamentarians, as well as
"representative public personalities," but rejected the demand by
the parliament speaker, Harmoko.

<HEADLINE> Lake Victoria Floods May Be Caused by Weed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Gloom and fear hung over Lake
Victoria as its waters continued to rise, wreaking havoc and
displacing people, as a result of perhaps siltation caused by the
blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
</P>
<P>
After decades of calm, Africa's largest fresh water lake is
spilling onto neighboring plateaus destroying farms and leaving
hundreds homeless especially in southwestern Kenya, local press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The blockage by water hyacinth has forced silt deposits in the
shallow sections of the lake, damming the rivers and causing
floods, William Saina, an agricultural expert, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The silt was carried from the western highlands by rivers
Nzoia, Mara Nyando and Sondu-Miriu that drain into the Victoria
ecosystem, he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed more siltation to destruction of trees and
cultivation in water catchment areas in highlands west of Rift
Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a marine expert, Captain Joseph Mucuthi, also said
the lake flooding is caused by the hyacinth weed which has
covered most parts of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The roots and leaves of the hyacinth and other water plants
have collected at the bottom of the lake, making it shallower,
hence the overflow, said Mucuthi.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the increasing water volume to the
shrinking shoreline.
</P>
<P>
The shoreline, "which is now shrinking towards the lake," he
said, has not been surveyed for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Geoffrey Howard of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, said Monday the
hyacinth invasion is an unlikely cause of the rise as 92 percent
of the weed is water.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall increase might be the cause, that is, if the totals
are abnormally high as the one experienced in 1960," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth is likely to increase the rate of evaporation
hence decreasing water levels, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local residents said the volume of water in the lake
has increased tremendously since last week and is spilling over
into its basin from Busia in Western Province to Migori in
southern Nyanza Province.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families in Busia, Siaya, Bondo, Nyando, Rachuonyo
and Suba districts fled their homes to escape the lake waters.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit area is the flooding-prone Nyando, where
schools, homes and farms have been swallowed by the advancing
lake.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have
been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Improve Coffee Yield Per Unit of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is making efforts to double
coffee yield per unit of land as the crop's production cost has
risen by 140 percent in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Coffee Research Foundation (CRF) Chairman Abraham Mwangi said
Monday the country's coffee production per unit area of land
remained low and currently stands at 600 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The output is particularly low in the small-holder sector
which currently stands at 460 kg per hectare, he said.
</P>
<P>
CRF is carrying out a program to educate farmers on
possibilities of producing two tons of clean coffee per hectare.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee yield per hectare is doubled..., the production
would shoot up to about 300,000 tons even at the current 162,000
national coffee hectarage," said Mwangi, quoted by local press
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said farmers needed to be trained on how to take care of
the seedlings because 60 percent of those supplied died in the
early stages was due to neglect.
</P>
<P>
The acreage under coffee doubled from 88,000 hectares
in 1977 to the current 162,000 hectares in Kenya, said Mwangi,
adding that much of the expansion work has largely been
restricted to the small-holder sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, production cost in Kenya jumped from 26,000
Shillings per ton in 1991 to 64,000 Shillings last year.
</P>
<P>
About 64 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar currently.
</P>
<P>
In the estate sector, the cost of production rose from 53,000
Shillings per ton in 1990/91 to 120,000 Shillings in 1997/98, an
increase of 146 percent, said Mwangi.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya Monday posted 1997/98 (Oct-Sept)
production at 60,000 tons, blaming adverse weather and a scarcity
of farm credit.
</P>
<P>
Prices at the Nairobi Coffee Exchange have improved during the
past seven years from 48,900 Shillings per ton of clean coffee in
1990/91 to 249,600 Shillings in 1997/98, a reflection of 412
percent.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Launch Coffee Farmers' Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to set up the Coffee
Farmers' Bank with an initial minimum share capital of 211
million Shillings (3.4 million U.S. Dollars) to ease credit
problems for coffee growers.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) said Monday that the move was
in line with the government's five-year development plan ending
in 2001, which calls for the establishment of sector-specific
banks to ensure easier access to credit by business and farmers.
</P>
<P>
"A sub-committee of the board has been formed to come up with
modalities of establishing the Coffee Farmers' Bank without
further delay," CBK Chairman John Ngari was quoted by Tuesday's
East African Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
A CBK special delegates' conference last week agreed that the
current eight members of a coffee bank promotion committee be
elevated to interim directors to enable registration and launch
of the bank pending elections to its board.
</P>
<P>
The initial minimum share capital for the bank will be drawn
from rebates out of 1993/94 and 1995/96 coffee earnings.
Individual coffee planters who were owed rebates would be issued
with share receipts for their bank stake.
</P>
<P>
Rebates refer to the cash difference between what the coffee
board forecast to earn from exports in any given period and its
real earnings, a coffee board spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The CBK Monday also posted 1997/98 (Oct-Sept) production at
60,000 tons, blaming adverse weather and a scarcity of farm
credit.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain Sayed has said India's planned beefing-up of
military forces and nuclear bombs is "a part of Indian political
and strategic ambitions."
</P>
<P>
Meeting Seiichiro Noboru, special envoy of Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, here late Monday night, Sayed urged
the international community to consider seriously "what effects
the Indian ideologies will have on regional peace," according to
the official Associated Press of Pakistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Western world has not so far suggested
any measure which could "satisfy our legitimate security
concerns."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of principle, he said, strict action ought to be
taken against India for conducting nuclear tests and full support
should be extended to others for exercising restraint.
</P>
<P>
But this principle has not been adopted by the Group-8
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Pakistan is deeply disappointed by the
Group-8 summit held in Birmingham, Britain, which failed to take
any positive and effective action against India.
</P>
<P>
He said there are "Neo-Nazis" in the present Indian coalition
government who are admirers of Hitler, which is very dangerous
because this ideology reflects "expansionist Indian designs."

U.S.Dollars) of tax revenue annually, a senior official said over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Appollo Nsibambi, the Minister of Education and Sports, said
each public holiday costs the treasurey 2.4 billion Shillings
(2.4 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts from the URA (Uganda Revenue Authority) worked out the
figures that each public holiday leads to loss of 80 percent of
their daily revenue collection of 3 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Nsibambi decried too many public holidays, saying they
constitute an inconvenience to the tax payers.
</P>
<P>
''On public holidays, most revenue collection departments are
closed, and since banks do not open during public holidays, tax
payers will have nowhere to effect payments,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that public holidays are too many for a country
like Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has 14 gazzeted public holidays, including New Year's
Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, National Resistance Movement
Day, Internaitonal Women's Day, Labor Day and Uganda Martyrs Day.
Others are National Heroes Day, Independence Day, Christmas day,
Boxing Day, Iddi Adhuhu and Iddi-el Fitr.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) has been actively involved in narcotics trafficking
in return for money to support its anti-government war, Turkish
police have said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News on Tuesday quoted unnamed police sources as
saying that operations conducted by police authorities last year
showed that the PKK was linked to 140 drug deals.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22,194 kilograms of various kinds of narcotics were
seized and 551 suspects arrested last year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Among the arrested, many are PKK members or have links with the
illegal organization, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the PKK sold the drugs through Kurdish
refugees in Europe who were employed as street vendors in order to
collect money, adding some PKK documents seized in the operations
have confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been engaging in a 14-year-old guerilla war
against the Turkish government in an attempt to establish an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Improving Laws On China's Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Law on the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, has meant a more complete legal system
for China's financial sector, according to PBOC sources.
</P>
<P>
New types of financial arrangements and activities have
appeared with the rapid development of China's banking industry,
needing more laws and regulations to standardize and protect the
interests of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Financiers say that the PBOC Law promulgated in 1995, the
Commercial Bank Law, the Negotiable Instruments Law, the Insurance
Law, and other laws passed since 1995 have provided a legal
framework for China's financial reforms and banking industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China has formulated a number of finance
rules and regulations as well, covering many areas and providing
guarantees for supervision, uncovering hidden troubles, and
preventing financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The administrative regulations for branch banks and foreign
financial institutions in China guarantee the rights and interests
of foreign financial institutions and help standardize controls
over these institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last year the PBOC increased efforts to improve the legal
system, focusing on improving supervision and credit quality, and
avoiding financial risks through 100 rules and regulations on
finance.
</P>
<P>
PBOC sources say that more rules and regulations will be
formulated this year to provide a better legal framework for
financial reforms and for preventing and minimizing financial
risks.

<HEADLINE> Flights to, From Israel to Be Smoke-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- All flights to and from Israel
will be completely smoke-free from June 1, the English language
newspaper Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measure brought Israel to the forefront of countries caring
about the health of airline passengers and staff, and only Canada
can boast the same achievement, Amos Hausner, legal adviser to an
anti-smoking organization in Israel, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, smoking has been allowed by Israeli law on flights
longer than two hours. The measure represented a breakthrough long
awaited by anti-tobacco activists, airline personnel and most
passengers, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Hausner, on behalf of the Israel Society for the Prevention of
Smoking, petitioned to the High Court of Justice against two
Israeli airlines, El Al and Arkia, pushing the court to pressure
the Transport Ministry to reach an agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, negotiations led to an expansion of no-smoking
flights, first to Europe, more recently to the Americas, and later
Africa. Hausner said the latest arrangement was made possible with
the cooperation of the Transport Ministry, El Al and foreign
airlines flying to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Although opposed to smoking bans for a number of years, El Al
had in recent years reached reciprocal agreements with foreign
airlines. According to the pacts, on any route on which El Al
barred smoking, other airlines would do the same.

KAMPALA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's biggest city robbery this
year occurred Monday morning when five armed thugs robbed an
estimated 240 million Uganda Shillings (240,000 U.S. Dollars)
from the Cairo International Bank located in central Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the thugs, armed with one pistol, raided the
bank's strong room on Bombo road as soon as the bank opened its
door for business at 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
They stormed the strong room when they found the treasury
manager, a cashier and a computer manager revolving cash for the
usual daily transactions.
</P>
<P>
Richard Okimondo, the bank's security guard, was said to have
opened the bank's rear door for the robbers and have entered the
robbers' car, abandoning his rifle loaded with five live bullets.
</P>
<P>

a Toyota Corolla.

part of the gang or was forced to go with them.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Cancer Screening Reduces Death Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Screening for prostate specific
antigen (PSA) can cut death rate due to prostate cancer by 69
percent by catching the disease early while it was still treatable
with surgery or radiation, according to a study released here
Monday by Canadian researchers.
</P>
<P>
The study was done by Dr. Fernand Labrie of Laval University in
Quebec, who pioneered the use of Hormone-blocking drugs as an
alternative to castration in advanced prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
He presented the results at the annual meeting of the American
Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), attended by about 18,000
cancer specialists around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the long-term study that began in 1988, well before PSA testing
became routine, researchers invited half of 46,193 men aged 45 to 80
years living in the Quebec City area to be screened for PSA. However,
only 8,137 actually agreed to be tested.
</P>
<P>
In the group of 38,056 unscreened men, there were 137 deaths due to
prostate cancer, compared with just 5 prostate cancer deaths among the
men who were screened.
</P>
<P>
When applied to the entire U.S. population, Labrie calculated that
regular PSA screening could prevent 27,000 of the 39,000 prostate
cancer deaths in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
"If the screening is started, as suggested by the American cancer
society and by us, at the age of 50 years, diagnosis of metastatic
prostate cancer should practically disappear," Labrie said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Craving for Buying Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Private buyers account for more
than 80 percent of the owners of the new homes sold in Guangzhou
since the beginning of this year, illustrating the potential of
the private home real estate market.
</P>
<P>
With 20 years of development, the real estate sector has become
one of six pillar industries in this prosperous city in south
China.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has worked out policies aimed at transforming the
previous welfare-oriented public housing allocation into a
commercial system. On one hand, the city's public houses are being
sold to tenants; on the other hand, those who want to continue
renting the houses have to pay higher rents that will be
eventually regulated by the market.
</P>
<P>
The city also is taking measures to stabilize housing prices to
ensure affordability to buyers.
</P>
<P>
One step is to ensure sufficient land for housing
construction. Though the available land dropped by 30 percent last
year, the supply for home construction remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As part of the move, the city has provided low-priced houses
for middle- and low-income families and local banks are issuing
mortgage loans to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the housing market order, the city government
introduced a home-sale license system in 1992. By February, 1,400
such licenses had been issued, making 258 construction projects
under the supervision of local banks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Orders Release of Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein Monday night
ordered the release of a major opposition leader, Leith Shbeilat,
who was sentenced last Tuesday to nine months in jail for inciting
pro-Iraqi riots.
</P>
<P>
"The Shbeilat affair is over, with his colleagues as
guarantors for him," the king said after meeting presidents of
Jordan's 13 professional unions.
</P>
<P>
Shbeilat was the former president of one of the unions, the
Jordan Engineers Association.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited meeting Monday suggested that the government
began to put up with the unions, which used to refuse to cooperate
with the government.
</P>
<P>
Shbeilat's release was widely regarded by the local media as
one of the most important friendly signals sent by the government
in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's leading Arabic daily Al Ra'i had reported that a
regular cabinet session Tuesday will study the procedures for
Shbeilat's release.
</P>
<P>
Shbeilat had been pardoned twice by the king, after the State
Security Court sentenced him to three years in jail for lese
majeste in 1992 and life imprisonment for treason in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Islamist once served in the 1989-1993 Lower
House of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He was jailed in February for instigating riots in the city of
Ma'an, in defiance of a government ban of public rallies
supporting Iraq in its standoff with the United States over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed and 24 other injured in the riots in Ma'an,
some 250 kilometers south of Amman.

A provincial government official says that, these enterprises,
which include the Henan Xinfei Electrical Appliance (Group)

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Pledges to Conduct All-Out Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
here Tuesday that his government will soon conduct reforms in all
fields in a bid to overcome the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a president, who was elected by the People's Consultative
Assembly in March this year for the 1998-2003 period, "I
understand the demand and the aspiration of the people for
reforms, including the demand for my resignation," Soeharto said
after holding a conversation at Merdeka Palace with "community
leaders," top military officers and some cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
"It is no problem for me to resign, but my resignation should
benefit the people's interest and the stability and unity of the
nation," he said. And it should be done under the 1945
constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the construction and prosperity of the country, Soeharto
said, the government will soon set up a council of reform whose
members also include university students and outspoken figures.
</P>
<P>
The council will cooperate intensively with the House of
Representatives to review and amend the existing electoral laws
and strengthen laws to control corruption, nepotism and monopoly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said he agreed that after the amendment of the
electoral laws, the house could hold general elections and elect a
new president. "I will no longer become a candidate for the future
president," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sino-New Zealand Cooperation Turning Hillsides Into Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A bit of harmony between man and
the environment can be seen on a piece of land in China's Guizhou
Province, where cows from the Netherlands, sheep from New Zealand,
and local fine-wool sheep graze on new grass.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, people are ploughing, planting, or adding fertilizer
while the wind blows through the pine trees around the green
carpet on China's first mechanized artificial pasture base. The
area is a Sino-New Zealand friendship project that began in 1983
on 300 ha. and is expected to cover 1,300 ha.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades ago, when Chinese and New Zealand technical
personnel first came here, all they saw was the endless barren
mountainsides covered in gravel so typical of karst formations in
this economically lackluster province in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
But, a strain of grass seed used for pastures and breeding
technology were brought from New Zealand, explains Ding Yingsheng,
who is in charge of the pasture, and the grass reduces acidity and
other harmful elements in the soil to improve its quality.
</P>
<P>
There are now 150 cows and over 400 sheep on the farm, which
produces at least 700 kg of milk a day and over 10 tons of wools a
year, bringing the base 900,000 yuan in profit last year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Uses Radio-frequency to Treat Snoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists at
Stanford University have successfully used radio-frequency energy
to treat snoring, according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The technique, called radio-frequency ablation, involves a
crescent-shaped wand containing a sheathed electrode that emits a
low level of radio-frequency energy.
</P>
<P>
The energy causes molecular particles within tissue cells to
vibrate, generating frictional heat that can be used to destroy
cells in the soft palate -- the tissues in the mouth that can
obstruct breathing during sleep.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Stanford University Medical Center in California
used the technique in 22 men and women who sought treatment for
snoring. the patients had an average of 3.5 visits over several
months for the 15-20 minute treatments.
</P>
<P>
During the procedure, they received a local anesthetic, and a
few took over-the-counter pain medication for a few days
afterward. Initial swelling disappeared in a few days, and there
were no infections or problems with speech or swallowing in any of
the patients.
</P>
<P>
The researchers reported, in the latest issue of the journal
Chest, that all of the patients showed major improvements in their
snoring scores. However, they noted that their study involved only
a small number of patients, and call for more studies of the
technique.

<P>
WELLINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nationwide support for the New
Zealand National Party has dropped for the first time since the
party changed its leadership in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion poll shows that now 41 percent of New
Zealanders support the National Party, down five percentage points
from its rating in April, the Wellington newspaper The Evening
Post reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Support rate for National had kept rising since Jenny Shipley
replaced Jim Bolger as the party's leader and the country's prime
minister last November.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Labor Party also saw its popularity fall one
percentage point to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, support for the small ACT party has picked up five
points to 9 percent. If National forms a coalition with ACT, they
will still hold the majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Despite National's fall, Prime Minister Shipley remains the
most preferred prime minister with a rate of 33 percent, ahead of
Labor's Helen Clark, whose support rate stands at 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wuhu Completes New Flood-Control Barrage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Long vulnerable to annual flood tides
on a section of the Yangtze River, China's biggest, Wuhu City in
Anhui Province has finished building a new barrage for flood
control, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Work started on the 7.1-km-long barrage along the Qingyi River,
a tributary of the Yangtze, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The reinforced-concrete wall, costing 33 million yuan (about
four million US dollars), is one m thick, four m wide
and stands 16.1 m above the normal water level measured at
Wusong, Shanghai. In addition, it is 2.7 m higher than the national
requirements, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The city authorities have, meanwhile, decided to build a
visitors' platform on the top of the wall.
</P>
<P>
This year's flood season on the Yangtze River is expected to
arrive in the coming months, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wuhu invested more than 20 million yuan in building a 2.2-
km-barrage in 1990, but this proved inadequate.

NANNING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Township-run enterprises in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been growing rapidly
in recent years thanks to changes in the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
They reported a total turnover of 325 billion yuan last year,
an increase of 30 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The added value of such enterprises accounted for 30.9 percent
of Guangxi's GDP in 1997, and 30.6 percent of peasants' net income
came from township-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
About 8,100 of these enterprises introduced a share-holding
system last year.
</P>
<P>
They were also interested in technological improvements, which
involved 3.2 billion yuan in spending last year.
</P>
<P>
Township-run enterprises have made an effort to get funds and
projects from places other than Guangxi. The Baise area, for
instance, attracted 170 million yuan of investment from investors
outside the autonomous region last year.

XIAMEN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft
Engineering Co. Ltd.(TAECO), a Sino-foreign joint venture in this
port city of Fujian Province, had repaired a total of sixty
airplanes by last month, most of them from overseas.
</P>
<P>
A company executive says that it is now the largest aircraft
maintenance center in Asia. It was started in January 1996 with 63
million US dollars in investment from six companies from China,
Britain, Japan, and Singapore, with the purpose of doing
maintenance work on Boeing 737s, 747s, and 757s.

Boeing bought a stake in it in August 1997, allowing it to
modify up to three older 747s in passenger configurations or cargo
freight layouts, annually. The executive says that the company can
do maintenance work, overhauls, modification of older aircraft,
and painting.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The power situation in Bangladesh
will not improve much till the year 2001, The Financial Express
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was stated Monday at a Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
presided-over meeting to view the overall power and energy
situation held in the backdrop of unabated load shedding
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A reserve margin of 20 percent was necessary to maintain a
sustainable load management, but the current reserve margin was
only zero, the report quoted a meeting source as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the commissioning of the 210 mw Sixth Unit of the
northwestern Ghorashat Power plant, 100 mw barge-mounted power
plant in southwestern Khulna district and 60 mw power in northern
Mymensingh district, the reserve margin would be 3 percent in the
next year, the source stated.
</P>
<P>
The reserve margin would be 15 percent and 20 percent by the
year 2000 and 2001 respectively after the commissioning of some
more proposed private and public sector power plants, he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her dissatisfaction at the overall power situation
in the country, the prime minister directed all the departments
concerned to take effect measures to expedite the development of
power generating sector.
</P>
<P>
The country has a power shortage of 45 mw everyday against the
minimum nationwide demand for 2,200 mw, the shortage of power is
causing serious loadshedding in many areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to streamline the power supply system and expand the
power industry, the prime minister removed the energy minister
last March and then took over the charge of the energy minister.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Prefers Tight monetary, Eased Fiscal Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Under the fourth letter of intent
to be presented to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Thailand
would propose a restrictive monetary policy and slightly eased the
fiscal policy, the Nation Tuesday quoted Central Bank Governor
Chatumongol Sonakul as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Chatumongol, the government will maintain its
restrictive monetary policy featured by high interest rates
despite complaints from local business community.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's budget and state enterprise
investments would be eased by allowing a wider deficit, the
governor said without elaborating on the figures.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted "an informed source" as saying the
government and IMF might revive the budget by increasing the
budget deficit up to 3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had agreed with the IMF in its third letter
of intent to have a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of the GDP,
which is considered not enough to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
The recent riots in Indonesia were one of the main factors that
has caused the Thai authorities to be anxious about monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said Indonesia's situation was extremely risky and
might affect Thailand's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda also said earlier that
Indonesian riots have forced governments of Asian nations to raise
interest rates for bonds, which have caused a greater risk for
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The fourth letter of intent will be presented to the cabinet on
May 26 and after the IMF's approval, expected on June 10, Thailand
will disburse 800 million U.S. dollars from the standby credit of
the IMF package.

<HEADLINE> Maldives Says Stand on Nuclear Issue Unequivocal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Foreign
Ministry of the Maldives has expressed strong support for all
efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
weapons of mass destruction, the Daily News here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the nuclear tests conducted by India last week,
the official said that the Maldives' stand was well known and had
been constantly and openly declared at the United Nations and
other forums.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives remains a strong advocate for establishing
nuclear-free zones and zones of peace, and it is a staunch
supporter and a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the official said.
</P>
<P>
A highly-placed Maldivian source said: "Our stand on nuclear
proliferation is unequivocal. But a statement at this juncture may
complicate matters rather than restore calmness as we head into
the next SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
summit."
</P>
<P>
Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom is now holding the
chairmanship of SAARC. The next SAARC summit is to be convened in
Colombo in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Maldivian stand on nuclear issues is
determined by "its concern for regional peace and security,
environmental safety and opposition to nuclear proliferation."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia On Alert Against Possible Sneak Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's troops along its
coastal line have been on full alert against possible sneak
landing by Indonesians in the wake of riots in the neighboring
country, a leading national newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Nanyang Siang Pau" daily quoted Defense Minister Syed
Hamid Albar as saying on Monday that royal naval and air troops
had been dispatched for stepping up sea and air patrol along
Malaysia's coastal line.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said in an interview with the daily that 10 naval
vessels were patrolling in the Malaysian waters and that the
Defense Ministry was dispatching air troops for air patrol to
assist the navy while the army would carry out patrol in
collaboration with other law-enforcing agencies to prevent sneak
landing by Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there had been no signs that the riots in
Indonesia would cause exodus of its people in large numbers to
other countries, but Malaysia had to take preventive measures.

<HEADLINE> Legislators: No National Drunken Driving Standard Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 200 billion-U.S. dollar
highway spending bill will encourage states to adopt tougher
anti-drunken driving bills but will not try to impose a national
standard, U.S. lawmakers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the issue removed a major impediment to a
compromise on the spending bill negotiated between the Senate and
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The decision not to seek a strict 0.08 blood alcohol content
limit was a victory for House negotiators, who won acceptance of
their plan to set up a fund to reward states that voluntarily
enact the tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
The Senate version of the six-year highway and mass transit
spending bill would cut up to 10 percent of a state's highway
construction money if it failed to adopt the 0.08 standard now in
force in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
The White House also pressed hard for the national standard.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the administration
will "continue to fight for the 0.08 blood alcohol content because
we know that it saves lives."
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed we were not able to keep it as a sanctions
program," said Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John
Chafee, chief negotiator for the Senate and a proponent of the
national standard.
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill is expected to move to the House and Senate
floors by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The national standard provision was strongly supported by the
Clinton administration and safety groups. Incentives, said Diane
Riibe of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, are "not strong enough
medicine to fight the epidemic of drunk driving."
</P>
<P>
Some groups representing liquor and restaurant industries have
lobbied hard against the 0.08 standard, saying it would end up
targeting responsible social drinkers rather than the chronic,
heavy drinkers who cause most of the drunken driving casualties.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate have been negotiating for several weeks to
iron out differences in the highway bill, one of the biggest and
most important measures they will vote on this year.
</P>
<P>
Chafee and his House counterpart, House Transportation
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, said they had reached compromises
on most of the major issues.

<HEADLINE> Italy: India's Nuclear Tests Create New Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- India's nuclear tests may not herald a
new Cold War, but are creating new tensions and concerns, said
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of International Apparel Federation held in
central Italian city of Florence, Dini said, "I don't see a danger
of new Cold War, what I see is sanctions which could be applied to
India if its tendency should continue.
</P>
<P>
"India has gone against world peace trend by conducting these
tests," he added. "These tests can't fail to be seen with deep
concern, especially by countries like Italy which have already
given up nuclear power for civil purposes as well."
</P>
<P>
A referendum in Italy banned the further construction of
nuclear power stations in 1987.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five underground nuclear tests last week,
triggering intensive worldwide criticism.

<HEADLINE> Annan: India's Blast a Catalyst for Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said on Monday the nuclear tests carried out by India
last week should be taken as a catalyst for world powers to
address the problem of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"We must get back to basics and (deal with) nuclear disarmament
in a way that is much more aggressive than in the past," he told a
news conference in Cleveland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the World Affairs Council, Annan said
India's actions were "a worrisome development," and hoped that
Pakistan will not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had written to Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif asking that he restrain from nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Annan also wrote to the Indian government of Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee asking India to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty and to ensure that last week's tests would be the last.
</P>
<P>
"We need to really... ensure that we don't get into a
competitive arms race in the region. If we succeed in restraining
Pakistan, it will be a great achievement," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Parties Call For Intl Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil political parties
have called for internationalization of the protest against the
killing of non-combatant civilians including politicians following
the killing on Sunday of Jaffna Mayor Sarojini Yogeswaran.
</P>
<P>
Yogeswaran was assassinated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) fighting against government forces for a separate
state in north and east Sri Lanka. Earlier Yogeswaran was asked to
relinquish her post, reports from the north said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tamil parties said that the use of children in
war had been categorized as a war crime by the world community and
the same principle should be applied to the killing of
non-combatant civilians and politicians.
</P>
<P>
They believed that assassinations of this kind are a great
threat to the democratic process especially in a place where it
had just begun amidst international attention after two decades.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Yogeswaran was an unarmed Tamil leader who voiced her
opinion and worked hard for the well being of the community. Her
assassinations is seen by the Tamil parties as an attack on the
democratic fabric of the country which needs much attention
locally and internationally.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Media Hail Stoyanov's Successful China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- President Petar Stoyanov's successful
visit to China deepens the traditional friendly ties between the
two countries politically and economically, Bulgarian news media
point out.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy commentary in Monday's "Democracy" daily said the
main achievements of Stoyanov's China visit can be summerized into
one sentence: "Bulgaria-China: Partners of the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the Joint Statement, signed by Stoyanov and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, established for the first time the
political framework for the advance of the Bulgaria-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, China voices respect to the development
road of the Bulgarian people's choice.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, on its part, reiterates there is only one China in
the world and Taiwan is an unseparable part of China, and that it
will not establish official relations and contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's national television on Sunday showed two documentary
films shot by its cameramen on the president's visit: "Chinese
Miracles" and "Chinese Challenges" depicting a booming country.
</P>
<P>
On the economic and trade relations between the two countries,
Bulgarian media agree that the Chinese market is of Bulgaria's
first choice.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "24 Hours" said in serial articles that Bulgaria
is committed to develop long-term, stable and comprehensive
economic and trade ties with China, including the joint
exploitation of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The articles also hope China will make full use of Bulgaria's
strategic position on the ancient Silk Road linking Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian president made a state visit to China on May
10-15.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Province Abounds in Selenium-containing Tea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province in southwest China
is considered rich in selenium resources and leads the country in
selenium-containing tea production.
</P>
<P>
The latest research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
province's Tea Science Research Institute shows that Guizhou,
which was thought to have no selenium resources, abounds in
selenium elements from the Paleozoic Era.
</P>
<P>
Selenium is essential to human bodies, a lack of which would
cause liver failure, pathological changes in malignant tumors,
premature senility, weak reproductive functions and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
Human beings take in selenium mainly in their daily
diet. Drinking selenium-containing tea is considered by many as
the most convenient and safest way. That's why scientists are keen
on developing selenium-containing tea, which was found only in
Shaanxi and Hubei provinces in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Of Guizhou's 26 counties where scientists conducted a survey,
23 have been verified to be selenium-rich areas suitable for
growing selenium-containing tea.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the province has already cultivated 5,000
hectares of selenium-containing tea, producing more than two
million kilograms of such tea annually, ranking first in
China.

<HEADLINE> Albania Seeks Peaceful Kosovo Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Albania hopes to solve the Kosovo
crisis through peaceful dialogue rather than by extreme means,
visiting Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milo told a press conference, held jointly with his Romanian
counterpart Andrei Plesu following their meeting,
that Albania believed a Kosovo republic should be established
within federal Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the
population in the Serbian province of Kosovo, have been seeking
independence from Yugoslavia from the beginning of 1980s. In 1990,
the Serbian government abolished the autonomous status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened this year as clashes between local Serbian
police and ethnic Albanian separatists escalated.
</P>
<P>
Milo denied an Albanian military build-up in the region
bordering Yugoslavia. He said his country did not have the actual
strength, even if it had the intention at the present time, and
Albania was engaged in its work of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Plesu said Romania is willing to play an active part in seeking
a solution to the Kosovo crisis, and to make a contribution to
Albania's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu also met with Milo, who
is scheduled to meet with Romanian prime minister and chairmen of
both the lower and upper houses of the parliament during his
two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Lebed to Build Ties With Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The new governor of Russia's
Krasnoyarsk region, Alexander Lebed, said Monday he was ready to
establish relations "beneficial and acceptable" to both the
Kremlin and his regional government.
</P>
<P>
The relationship should be based on an agreement on the budget
between Krasnoyarsk and the federal government, Lebed told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The former general also said he was planning to raise a bill
related to the protection of investors.
</P>
<P>
On President Boris Yeltsin's possible running for a third term
as president, Lebed said he thought it was completely against the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on whether he would put himself forward
as a candidate for the presidential elections in 2000, a
prediction made by many analysts but which he previously denied.
</P>
<P>
"The governor has his commitments, and I must first fulfill
these commitments," he said, adding his top priority now was to
restore the region to economic health.
</P>
<P>
Lebed easily beat off incumbent Valery Zubov in Sunday's
elections for the governorship.

<HEADLINE> One More Presidential Candidate Concedes Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Senator Raul Roco, the presidential
candidate of the Philippines' Democratic Action Party, has
conceded defeat to his apparent winning rival, Vice President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published Tuesday, Roco, one of the main rivals
of Estrada as shown by an unofficial quick count of votes in the
May 11 elections, said that he accepted Estrada's victory.
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations to Vice President Joseph Estrada as the 13th
president of the republic. At this time, on behalf of Aksyon
Demokratiko (the Democratic Action Party's name in Filipino) and
in my personal capacity, we accept his victory," said Roco.
</P>
<P>
Roco's concession was a turnaround of his earlier stance. The
senator has accused Estrada of conducting massive vote-buying and
said he won't concede defeat early.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest partial and unofficial results, Roco
came in the third place with 2.63 million votes out of the 19.1
million votes already counted. Frontrunner Estrada maintained his
commanding lead with 7.16 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Roco was the fifth candidate to throw in the towel. Earlier,
former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim and former presidential adviser
Emilio Osmena, had already accepted their defeat to Estrada.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada's nearest rival, Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia of the ruling party, has accused
Estrada of massive fraud and insisted that he will not concede
until the official results come out.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was reportedly trying to persuade Roco not to
concede yet and help his poll protest against Estrada in order to
derail the leading candidate's proclamation as president.
</P>
<P>
But the request was bluntly turned down by Roco who said he
would not be a "cry-baby." De Venecia only got the support of
another candidate, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago in his planned
protest against Estrada's victory.
</P>
<P>
The final official results are not expected to be known within
the next two weeks as the bicameral Congress will not begin a
joint session to canvass the votes for the president and the vice
president until May 25.
</P>
<P>
The official counting of the estimated 27.2 million votes cast
is being done manually and it is now still being conducted at the
provincial level.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seizes Illegal Timber, Saw Mills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities seized over 130
tons of illegal sawn timber and four saw mills in the country's
Yangon division last week, The New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizures, made by a combined team of local forestry
departments on last Thursday and Friday, were conducted in six
villages in the Taikkyi township of the division.
</P>
<P>
Action is to be taken against the illegal mill owners under
Myanmar's Forest Law, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has recently stepped up its crackdown on illegal
production of timber while encouraging legal production and export
of value-added wood products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs. The country's Forest Law
enacted in 1992 bans the private sector from exporting teak logs.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country's export of
forest products, including teak, hardwood and plywood and veneer,
amounted to 125.7 million U.S. dollars in 1997, accounting for 14
percent of the country's total export.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Decline in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports for April was
166.9 billion baht (4.3 billion U.S. dollars), down 19.4 percent
compared to March, according to figures released by the Thai
Customs Department available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Somchainuk Engtrakul, director general of the department,
blamed the export slow-down on the illiquidity in the domestic
banking system, which has made it impossible for many exporters to
get credit despite growing orders from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports have generally benefited from the
depreciation of the baht currency, which was floated in July 1997
and has fallen 40 percent in value ever since.
</P>
<P>
Despite the price competitiveness of Thai goods on the
international market, many local companies have been unable to
take advantage of the baht's depreciation because of a severe
liquidity drought in the crisis-ridden domestic finance system.
</P>
<P>
The illiquidity and Thailand's economic downturn have also
affected imports. Imports fell by 17.2 percent in April, leaving
Thailand with a 23.5 billion baht (618 million dollars) surplus.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, thanks largely to
declining imports, Thailand recorded a 154.8-billion-baht (4.05
billion dollars) trade surplus.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cancer Club Members Live Longer Than Other Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent study of 3,173 members of
the Shanghai Cancer Recovery Club has found that those living for
five years after being diagnosed as having the fatal illness have
gone from 33.6 percent in 1993 to 48 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The study indicates a benefit from club activities because of a
greater willingness to combat the illness. Forty-nine percent of
those surveyed said they felt awful for the first few days after
being told of the findings by the doctor, but that, after they
joined the club, 73 percent said they developed a stronger desire
to live and only 0.8 percent said they didn't believe they could
live any longer.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 percent of the club members found themselves in higher
spirits, 34.5 percent said they could control their temper better,
87.3 percent said their morale had improved, and 13.5 percent
become physically stronger.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is China's largest industrial and economic center and
has a cancer incidence that is much higher than the national
average, with 32,000 people being diagnosed with cancer every year
and 23,000 dying of the illness.
</P>
<P>
The club was set up in 1989 and now it has 11 groups and over
20 branches, and more than 5,000 members. For the past nine years
it has held various activities like dances, art festivals, sports
matches, and tours. It even has its own fashion show group,
chorus, lecturers, and a recovery center, the first to be run by
cancer patients in China.

<HEADLINE> Capital Investment in Environment Paying Off for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Environmental quality in Shanghai
has been remarkably improved because of the city government's
investment of 11.6 billion yuan (about 1.45 billion U.S. dollars)
during the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
The improved environment can also be attributed to massive
urban infrastructure construction, which has resulted in expanded
gas and water supply, better wastewater treatment and more green
spaces.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that, by the end of last year, the city
could treat 1.8 million tons of wastewater per day, 3.6 times more
than it did in 1990. The area of green spaces surged by 120
percent to 7,849 hectares, covering 17.8 percent of the urban area.
</P>
<P>
Now 60.3 percent of the urban area has kept noise pollution
below the state standard while all chimneys in the city have been
upgraded to reduce smoke pollution to the minimum level.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics also show an increase in the amount of
industrial waste gas and untreated water discharged directly into
the river.
</P>
<P>
The local environmental protection department cautioned that
Shanghai faces grave challenges in environmental protection if its
economy continues to grow 10 percent annually and its population,
including the migrant population, keeps expanding.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government announced
Monday that it will unilaterally break off abolish an agreement
with India on the peaceful use of nuclear energy in protest
against the five nuclear tests India conducted last week.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary-General Ivan Cannabrava informed Indian
Ambassador Ishrat Aziz the government decision.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government used the occasion to reiterate its
opposition to the Indian tests, saying they had damaged the
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and ongoing disarmament, and
threatened world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Brazil would reverse the decision if India backed down from its
nuclear stance, a Brazilian Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
India exploded five nuclear devices last week and claimed it
would not sign the non-proliferation treaty despite worldwide
protests.
</P>
<P>
The decision to abolish the agreement was made by Brazilian
President Fernando Cardoso, who is in Geneva. He said Brazil
would not mix its peaceful use of nuclear energy with India's
military purpose.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in January 1996 when Cardoso was
visiting New Delhi.

<P>
HAVANA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 15-member Caribbean Forum
granted Cuba observer status on Monday, bringing Havana closer to
lucrative European Union (EU) trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
The decision allows Cuba a role in group discussions, but no
voting right.
</P>
<P>
"We are working towards the integration of Cuba within the
construct of the Caribbean," said Raphael Fletcher, Grenada's
foreign minister and chairman of the Caribbean Community council
which oversees the forum.
</P>
<P>
The forum includes former European colonies which receive trade
preferences and price protection for exports under an agreement
signed with the EU 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The move comes at an opportune time as European countries will
soon begin renegotiating trade subsidies with 71 former colonies
worldwide in September.
</P>
<P>
Cuba was a former Spanish colony.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean have

<HEADLINE> Women's Museum Opens in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A unique women's museum has been set
up at Shaanxi Teachers' University in Xi'an, capital of Northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 40 square meters, the museum presents the folk
culture of women in five categories including women's "secret
scripts," knitting, wedding clothes, paper-cut works and birth
customs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the exhibits were collected from the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in south China, Hunan and Henan provinces in
central China and Shaanxi Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits include the embroidered quilt cover and belt, and
"obstetric cart" used in some mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
The most attractive exhibit is women's "secret scripts," a kind
of script with characters which can be read only by some rural
women in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The scripts, invented in the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),
were the means of communication for women to express their
affection, hatred and desire for happiness.
</P>
<P>
Written on paper or on fans, embroidered on handkerchiefs, and
bound in books, the scripts were a lost art.
</P>
<P>
The museum was set up by the Women's Research Center, a
non-governmental organization at Shaanxi Teachers' University.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Xiaojiang, initiator of the center, the purpose
of the museum is to show women's creative power, present women's
culture, and arouse modern women's awareness of creativity and
self-supporting.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy is pressing Iraq to continue
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors in order to speed up the
lifting of sanctions, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Dini
stressed that the next few months could be crucial for Iraq's
international relations.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy
Agency will be drawing up a supplementary report on Iraq's nuclear
capability by the end of July, and the U.N. Security Council will
debate the situation shortly after.
</P>
<P>
Dini praised Iraqi cooperation with U.N. inspectors,
particularly in investigating presidential sites and nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions would be lifted only after Resolution 687 of the
U.N. Security Council is fully implemented, Dini added, urging
Baghdad to further cooperate in the probe for nuclear, chemical
and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy supported the full and rapid application of the
Oil-for-Food agreements for the provision of humanitarian supplies
to the Iraqi population.
</P>
<P>
"Italian support for improving the Oil-for-Food mechanism is in
line with the great sensitivity of Italian public opinion and
political and parliamentary circles for the humanitarian and
relief aspects for the Iraqi population," the Italian Foreign
Minister concluded.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, on a visit to Italy from May 17 to 21, expressed
appreciation for Italy's efforts in defusing the recent Gulf
tensions.
</P>
<P>
The threat of another Gulf war shrouded the region in February
when Iraqi authorities refused access to U.N. weapons inspectors
at presidential sites.

MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada, a likely shoe-in for the next president according to an
unofficial count of votes in last week's elections, will meet the
private sector Tuesday to discuss his administration's plans.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, Estrada
will try to address the concerns of the business community which
has been worried over the election of Estrada, a college dropout
and a former action movie star.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will hold the informal meeting with heads of private
sector groups as well as prominent representatives from the
Philippine business community, according to the Today newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Business groups that will attend the informal dialogue include
the influential Makati Business Club, the Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (PCCI), and the Employers' Confederation of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the PCCI said the business community will be
discussing with Estrada his agenda on the economy during the first
100 days of his term should he be proclaimed the next president.
</P>
<P>
PCCI Chairman Alberto Fenix said that the PCCI will be
presenting an action agenda to Estrada for the first few months of
his term which will include improving the business environment and
measures to improve business in light of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest partial and unofficial results issued
here Monday night, Estrada emerged as a likely runaway winner in a
field of 10 candidates, with 7.16 million votes, or 37.4 percent
of the 19.1 million votes counted.
</P>
<P>
His closest rival was Speaker of the House of Representatives
Jose de Venecia of the ruling party who trailed far behind with
2.93 million votes, or only 15.34 percent of the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million eligible Filipino voters
cast their votes on May 11, according to an earlier estimate of
the country's Commission on Elections.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 27.2 million votes cast are being counted
manually, and the official results are not expected to be known
within the next two weeks.

BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two of China's most important
museums -- the Chinese Museum of History and the Chinese Museum of
Revolution -- will be expanded this year, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Luo Bojian, director of the division of
museums of the State Cultural Relics Bureau as saying that the
museums are too small and lag behind in the ways of displaying
cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The museums, built in the 1950s at Tian'anmen Square, have a
combined area of 65,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 square meters will be added to the museums
during the three-phase projects, estimated to cost 120 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"New museums are to be airconditioned, so cultural relics can
be preserved in a condition of constant temperature and humidity,"
said Luo.
</P>
<P>
The museums will be equipped with sensitive alarm systems to
guard against theft and fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bureau is pledging to establish at least one
institution for the nation's 55 minority nationalities within the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The number of annual visitors to the Chinese Museum of History
dropped from one million 10 years ago to 500,000 last year.

BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of China's residents
in large- and medium-sized cities want specialized services --
such as electric appliance repairs, home decoration and

</P>
<P>
And they prefer the work be carried out by local residents
rather than rural laborers, a survey published on

China's state-owned enterprises and government bureaux are
being streamlined to improve efficiency, forcing the lay-offs of
more than 11 million workers last year.
</P>
<P>
Performing the services sought by urbanites, although often
temporary work, can create jobs for many of the laid-off workers,
the survey suggests.
</P>
<P>
Services including in-home repair of electrical appliances,
deliveries of newspapers and journals and home repairs are most
desired by urbanites and such services can provide at least one
million jobs, the survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggested local governments and trade unions should
take the first step, by establishing special institutions to
enhance trust between would-be employers and employees, to ensure
smooth implementation of such services.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, laid-off workers should also be retrained to ensure
that they are qualified for technical positions.

ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
praised on Tuesday the positive role played by China in Asia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, addressing a meeting in Florence of the International
Apparel Federation, also expressed grave concerns over the
financial crisis plaguing economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, China's decision not to devalue its currency RMB
showed a spirit of responsibility and served, in a way, as an
"antibody" against the crisis, Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was still too early to get a full view of what was
happening in Asia but one thing was for sure -- the spirit of
responsibility like China's is needed at this time.

The deal, which waives U.S. sanctions on EU, Russian and

Iran, was reached at London talks between Santer, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and the current EU President British Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>

"There are obviously still some further steps which need to be
taken before the deal can be completed and implemented, but I am
hopeful these can be concluded as soon as possible," Santer said

An Iraqi spokesman, on customary condition of anonymity, said
the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson has created bogus
pretexts to delay the implementation of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
The contracts involve importing medicine, soap, spare parts for
agricultural, industrial and water projects, but Richardson raised
the suspicion that the contracts may allow Iraq to import products
which could be used for military purpose, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports First Consumption Decline in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai reported its first
decline this decade in per capita consumption in the first quarter
of this year amid rising incomes, according to an official survey.
</P>
<P>
The per capita consumption spending of Shanghai's urban
residents stood at 1,704.7 yuan in the first three months, down
3.4 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
An analysis indicates that personal spending on clothes and
household appliances went down, while spending on food,
transportation, telecommunications, entertainment, education,
culture and services went up.
</P>
<P>
The largest spending increase was for health care and housing,
up by 41.2 and 26.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the decline in overall consumer spending to
changing consumption habits and increasing bank savings in
anticipation of the housing commercialization reform package to be
unveiled in July.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources said that Shanghai residents' per capita bank
savings surged by 31 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on 500 households, also found that Shanghai
residents' per-capita disposal income was up 5.5 percent
year-on-year to 2,380.9 yuan in the first quarter. The real
increase after adjusting for inflation was 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the quarterly average resident's income in the form of
assets declined nine percent from a year ago. As the impact of
interest rate reductions became more apparent, Shanghai residents'
interest earnings dropped 12.9 percent in the first quarter
compared with the corresponding period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Albanian FM on Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The government in Tirana believes
that a Kosovo "republic" within Yugoslavia would be the best
solution to the current crisis, the visiting Albanian Foreign
Minister Paskal Milo told a press conference in Bucharest on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Paskal Milo, who is in a two-day official visit in Romania,
held a joint press conference with his Romanian counterpart Andrei
Plesu after their talks. He said that in his opinion, Ibrahim
Rugova is the best alternative for the Kosovo province, as he is a
representative of the Albanians in the province and a symbol of
their aspirations in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"Tirana shares the attitude in Bucharest, namely that the
settling out of the Kosovo conflict should be attained by dialogue
and peaceful means. Extreme measures must be avoided and we should
all try to find the more suitable solutions for all the parties
involved," the Albanian official pointed out. "We believe that the
situation in Kosovo is not only an Albanian problem, but also a
regional, even international one, which must be solved with
everybody's contribution", Milo added.
</P>
<P>
He asked all partners in the world to examine, "until it is not
too late", the situation in Kosovo and encourage the peace and
arbitration forces in order to find out a realistic, viable and
objective solution.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu, in reference to the
possibility that Romania could play the role of mediator in the
Balkans, said that Romania is ready to assume, whenever it is
needed and if the regional countries and the international
institutions find it necessary, any role that might be of help in
resolving the conflict.

BUCHAREST, May 18 (Xinhua) - "In the opinion of the Romanian

<HEADLINE> Annan Voicing Concern over Nuclear Tests in Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has written separate letters to Indian and Pakistani Prime
Ministers, voicing his concern over the nuclear tests by India
last week, a U.N. disarmament official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
Annan stressed the importance and urgency of achieving nuclear
disarmament which would lead to the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament
Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged India to consider signing the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) which is an important element in nuclear
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, Dhanapala said,
without giving the date of the letters.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General also urged India to fulfill its promise
to consider the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament for
a fissile material cut-off treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the
Secretary-General expressed his concern that India's tests run
counter to the norms widely respected by the international
community, Dhanapala said.
</P>
<P>
Urging Pakistan also to subscribe to the CTBT, the U.N. chief
called for constraint exercised by all states so that there would
be no escalation of an arms race in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on India's attitude towards CTBT, Dhanapala
said Annan has "very clearly stated that the CTBT should be
adhered to without conditions".
</P>
<P>
India said on May 11 following its first round of two tests
that it would be prepared to consider being an adherent to some of
the undertakings in the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the Indian tests would affect the long-proposed
treaty to make South Asia a nuclear weapon free zone, Dhanapala
said that "the events of the last week made it very unlikely that
the nuclear weapon free zone in the region would be established in
the future".

<HEADLINE> Albright, Arafat Talks Fail to Make Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) - The surprise talks in London between
US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Monday has ended without a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which lasted for an hour and three quarters, was
hastily-arranged as Albright had telephoned Arafat, who was in
Oslo attending a Socialist International meeting, in the middle of
the night to invite him to London.
</P>
<P>
US State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters after
the meeting that "I cannot say that we have a breakthrough. On the
contrary, we are working very hard to overcome the differences".
</P>
<P>
Albright was quoted as saying after the talks that she and
Arafat had good and constructive talks while Arafat simply made no
comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to the reason why she had wanted to hold the surprise talks
with Arafat, Albright said that "I wanted to consult with him, to
talk with him. It's important to stay in very close touch".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel still does not agree to a key US
proposal to hand over a further 13 percent of the occupied West
Bank to Palestinian rule in exchange for a clampdown on Islamic
militants while the Palestinians have already accepted the US
proposals but refused to any further change.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin insisted that the U.S. would not water down its
central proposals for breaking a 14-month deadlock in the Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to the key elements of our proposal, we are not
watering them down," he said.
