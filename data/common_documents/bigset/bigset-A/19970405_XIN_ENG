<HEADLINE> BAe, Lockheed Cooperate on Battlefield Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace (BAe) and
Lockheed Martin of the US have joined forces to bid for a 5
billion US dollars contract to supply battlefield reconnaissance
vehicles for the British and US armies.
</P>
<P>
The contract is a big step forward in defense cooperation
between Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
BAe and Lockheed will form a joint venture company to handle
the bid, with armored vehicle makers Vickers and Alvis from the
UK and General Dynamics Land Systems of the US acting as main
contractors to the company.
</P>
<P>
They decided to pool the contract last year and are expected to
order about 1,600 vehicles -- 1,200 for the US Army and the rest
for British Army.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles officially are under the name Tracer/FSCS and the
cost of each vehicle comes to more than 3 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the new vehicles would replace the Army's aging
Scorpion and Scimitar vehicles, neither of which proved efficient
machines in the Gulf and Bosnian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The powerful alliance is reported likely to be opposed by a
team including GKN Defense and GEC-Marconi in the UK with US
partners which have yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources here believe that it is unlikely that
other bidders will emerge because no other British company is
thought to be capable of supplying the technology and integration
systems for the highly complex machines.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lockheed Matin said that Tracer would be
designed to enter the battle theater ahead of the main battle
groups and gather intelligence through digital electronic
"sniffing, seeing and hearing" systems.
</P>
<P>
The armored vehicles will also be a radar-avoiding "stealth"
vehicle, designed to penetrate far behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
It will be packed with sophisticated radar, infra-red and visual
sensors, and carry massive computing power and state-of-the-art
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
BAe said that the Joint Requirements Operations Committee of
the US and British armies was scheduled to meet soon to hammer out
Tracer's technical requirements.

<HEADLINE> Police Detain 49 for Anti-Israel Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Police on Friday detained 49
men who demonstrated against an Israeli team taking part in an
ongoing cricket tournament in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators aged between 20 and 48 were arrested at a
mosque near the University Malaya's main gate in Petaling Jaya
adjacent to the capital city after the afternoon Friday prayer,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
About 500 demonstrators comprising university students and
opposition Parti (party) Islam Se Malaya (PAS) members assembled
near the university gate soon after Muslims finished the Friday
prayer at the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Policemen were deployed there earlier after authorities
received information of an impending demonstration near the
university.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad described the
demonstration as "stupid".
</P>
<P>
"This is a stupid act. We want to show the Israelis that
Muslims are right thinking people but with this act, the objective
is not met," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted by Bernama
as saying in Kota Baharu, about 475 kilometers northeast of here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the demonstration would not have any effect on
the Palestinian-Israeli issue "because if they go to any Arab
country they will see similar actions.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show that Muslims in Malaysia can do things without
being too emotional, but now these people go and demonstrate, this
is stupid," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told reporters there that while Malaysia did not have
diplomatic ties with Israel, it wanted to get especially the
younger Israelis to oppose hardliners like Israel's Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said holding demonstrations would not in any way benefit the
Palestinian struggle but instead only served to encourage the two
sides to go on fighting.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy for us to demonstrate and seek a continuation of the
war between the Jews and Palestinians because we are not the ones
going to war.
</P>
<P>
"We live here and it's easy to demonstrate because we know that
nobody shoots us if we demonstrate in Malaysia but in other
countries you get shot if you hold demonstrations," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were advised to stop their protests as their
actions did not help the peace process between the Palestinians
and the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Soldiers Ready for Evacuation of Westerners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 Western soldiers are now
in Congo and off the coast of Zaire to prepare for the evacuation
of 7,800 Western expatriates from Zaire, after the arrival of the
U.S. helicopter-carrier "USS Nassau" off the coast of Zaire,
Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
On board the USS Nassau are 1,800 U.S. marines who are
preparing to evacuate the 350 U.S. citizens staying in Zaire,
according to the Pentagon, which said that the deployment of U.S.
soldiers is purely for the purpose of evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 600 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Brazzaville,
which is separated from Kinshasa by the Zaire River, and they can
call for aid from the 300 U.S. soldiers in Libreville, Gabon, and
even the U.S. rapid reaction force in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with Chinook and Cobra military helicopters and
Harrier combat aircraft, the USS Nassau can serve as the basis
for a reinforced infantry battalion of the U.S. Army, and has
already served in the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Albania.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, the former colonial power in Zaire, has sent a
parachutist battalion of 550 soldiers to Brazzaville and the
Congolese port of Pointe-Noire, 350 kilometers west of the
Congolese capital.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian troops are equipped with five C-130 transport
aircraft and can evacuate the 2,800 Belgians living in Zaire,
1,000 of whom are in the southeastern province of Shaba.
</P>
<P>
France has sent 300 soldiers to Congo, and has 600 soldiers
regularly based in Libreville. The French troops have two Puma
military helicopters and some boats in Congo and two Transall
C-160 transport planes in Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Two thousand French nationals are living in Zaire, 900 of whom
are in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain has sent about 60 commandos of the Royal
Marine to Brazzaville. They are equipped with hovercraft and speed
boats.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- France today called on the Zairean
rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila to report "humanitarian
right" and start immediately negotiations with the new Zairean
government of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi.
</P>
<P>
"The ADFLC (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Congo) should respect the humanitarian right and let the rescue
arrive at the innocent victims of the conflict," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean rebels have refused to recognize the government of
Tshisekedi, who was nominated by President Mobutu Sese Seko on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that the inter-Zairean negotiations begin
effectively and that the cease-fire establish in an accompanying
way, so that the public engagement will be taken by Zaireans
themselves," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two warring sides of Zaire is
supposed to begin in the next few days in South Africa under the
mediation of the special envoy of the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity, Mohammed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
France once again has expressed its total support to the peace
mission of Sahnoun.

<HEADLINE> National Youth Policy Urged in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) today appealed to the
government to endorse a national youth policy to help find ways
for youths to participate in the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a youth conference here, ANCYL secretary for youth
development Songezo Mjongeli said the lack of such national youth
policy would affect South Africa's economic growth because their
participation in economic development was vital.
</P>
<P>
Mjongeli said the goals of the conference were to reduce
unemployment among the youth, and to provide another chance for
youth who had missed out on education and training; equitable
access to health and a better quality of life of all young
people.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from South Africa's all nine provinces are working
on a draft youth policy on the economy, human resources
development, peace and security, international relations, the
criminal justice system and the environment.
</P>
<P>
On human resources development, the draft said apartheid
produced a distorted skills profile based on racism.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, most Whites were given opportunities to
acquire formal skills through universities and technical schools
or through an apprenticeship system.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of Blacks acquired training informally and
the skills they acquired were usually not recognized.
</P>
<P>
The draft also called for emphasis on better results in
teaching numeracy, maths and natural sciences, especially in
previously disadvantaged schools.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Chief Issues Warning over EMU Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, has warned that forcing the European Monetary Union
(EMU) to go ahead according to a timetable rather than economic
convergence criteria would be fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the single European currency would
be launched on January 1 1999, but most of the 15 members of the
European Union (EU) were unlikely to meet the strict entry
criteria in time, according to financial experts.
</P>
<P>
"My sympathies remain with those who emphasize the importance
of sustainable convergence, rather than the calendar," the
Financial Times quoted George as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What really puzzles me is why anyone should want to risk
joining the euro area unless they were genuinely convinced that
the economic risks had been minimized through sustainable
convergence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor made it clear that Britain, which has won an
opt-out right on the single currency, remained committed to the
monetary and fiscal stability demanded by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
If the British government finally decided to stay out of the
single currency, it would be crucial to persevere with those
disciplines, he added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Renews Call for Conducting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today repeated his call on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) for concluding the final-status talks within six
months.
</P>
<P>
At today's cabinet meeting, Netanyahu called for an immediate
start of the final-status talks in order to solve all the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed a proposal being formulated by the United
States on resuming the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
which is based on the idea of conducting the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that, if the two sides failed to reach
agreement within six months, he is willing to attend a Camp David
style summit with PNA President Yasser Arafat under the auspices
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, so as to solve the outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
In September 1978, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter hosted
at the Camp David a historic summit between late Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Begin
and Sadat signed two peace agreements on normalizing bilateral
ties, thereby sealing the Israeli-Egyptian peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with German Television earlier today,
Netanyahu reaffirmed his stand that the talks should not begin
before the PNA halts the current wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
"I put forward the proposal, that once the violence is
stopped, to go towards the final-settlement negotiations for six
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is not resolved within six months, (it is time) for
Arafat and myself and President Clinton to meet in a Camp David
style summit, or to try to get finally one big effort to (achieve)
the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian disputes," he added.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, a day after Israel began the controversial Har
Homa settlement construction in East Jerusalem, Netanyahu first
proposed holding the final-status talks and concluding the
negotiations within six months rather than two years as
stipulated in the Oslo accords between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA rejected the proposal as a tactic to divert the
world attention from the Har Homa construction. PNA spokesman Abu
Rudeineh said the Palestinian side will not accept the proposal
simply because of its lack of trust in the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
By repeating his call for holding the final-status talks,
Netanyahu was apparently making a diplomatic gesture on the eve of
his upcoming U.S. visit. He is scheduled to depart Sunday for a
three-day U.S. trip, during which he will meet with Jordanian King
Hussein and Clinton on defusing the current Israeli-Palestinian
crisis, triggered by the Har Homa Jewish settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks will tackle the most difficult and
sensitive issues on the final borders, status of Jerusalem and
fate of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Down to 5.2 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in the U.S.
declined for the second consecutive month to 5.2 percent in March,
U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest seasonally adjusted jobless rate in five
months and it followed the rate of 5.3 percent in February and 5.4
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The report said that employers reported a moderate increase of
175,000 in jobs after gains of 293,000 in February and 259,000 in
January.
</P>
<P>
The job growth in March was led by service industries such as
computer and data processing, retailing and banks and securities.
Manufacturing employment rose by 16,000 while construction
employment, which had shot up by 108,000 in February, fell 27,000
in March.
</P>
<P>
While job growth last month was moderate, average hourly wages
in the country rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
The report said that average hourly earnings of non-farm,
non-supervisory workers rose by 0.4 percent to 12.15 dollars in
March after an identical gain in February.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, average wages in the U.S. are up 4 percent
but that hasn't translated into an increase in inflation which was
3.3 percent in last year.
</P>
<P>
With other signs the economy's strength is extending into the
Spring, many economists believe the U.S. unemployment rate could
slip below 5 percent later this year for the first time in a
quarter century.
</P>
<P>
The White House welcomes the news today as a sign of "a healthy
economy".
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street took the report as another sign that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates again, resulting
in a brief falling of more than 70 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average in early trading today.

<HEADLINE> EU to Hold Conference on Trafficking in Women in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- As President of the European Union,
the Netherlands is organizing a ministerial conference dealing with
international trafficking in women.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the conference, due to be held from 24 to 26 April in
The Hague, is to bring about recommendations for a code of conduct
to prevent and combat trafficking in women, the Dutch EU presidency
said on Friday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
This is a follow-up to the Fourth World Women's Conference in
Beijing in 1995 and the European Conference on Trafficking in Women
held in Vienna in 1996, the Presidency said.
</P>
<P>
The themes to be discussed at the conference, which will be
attended by ministers of Equal Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of
EU member states, are the prevention, detection and prosecution of
those involved in trafficking in women.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate made by the International Organization
for Migration, in 1995 some 500,000 women were trafficked to the EU.
Many of these women came from Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Lille's midfielder David Garcion
tested positive for anabolic steroids, the first time a French
professional soccer player being caught for the performance
enhancing substance, a sports newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe said Garcion failed a drug test following a match
against Nice last December.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a player in the French first division
league has tested positive for the muscle building drug, the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
L'Equipe said according to relevant rules, Garcion could be
suspended for nine months.
</P>
<P>
Garcion has reportedly appealed the test findings and will
continue to play for Lille until a verdict is reached by the
special commission of the French soccer federation.

<HEADLINE> US Pentagon Says Cost of F-22 Program Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today defended the F-22 program despite of its higher cost
than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. NBC's "Today" show, Cohen
said, "we need planes such as the F-22... in order to be able to
carry out our mission."
</P>
<P>
However, critics have indicated that there is no threat from
any enemy that requires the U.S. to deploy the sophisticated and
expensive F-22 fighters.
</P>
<P>
In a letter made public Thursday, Cohen told congressmen that
the latest Pentagon estimate of the F-22 is 33 percent higher than
the earlier Air Force projection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force says 438 of the radar-evading fighters will
cost 43.8 billion U.S. dollars while Cohen's advisers put the
figure at 64.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force insists that program costs can be cut. But Cohen
warned that "such reductions might not be achieved."

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party, UF Informal Talks Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Informal consultations among
major Indian parties to resolve the political crisis facing the
10-month-old H.D. Deve Gowda government were stalled today
following a hardening of posture both by the Congress party and
the ruling United Front (UF), the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis arose out of the Congress party's withdrawal
of support for the 14-party UF government on March 30, a move
which reduced the government to a minority.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party staked its claim to form an alternative
government soon after it withdrew support for the UF.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister V.P. Singh, who has been trying to broker
peace between the Congress party and the UF in the past few days
in order to keep the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out
of power, said today that he stood by the UF resolution -- "no
support to the Congress party and no change in UF leadership."
</P>
<P>
The Congress party today sharpened its attack on Prime Minister
Deve Gowda, with senior party leader K. Karunakaran making Gowda's
resignation a precondition for the party to review its decision to
withdraw support for the UF government.
</P>
<P>
"Gowda should be replaced. Only then we will consider the UF
appeal to us," he said, referring to the UF's request that the
Congress party review its decision to scrap support to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Karunakaran, a member of the Congress Working Committee which
is the highest decision making body of the Congress party, was
part of the core group which took the decision that support to the
Deve Gowda government be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UF today ruled out sharing power with the
Congress party, but said it had an "open mind" on the modalities
of the talks with the party.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Congress party's insistence on Gowda's
resignation, a UF spokesman reiterated the stand taken by the UF
Steering Committee that the leadership issue of the UF was
non-negotiable.

<HEADLINE> British and U.S. Arms Makers to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A British arms maker will join
hands with a leading United States arms producer in bidding
for a battlefield vehicle supply contract for the troops of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 5 billion U.S. dollar deal to supply state-of-the-art
battlefield reconnaissance vehicles, Tracer/FSCS, is seen as a big
step toward defense cooperation between Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace (BAe) and U.S. Lockheed Martin will form a
joint venture to handle the bid, with armored vehicle makers
Vickers and Alvis from Britain and General Dynamics Land Systems
from the U.S. acting as main contractors to the company.
</P>
<P>
They decided to pool the contract last year and are expected to
order about 1,600 vehicles -- 1,200 for the U.S. Army and 400 for
the British Army.
</P>
<P>
BAe said that the Joint Requirements Operations Committee of
the U.S. and British armies would meet soon to define Tracer's
technical requirements. The vehicles are estimated at more than 3
million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Britain would use the new vehicles to replace its aging
Scorpion and Scimitar vehicles, which proved inefficient in the
Gulf and Bosnian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
British GKN Defense and GEC-Marconi reportedly would challenge
the two companies in the bid.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources here believe that it is unlikely that
other bidders will emerge because no other British company is
thought to be capable of supplying the technology and integration
systems for the highly complex machines.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lockheed Martin said that Tracer would be a
radar-avoiding "stealth" vehicle, designed to penetrate far behind
enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
It will be packed with sophisticated radar, infra-red and
visual sensors, and carry massive computing power and
state-of-the-art communications equipment.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Deliver Emergency Food Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) will
deliver 420 tons of food donated by the Italian government to
Albania soon in a joint operation launched today by WFP and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The food, including flour, beans and vegetable oil, can feed
7,500 people for four months, a WFP press release said.
</P>
<P>
The food will be delivered to orphanages, hospitals, homes for
the elderly and centers for the handicapped in the capital city of
Tirana, as well as the northern and central Albania's towns of
Skoder and Kavaje and Lushnje and Fier in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said the food would also go to the poorest households
affected by the collapse of the social welfare system.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first United Nations delivery of food to
Albania since the serious political crisis erupted in March," the
WFP said.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment is expected to arrive at the port of Durres
early next week and the distribution will be carried out by the
Albanian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and some
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preparations for a much larger emergency food aid
operation are underway, the WFP added.
</P>
<P>
It said the current wheat requirement in Albania is estimated
at 700,000 tons. In Albania which is one of the poorest countries
in Europe, urban residents rely heavily on food imports as only 4
percent of domestic production enters the market.
</P>
<P>
During a recent week-long visit to Albania, a WFP assessment
mission has found that the country's food-supply infrastructure
has been largely destroyed or being out of function due to
security fears among workers.
</P>
<P>
"The current food crisis in Albania has been further aggravated
by the closure of its borders, which has made it impossible to
import food," WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
"Humanitarian relief is essential if we are to avoid a further
aggravation of social tensions," Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
Food prices in Albania have risen by 40 percent after the
recent disturbances, said the WFP, while wheat production in 1996
dropped nearly 26 percent from 1995 to about 300,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NGO Official on Protection of Women's Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The conference on human rights
should pay more attention to the elimination of poverty and
discrimination and violence against women, a Chinese NGO
representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing session of the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, Feng Cui, an official from the All-China
Women's Federation (ACWF), said the commission should adjust its
work priority so that it can reflect the wishes and demands of the
broad masses of people including women.
</P>
<P>
She accused a few western countries of deliberately distorting
the concept of human rights, pursuing double standard instead of
taking an impartial and objective attitude, creating confrontation
instead of promoting cooperation, and even using the human rights
issue as a tool to attack other sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
Feng urged the Human Rights Commission to take measures to stop
and correct this abnormal situation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
She hoped the international community will help the NGOs of the
developing countries participate in the international human rights
activities so that their aspirations and demands could be
presented to the commission.
</P>
<P>
She called on NGOs to play an active role in monitoring
government activities in international cooperation regarding human
rights.
</P>
<P>
She said that ACWF, the largest women NGO in China, has
actively participated in international and domestic activities
aimed at promoting and protecting women's human rights.
</P>
<P>
Feng said the ACWF has been involved in a series of human
rights-related activities, such as literacy programs,
poverty-eliminating projects, re-employment programs, and
political empowerment campaign among women in China's rural and
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
She said these activities had effectively safeguarded the human
rights of women and children and raised the awareness of the whole
society on gender equality as a follow-up to the Fourth World
Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"All these activities have produced great impact on the
promotion and protection of women's human rights," Feng said.

<HEADLINE> UF to Ask Congress Party to Review Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling United Front (UF)
is likely to formally ask the Congress party tomorrow to
reconsider its decision to withdraw support for the 10-month-old
government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, the Press Trust
of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The UF may also propose setting up a committee to sort out
differences between the two sides as part of efforts to resolve
the current political crisis following the Congress party's
withdrawal of support last Sunday, UF sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, senior UF leaders are understood to
have conveyed to the Congress party that a letter requesting
Congress to review its decision would be sent tomorrow after the
UF Steering Committee convenor, N. Chandrababu Naidu, holds
consultations with other UF leaders on his arrival here from
Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Some UF leaders, who have met senior Congress party leaders,
were told that the Steering Committee had not addressed the party
directly but only issued an appeal through the media.
</P>
<P>
So far, parleys between the UF and the Congress party have been
informal and the latter is pressing for a formal dialogue.

<HEADLINE> French Court Orders Renault to Suspend Closure of Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A French court today ordered the
automaker Renault to suspend the procedure to close its Vilvoorde
assembly plant in Belgium, which will result in the layoff of
3,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal of Grand Instance of Nanterre outside Paris, where
the office of social affairs department of Renault is located,
asked Renault to stop "pursuing the application of the closure of
the Vilvoorde plant until it has fulfilled its duty of information
and consultation with its Committee of European Group."
</P>
<P>
The decision followed an earlier decision this week by a
Belgian court in Brussels declaring the procedure by Renault to
close the Vilvoorde plant as illegal in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The court in Nanterre also ordered Renault to pay 15,000 francs
(3,000 U.S. dollars) to the Committee of the European Group, an
employees' consultation institution for all the Renault plants in
Europe, for failing to make consultation with it when making the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Renault have decided to make appeals against the two rulings by
the courts, and said that "the elements of procedure will not
change the economic necessities which impose themselves upon the
enterprise," reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Renault has been losing money for years and is planning a large
scale social restructuring of its industrial sector to make itself
more competitive in European and world auto market.
</P>
<P>
Renault's labor unions in France, Spain and Belgium, which have
been holding trans-national European protests since Renault
announced the decision in late February, today welcomed the court
rulings.
</P>
<P>
From 500 to 1,000 Renault workers from Vilvoorde today
demonstrated in Brussels in an "over-charged atmosphere" in
front of the headquarters of the European Commission, where the
European commissioner for competition, Karel van Miert, met with
representatives of the workers, according to AFP.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Unveils New Safety Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French
Channel tunnel operator, unveiled new safety procedures Thursday
in the wake of last November's Channel tunnel fire and confirmed
that it would re-open freight shuttle services in June.
</P>
<P>
The safety improvements announced Thursday include more checks
on lorries, stopping trains in the tunnel as soon as a fire is
discovered rather than attempting to drive out, installing water
sprinklers in the tunnel, adding electronic devices to show more
precisely where a train has stopped, and providing smoke hoods for
truck drivers and train crew.
</P>
<P>
However, the company confirmed that it had no intention of
enclosing its controversial open lattice-sided lorry shuttle
wagons and rejected suggestions that the semi-open structure of
the wagons had contributed significantly to the spread of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ponsolle, Eurotunnel co-chairman, said: "We don't think
absolute safety is possible but we have learned lessons from this
incident and have already implemented a number of important
changes".
</P>
<P>
But the Fire Brigade Union accused the company of putting
passengers' lives at risk, warning that its refusal to change the
wagons was complacency at its worst and that a future, fatal fire
was "an absolute certainty".
</P>
<P>
The new measures are expected to cost 20 million pounds (32.8
million US dollars) in new equipment and 1-2 million pounds
(1.64-3.28 million US dollars) a year in additional staff costs
and staff training.
</P>
<P>
A decision on whether Eurotunnel's plans are adequate will be
taken next month by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, a joint
British and French body responsible for regulating the operation
of the tunnel. But Eurotunnel said it was confident there would be
no problems.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel hopes that the freight shuttles, which were
transporting 2,000 wagons a day before the fire, can be resumed in
June after tunnel repairs are complete.
</P>
<P>
Last year's fire has so far cost about 75 million pounds (123
million US dollars) in lost revenue. But the cost to the company
will be about 10 million pounds (16.4 million US dollars) with the
rest covered by insurers.

<HEADLINE> Turk Charged with Setting Blaze That Killed His Wife, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish man was arrested today and
charged with deliberately setting a blaze in his own apartment in
the western German city of Krefeld on Monday which killed his wife
and two of his children, German media reported.
</P>
<P>
German investigators said the 42-year-old Turk, identified as
Aziz Demir had started the fire after his wife had told him she
would file for divorce following the March 28-31 Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in Krefeld at about 02:00 hours Monday
forced Demir's 41-year-old wife and one of his daughter to jump to
deaths from a three-floor window of their apartment. The son of
the couple was found dead later in the flat, dying from smoke
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
Demir had claimed to have been at a bar when the fire broke
out. He had to be refrained by the police from rushing into the
burning house after returning home at about 02:30 hours.
</P>
<P>
But German investigators said they had obtained a video film
from a petrol station security camera showing him filling a petrol
canister three hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to police in Krefeld, two witnesses also saw Demir
carrying the petrol canister and heading for his apartment
building later.
</P>
<P>
German prosecutors said Demir, who has worked in Germany for 20
years, had regularly beaten his wife and children. To avoid their
father, the children had even slept out in the family car.
</P>
<P>
The wife had been preparing for a divorce and had moved money
to Turkey, they added.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Zaire to Allow Access to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today called on all the parties, especially the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, to allow aid
agencies free access to refugees and displaced persons in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said that the
council was deeply concerned with the serious humanitarian
situation in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The council fully shares the concerns of the (U.N.)
secretary-general expressed yesterday as well as the joint appeal
issued today by the European Union, UNHCR and UNICEF," he said in
a statement to press.
</P>
<P>
The six-month-old civil war has driven countless Rwandan
refugees and local people into the interior. Numerous people have
already died or are dying of exhaustion, hunger and disease. Over
the past week, the United Nations Higher Commissioner for
Refugees, United Nations Children's Fund and the World Food
Program and other aid agencies are trying to aid more than 100,000
refugees who have re-emerged from the forest. The aid agencies
estimate that more displaced persons remain out of reach.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urges all parties in Zaire to enable aid
workers to reach and assist refugees and displaced persons among
whom are thousands of children, Monteiro said.
</P>
<P>
"They need help -- and they need it now," he added.

LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe all
stopped their recent drops and ended in the positive grounds
Friday as the Dow recovered from its early losses.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London were forced back from a session high

<P>
It was reported that New York investors took fright again on
fears of more US rate hikes, and buyers in London could do little
else but follow despite a buoyant UK economy.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed sharply higher in response
to a firm dollar and bond market, with the DAX-30 index up 29.69

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Takes Off on 16-Day Science Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Space shuttle Columbia
blasted off this afternoon on a 16-day mission to study how the
near-zero gravity changes the freezing and melting processes,
metal, plants, disease cells and especially fire.
</P>
<P>
NASA's oldest shuttle and its seven member crew soared into
orbit from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 2:20 p.m. EST, after
a one-day delay because some of the shuttle's coolant pipes were
missing insulation.
</P>
<P>
Liftoff was originally scheduled for 2 p.m. this afternoon, but
a troubled leak check of the shuttle cabin made NASA delay the
launch for another 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
During their space voyage, the astronauts will set as many as
200 small fires in Columbia's laboratory. The study will help
determine how quickly flames spread in weightlessness in order to
develop cleaner fuels and better firefighting techniques, both in
space and on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Fire in spaceships is a serious issue. Fire killed three Apollo
astronauts in 1967 during a countdown dress rehearsal. In
February, the Russian space station Mir had a small fire that
blocked access to the crew's escape ship and produced smoke.
</P>
<P>
The fire tests are among 33 planned experiments that are
considered precursors for the future international space station.
Also on board are spinach, clover, sage and pine seedlings, as
well as various crystals and metals.
</P>
<P>
This is the third shuttle mission this year and the 83rd since
Columbia made the first shuttle flight in 1981.

<HEADLINE> US Expresses Concerns Over Israel's Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today expressed concerns over a new Israeli plan to expand the
existing Jewish settlement on the West Bank and near Jerusalem,
indicating such a move will further erode confidence between the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During a photo session with Norway's Foreign Minister Bjoern
Tore Godfal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
that she raised the issue during a meeting Thursday with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very delicate moment in the whole situation, where it's
very important to do everything we can to rebuild the bonds of
confidence. Within that context, I expressed my concern to
Minister Mordechai about the thickening of the settlement," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai announced this week that there is a plan to add 358
housing units to the West Bank settlements of Jenin and Sharei
Tikva and several thousand near Jerusalem. And he told a Jewish
group in Washington today that the existing settlements "must be
able to develop and grow."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has opposed construction of new
settlements as complicating to territorial negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians, but said expansion of existing ones
wasn't a problem as long as it was a product of "natural growth."
</P>
<P>
But this time, the Clinton administration expressed "concerns"
as it is at a sensitive time.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Balkan Needs Comprehensive Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
today stressed the need for Balkan countries to have a
comprehensive action plan in order to overcome the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Simitis made the remark while attending the two-day conference
of the European Socialist Party (ESP) on the Balkans, which opened
today in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union (EU) did not yet have an all-round
policy which would effectively support the Balkan countries during
this fluid period of transition to the free market economy, and
called on EU countries to assume their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the first priority was the provision of
emergency aid so as to achieve economic stabilization and
consolidate the hopeful political solutions which were already on
course.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the mobilization and intervention of other
international organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), the Western European Union, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as the
governments of all countries that directly or indirectly influence
developments in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that countries in central and eastern Europe
should be treated equally. He was referring to the countries'
membership bid for the entry into the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference shortly before the opening of
the conference, ESP President Rudolf Scharping said stability in
the Balkans was a prerequisite for security in the whole of Europe
and the ESP was in favor of political dialogue for the resolution
of the crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue among the political forces of the Balkans could play a
"decisive role" in developments in the region, he said, adding
that otherwise they would face a wave of conflicts.

ABU DHABI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chief of staff of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) armed forces Mohammed Bin Zayed al Nahyan
today suggested the Arab Gulf states form a security policy to
ensure the stability and preserve the resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a two-day symposium on the
gulf security held here this morning, Mohammed said the world
interest in the stability and security of the Gulf region is
growing due to the importance of its oil.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the UAE Survey and Research
Center, was attended by dozens of politicians, scholars and
diplomats from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
</P>
<P>
"The security issue is of great significance in the Gulf
region in particular," the UAE official noted at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed pointed out that security in the region faces many
challenges due to the meshing of the regional interests with the
international ones.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of conducting research and
consultations on the security of the region and hailed regional
discussions to establish a common stance on security issues.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day symposium, issues relating to the security
of the Gulf region as well as its internal and external relations

<HEADLINE> Eritrean President Visits Guangdong, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 5 (xinhua) -- Eritrean President Issayas
Aferwerki, accompanied by Shi Yongjiu, Chinese ambassador to
Eritrea, arrived in Guangzhou today from Republic of Korea on a
special visit to Guangdong Province at the invitation of the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade Commission, Merchants Bureau and relevant
enterprises held talks this afternoon with Eritrean guests,
discussing bilateral investment, and exchanges of cooperation in
economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ruihua, governor of the province, met with and entertained
the visiting president and his party. Lu briefed the guests on
Guangdong's economic and social development, saying that
Guangdong's fast economic development in recent years can be
attributed to its efforts to use large amounts of foreign
investment, which contributed greatly to its industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The governor said its industrial output value has far exceeded
that of agriculture, and Guangdong, a former agricultural
province, has become an industrial one.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong and Eritrea are supplementary in the fields of
electronics, light industry and planting and breeding, and also
have broad prospects for economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president expressed admiration for the province's
speedy economic growth, saying that Eritrea is a young nation, and
the Eritrean people long for economic prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The trip to Guangdong is the second leg of his Asian tour. He
said that he came to Guangdong for one special purpose: to learn
more about the province's experience in using foreign investment
to set up special economic zones, hoping that the two sides will
increase contact and exchanges to promote bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While in Guangdong, the president will see an exhibition on the
province's achievements in reform and opening up, and visit
Shenzhen and Dongguan as well as local businesses and urban
construction projects.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Government Endeavors to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has come up with a new package for
farmers this week, doling out big concessions aimed at improving
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Agriculture Convention Thursday attended by
thousands of farmers, the prime minister vowed to bring "green
revolution" in the country by taking concrete steps to make
Pakistan self-sufficient in agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Pakistan's
economy, contributing almost a quarter of the national income.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector has not received due attention during the
last three decades or more as a result of long-running political
instability, which often resulted in frequent changes of
governments and inconsistent implementation of farm policies.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, as an agricultural country, is now facing a serious
crisis, particularly the acute shortage of wheat, sugar and edible
oil.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government, which came to power on February 17, is
now attaching great importance to this vital sector and has lost
no time in launching an incentive agricultural package.
</P>
<P>
The package carries a hike in support prices of wheat, rice and
edible oil besides a slash in agricultural input, increases in the
allocation of loans for farmers and solid measures for improving
irrigation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The new government will also carry out extensive agro-research
and improve infrastructure including construction of road networks
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The package has been widely welcomed and has been termed by
some agricultural experts as "a historic step" to stabilize the
agricultural sector which is the base line of Pakistan's national
economy.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that comprehensive efforts to revive the
unstable agricultural sector are imperative when Pakistan, once
dubbed a "food granary" of the sub-continent, has been importing
two million tons of wheat or more during the last three years, and
the import of wheat for the current year is to cost a massive 25
billion rupees (625 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, edible oil, sugar, dairy products and a variety of
vegetables in short supply have been imported along with meat,
accounting for 25 percent of the total import bills of the
country, which is already facing an acute balance of payments
problem.
</P>
<P>
Successive governments in Pakistan have treated enhancement of
agricultural production as a bureaucratic exercise of fixing
targets without achieving any meaningful result, Agriculture
Minister Abida Hussain said in her speech delivered at Thursday's
convention.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector, which
contributes 24 percent of Pakistan's national income, is less than
5 percent of development expenditures each year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that inadequate public investment, high cost of
maintenance and wrong-headed price policies in Pakistan are the
major causes of these problems.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the deterioration in the physical integrity of the
irrigation and drainage system and quality of soils has also posed
a serious threat to the sustainability of agricultural growth in
the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that due to the continued neglect of irrigation
infrastructure, 70 percent of water is lost in the delivery system
besides the twin menaces of waterlogging and salinity which
continue to damage soil productivity.
</P>
<P>
On the policy front, agriculture experts here are of the view
that the most serious problem is the imbalance between input and
output prices, which reduces farmers' income, fuels ballooning
import bills and encourages smuggling of local produce to the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural package will be helpful in reducing the import
bills of wheat and edible oil, they said. And massive increases in
the support prices of wheat, rice and sunflower seed are expected
to play an active role in increasing areas for the cultivation of
these crops.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the abolition of 12.5 percent sales tax on cotton
seed will give relief to cotton growers, and reduction in the duty
on agricultural machinery would be helpful in introducing modern
techniques.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the package is fairly comprehensive and
should help ease some of the immediate and short-term problems
confronting the country's agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pay Respect to Ancestors at Qingming Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Chinese from
home and abroad gathered to pay their respects to one of their
forefathers before his majestic tomb on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River today, a day known as "Qingming" on which Chinese
traditionally remember their deceased, mostly family members and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
A grand, solemn ceremony was staged before the tomb of the
Yellow Emperor at Huangling (Yellow Mausoleum) County in Northwest
China's Shaanxi Province. The event was supervised by State
Councillor Song Jian and Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
At 9:50 a.m., drummers in ethnic costumes beat their drums 32
times, signifying China's 34 provinces, municipalities, autonomous
regions and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
and the Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The resonant drum beats were followed by 12 rings from a bell,
which symbolized the 1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Amid the slow-rhythmed ancient Chinese music of bamboo and
string instruments, visitors placed wreaths and bowed at the 3.6-m
tall mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Philip Wong Yu-hong, vice chairman of the Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong and member of the preparatory
committee of the HKSAR, told Xinhua that he felt excited being
back in Shaanxi after a period of three years, particularly when
Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"On this special occasion, I believe that all of us here feel
the same," the 59-year-old man said. "The return of Hong Kong
marks not just the beginning of an epoch of "one country, two
systems" for Hong Kong, but also a starting point for all of the
Chinese people to march toward a unified and strong China."
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd was Henry Hu Hung-lick, a renowned attorney
from Hong Kong and also a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC, and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Marveling at a giant tree believed to have been planted 5,000
years ago by the Yellow Emperor himself, the 77-year-old Hung-lick
expressed his hope that the ritual for the Yellow Emperor would
continue, saying "the activity can encourage all Chinese people to
contribute to the cause of reunifying the country."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the city of Baoji, also in Shaanxi Province, a
similar event was held by the local government to remember the Yan
Emperor, another Chinese ancestor. Historical records and legends
hold that the Yan Emperor was born here 5,000 years ago. The
Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as "descendents of
the Yan and Yellow emperors."
</P>
<P>
Exactly 1997 pigeons were let into the air, marking China's
resumption of exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong. Artistic
performances were given and more than 1,000 people took part in a
5,000-m foot race.
</P>
<P>
According to legend, numerous tribes lived on the vast and
rugged Chinese land some 5,000 years ago. Two major tribes, headed
separately by the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor, fought and
later merged, along with other smaller tribes, into an early
version of the Chinese ethnic population.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Peace Process on Verge of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has warned, in an urgent message to U.S. President
Bill Clinton, that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was on
the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The PNA sent the message on the eve of the Sunday visit by
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to travel Sunday to the U.S. on a three-day
working visit and will meet with Jordanian King Hussein who is
currently in the U.S. undergoing a prostate surgery in Rochester,
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Netanyahu will meet with the U.S. president and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to discuss ways of
defusing the Israeli-Palestinian tension.
</P>
<P>
The message said if the current crisis continued, the forces
of peace would be left behind and forces of violence would be
pushed to the fore, which meant the eruption of an all-out
confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the PNA demanded the U.S. government to put
more pressure on Israel to change its hardline policies that
have led to the deadlock in the peace process and to the current
wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat convened in Gaza Friday night a
joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and the PNA cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with the current situation and the resolution
adopted in Cairo, Egypt, last week by the Arab League's Foreign
Ministers Meeting to recommend freezing ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rudeineh, PNA cabinet secretary, said Israel should halt
the controversial Har Homa construction in East Jerusalem before
an Arafat-Netanyahu summit could take place.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's proposal to immediately resume
and conclude within six months the final-status talks, Rudeineh
said the PNA was studying all proposals on resuming the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the PNA was skeptical, in the absence of its
trust for the Netanyahu government, if Israel's proposal was
enough to bring back the stalled peace process on track.
</P>
<P>
Saying the PNA was still waiting for the U.S. initiative to
break the peace stalemate, Rudeineh urged Clinton to guarantee
Israel's commitments to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly formulating a new proposal on
restarting the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations based on
the idea of reviving the final-status peace talks, which will
tackle the most difficult issues of the final borders, status of
Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Early Retirement Package Sparks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sense of insecurity among workers
in the money-losing public sectors abounds as Egypt's early
retirement renumeration package prepares to hit the road, the
English weekly Al-Ahram reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, approved by the cabinet's ad-hoc committee on
privatization on March 23, is designed to encourage early
retirement in the ailing public sector enterprises and cushion
the shocking waves of privatization.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, men between the ages of 50-58 and women
between 45-58, who have been employed for at least 20 years, are
eligible for early retirement in return for a lump sum payment
ranging between 12,000 and 35,000 Egyptian pounds (about 3,529
and 10,294 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, chairman of the committee,
has held that the scheme will balance the interests of the
employees and their stumbling companies.
</P>
<P>
However, many argue, instead of giving extra reparations to
the would-be pensioners, the plan actually reduces the sum that
will have been payable if a full period of service is completed.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mursi, secretary-general of the Trade Union
Federation, speculated that a worker that quits before the age of
45 will get a pension 15 percent less than his due at a normal
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a worker retiring at 50 will settle for a sum 10
percent less than his normal pay, and 5 percent less for a
55-year-old retiree.
</P>
<P>
Though the gap narrows with a longer stay, it hardly makes a
big improvement on the pensioner's future job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The government scheme makes no satisfactory allowance for the
future of workers, many of whom have never known much about any
career move before, said Saad El-Din Khalifa, commercial
consultant for a state-owned wood factory.
</P>
<P>
"By the time they are in their fifties, they are unable to
work in any other place because their skills are limited by the
physically challenging nature of their jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Khalifa offered his recipe for the problem
of excess employment in the public sector, saying that companies
should encourage workers to become their shareholders, or set up
a certain social insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
Giving not even a lukewarm welcome to the plan, public sector
workers feared that the government is taking more than it gives.
</P>
<P>
A worker at the Egyptian Company for the Manufacture of Wood,
who earns 85 pounds (25 dollars) a month, said that he prefers
what he is getting now, a small but day-to-day payment, to the
promised compensation which "amounts to nothing" for him.
</P>
<P>
"To take one lump sum that could be very easily lost in an
unsuccessful venture is too risky. My future would be over," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another worker said on condition of anonymity that he even
doubted that the ceiling compensation money would be enough to
cover one serious surgical operation once he is no longer covered
by the company's medical insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the company's employees agreed that the funds had
better be spent on the purchase of new equipment and guaranteeing
the regular supply of raw material.
</P>
<P>
Such a policy, they argue, can save their company, and in a
real sense, their own jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some experts pointed out that the ailing companies
are going bankrupt because of bad management and lack of
efficiency, but not of overemployment.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that certain investment on the workers, such as
on-the-job training and re-education, would guarantee a more
capable workforce, if not a bigger workforce.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in the country of 62 million people has reached
17.5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in this vein, Gouda Abdel-Khalek, professor of
economics at the Cairo University, urges the allocation of funds
to retrain workers and alleviate their transitional doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he warned, they would be left facing a competitive
and aggressive market with little preparation or relief.
</P>
<P>
The early retirement package will be implemented in
unprofitable and stumbling companies at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The top 15 depressed companies affiliated to the public
business sector owe 1.5 billion pounds (441.2 million dollars) in
addition to the same sum in interests, according to Public
Enterprise Atef Ebeid. The majority of them are in the spinning
and weaving, chemicals and metallurgical sectors.

<HEADLINE> Calm in South Lebanon Despite Israeli Air Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A relative calm still shrouds south
Lebanon today despite a dawn air raid carried out by Israeli
military helicopters at suspected targets of Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas, security sources in the area reported.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Israeli helicopters fired three
air-to-surface missiles at vicinities of the village of Lebbayyah
in Western Beqaa without causing casualties or damages.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters also swept with machineguns the heights of
Jebel Al-Zahr and the vicinities of Lebbayyah and Ein Al-Fjour.
</P>
<P>
The air raid followed reconnaissance flights of Israeli
helicopters over Western Beqaa, some 80 kilometers southeast of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous security sources disclosed that the Israeli
forces were attempting to drop commandos to launch attacks on the
guerrilla targets, but the groundfire of the Lebanese army gunners
and the guerrillas in the area thwarted the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the minor clash earlier this morning did not break a
rarely calm which has shrouded south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, since more than two
weeks except sporadic trades of fire.
</P>
<P>
In an ambush targeting a patrol of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in the Israeli self-carved "security
zone" Tuesday, fighters of the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah killed
one SLA militiaman and wounded five others.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer
zone in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Michael Chang Set to Regain Salem Open Title in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- With the absence of world's
top-ranked Pete Sampras of the United States, his fellow
countryman Michael Chang poses as the hottest title contender at
the Salem Open tennis tournament which opened here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As top-seeded Sampras had earlier quit the annual Hong Kong
event due to a wrist injury suffered last month, Chang was lifted
by the organizers as top seed for the 328,000 U.S. dollar event.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a 27-year-old American-Chinese and two-time winner of
the Salem Open, is seeking a major title in Asia after a
disappointed 1996 season when every Asian title had eluded him.
</P>
<P>
According to the draw carried out here on Saturday, the
third-ranked Chang begins his assault on Monday to regain the
title which was taken from him at last year's event by Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Chang will take on and is expected to win over Hong Kong's
Melvin Tong in the men's singles main draw's first round.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion from the 1992 Games Marc Rosset of Switzerland
 will take on Nicolas Kiefer from Germany in the first round on
Monday. The second-seeded Rosset is ranked 16th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Australia's third seed Todd Woodbridge, now ranked 26th in the
world, will meet Doug Flach from the United States, also on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other seeds of the nine-day event are Sweden's Thomas
Johansson, ranked 39th, Australia's Salem Open regular participant
Patrick Rafter, now ranked 43rd in the world, Czech Republic's
Martin Damm, who defeated Chang in the second round at last year's
Beijing Open, David Prinosil from Germany and another Czech Daniel

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Court Confirms First Death Penalty for Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan higher court Friday
confirmed the first death penalty given to a former official
convicted of genocide in the 1994 massacre against Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal of Kigali rejected an appeal by Egide
Gatanazi, 43, who was convicted of murders, rapes and lootings by
the Tribunal of First Instance of Kibungo in southeast Rwanda on
January 3 in the country's first genocide trial.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal will make a ruling on April 18 on the
appeal by Geogratias Bizimana, a 37-year-old male nurse, who was
convicted of genocide by the same court.
</P>
<P>
The two men pleaded not guilty during their trial which began
last December, two years and a half after Hutu extremists killed
at least 500,000 people from April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people, most of them Hutus, are now in prison
waiting for trial on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 other people have also been given death penalties
for genocide by lower courts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
joined two million Beijing residents here today to take part in
the annual nationwide voluntary tree-planting day.
</P>
<P>
On the bright sunny morning, Jiang and other senior Chinese
leaders Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu
Jintao, came to south Beijing's Park of the Temple of Heaven,
where they were joined by dozens of school children carrying
buckets.
</P>
<P>
Jiang planted two pine trees, shovelling the soil with a
spade. Three students helped him water the newly-planted trees.
</P>
<P>
The Park of the Temple of Heaven is known for its vast spread
of well-preserved evergreens; at least 4,000 of them were planted
hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Tree planting and afforestation represents an important
undertaking that benefits the country and people a great deal,"
Jiang noted in planting the trees. "The entire nation must be
mobilized to continue this endeavor."
</P>
<P>
Since China launched its annual nationwide voluntary
tree-planting day 16 years ago, a total of 25 billion trees have
been planted throughout the country. The percentage of forest
cover in the country has reached 13.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
The yearly tree-planting day falls on the first Saturday of
April. At least two million Beijing residents planted trees in and
around the city today.
</P>
<P>
"This warm and blooming Spring day is the best time for tree
planting," Premier Li said, while watering a pine just
planted. "As the national capital, Beijing should be cleaner and
prettier."
</P>
<P>
Beijing is among the best forested cities in the country, with
a percentage of forest cover reaching 32 percent, according to the
Ministry of Forestry.

NAIROBI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Forces of the rebel Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) today
entered zaire's diamond capital of mbuji-mayi in central Zaire, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Mining sources in the town said rebels had streamed in across
a bridge in the morning.
</P>
<P>
``People are cheering in the streets, there's a heck of a lot
of noise. they are treating this as very good news,'' one said.

The rebels took up arms to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko
last October. They repulsed an offensive launched by government
troops in February and seized Kisengani, the third largest city
in Zaire and vowed to take Lubumbashi in Shaba Province this
month
</P>
<P>
The mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi and the surrounding Kasai
region of central Zaire is a diamond-rich land of opposition to
President Mobutu. Kasai even uses different money to defy the
ailing president and is a crucial test of support for the rebel
alliance.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Academy of Science (CAS),
the country's top scientific body, announced here today that in
principle scientists over age of 65 will not be given jobs as
heads of the country's major scientific research projects.
</P>
<P>
The academy made the decision in an effort to promote the
country's outstanding young scientists to key research positions
at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
There are 48,000 researchers and other technical professionals
working with CAS, 60 percent of whom are young scientists under
the age of 45, according to Prof. Lu Yongxiang, vice-president of
CAS.
</P>
<P>
"But only one fourth of these young scientists have the titles
of 'associate professor' or 'full professor'," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, about 3,000 research fellows and full
professors, accounting for three fourths of the academy's senior
scientists, will retire in the next three years," Lu told the
annual working meeting of CAS.
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, CAS has decided that at least half of the leaders
of the academy's major research projects during the period of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) must be under the age of
50, and senior scientists above the age of 65 will not be
appointed as leaders of research projects," Lu said.
</P>

Now, only 19 percent of the leaders of the academy's major
research projects are under the age of 45.

COLOMBO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar briefed editors of local newspapers on the
process that had led to the agreement between the People's
Alliance (PA) and the United National Party (UNP) on ending the
ethnic conflict, according to a news release from the ministry
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The release said the foreign minister Friday night told the
editors that there was no plan at this point for talks with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"The government had consistently expressed willingness to open
a dialogue with the LTTE, subject to conditions including a
substantial laying down of arms and an agreement to arrive at a
settlement within a stipulated time frame," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar also said the government was not contemplating
mediation or facilitation by any foreign government or third party
at this point.
</P>
<P>
He observed that he saw this agreement "as significant" and had
 described it "as a step on along road."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the editors "to view this important step taken
constructively and to give this new approach a chance to work in
the national interest."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Scientist Outlines Blueprint for Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), the country's top scientific body, has decided to tackle
large-scale research projects related to the economy and the
market in the remaining years of this century.
</P>
<P>
This is one of four major tasks the staff of the academy must
complete by the turn of the century, CAS President Zhou Guangzhao
said at the organization's annual meeting which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the to-do list is creating a pool of CAS elites to
focus on the frontier sciences; training a new and competent
generation of scientists; and building CAS into an
internationally-advanced scientific research base that educates
high-level professionals and promotes the growth of China's
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China's unique conditions, notably its
population, resources, and environment, mean that China has to
practice resource-conservation in regard to production and
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
"China must rely on quality rather than quantity in order to
seek further development," Zhou said. "China has to substitute
scarce resources with creativity and knowledge, and serve the
market with more science-intensive products."
</P>
<P>
"Scientific researchers, therefore, will have higher
requirements as well as more opportunities," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects Chinese scientists to climb to the pinnacle
of the sciences and develop high-tech products that can lead the
world market.
</P>
<P>
CAS will concentrate on making groundbreaking studies on
electronics and informatics, biotechnology, new materials and
applications, advanced manufacturing techniques, new energy and
environment technology, space technology, and oceanic technology,
Zhou said, as these fields are closely related to strategic needs
of the national economy and people's way of life.
</P>
<P>
Study results will be applied according to market demands, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that it is imperative for CAS to train qualified
people, as many of its senior researchers will retire in a few
years. He hoped that those who retire but are still in good health
will continue to help young people involved in the
sciences.

<HEADLINE> Graf Donates 1.3 Million Marks to Charity: Report </HEADLINE>

<P>
BONN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf has donated 1.3 million
marks (777,000 U.S. dollars) to charity last month, Der Spiegel
magazine reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The donation was part of a deal with German authorities in
order that they would drop the investigation of the tax evasion
charges against her, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted Graf saying that although it hurt to agree
to the deal, it was worth it to avoid further litigation and put
the "medai circus" behind her to focus on tennis.
</P>
<P>
Graf, 27, recently lost her ranking as world number one women's
tennis player to 16-year-old Martina Hingis of Switzerland after
94 weeks on top.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who had probed Graf's finances for nearly two
years, dropped their investigation last month after she agreed to
pay a sum to charity. The amount was not made public at the time.
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf denied she had done anything illegal in handling
her finances.

with the Zairean government, the rebels of Laurent-Desire Kabila
Friday took Mbuji Mayi, the capital of the diamond-producing

the objective of the rebels after their capture of Kisangani, fell
hours after Zairean government troops looted the town and fled
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirty months after the American intervention which drove
General Cedras out and restored President Aristide, Haiti is
suffering from a slump and is threatened by a rampant anarchy. The

which is predicted at 10 percent at the most.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton has chosen New York banker Felix
Rohatyn as the new U.S. Ambassador to France, reported the Wall

Presidential Adviser on Peace Sheka Mansaray described
Sankoh's charges as ''Ludicrous and Baseless'', saying, ''the
Sierra Leone government would never undertake such venture.
</P>
<P>
Mansaray said the RUF members in the Commission for the
Consolidation of Peace (CCP) were only interested in advancing
peace after ''so much lives had been lost and massive destruction
done to their motherland''.
</P>
<P>
''There was no question of our urging them to overthrow Sankoh
or promises of ministerial posts and directors of parastatals,''
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some senior RUF members toppled Sankoh in a coup and Sankoh
was arrested in Lagos, Nigeria for having brought with him arms
into the country.
</P>
<P>
Some field commanders of the RUF backed Sankoh and lured seven
senior RUF members into a trap in Nongowa in eastern Sierra Leone
last week and the two RUF representatives in the CCP, Fayia Musa
and Ibrahim Deen-Jalloh were seized among them.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh in his broadcast made no reference to the fate of
Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Guinea, Mohamed Diaby but diplomatic
sources here believe the envoy will be used as a ''bargaining
chip'' for the release of Sankoh from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats say the capture of Diaby, who was until
his diplomatic appointment six years ago was the Commander of the
Sierra Leone Navy, has earned the RUF ''a strong bargaining
power''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Kabbah, speaking at a rally in Freetown
on Thursday, said, he ''is prepared to beg Nigeria to free Sankoh
in the interest of peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Exhibition on Port Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition entitled "the
Fragrant Harbor: An Overview of Its Maritime Trade and Port
Development" opened in Kowloon Park here today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features the development of the maritime trade
and port of Hong Kong from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the
present.
</P>
<P>
Through some 100 photos on display, visitors will be able
to see an interesting collection of historical evidence that
reveals the territory's early growth as a seaport.
</P>
<P>
Among them are an early sea chart, excavated fragments of an
ancient wooden ship and ceramics finds dating several centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
There are also photos of early days tea label and shipping
schedules, as well as scenes of docks and local trading districts
of a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Urban Council said that Tuen Mun was already
a port of Guangzhou as early as from the Tang Dynasty. By the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), Hong Kong had probably become a stop on the "Maritime
Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
He said that it is evidenced by the artifacts unearthed from
Peony's Bay as recorded in the photos.
</P>
<P>
Some blue-and-white porcelains believed to be produced in
Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Martarban produced in
Southeast Asia were found.
</P>
<P>
There is also a section on the transformation in the modes of
sea transport that had since appeared in the territory's waters,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will see Hong Kong's progress of becoming an entrepot
and its eventual emergence as a thriving financial and commercial
center in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Government Achieves Budget Balance in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government achieved a
balanced budget in 1996, resulting in 24 million patacas (about
3.04 million US dollars) of budget surplus, the Macao government
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The total income of the government reached 8.836 billion
patacas (about 1.118 billion US dollars), down one percent from
1995, mainly due to a decrease of income from casinos.
</P>
<P>
The overall expenditure topped 8.812 billion patacas (about
1.115 billion US dollars). Of the total expenditure, the
government organs spent 6.5 billion patacas (about 822.8 million
US dollars), up 6.6 percent from 1995, a result of salary increase
for government employees, according to a press release from the
office of the Social Affairs and Budgetary Secretary.
</P>
<P>
The cost of public investment and development in 1996 hit 1.3
billion patacas (about 164,6 million US dollars), an increase of
7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the government no longer owes direct
debts as it paid off two loans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government said it will pay back all indirect debts the
government owes, namely the government's guarantee of loans for
the Macao International Airport, which reached 489 million patacas
(about 61.9 million US dollars), before December 19, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raises Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian oil authorities announced
that prices of all oil products, including super petrol and fuel
oil, rose by 25 percent throughout the country as from today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the price
increase was announced in a statement by the Public Relations
Department of the Iranian Oil Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran raised the fuel prices by 50 percent last year and 100
percent the previous year. The move triggered some protests and
demonstrations from the local people, who complain about the
runaway inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oil Ministry, the price of leaded and
non-leaded super petrol has been increased by 30 rials (0.001
U.S. dollars) per liter, bringing their price to 160 rials
(0.053 dollars) per liter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, price of super petrol rose to 220 rials (0.07
dollars), up by 40 rials (0.013 dollars) a liter, and gas oil
to 40 rials (0.013 dollars), up by 20 rials (0.006 dollar).
</P>
<P>
Under the Second Five-Year Development Plan (1995-1999),
prices of oil products will be increased slightly every year,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The price increases were planned at the beginning of the new
Iranian calendar year starting from March 21, but were
postponed to after the new year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the oil-rich Iran are still among the lowest in
the world. It costs about four U.S. dollars to fill a car with
super petrol.
</P>
<P>
But economic observers here have noted that the price hike
will boost the inflation rate. Official figures put the inflation
rate at 26 percent, but observers say that the inflation is about
60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Plans to Provide Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will to provide
50-million-dollar aid to Albania as it was racked by weeks of
violence, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a high-ranking government official, who
declined to be named, as saying that Turkey is "about to
complete studies on a 50-million-dollar donation to Albania, an
effort to help the country overcome its difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen traveled to
Albania last week to assess the situation in Albania where
violence erupted after the collapse of pyramid schemes in which
many citizens lost their life's savings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkey was prepared to contribute troops to any
international effort for aid distribution in Albania and a
contingent of 500 Turkish troops are expected to be sent for
this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is concerned about the developments in Albania, which
it sees as a country with an important place in the Balkans and
whose stability is linked with that of the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey fears that if the Albanian situation gets out of hand
it could spill over into Macedonia, where nearly half the
population is of Albanian origin.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed a military cooperation agreement with Albania
in 1995 and the two countries have held several joint military
exercises under NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Succeeds in Duplicating Human Ear on Animal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor has succeeded in
duplicating the human ear by conducting cell-reproduction
experiments on animals.
</P>
<P>
The research of plastic surgeon Cao Yilin, who works at the
Shanghai No. 9 People's Hospital, is said to offer bright
prospects for those whose organs have been damaged or lost.
</P>
<P>
Cao began his research 1993, based on his clinical experiences
in plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
To copy an organ, Cao takes cells from the organ to be
reproduced and cultivates them on a trestle-like apparatus made of
special material. He then transplants the cartilage derived from
the cells on a white mouse. A human ear appears on the animal in
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The technology is expected to be used on human bodies by the
end of the century, as the histological engineering develops," Cao
said. Based on the same principle, trachea, liver, joint, tendon,
skin and bones for human beings can all be reproduced by
collecting some active tissues of the ailing organs."
</P>
<P>
Dai Kerong, a renowned orthopedic surgeon in China, said that
histological engineering is different from cloning DNA, in that
the former reproduces cell tissues and can be widely used in
clinical practices.

<HEADLINE> Value of Kuwait Government Holdings Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The value of Kuwaiti
government holdings has more than doubled since 1994 when the
government started selling shares in its companies in the
process of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Ali Rashaid, Director of Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the
country's only managing body of government assets, told local
English daily Arab Times in an exclusive interview published
today that "at the start of the privatization program, KIA's
local holdings were worth around 850 million Kuwait Dinars (2.8
billion U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
He said that even after the sale of 20 companies, the
value of the remaining holdings is now around one billion dinars
(3.3 billion U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
Selling of shares in the 20 companies had generated 750
million dinars (2.475 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rashaid said that the Kuwait stock exchange market
grew by 58 percent since the beginning of 1996, reflecting more
confidence and better results for the listed companies.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Kuwaiti government's policy is to privatize
its holdings in local firms, including listed and unlisted
companies.
</P>
<P>
This policy is aimed at attracting more private capital to
the local stock exchange while increasing the role of the
private sector, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Research on Bacterial Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
discovered a molecule that enables bacteria to resist an
unusually wide range of drugs, according to a report of the
Weizman Institute of Science published here today.
</P>
<P>
The find, reported in the April issue of the Journal of
Bacteriology, suggests it may become more and more difficult to
design effective new medications for bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side, the newly-identified molecule, named
MdfA, may serve as a model for the further study and
understanding of multidrug resistance, aiding efforts to overcome
this phenomenon in bacterial diseases.
</P>
<P>
This research may also help clarify multidrug resistance in
human cancers, which results in tumor cells expelling anti-cancer
drugs, thus presenting serious obstacles to chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
"The more sophisticated the drugs we develop, the more
bacteria may emerge equipped with sophisticated ways to fight
these drugs," says Dr. Eitan Bibi of the institute's
Biochemistry Department, who conducted the study with doctoral
student Rotem Edgar.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Bibi predicts, "This is an obvious challenge
for antibacterial therapies that must be planned in anticipation
of growing resistance mechanisms."

<HEADLINE> Urumqi Zoo Has Another Snow Leopard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The snow leopard population at the
Urumqi Zoo, in the capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, has risen from four to five at a cost of over
20 sheep of a herdsman.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Eziz, a herdsman of the Taxkorgan Tajik
Autonomous County on the Pamirs, came upon three snow leopards
munching on three sheep from his fold. Two of the leopards fled
when they saw him, while the third, a cub, was trapped in the
sheep pen.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the snow leopard is a state-protected rare
wildlife, Eziz sent his son rushing to the township seat on the
horseback to file a report. The ride took six days. By the time
officials arrived at Eziz's home, 20 sheep had been killed by the
snow leopard.
</P>
<P>
As the traffic between Eziz's home and the county was blocked
by ice and snow, and two snow-covered steeps 6,000 m above the sea
level need to be climbed over, his son spent more than half a
month sending the cat to the county's wildlife protection
department, with the help of local herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the Ministry of Forestry, the Urumqi Zoo
shipped the leopard back from Taxkorgan County, some 1,900 km
southwest of Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
According to Fan Jiang, deputy director of the Urumqi Zoo
Administrative Office, the male snow leopard weighs some 30
kg. Its neck and claws were wounded and it was under the
meticulous care of medical workers.

TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
1,750 tonnes of Iranian humanitarian assistance arrived in
Afghanistan Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the third consignment of the Iranian aid to the
war-torn country in the past two months, the state-run Tehran
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the food consignment will be distributed
among people in the northern and central parts of Afghanistan
subsequent to delivery to the representatives of various factions
there.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention how the assistance
reached the northern and central regions in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It said that the previous two consignments included 1,900
tonnes of flour along with other food essentials which were also
distributed among people in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Iran declared earlier that it will continue to provide
"humanitarian aid" to Afghanistan since it still recognizes
ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legitimate
representative of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Invests 240 Million Dollars for Ambitious Science Projects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China disclosed a number of
ambitious scientific projects here today, which include building
the world's most advanced telescope that will allow scientists to
carry out surveys of at least 100 million galaxies.
</P>
<P>
"The schemes form part of a massive two billion yuan (241
million US dollars) state investment plan for four ambitious
science projects in the remaining years of this century," said
Professor Lu Yongxiang, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences(CAS).
</P>
<P>
The package includes the construction of an advanced sky
survey telescope, a national synchronous radiation laboratory, a
earth crust movement monitoring network and an advanced light
source that is at lease 100 million times brighter than X-ray
light.
</P>
<P>
China will build a sky survey telescope, which is the most
advanced in the world, at Xinglong hill in Yanshan Mountains of
north China.
</P>
<P>
"The large area, multi-object spectrum telescope, with a

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reforms Help Manila Attract More Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in the
Philippines reached 18.7 billion U.S. dollars last year, an
increase of 22.2 percent over the previous year, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that foreign investments in the country will
soar to 20 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists have attributed the significant increase in
the foreign investments to a succession of economic reforms and
vigorous measures the government had undertaken to attract foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, foreign investments in the Philippines were
less dynamic than in other Asian economies because of chronic
political instability and structural economic problems such as
strong protection of domestic industries through regulation,
fragile financial system, stagnant exports and huge trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
After taking office in 1992, President Fidel Ramos first
stabilized the political situation and strengthened his power base
by reconciling with coupists, holding peace talks with rebel
groups and forging an alliance with the largest opposition party
in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Then, the government passed the Foreign Investment Act of 1991,
which in principle removed all restrictions on foreign capital
participation.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the liberalization of foreign exchange
transactions in 1992 and the extension of the land leasing period
from 50 to 75 years for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the deregulation of the telecommunications and the
power industries brought a large amount of foreign investments
into the country.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the financial system was reformed through a
series of measures including the reorganization of the Central
Bank which was heavily in debt, the merger of two stock exchanges
into the Philippine Stock Exchange and the decision to allow 10
foreign banks to enter the local market for the first time in half
a century.
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign investments, the government also put
the creation of economic zones as its top priority, introducing a
number of favorable incentives for foreign enterprises entering
these zones.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, there are
now 54 economic zones across the country with some 550 foreign
companies located inside.
</P>
<P>
Last year, foreign firms invested at least 2.4 billion dollars
into these zones. And for the first two months this year, the
figure has reached 1.06 billion dollars, up by 530 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The effective efforts of the government have resulted in the
inflow of huge foreign investments and the fast growth of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The economy, which jumped from zero growth in 1991 to 6.8
percent increase in 1996, will also grow by 7-8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
For the remarkable growth of economy, the country has been
cited as a "Tiger Economy" by some international companies.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the country has broad prospects for attracting
more foreign capital. Its labor remains cheaper and well-educated;
It is liberalizing more industries; The southern Philippines is
opening up more investment opportunities after the government and
the largest rebel group ended a 24-year-old war there last year.
</P>
<P>
However, some problems will also hinder the growth of the
country's foreign investments. These stumbling blocks include the
serious waves of kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, 241 people were taken hostage last
year in the country. For the first three months this year, 54
kidnapping cases have occurred with kidnappers demanding at least
20 million dollars as ransom.
</P>
<P>
To ensure personal security, many foreign investors have to
hire security guards to protect themselves or their properties.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's major investment partners in Asia and
Europe have also expressed their concern over the Philippines'
investment policies after the Supreme Court revoked the winning
bid of a Malaysian conglomerate for a controlling stake in the
historic Manila Hotel and rewarded it to a Filipino firm in
February.

"The proposed new machine will operate at energy levels from
2.2 to 2.5 GeV, to provide a brighter source of synchrotron light
for researchers in fields ranging from advanced materials, life
sciences, nuclear physics, medical science to electronics,
medicine, petroleum and the chemical industries," researchers from
CAS said.
</P>
<P>
"The country hopes that the appliance of frontier science will
give itself a firm foothold in the forefront of international
scientific and technological science in the coming century," Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
China will invest 120 million yuan to build an earth crust
movement monitoring network, by adopting a global satellite
positioning system, and satellite laser distance measurement
know-how.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that China will possibly make some major
progress in earthquake forecast," a researcher from CAS said.
</P>
<P>
China will also develop a micro-precise monitoring system,
using satellites, that will pave the way for scientific and
technological advances in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
"In order to carry out the plan smoothly and more effectively,"
scientists said, "China will draw on experience collected from its
building of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the 1960s and 1970s, and
arouse the most elite scientists. It will also strengthen
international cooperation, and win strong support from scientific
and industrial circles."
</P>
<P>
CAS will get most of the financial support from the central
government budget. And local governments of Shanghai municipality
and Guangdong province have offered their financial support to the
building of Shanghai synchrontron light source and a state-of-art
research vessel.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, scientific researchers in Hong Kong also expressed
their interest in joining the construction of synchrontron
device.

HUHHOT, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have succeeded
in transplanting fish genes into beets.
</P>
<P>
The transgenic beet seedlings can survive temperatures of six
to 6.5 degrees below zero, 2.5 times that of non-transgenic
beet. The sowing period of the beet can come ten to 15 days
earlier and its harvesting period can be extended by ten to 15
days.
</P>
<P>
The research is jointly conducted by the Beet Sugar Industry
Institute of Inner Mongolia and the Biology Department of the
University of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The gene came from the anti-frost protein gene of an Arctic
fish imported from Germany in 1992. Li Tianran, a professor of the
Biology Department, and Zhang Jianfeng, a graduate student under

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market this week, trading was range-bound
and there was relatively less commitment from players who were
taking a wait- and-see approach while closely monitoring the
production data for March.
</P>
<P>
Against the previous close, April-South was offered unchanged
at 1,290 ringgit (about 516 U.S. dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said strong leads expected on the futures market and
the possible emergence of fresh market-moving news should provide
a positive impact for the palm oil cash market to find better
ground next week.
</P>
<P>
However, with the uncertainties on the market's immediate
trend, any further consolidation would be based on technical
factors, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was in range bound trading
this week with its price settling the week unchanged at 14.29
ringgit (about 5.716 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover dropped to 370 tons from 404 tons last
week with European, Japanese and local buyers being the main
volume contributors on the market.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to be volatile next week with its price
likely to hover between 14.20 ringgit (about 5.68 dollars) and
14.35 ringgit (about 5.74 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is also anticipated to experience mild profit taking
at the start of next week, following the metal's continued easier
undertone on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
Tin, which is traded in US dollars on the LME, found good
support locally as the metal is considered to be cheaper here in
line with the expected weaker ringgit next week, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Malaysian rubber market closed the week
lower with sluggish trading as overseas buyers retreated to the
sidelines waiting for prices to ease further.
</P>
<P>
The May RSS 1 closed the week four sen lower to 294.50 sen
(about 117.8 U.S. cents) per kg, while the SMR 20 dropped seven
sen to 278.50 sen (about 111.4 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for April 3 stood at 225.36
Malaysian/Singapore cents (sen) from 228.38 cents (sen) on March
26.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average was at 226.94 cents per kg from
229.06 cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
The rubber market is expected to be mixed next week in
continued dull trading as most buyers, discouraged by the existing
"unaffordable" NR prices, are waiting for prices to ease to a more
attractive level, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Manila-MILF Peace Talks Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have rescheduled their talks
slated for next week in order to conduct investigations into last
month's fighting in Buldon, Mindanao, a government negotiator said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview in Cotabato city, Mindanao, Fortunato
Abat, chief government negotiator said that the two sides agreed
Friday to reschedule talks to "give way for the government-MILF
created Interim Ceasefire Monitoring Committee (ICMC) to conduct
investigations on the Buldon issue."
</P>
<P>
On March 16, government troops and MILF rebels exchanged mortar
fires in Buldon, killing 11 civilians and displacing hundreds of
families in the region. The government and the MILF accused each
other of violating an interim ceasefire in the area.
</P>
<P>
Abat said that during his talks with a rebel leader Friday, the
MILF threatened to postpone future peace negotiations with the
government unless the Buldon issue will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"The ICMC will start their probe on April 7 and will give an
official report on April 9. It (will be) too close for the talks
slated for April 9-10," Abat said.
</P>
<P>
Abat said that the third government-MILF technical committee
meeting was tentatively rescheduled on April 22-25 to "give an
allowance for the MILF's request."
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF has become the country's major rebel
group after the government and the Moro National Liberation Front
signed a pact on peace in Mindanao last September. The MILF
rejected the peace pact and is continuing its fighting for an
independent state in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Seeks Legal Opinion on Dissolution of House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- As India's Congress party
hardened its stance to press for his resignation, Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda on Friday sought legal opinion to recommending
dissolution of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) and
holding of fresh elections, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Official sources, while confirming that a request to the effect
had gone from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to the Law
Ministry, declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
As informal parleys between leaders of the ruling United Front
and the Congress party reportedly suffered a setback on Friday,
Deve Gowda's move gave rise to speculation that he might opt for
recommending dissolution instead of facing the Lok Sabha on April
11 for a confidence motion as requested by the president.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines Asked to Shed Foreign Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government on Friday
directed Jet Airways, an Indian domestic air carrier, to shed its
40 percent foreign equity stake within six months, The Financial
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government gave the direction following the announcement of
new investment norms for entry of foreign airlines into the
domestic aviation sector earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Under the new investment norms, foreign airlines are barred
from holding equity stake in India's domestic aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic air carriers in which foreign airlines hold equity
directly or indirectly have been given six months time to
disinvest," Indian Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim told a
press conference here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
While 60 percent of equity holding in Jet Airways is held by a
non-resident Indian, the remaining 40 percent stake is held
equally by Gulf and Kuwait Airways.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Players Sidelined in Bribery Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's soccer authorities
have told clubs to sideline four players named in a match-fixing
case, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted S-League chief Douglas Moore as saying it would not
be fair to the players to let them on the field while the case was
under way.
</P>
<P>
"If a particular player makes a genuine mistake, fans may
compound the problem by ridiculing every move which they perceive
as wrong made by the player," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two men, a businessman and a former employee, have been charged
with corruption, criminal conspiracy and bribery over accusations
that they tried to fix matches in the S-League's inaugural season
last year.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Rajendran R. Kurusamy, 37, and former employee
Ramadas Eurulandi Sangalee, 40, appeared in court on Friday and
were freed on bail, the newspaper said. Corruption charges carry
penalties of up to five years in jail and a fine of 100,000
Singapore dollars ($70,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said another man faced three bribery charges
but police had not yet found him.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the charges included giving money to a
referee to fix matches.
</P>
<P>
The charges also included handing over money which allegedly
eventually reached the four players.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's anti-corruption police, who are handling the case,
were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
The S-League was set up last year after Singapore pulled out of
the Malaysian League following a series of bribery scandals.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Malaysian players were banned for lengthy periods
after those scandals. One-time Singapore star Abbas Saad, a
Lebanese-born Australian, was banned for life. A Singapore manager
and a player both went to jail.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian football authorities complained then that
Singapore was not doing enough to clamp down on match-fixing
because it had accused only a few people of doing it. Singapore
rejected the charge.
</P>
<P>
In Europe last week, Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger was
suspended for life for attempted bribery. He has appealed against
the ban.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) market fell sharply this week with
over-reaction by players to the National Bank's announcement on
the lending curbs to reduce property.
</P>
<P>
Although most analysts feel the market's sharp fall this week
is not attributable to the central bank ruling, which was
announced last Friday, confidence seems to have drained out of the
market ever since.
</P>
<P>
"The market should by now fully digest to the new ruling. We
feel that the market actually is now in its consolidation phase...
the central bank's action should not warrant the current bearish
sentiment. It is just a matter of timing," they said.
</P>
<P>
They also viewed that there was unlikely to be any rebound at
this point of time as most retail investors were selling
aggressively in order to cut further losses.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE Composite Index closed at 1,136.78 points, the lowest
so far this year, down 80.86 points from the previous close of
1,217.64.
</P>
<P>
The Emas Index declined 28.06 points to 329.29 from 357.35, the
Industrial Index plunged 122.66 points to 2,143.10 from 2,265.76
and the Second Board Index fell to 607.82 from 673.46.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the week was 1.845 billion shares worth
12.583 billion ringgit (about 5.0332 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mainboard turnover totaled 1.580 billion shares worth 9.517
billion ringgit (about 3.8068 billion dollars), up slightly from
an estimated 1.435 billion shares worth 8.591 billion ringgit
(about 3.4364 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Second board turnover totaled 265.061 million shares worth
3.066 billion ringgit (about 1.2264 billion dollars) compared with
330.499 million shares worth 3.980 billion ringgit (about 1.592
billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals declined to 239.436 million shares worth 1.683
billion ringgit (about 673.2 million dollars) from 331.265 million
shares worth 2.135 billion ringgit (about 854 million dollars)
last week.
</P>
<P>
Aokam Perdana was the week's most active counter with 120.227
million shares or 6.51 percent of the total shares traded. It
closed at 3.74 ringgit, down 2.11 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Among other active counters this week were Tekala Corporation
down 1.45 ringgit to 6.95 ringgit on a turnover of 57.240 million
shares, Sime Darby 55 sen lower to 8.50 ringgit with 44.042
million shares traded, Suria Capital lowered by 51 sen to 2.83
ringgit with 28.477 million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
On a sectoral basis, consumer products accounted for 124.530
million shares traded, industrial products 388.434 million shares,
construction 111.233 million shares, trading/services 208.113
million shares, and infrastructure 2.565 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Investors are expected to adopt a cautious stance on the KLSE
next week as potential for the market to further decline is
evident before any rebound takes place, the analysts said.

CANBERRA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked pair Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde gave Australia a 3-0 quarter final
Davis Cup win against the Czech Republic in Adelaide, on Saturday.

start.
</P>

CHANGCHUN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin province
has enhanced its afforestation efforts in order to improve its
ecology and contribute to economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jilin province has one of China's richest forest resources, and
afforestation has long been a high priority for the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Starting last year, the departments in Jilin gradually enhanced
their work in urban and rural land greening, built tree-planting
bases for volunteers, economic forestry planting, and construction
of green shelterbelt systems.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 42 large tree-planting bases for
volunteers were established in the province last year, with 64
million trees planted.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we have also built five green economic development
belts by planting 23,000 hectare of economic forests, which helped
the farmers to become well to do," said an official from the
forestry department of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the forest coverage in Jilin
province is expected to reach 44 percent in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) --- Bangladesh has seen a boom of
foreign investments in its first operational export processing
zone based in the southeastern port city of Chittagong following a
lull in political unrest.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, in the first six months of the
current fiscal year beginning from last July, the Chittagong
Export Procession Zone (CEPZ) drew a foreign investment of 11
million U.S. dollars, an increase of 32 percent compared with that
of the corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Presently investment surged to 177 million U.S. dollars in the
CEPZ which was commissioned in the year 1983 with an investment
below one million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials said investments in the CEPZ may go up by another 30
million dollars in the next six months with the commissioning of
13 more industries.
</P>
<P>
The CEPZ, set up over 450 acres of land near Bangladesh's
largest seaport, has so far housed 71 operational industries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea topped the list with 17 industries while Japan
secured the second position with 12 industries, official reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs of 13 industries now under implementation
stage at CEPZ are from Spain, the United States, the United
Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CEPZ exported finished goods worth 159 million
dollars from July to December of the current fiscal years as
against 124 million dollars during the same period in the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The exported goods include electronics, sports shoes, readymade
garments, golf equipment, cap and camera lens.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hold Talks with India on Ganges Water Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- A two-member Indian delegation is
due here today to hold talks with the Bangladeshi side on the
Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, which has remained practically
inoperative since March this year, according to officials from the
Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side earlier had decided to hold the Joint River
Commission (JRC) meeting but the meeting was abandoned due to the
internal political situation in India. Instead the India now
decided to hold the official level talks.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh officials said that as per the agreement, the Indian
side is supposed to regulate the withdrawal of water at the
upstream of Farakka Barrage, dozens of miles north of the
Bangladeshi border.
</P>
<P>
The Indian authorities, however, did not take any step in this
regard to ensure the availability of water at the Farakka point,
the officials complained, adding that the meeting would take stock
of the Indian initiatives of implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian side has reportedly informed Bangladesh
that the Ganges water flow slowed down as the ice in the Himalayas
where the Ganges originates was not melting enough to raise the
level.
</P>
<P>
Under the 30-year Ganges Water Treaty signed in December 1996,
if the water flow at the Farakka Barrage falls below 70,000 cusecs
(cubic feet per second), the two countries should split the water
evenly.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Access to Refugees in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today called on all parties in Zaire, particularly the
rebels led by Laurent Kabila, to allow aid agencies access to
thousands of stranded refugees, many of whome are dying of
malnutrition and disease.
</P>
<P>
Council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said that the
Security Council reiterated its deep concern over the alarming
situation of refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"They (refugees) need help and they need it now," he told
reporters after a meeting of the council.
</P>
<P>
The council urges the parties, particularly Kabila's rebel
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
(ADFL), to ensure safe access of humanitarian aid to, and the
safety of, all refugees, displaced persons and other affected
civilian inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged the ADFL to cooperate fully with the
United Nations in the implementation of the repatriation plan of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It also
called on the government of Rwanda to help the implementation of
this plan.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been plagued by civil war over the past six
months. The fighting between the government and the ADFL has
driven countless Rwandan refugees and local people into the
country's interior.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, mostly women and children, have already
died or are dying of exhaustion, hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian aid agencies have tried to assist more than
100,000 refugees who have re-emerged from the forest over the past
week. There are 200,000 more displaced persons who are still
beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR, while trying to stabilize the refugees around Kisangani
and Ubandu in eastern Zaire, plans to repatriate Rwandan refugees
who fled their country after the conflict between Hutu and Tutsi
broke out in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Issues Ordinance to Amend Local Body Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- King of Nepal Birendra has
issued an ordinance to amend some of the country's acts concerning
local administration bodies and their elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement by the Cabinet Secretariat on
Friday evening, the king made the issue after receiving a
submission from the government of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand seeking the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement did not specify what amendments will be
made to the existing acts on the local bodies and elections under
the king's ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The Chand government, which came to power last month, had
pledged to empower local administration bodies and local people
through ordinance as a bill on decentralization could not be
passed in the parliament session concluding recently.
</P>
<P>
The one-month Winter session of parliament, which witnessed the
fall of the former government under Sher Bahadur Deuba due to its
losing of confidence vote and the formation of Chand's government,
failed to discuss any important bill as the new government claimed
it had no adequate time to present the bills.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers had demanded the government to hold the
upcoming local elections only after the decentralization bill,
expected to give more autonomous rights to local bodies, is
approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The local elections, already scheduled to be held by the end of
June, will elect chief officers and representatives for local
administration bodies on village, municipality and district levels
throughout the country.

run last year, could be arrested till today, according to the
police sources.

till Sunday from the high court division of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Others are expected to make a move to obtain bail together on
Sunday to avoid being arrested, sources in the stock market said.

accused since a magistrate issued warrants of arrest against them
following the SEC complaints filed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

the police sources.
</P>
<P>
The accused are some leading businessmen in Bangladesh,

<HEADLINE> APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting Opens in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, The Philippines, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers' meeting
opened here today to seek ways to stimulate the private sector's
participation in infrastructure development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Philippine President Fidel Ramos said it
is a formidable task for the 18 APEC member economies to meet huge
financial requirements of infrastructure development which is key
to sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the financial needs of infrastructure development
would reach some 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars over the next decade
which is hard for the governments to meet.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the fourth APEC leaders meeting in Subic,
the northern Philippines, last November called on the finance
ministers to pursue effective measures to establish efficient
financial and capital markets and encourage the private sector to
participate in infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the finance ministers will try to
reach agreement on the facilitation of the private sector's
participation in infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss measures to accelerate the development
of domestic financial and capital markets and maintain stable and
free flows of capital in the region.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the finance ministers' meeting are the
presidents of the International Monetary Fund and the Asia
Development Bank, and representatives from the APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) and the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the ABAC and the PECC to be invited
to a dialogue with the finance ministers. The PECC is currently
the only private-sector-associated organization enjoying observer
status at APEC ministerial and senior officials meetings.
</P>
<P>
Parallel to the finance ministers' meeting, the APEC Financiers
Group, an advisory group composed of leading financiers from the
APEC member economies, is also meeting in Cebu, capital of Cebu
province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among the Asia-Pacific economies. It groups
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Austrian GDP Forecasts for 1997 Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- One of Austria's top economic
bodies raised its growth estimate for Austria's gross domestic
product (GDP) this year from 1.0 percent to 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Kramer, president of the Austrian Institute for Economic
Research (AIER), and Bernhard Feladerer, president of the Senior
AIER published their forecasts at a joint press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Having forecast last December a 1.0 percent increase in the GDP
in 1997, Kramer raised his forecast to 1.2 percent today.
</P>
<P>
Showing more optimism than Kramer, Feladerer repeated
his forecast of 1.5 percent growth made last December.
</P>
<P>
Kramer and Feladerer believed that the policies adopted by the
government in controlling the budget would not lead to a negative
impact on economic development.
</P>
<P>
On international trade, they forecast that exports would rise
faster than imports. Both expected a 6.6 percent increase in
exports in 1997 and 7.8 percent in 1998. Imports are expected to
grow 3.6 percent in 1997 and 5.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But they disagreed on unemployment and inflation control.
</P>
<P>
Kramer predicted that the unemployment rate in 1997 be the same
as last year' 7 percent, while Feladerer forecast unemployment
at 7.4 percent in 1997 and 7.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On inflation, Kramer believed the rate would drop from 1.9
percent this year to 1.6 percent in 1988, while Feladerer forecast
a higher rate of 2 or 2.1 percent in the same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma today called
for the gradual reunification of Russia and Belarus, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The lower house adopted a statement outlining the goals and
principles of the creation of the Russian-Belarussian federation
as a unified sovereign democratic republican state.
</P>
<P>
"The deepening economic, social and political crisis in all
spheres of public and state life in both countries" has prompted
the need for the reunification of Russia and Belarus, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also passed a resolution condemning coverage of the
creation of the Russian-Belarusian union by Russia's mass media,
primarily television and radio.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers urged the president and government to take immediate
measures against media criticism of the union treaty, even going
so far as cutting off financing for television and radio companies
and periodicals.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma also called on the heads of television and radio
companies and other mass media bodies to work for the unification
of the two peoples and states.
</P>
<P>
The treaty forming a union between Russia and Belarus was
signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Belarussian
counterpart Alexander Lukashenko last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament Yegor
Stroyev and Belarussian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said
Thursday that the ultimate aim of the treaty was the unification
of the two countries.

<P>
ROME, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia is considering making a
modest contribution to the Italian-led multinational protection
force set up to secure relief aid operations in Albania, the
Italian Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Slovenian government would first consult
the country's other political parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Slovenia was well aware of the significance of even
making a symbolic contribution, which would be in line with the
country's ambitions to move closer to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the European Union, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian-led multinational protection force is expected to
consist of up to 6,000 men from at least eight nations and begin
deployment in the week starting April 14.
</P>
<P>
Troops will be posted at Tirana airport and the Adriatic ports
of Durres, Vlore and possibly Sarande.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Sees Russia as Most Important Partner: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev was speaking
at a press conference for the fifth anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Azerbaijan-Russia relations are established on the
principles of equality, respect of territorial integrity and
inviolability of borders.
</P>
<P>
He said he was gratified that more than 20 intergovernmental
agreements had been signed since the establishment of diplomatic
relations in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
But he said Azerbaijan condemned the illegal delivery of
Russian arms to Armenia and hoped the investigation being
conducted by top Russian officials would yield concrete results.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's eastward expansion plan, Rizayev said that since his
country is basically against the formation of "military blocs or
alliances," it is not happy about NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
At another press conference in the Azerbaijani capital Baku on
Friday, Russia's Ambassador to Azerbaijan Alexander Blokhin said
Russia was improving its ties with Azerbaijan and strengthening
cooperation in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged there were still differences between the
two countries, especially in their approaches to integration in
the Commonwealth of Independent States, but said these were not
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
As for the smuggling of Russian arms to Armenia, Blokhin
stressed that Russia's attitude proves it is not involved in the
matter. He said the actions of individuals should not put
obstacles in the way of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks' Bad Loans to Peak in 1998: Specialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's banking crisis is
likely to be more serious and prolonged than authorities expect,
according to an expert with the International Credit Rating Agency
Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans are likely to be much worse than forecast
by the Bank of Thailand, the Bangkok Post today quoted Peter
Sikora, a banking specialist with the Standard and Poor's
Melbourne office, as saying in a teleconference call.
</P>
<P>
Sikora predicted that non-performing loan levels would peak
next year at 12-15 percent of the total loans for commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
This could be even higher for finance and securities firms,
given their heavier involvement in speculative operations such as
securities margin and vehicle hire-purchase loans.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand last reported bank non-performing loans at
7.7 percent of the total, as of June 1996, with private analysts
believing the level went well into the double digits by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, however, Cem Karacadag, a director of the
Standard and Poor's New York office, said Thailand's financial
position is more than capable of weathering the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The fundamental credit strengths and weaknesses of
Thailand simply have not changed. And that is the basis for our
stable outlook on both the long-term 'a' foreign currency and the
long-term 'AA' local currency ratings for the kingdom."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Thai government's strong financial position,
spurred by nine years of fiscal surpluses, had given policy makers
ample space and flexibility in responding to shocks.

<HEADLINE> 163 Journalists Slain in L. America Over Last Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 163 journalists
were assassinated in Latin America over the last eight and a half
years, the Interamerican Press Association (SIP) said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Colombia was the most dangerous country for journalists, with
67 members of the press assassinated there, the SIP report said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Peru shared second place with 18 journalists
assasinated in each country, followed by El Salvador with 16,
Guatemala with 15 and Brazil with 13.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina fewer than
five journalists were killed in each country.
</P>
<P>
The death toll for most Latin American countries is much higher
than in North America and Haiti. Seven journalists were murdered
in the United States, five in Haiti and one in Canada.
</P>
<P>
There have been no assassinations of journalists in Panama for
several years, although cases of intimidation had been reported,
the SIP said.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Trotti, director of the SIP, told the First Latin
American Journalism Congress on Thursday that only one person has
been convicted so far for masterminding an assassination but
several of those who carried out the murders have been jailed.

<HEADLINE> Acid Rain Area Highlights Efforts to Combat Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Liuzhou City reduced
the discharge by 13,000 tons of sulphur dioxide and 2,300 tons of
smoke and dust last year, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The city, an industrial powerhouse of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, is one of the heavy acid rain areas in China,
and its 800,000 residents suffered a lot.
</P>
<P>
The Liuzhou City Government has resolved to combat the air
pollution since early last year. Forty measures have been taken,
and it was listed as the city's priority in 1996 to cut the
sulphur dioxide emissions by 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 60 major polluters have promised to improve within a
specified time limit," said an official with the city
environmental protection department, adding that another 24
small-sized factories or workshops have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
The city prohibited the sale and use of the raw coal with
sulphur content above one percent, and the boilers in the central
city have been forced to be equipped with desulphurization
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city spent some a total of 18.5
million yuan (2.23 million US dollars) in combating air pollution
last year, and 31 key pollution control projects were completed.

YINCHUAN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- New tourist maps of the Ningxia

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos Sign Transportation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos have signed a
transportation agreement, paving the way for the two countries to
be linked by a railway which will run over the border bridge
across the Mekong river, according to a report from Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed on Friday in Vientiane, capital of
Laos, by Thai Minister of Transportation Suwat Liptapallop and his
Lao counterpart Phao Bounnaphon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement defines the border at the bridge site, clearing
the last legal obstacles to the construction of a rail link over
the Friendship Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The midway of the bridge is not directly above the deepest
waterway in the river, causing legal, management and maintenance
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side will complete in September a section (about 20
kilometers) of the railway from Nong Khai to the middle of the
bridge, while the Lao side will build a 14-km track linking the
bridge with Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund will provide Laos
with a loan amounting to 50 percent of the construction cost on
the Lao side.

<HEADLINE> Massive Poverty Reduction Effort In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The successful completion of a
World-Bank poverty reduction project in the Tarim Basin of
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will mark the start
of a second-phase project, with a World Bank loan of 150 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new project is expected to benefit more than five million
people in the basin, helping some of them become better off while
protecting their environment.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase project, which has a total investment of 1.65
billion yuan, including 125 million US dollars in World Bank
loans, has improved irrigation conditions greatly in the area and
lifted 2.2 million local people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the project helped open up 80,000
hectares of uncultivated land, improve 120,000 hectares of
low-yield farmland, and build infrastructure for water
conservation and husbandry.
</P>
<P>
An official from a World Bank Inspection Group that visited the
area several days ago said, "China is the most successful country
in carrying out World Bank-funded project, and the World Bank is
especially confident in Xinjiang, since agricultural development
in the area holds even greater potential than coastal regions."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: APEC Seeks Freer Capital Flows, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, The Philippines, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of
the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meet here
today to seek innovative schemes for stable exchange rates and
freer capital flows in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the official agenda, the two-day meeting will be
dominated by discussions on the current macro-economic issues and
policies for supporting the freer flow of capital, the private
sector participation in infrastructure development and promotion
of financial and capital market development.
</P>
<P>
When APEC leaders met in Subic, the northern Philippines, last
November, they called on their finance ministers to pursue
concrete and practical measures to accelerate the development of
domestic financial and capital markets in the region, and
stimulate the private sector participation in infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the ministers will take off from the
directives of APEC leaders to translate visions into action and
encourage APEC members to take the lead in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
AS the lack of infrastructure was identified at the Subic
meeting as a major constraint to growth in the region, greater
private sector involvement in the infrastructure development is
top on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
APEC members acknowledges the compelling need to mobilize
private resources for infrastructure development in view of the
huge financing requirement, which was placed at 1,500 billion U.S.
dollars in East Asia alone in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the shares of private-sector sponsorship and financing
of infrastructure projects at present are still less than 10
percent of the total infrastructure investment.
</P>
<P>
"This share must be raised. This means increasing the supply of
bankable infrastructure projects. Private resources must also be
mobilized by deepening and broadening domestic capital market,"
said Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo Friday.
</P>
<P>
Toward this direction, he said, the APEC working group has
recommended the creation of innovative financing mechanisms that
facilitate cross-border debt and equity exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of the Subic meeting, APEC ministers may consider
endorsing voluntary support of freer capital flows, they said.
</P>
<P>
Amid the Thai baht crisis and a recent rise in U.S. interest
rates, the ministers' meeting, which is also attended by central
bankers, is expected to put the issue of exchange rate stability
into sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
The desire for stable exchange rates will be one of the points
highlighted in the ministers' joint statement to be issued
tomorrow, said Jeremias Paul, director of the international
finance at the Philippine Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The statement is likely to note that the currency imbalances
noted by Group 7 finance ministers in April 1995 have been
corrected and will probably reaffirm the importance of pursuing
macro-economic policies that will nurture stable capital flows and
currency rates.
</P>
<P>
Last year, APEC members delivered their individual action plans
to help reach the bloc's goal of eliminating all barriers to trade
and investment in the region by 2010 for developed members and
2020 for developing members.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Sells off More Government-Subsidized Flats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has sold 6.58 million sq m of its 50
million sq m of government-subsidized flats to individual workers.
</P>
<P>
Sale of government-subsidized flats is part of this northeast
industrial center's measures to reform its housing system and pool
more funds for construction of more apartments, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, government-subsidized flats were distributed for
free or at a very low rent among government and state-owned
enterprise workers as part of the welfare program.
</P>
<P>
To support housing reform, the city has also tried the
aggregate housing funds, and down-payments for eventual house
purchase from government and factory workers, instead of the
monthly collection of rent.
</P>
<P>
So far, 930,000 employed people have participated in the
aggregate housing fund and deposited 400 million yuan into the
fund, while 72,000 government department employees have paid 510
million yuan in advance for house purchases.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has started construction of 848,000
sq m of flats under the "comfortable living" project, 788,000 sq m
of which have been completed, and 13,000 households that had had
housing difficulties have moved into the newly-finished flats.
</P>
<P>
Comfortable living program is designed to provide housing to
urban families with moderate and low incomes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Refined Oil Exports Jump in January, February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's refined oil exports in
the first two months this year posted 6.51 million barrels,
soaring up 545 percent compared with the same period of last year,
according to officials statistics.
</P>
<P>
The largest increase was seen in gasoline exports, which
skyrocketed 1,014 percent to 2.04 million barrels in January and
February this year, according to data from the Petroleum Institute
of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of diesel oil in the period totaled 1.46
million barrels, an increase of 973.9 percent, which mostly were
exported to neighboring countries like Laos.
</P>
<P>
The Thai fuel oil exports rose 136 percent to 1.01 million
barrels in the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's exports of indigenous condensate were
914,500 barrels in the period, dropping 43.8 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the sharp rise in refined oil exports in
January and February generally came as a result of the slowdown in
refined oil consumption in the country and oversupplies of local
refined oil products.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's refined oil consumption in the first two months of
the year grew up only 2 percent over the same period last year to
an average of 732,540 barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
The slowdown mainly stemmed from a significant drop in the use
of fuel oil, which is being replaced by indigenous natural gas.

<HEADLINE> China, Czech Republic Agree to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Czech leaders today met and
exchanged views with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo on
strengthening bilateral relations and other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to take effective measures to push forward
economic and trade cooperation by increasing mutual understanding
and cultural, educational and scientific and technological
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Wu, who arrived here Friday, Prime Minister Josef
Lux spoke highly of China's foreign policy based on mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both the Czech Republic and China are willing to develop their
friendly cooperation ties and Wu's visit will further develop
Czech-Sino relations, Lux said.
</P>
<P>
Milos Zeman, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house),
said exchange visits by the two nations' leaders will increase
mutual understanding and deepen friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Czech Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Josef Zielenice
said his country values its friendship with China by sticking to
the One-China policy and will not establish official links with
ChineseTaiwan.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade ties, a major basis for Czech-Sino
relations, have developed smoothly over the last few years and
should continue to improve, Zielenice said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China attaches great importance to developing its
relations with the Czech Republic as the two nations share the
same or similar views on many important issues.
</P>
<P>
There are no fundamental conflicting issues and problems left
over by history between China and the Czech Republic, so
furthering friendly cooperation is in the interests of the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China, respecting the development path selected by the Czech
people themselves and the internal and external policies of the
Czech government, is ready to cooperate with Czech Republic in
dealing with international issues, the Chinese vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is the third leg of Wu's five-nation
European tour, which has taken him to Ukraine and Belarus and will
take him to Finland and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Rehabilitation Program Benefits Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China is making marked progress in
its endeavors to help its 60 million disabled people, according
to a new official report.
</P>
<P>
This is shown in the growing number of people with physical
disabilities who have been benefited from a national
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1988, the rehabilitation program has so far treated
2.32 million people who suffer from cataracts, polio or deafness
and changed their life for the better as a result, said a
spokesman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The figure could be much bigger, if people with mental
disorders who have received community-based services in 235 cities
and other services, were included, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The federation, set up in 1988 to promote the rights and
interests of handicapped people, said in a report that in 1996:
</P>
<P>
-- 257,170 cataract suffers regained their sight;
</P>
<P>
-- 51,365 polio victims or those suffering spinal or joint
problems were operated on successfully;
</P>
<P>
-- 13,420 deaf children participated in hearing and speech
programs;
</P>
<P>
-- More than 24 million newly married and pregnant women and
babies took liquid iodine as a way to prevent mental diseases.
</P>
<P>
These achievements went far beyond the government's original
plan for the year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most Chinese health departments and medical services
have included rehabilitation of people with disabilities in their
daily agenda.
</P>
<P>
Now the national rehabilitation program is switching its
priorities from medical care to later-stage rehabilitation
training and community rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
A total 873 offices have been established at the provincial,
city and county levels to provide guidance for local
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
The federations has drafted two sets of requirements for
systematic training of mentally retarded children and those with
limb defects.
</P>
<P>
Experts are compiling teaching materials to help standardize
rehabilitation training.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Set to go to Albania From April 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The multinational protection force
set up to protect aid supplies to strife-torn Albania will be
deployed in the week starting April 14, the Italian Foreign
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of representatives from the
eight countries which have either pledged to contribute forces or
are considering participation.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the force will coincide with the arrival of
humanitarian aid to the Balkan nation which has been in the grip
of violence and unrest for the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the protection force is to help implement
emergency relief operations. Italy is expected to send between
2,000 and 2,500 troops, France 1,000, Greece 700, Turkey 500,
Romania 400 and Spain 300. Austria and Denmark said they are still
considering participation.
</P>
<P>
The force is expected to secure key ports and transport routes
to protect the delivery of European humanitarian aid from armed
gunmen in the country.
</P>
<P>
Troops will be stationed in the southern ports of Vlore and
Durres and at Tirana airport so that food can be imported will
protect aid convoys inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based World Food Program (WFP) said today it would be
sending an initial consignment of 420 tonnes of flour, beans and
oil to the Albanian port of Durres on April 9, from where it will
be sent on by truck to the main towns and cities of Tirana,
Kurtes, Peshkopia, Elbasan and Shkoder.
</P>
<P>
WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini said,"The present food
situation in Albania has been made worse by the closing of
borders, which made imports impossible. Emergency assistance is
credible."
</P>
<P>
However, a military commentator from the London-based
Institute for Strategic Studies, Colonel Terence Taylor, cast
doubt on the wisdom of military intervention in the Balkan
country, saying that the Albanian solution was so confused that a
military mission did not appear credible.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to talk about protecting humanitarian aid supplies,
but what happens if someone attacks a Red Cross vehicle, or a
military patrol?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Albania descended into chaos in early March when protests
triggered by the collapse of shaky investment schemes mushroomed
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lost their life savings in the collapse and
blamed President Sali Berisha. The protests turned violent after
armed rebels looted army depots and took over several towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 refugees fled the country in March and the
Albanian government has called for international aid and military
intervention to help the new government of national reconciliation
restore order.

<HEADLINE> Steps Taken To Protect Yangtze River Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Effective measures are being taken
to prevent any further disruption of ship traffic on the Yangtze
River during construction of the Three Gorges Dam Project and
after it is completed, officials said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Navigation and project construction authorities gave the
assurances after a blockage at the adjacent Gezhouba Dam late last
month that delayed hundreds of vessels for some two weeks.
</P>
<P>
As of March 29, all the ships jammed at Lock II of the water
control and power project at Yichang in Central China's Hubei
Province had passed through the dam, according to today's "China
Daily". The ships had been waiting since March 11.
</P>
<P>
"We believe similar problems are unlikely to happen at the
ongoing Three Gorges Project, which is to dam the river this
November, and we are making greater efforts to guarantee that,"
said Liang Yingzhan, director of the Office for Three Gorges Dam
Navigation under the Ministry of Communications in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liang described the latest Gezhouba disruption, which blocked
more than 600 vessels, as "accidental," because it was a result of
the urgent preparations of the dam's Lock II, and the
once-every-six-years major maintenance work of Lock III, as well
as the inadequate handling capacity of Lock I.
</P>
<P>
"It is very rare that two of the three locks of the dam are out
of order at the same time...but the accident certainly needs to be
taken seriously, especially as traffic flow increases in the
future," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Wuhan-based Yangtze River Navigation
Administration told China Daily that the disruption was one of
several similar incidents that had occurred at the dam since it
opened in 1981.
</P>
<P>
During the traffic jam, Wuhan sources said, measures were taken
by local authorities to guarantee navigational safety.
</P>
<P>
Priority was given to free blocked passenger ships and freight
vessels carrying cargo for the Three Gorges Dam Project, China's
largest water control and power project, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jie, an official with the Yichang-based Three Gorges Dam
Project Development and Construction Corp, said his company gave
close attention to the blockage at Gezhouba Dam.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working with related departments and the Ministry
of Communications to guarantee shipping and navigation on the
Yangtze River," Tang said during a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
From this coming November to 2003, ships will pass the site of
the dam through a 350-meter-wide channel. A temporary lock will
also open to pass ships through when the river's water flow
exceeds 20,000 cubic meters per second.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe Chief Sees Role in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Council of Europe Daniel Tarschys today called on its member
nations to help restore order in chaotic Albania.
</P>
<P>
Tarschys said in an interview with the Macedonian magazine Pulse
that the situation in the Balkan country was very serious. He said
what had happened there was not a tragedy only for Albania, but
also for Europe.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the Council of Europe should first offer help in
restoring order, reforming police systems, protecting human rights
and preparing for the June general election.
</P>
<P>
However, he said these goals wouldn't be achieved unless
political parties establish confidence each other.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the plans to deploy a 6,000-strong Italian-led
multinational security forces in Albania, he said Italy should
play a crucial role as it faces Albania just across the Adriatic
Sea and is facing the flow of hundreds of thousands
of Albanian refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lawlessness has swept the Balkan Country over the last three
months since the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which
thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Output More Than Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China Offshore Oil Nan Hai East
Corp (CONHE), produced 3.51 million tons of crude oil in the
South China Sea in the first Quarter of this year, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The figure was an encouraging 220,000 tons more than the
planned goal for that period, said the CONHE, one of four
subsidiaries of the China National Offshore Oil Corp.
</P>
<P>
The eastern South China Sea is one of China's major oil
producting areas. Experts say more than five billion tons of oil
are located in the 131,000 square kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
CONHE and its overseas partners so far have discovered fewer
than 10 percent of the estimated reserves.
</P>
<P>
CONHE plans to pump 33.78 million tons of crude oil during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) with an average annual output of
6.75 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In the previous 13 years, more than 38 overseas oil companies
have committed to explore and develop oil in the offshore
area. They include Esso, British Petroleum, Chevron, Agip, Shell,
Amoco and Phillips.
</P>
<P>
Liuhua 11-1, a field opened on March 29,1996, is China's
largest offshore oilfield. It is expected to produce 2.5 million
tons of oil annually during its peak years.
</P>
<P>
The Liuhua oilfield, run with US partners and 190 miles
southeast of Hong Kong, is estimated to contain more than 200
million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Huizhou 21-1 was China's first commercial offshore oilfield. It
began commercial production in the South China Sea in late
1989. Huizhou 26-1 started operation in November 1991.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Refugees Pose No Health Threat to Italy: Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Albanian refugees pose no health
risks to Italians, the head of the Italian Red Cross said here
today, and he denounced those using the issue as a scare tactic
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Albanians are hardy people, and from what we have seen during
the medical check-ups given to all refugees when they arrive, some
of them have minor ailments or colds because of the conditions
they travel in, but that's it," Mariapia Garavaglia, commissioner
of the Italian Red Cross told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"So we must not be alarmist. Albanian refugees are not bringing
epidemics to Italy," Garavaglia said, adding that a mass
vaccination campaign had been launched by the Red Cross in the
Balkan nation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Red Cross is caring for 7,880 refugees in 112 camps
throughout the country. The refugees fled Albania to escape the
violence and unrest gripping the nation.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner criticized those who "exploit this situation
during a campaign." He stressed, "We are dealing with forced
emigres, not voluntary ones."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Northern League deputy Alberto Lembo warned
against Albanians carrying diseases. "We don't want our regions
exposed to the risks of infection and epidemics," Lembo said.
</P>
<P>
Several northern city councils, notably Milan's administration,
have refused to accept any refugees, even though the government
has decided to spread the refugee burden more evenly across
Italy. So far, most of the refugees are in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government set up a task force on Thursday to deal
with some 13,000 refugees who have fled to Italy since civil
unrest broke out in Albania in February.

to realistic situations in China's rural conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to comparatively backward management and
technology, they also meet serious challenges and
difficulties. Many township enterprises use large quantities of
natural resources in pursuit of increased production.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, economists say they have affected the environment
to some extent.
</P>
<P>
They also lose ground in the market because they are not
competitive in terms of product variety, quality or
price. Township enterprises also are becoming less adaptable to
the market economy which requires effective promotional strategies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many township enterprises are too small to be
profitable, lack the necessary competitive edge, have a misguided
product structure, suffer from poor management and heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
These problems prevent the enterprises from optimal development.
</P>
<P>
The conference focused on scientific research and application
in township enterprises to develop more high-tech products in the
future. With this, they are expected to improve overall standards
in management, sales and service.
</P>
<P>
Doumen, a historical town situated in the city of Shaoxing in
east China's Zhejiang Province, is a good example of a town that
has attracted foreign capital to bolster local economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year the town, whose population is 46,000, produced 2.03
billion yuan (245 million US dollars) worth of gross domestic
product, of which 1.81 billion yuan was contributed by the
township industry. It is listed as one of the 100 most developed
towns in the province.
</P>
<P>
The local government has strengthened its efforts to attract
overseas investment, and three joint ventures with a combined
investment of 5.93 million US dollars have been set up last
year. Fifteen foreign-funded enterprises are operating in the town
now.

<HEADLINE> HK Toys Attract Many Buyers at Tokyo Toy Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's toys had caught the
attention of many buyers at the recent Tokyo Toy Show by the
quality, innovative design and price competitiveness of the
products offered by the Hong Kong manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
said here today that a delegation of 20 Hong Kong toy
manufacturers under the auspices of the TDC exhibited a vast array
of toys at the show, including children's tents, electronic games,
bicycles, wind-up savings banks, plastic play sets, stuffed
animals and protective pads.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 87,000 buyers visited the Tokyo Toy
Fair which was held from March 19 to 23 at the Tokyo International
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Kazuji Kodaira, assistant general manager of the trade
operation department for Tomy Tec Co., Ltd., commented: "Hong Kong
products are priced very attractively and their quality seems to
be equal to Japanese products, adding, "I think Hong Kong toys are
marketable in Japan."
</P>
<P>
Naoki Kobayashi of Seiko Epson said that his company already is
doing business with Hong Kong toy makers. The key to the success
of Hong Kong toys is their price competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan imported 5 billion HK dollars (642 million US
dollars) worth of toys, dolls and games from Hong Kong, up 20
percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Economy Sees No Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's managers painted a gloomy
picture of the state of the country's economy in a survey released
by the Ministry of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the 1,849 managers polled by the ministry said
their companies were still making redundancies and saw little
signs of recovery in the economy which has been in crisis over the
last few years in the transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
More than half the managers, from a range of sectors including
chemicals, food, engineering and glass, reported a fall in output
and production capacity in the second half of last year over the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Some 84 percent reported falling demand for their products and
one in four companies complained of rising stocks of finished
goods in their warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two thirds of companies reported a fall in stocks of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
But costs and prices were on the rise in the second half of
last year, with 66 percent of managers reporting increases in the
cost of raw materials, and 43 percent reporting increases in the
prices of their finished products.
</P>
<P>
As for financing, only 2.2 percent of the managers polled had
received foreign investment in the second half of 1996, with 7.2
percent attracting investment from domestic sources, down from
nine percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Four out of five enterprises relied on their own funds and six
percent used government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The sectors attracting the highest levels of investment were
the energy sector, 22 percent of which received some form of
investment, the chemical and petrochemical industry with 15.5
percent, the steel industry, 14.3 percent and light industry 11
percent.

<HEADLINE> Zone for Agricultural Hi-Tech Development to Be Built in Yangling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Yangling
Demonstration Zone for Hi-tech Agricultural Industries officially
kicked off Friday in Yangling, Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
It is the only State-level zone designated for agricultural
hi-tech development, according to "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The zone will serve as a national high-tech research center. It
will specialize in turning research into practical production
uses, according to Cheng Andong, governor of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Council officially approved the plan on March 25. In
1934, China's first agricultural school was established in
Yangling.
</P>
<P>
Yangling is a small town 90 km west of Xi'an, the provincial
capital. The development zone will encompass 20 sq km. Some units
will be located elsewhere in Shaanxi in order to conduct
demonstrations throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
First to be put into operation will be several State key
laboratories and research and development centers for
drought-resistant wheat seed, water-conserving irrigation
techniques and soil conservation. These are regarded as vital
problems to be solved in the development of agriculture in
Northwest China, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Yangling, China's largest agricultural research and education
center, concentrates more than 4,000 agricultural scientists and
experts engaged in 64 disciplines and programmes of agriculture,
forestry and hydraulic engineering.
</P>
<P>
The town has two universities, five research institutes and
three special schools for agricultural sciences.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, more than 60,000
agricultural-scientific personnel have been trained. Some 5,000
agricultural research achievements have been made, recouping 200
billion yuan (24.1 billion US dollars) in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Yangling has co-operated with and set up
academic exchanges with more than 20 countries. At least 30
international projects underprinted with investments of some 8
million US dollars are now being undertaken, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
To speed construction of the zone, the central and local
governments have invested nearly 200 million yuan (24.1 million
dollars) for its infrastructure, and 13 industries have been
established to attract domestic and foreign funds into the zone.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (3-4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (3-4) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the relationship between the Basic Law and
the Sino-British Joint Declaration?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Both the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint
Declaration are documents of great historic importance. The
Sino-British Joint Declaration is a diplomatic convention reached
by the Chinese and British governments through diplomatic
negotiations on the settlement of the Hong Kong question left over
from history.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, on the other hand, is a legal document of the
PRC enacted in accordance with the country's Constitution. It
represents, in the form of law, China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and its administration of Hong Kong
after 1997 in accordance with the policy of "one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
Both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law contain two basic
points: the return of Hong Kong to China and the maintenance of
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. How to achieve these
goals? Their achievement has to rely on the "one country, two
systems" mechanism and a series of special policies worked out in
accordance with the concept of "one country, two systems". With
the enactment of the Basic Law, the Chinese government's 12 basic
policies regarding Hong Kong have been enshrined in the form of
law, in concrete legal terms. In legal terms also does the law
reflect the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Question: How does the Basic Law reflect the policy of "one
country, two systems?"
</P>
<P>
Answer: In content, the Basic Law from beginning to end
embodies the principles of "one country, two systems", "rule of
Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" and "a high degree of autonomy for
Hong Kong." For instance, in its provisions about the relationship
between the central government and the Hong Kong SAR, the Basic
Law stipulates that, on the premise of safeguarding national
sovereignty and the practicing of a socialist system in the
mainland, the current capitalist system and lifestyle of Hong Kong
will remain unchanged for 50 years. The central authorities will
be responsible only for Hong Kong's defence, foreign and other
affairs as prescribed by law. All powers that can be relegated to
the Hong Kong SAR will be given to the Hong Kong SAR, which will
have an unprecedentedly high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution of China, the National People's
Congress and its Standing Committee have the power to interpret
laws, including the Basic Law. However, in order that the Hong
Kong SAR enjoy an integral, independent judicial power, the NPC
Standing Committee will authorise the court of the Hong Kong SAR,
in adjudicating cases, to interpret provisions of the Basic Law
dealing with matters that fall within the autonomous powers of the
region. Only with regard to provisions of the Basic Law that
concern powers of the central government and the relationship
between the central government and the Hong Kong SAR is the court
of the Hong Kong SAR required to seek interpretation of relevant
provisions by the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Calls Magic's HIV Undetectable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Earvin "Magic" Johnson's
doctors said the former basketball star's HIV levels are
"undetectable" in blood tests but are not the miracle cure.
</P>
<P>
A statement in Los Angeles Friday from physicians David Ho and
Michael Mellman countered tabloid reports that Johnson was gravely
ill.
</P>
<P>
"Earvin is doing fine," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
"Currently he is on combination drug therapy, which has reduced
HIV's presence in his blood to undetectable levels."
</P>
<P>
The doctors also disputed quotes from Johnson's wife Cookie in
the April issue of Ebony magazine calling Magic's showing no trace
of HIV a miracle from God.
</P>
<P>
But infinitesimal levels of HIV do not mean Johnson is cured,
only that he has fought the disease to the best of modern science
and prevented HIV from advancing into AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We must emphasise that 'undetectable' does not
equal 'absent,'" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be premature and incorrect to say Earvin
is 'virus-free.' We are very pleased he has adhered to his daily
regimen and that is reflected in his good health, " said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Australia and Italy Win Opening Singles in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Italy claimed the
victories in the opening singles in their Davis Cup quarter-final
clashes, but last year's finalists Sweden were given a tough
opening day by South Africa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Australia dominated the flu-hit Czech Republic in Adelaide with
their big-servers Mark Philippoussis and Patrick Rafter proving
too powerful for Martin Damm and stand-in David Rikl.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, 24, who had got Australia off to such a fine start by
beating Cedric Pioline in their first-round clash against
champions France, was again able to get Australia off with a win
when he outplayed Damm 6-1, 7-6 (9/7), 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The 1.94m Philippoussis, who has one of the world's fastest
serves, then slammed down 15 aces to hammer Rikl 6-1, 6-4, 2-6,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
Spain's hopes of translating this season's ATP tour successes
of their players to the Davis Cup floundered in Pesaro, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Omar Camporese shocked world number-eight Carlos Moya with a
stunning 6-7 (8/10), 6-7 (4/7), 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 comeback triumph.
</P>
<P>
Camporese, ranked a lowly 156 and standing in for Italian
number-one Andrea Gaudenzi, looked dead and buried after losing
two consecutive tiebreaks. But he found his service rhythm, and
Moya collapsed under the pressure to the delight of the Italian
crowd.
</P>
<P>
In the second rubber, Renzo Furlan also had to stage a comeback
and after trailing by two sets to one against Alberto Costa came
through to win 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's world number-seven Thomas Enqvist cruised through his
opening rubber against South Africa's Grant Stafford 7-5, 2-6,
6-4, 6-1 in Vaxjo.
</P>
<P>
Stafford, ranked 69, briefly threatened by winning the second
set but Enqvist recovered to take the third and fourth in what was
mainly one-way traffic.
</P>
<P>
South Africa quickly levelled the tie at 1-1, however, when
world number 10 Wayne Ferreira saw off Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 6-4,
2-6, 7-6 (7/3).
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarterfinal in Newport, the United States were
pinning their singles hopes on Jim Courier and Andre Agassi
against Dutchmen Jan Siemerink and Sjeng Schalken respectively.

<P>
ROME, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Renzo Furlan stunned Alberto Costa of
Spain to give unfancied Italy a 2-0 lead in their Davis Cup world
group quarter-final in Pesaro, Italy, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Omar Camporese had earlier recovered from losing two
tie-breaks to oust world number eight Carlos Moya and put Italy
ahead 1-0 in the opening singles match.
</P>
<P>
Furlan, ranked 64th in the world, beat 12th-ranked Costa 4-6,
6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 in a five-setter to give Italy a chance to wrap
up the contest in Saturday's doubles.
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The rebound of technology shares
spurred a late rally on the New York Stock Exchange today despite
a weak bond market, where interest rates jumped toward a
nine-month high.

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 48.72 points to
6,526.07, recovering from an early 72-point slide. That trimmed

<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin with the

consecutive month in March, pushing up hourly wage sharply.

As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
soared to nearly 7.16 percent before settling at about 7.12
percent. The long-bond yield hasn't finished a day at that level
since last summer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate to Ratify Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the Senate to ratify the treaty banning all chemical
weapons by the deadline of April 29.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony outside the White House, Clinton said,
"If the Senate fails to ratify the convention before it enters
into force, our national security... and our economic security
will suffer."
</P>
<P>
The convention, which were signed by 161 countries in 1993 in
Paris, has been ratified by 70 countries so far and will take
effect as of April 29 with or without U.S. approval.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will ban the development, production, acquisition,
stockpiling, retention and transfer of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. Senate fails to ratify it by the deadline, the U.S.
will have no role in its implementation and U.S. chemical
companies could face sanctions, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, former Secretary of State James Baker
said, "If we fail to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, we
will be sending a clear signal of retreat from international
leadership both to our allies and our enemies alike."
</P>
<P>
The rally was also attended by U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and some senior officials from former U.S. administrations.
</P>
<P>
Opponents led by Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, insist that the convention does not serve
well the U.S. interests and vow to block it from ratification.

<HEADLINE> Greek Inflation Drops to 6 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation sharply fell
from 6.6 percent in February to 6 percent in March this year, a
Greek government official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Yiannos Papantoniou, minister of national economy and finance,
said that the latest drop in inflation was out of expectations for
the government which had hoped for an annual rate of 6.2 percent
at the most.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the National Statistics Service showed
that the sharp drop should be contributed to the rise of consumer
price index in March by only 2.2 percent, compared to 2.7 percent
in the same month last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Greek government's target of a 4.5
percent inflation this year, three percentage points lower than
inflation last year, had been half-achieved in the first quarter
of the year.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Reprimands Libya on Violating Air Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today reprimanded Libya for a recent violation of the mandatory
U.N. air embargo.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Ambassador Antonio Monteiro, council president for
April, said in a statement that the flight of a Libyan-registered
aircraft from the Libyan capital Tripoli to Jeddah of Saudi Arabia
was a "clear violation of council resolution 748 of 31 March
1992."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council considered the act as "totally
unacceptable" and called on Libya to refrain from any further such
violations, he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The council will review the matter should further violations
occur," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed mandatory sanctions, including a
ban on all international flights, on Libya in 1992 for failing to
extradite two men wanted by Britain and the United States for the
1988 mid-air bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has denied the charges and refused to hand over the two
men to the West, but has expressed its willingness to surrender
them to a neutral court.
