<HEADLINE> Gore Wins Ariz., First Web Primary  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Although busy computer connections and other
glitches frustrated some voters in Arizona's Democratic primary
Saturday, a record turnout gave Vice President Gore a resounding
and expected victory as the party completed the first binding
election for public office using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The state's voters had a choice of using traditional paper
ballots or computer terminals at most of the 124 polling sites.
Mail in ballots also were available. Even without a competitive
race, more than 35,000 people -- three times as many as participated
in 1996 -- had cast ballots in early Internet voting completed
Friday. An additional 20,000 mail-in ballots also were cast.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's voting at polling sites offering paper ballots as
well as Internet voting stations raised the total to about 76,000,
double the previous highest turnout since the party switched from a
nominating convention to a primary in 1984
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the paper ballot and Internet vote counted,
Gore had 55,508, or 78 percent, to 14,198, or 20 percent, for
Bradley and 1,087, or 2 percent, for Indiana businesswoman Heathr
Anne Harder, the only other person on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-in ballots were to be counted later.
</P>
<P>
   But with Gore already having the nomination assured and his
rival, Bill Bradley, out of the race, the story became more about
how Arizona Democrats voted to allocate 31 delegates than who they
voted for.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 234 Democratic delegates were being decided this
weekend in Arizona, Michigan and Minnesota. The three states have a
total of 295 delegates, including at-large delegates not selected
by primary or caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan caucuses Saturday, Gore had 15,854 votes to 3,117
for Bradley with all 135 caucus sites reporting and all mail-in
ballots counted. That translated to at least 107 delegates for Gore
and 7 for Bradley, with the allocation in three congressional
districts unavailable Saturday night as voters chose 129 of
Michigan's 157 total delegates.
</P>
<P>
   While not as groundbreaking at Arizona's Internet voting,
Michigan Democrats allowed mail voting for the first time and more
than 75 percent of the caucus ballots were cast by mail.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 of 111 precincts reporting after the first of two days
of Minnesota caucuses, Gore had 74 percent of the votes to 12
percent for Bradley in contests for 74 of the state's 91 total
delegates. However, a candidate has to get at least 15 percent of
the votes cast in a congressional district to win any delegates and
Bradley had not reached that threshold anywhere Saturday. Were that
pattern to hold true Sunday, Gore would get all 74 of the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona party officials were excited about the turnout,
expecting the highest number of ballots since Arizona switched from
a nominating convention to a primary in 1984. ''What a nice problem
to have, the place being busy,'' state Party Chairman Mark Fleisher
said. ''Not too many elections have had that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's vote was a glimpse at the future, said Phil Noble,
president of PoliticsOnline, a South Carolina-based company that
provides Internet tools for politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are millions of people who want to participate and
they're telling us the Internet is the way they want to
participate,'' Noble said. ''What Arizona proves is it's going to
happen a lot faster than anyone imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   But the future didn't arrive without some glitches, usually
associated with the large number of people participating.
</P>
<P>
   Ute Brady of Scottsdale, a native of Germany who exercised her
first vote since becoming a U.S. citizen, wasn't able to vote
online at Scottsdale Community College because of the heavy volume.
But she said since it was her first election, she preferred using a
paper ballot anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Cunningham of Phoenix, also had problems. She tried
repeatedly to log on from home to cast her vote, but she said all
she ever got was a busy message or a blank computer screen. She
finally decided to cast a paper ballot the old fashion way. ''It
sounds so easy to do. I wanted to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Burns, 63, a Phoenix engineer, said he found no
problems and would like to see the Internet used in general
elections.

<HEADLINE> Leafs' Bryan Berard Injures Eye  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan
Berard sustained a serious eye injury, that will require surgery,
after he was struck with a high stick Saturday night that left him
bleeding on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, who was kept overnight in the hospital, was injured in
the second period of the Maple Leafs' 4-2 victory over Ottawa, when
he was clipped under the right eye by the stick of Senators forward
Marian Hossa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is going to be an operation on his eye,'' coach and
general manager Pat Quinn said. ''This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, in his fourth NHL season, crumpled to his knees with his
forehead on the ice as a pool of blood grew until medical personnel
could reach him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stick caught him under the right eye and there is some
fear there is damage to the eye,'' said Casey Vanden Heuvel, the
Leafs' director of hockey operations. ''It took a considerable
amount of time to get the bleeding under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Another club official said it was suspected Berard suffered a
damaged orbital bone.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to be put under general anesthesia to determine
what has to be done. We expect there will be an update (Sunday),''
Vanden Huevel said.
</P>
<P>
   Hossa received a double minor for the infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, if it's serious, I'll call and apologize,'' Hossa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berard's teammates were shaken by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard it was pretty nasty,'' Leafs forward Steve Thomas
said. ''Then we heard he was taken out (of the arena) on a
stretcher. Bryan was very scared and upset. He is one of us.
Everyone here is like a brother.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ABC News-Washington Post Poll released Saturday has
Democrat Al Gore gaining ground in the polls, considered a strong leader by more

   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines flight attendant was stunned Saturday to

International Airport. Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed and
passengers slid to the ground after the emergency landing, airport spokesman Bob
Parker said. The boy, 8 or 9 years old, was by chance carrying a backpack
identical to the one used in the test. The boy laid his pack on a security
checkpoint conveyor belt at the same time as the ''passenger'' in the test put
the identical bag on, and the boy picked up the wrong bag on the other side.

Zimbabwe Head Backs Farm Occupation

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's state-run media Saturday reported

standoff between the government and white farmers who produce the bulk of the

properties, claiming rights to land farmed by descendants of British settlers.
Mugabe has been accused of promising free land to shore up his ruling party's

<HEADLINE> Explosives Removed From Docs Home  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities on Saturday removed the last
of 27 canisters packed with plastic explosives and other hazardous
materials from the home of doctor suspected in an assassination
attempt on his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as health inspectors cleared the home of Dr. Larry Ford,
who killed himself March 2 as police sought to question him, 250
residents of 52 nearby homes were allowed to return home, ending a
four-day evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just ready to go home,'' said resident Karen Crellin,
who was evacuated with her husband and their two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 49, shot himself to death a day after police searched his
home as part of the investigation into the wounding of James
Patrick Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is chief of Biofem Pharmaceutical Inc., a biomedical
company formed to market female suppositories to prevent sexually
transmitted diseases. He was shot in the cheek by a masked gunman
Feb. 28 outside the company's Irvine headquarters, but survived.
The gunman has not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's widow, Diane, told the Orange County Register in Sunday's
editions that her husband was a ''kind, compassionate gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   He ''would never do anything to harm the community. He would
never hurt anybody,'' she said. Ford was buried in Provo, Utah, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also shocked the couple's three college-age
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our family is so ... boring,'' Larry Ford Jr., 24, told the
newspaper. ''There is no dysfunction. No aberrant children. No big
drama at our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have charged the alleged getaway driver, Dino
D'Saachs, 56, of Altadena, with conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, D'Saachs described his longtime friend Ford as a
caring man.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me once he could never be a pediatrician because it
would hurt him too much to see a child cry,'' D'Saachs told the
Register in a jailhouse interview.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford's death, a police search uncovered 21 canisters
buried beneath a false floor at his home. They contained firearms
and thousands of rounds of ammunition, including machine gun
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Six more canisters were found under a concrete slab on the side
of the house, beneath pool chemicals and trash cans. All have been
given to the FBI, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford told the Register and the Los Angeles Times
that the infectious disease specialist had gathered intelligence on
biological matters for the federal government. The South African
Embassy in Washington is investigating reports that Ford advised
the South African Defense Force on chemical and biological weapons.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Gugliotta Out For Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Suns forward Tom Gugliotta will miss the
rest of the season after tearing two ligaments in his left knee
during Friday night's game against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Emerson, the team's orthopedic surgeon, drained
fluid from Gugliotta's knee Saturday and said an MRI exam showed
''three major injuries -- complete ruptures of the anterior cruciate
ligament and the medial collateral ligament and damage to the
meniscal attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson added that all three areas require surgery, likely to
take place in about a week, and Gugliotta might need a whole year
to recover from the reconstruction in his knee.

<P>
   ''We've had experience with ACL injuries in this organization,''
said Emerson, noting knee injuries to former Suns forward Danny
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing, but I just have to concentrate on getting
better and getting back to 100 percent,'' Gugliotta said. ''The
good news is our team still is going to be good the rest of the
season. I just won't be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta was injured with 3:09 remaining in the 99-96 loss to
Utah. Suns guard Randy Livingston drove to the basket and fell into
Gugliotta's left leg. Gugliotta fell to the floor in pain, gripping
his knee, and needed help to get to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The injury also will keep Gugliotta from playing for the U.S.
team in the Olympics this fall in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta was averaging 13.7 points and 7.9 rebounds this
season. He missed seven games after suffering a life-threatening
seizure on the team bus Dec. 17 in Portland because of a reaction
to a food supplement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Sean Burke recorded his second straight shutout
and Trevor Letowski scored twice Saturday night, leading the
Phoenix Coyotes to a 5-0 victory over the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who shut out the New York Islanders 5-0 Thursday night,
stopped 26 shots in earning his 22nd career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Juha Ylonen, Jeremy Roenick and Mikael Renberg also scored.
</P>
<P>
   Ylonen scored 32 seconds into the game on a wrist shot from the
left circle. There was traffic in front of goalie Felix Potvin and
the puck flew past his glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick put the Coyotes up 2-0 with his 32nd goal, scored 16:20
in. Shane Doan carried the puck up ice along the left boards and
found Roenick with a pass between the circles.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' third goal came 6:30 into the second. Greg Adams
was checked off the puck by defensemen Brent Sopel and Murray
Baron. Letowski slid the loose puck past Potvin.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix made it 4-0 just 36 seconds later when the recently
acquired Renberg scored his first goal with the Coyotes. The goal
sent Potvin, who only stopped 10 of 14 shots, to the bench in favor
of Garth Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Letowski got his second goal, with Phoenix short-handed, 16:39
into the second to make it 5-0.

<HEADLINE> Fresno St. 75, No. 14 Tulsa 72  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- For the third time this season, Fresno
State was a few seconds better than Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Roberson hit a 3-pointer with 11.5 seconds remaining to
give the Bulldogs a 75-72 victory over the 14th-ranked Golden
Hurricane in Saturday night's championship game of the Western
Athletic Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa lost only four games this season, and three of those were
last-minute defeats by Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winner of the WAC tournament does not receive an
automatic NCAA tournament berth, both teams are likely candidates
for bids. It would be Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian's first
return to the tournament since 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian is sixth on the NCAA tournament list with 37
victories, and his UNLV team won the national title in 1989-90. But
he battled the NCAA in court for years, and his teams at Long Beach
State and UNLV both were in trouble with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian has led the Bulldogs to five straight seasons of at
least 20 wins, but Fresno State has not been invited to the NCAA
tournament the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Heard gave Tulsa a 71-70 lead on a jumper with 57 seconds
remaining, and the Golden Hurricane quickly got the ball back. But
Heard threw the ball away with 24 seconds left, and Roberson hit
his decisive shot from the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's Marcus Hill had two free throws and a chance to tie with
5.4 seconds left, but missed the first. Courtney Alexander then hit
two foul shots for Fresno State with 4.1 seconds left and stole
Tulsa's ensuing inbound pass.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the nation's leading scorer averaging 25.2 points,
had 29 to lead the Bulldogs (24-9). Roberson added 26 for Fresno
State, which reached the title game with a wild 103-100
double-overtime win over Hawaii in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Coley had 19 points for Tulsa (29-4), the WAC
regular-season champion. Hill added 13 and Brandon Kurtz had 12
points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander had 17 points as the Bulldogs took a 35-31 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane scored the first seven points, holding Fresno
State scoreless for the opening 3:16. Alexander gave the Bulldogs
their first lead at 12-11 on a jumper, and followed that with a
three-point play. Fresno State led the rest of the half.

<HEADLINE> Kings 3, Flames 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ziggy Palffy and Craig Johnson scored less
than six minutes apart during a fight-filled first period as the
Los Angeles Kings completed a four-game season sweep of the Calgary
Flames with a 3-1 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aki Berg scored midway through the third period, Luc Robitaille
had two assists and Jamie Storr made 24 saves for the Kings. Los
Angeles swept a season series from the Flames franchise for the
first time since the team's first season in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary, which has lost three straight, stayed tied with Anaheim
in the Western Conference standings, three-points behind San Jose
for the eighth and final playoff berth. The Flames only goal was
scored by Jarome Iginla during a second-period power play.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Fuhr made his first start for Calgary since Dec. 15 in
place of Fred Brathwaite, who started the previous 12 games and
surrendered 13 goals in his last two outings.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr, whose five victories this season have all come in
overtime, spent 28 games on the injured list following knee surgery
in December. The 19-year veteran, who stopped 35 Kings shots,
hasn't won as a starter since beating San Jose on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 3-3-2 homestand that ended with their first
back-to-back home losses since early October, the Flames had four
fighting penalties and only three shots in the first period. The
Kings took 14 shots at Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's Clarke Wilm squared off with Ian Laperriere, Eric
Charron took on Kings captain Rob Blake, Flames defenseman Derek
Morris exchanged punches with Dan Bylsma and Rene Corbet challenged
Marko Tuomainen -- all in the first 11{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One minute after the last fight, Palffy made it 1-0 with his
26th goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in seven games that Calgary was shut out
in the opening period, and only the second time in 15.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's shot from the top of the right circle struck
Calgary's Andreas Johansson in the back, but Blake kept the puck
alive and Palffy converted a rebound of Blake's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings squandered a chance to extend their lead, after
penalties to Shannon and Charron gave Los Angeles a two-man
advantage for 1:15.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made it 2-0 with 1:55 left in the first, beating Fuhr
through the pads, moments after hitting the left post during a
goal-mouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames were shorthanded for all but one second of a 6:32
span of the second period after Iginla scored his 24th goal and
13th in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuhr was brilliant during that crisis, which included a
four-minute high-sticking penalty to Charron for cutting Robitaille
on the chin, and another two-man advantage the Kings had for 1{
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican police have captured one of the
country's most-wanted drug trafficking suspects, an attorney for
the man's family confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Labra, an alleged leader of the Arrellano Felix drug gang,
was captured at noon Saturday in an operation that in downtown
Tijuana involved the Mexican army and federal police, the Notimex
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be one of the most important drug arrests in
recent years in Mexico, where an anti-narcotics campaign has been
strongly criticized for its failure to capture leaders of the
Arellano Felix gang.
</P>
<P>
   The Tijuana-based organization is considered by the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency to be one of the largest and most violent drug
gangs operating in Mexico. One of the Arrellano Felix brothers,
Ramon, is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and federal authorities
have offered a $2 million reward for information leading to his
capture.
</P>
<P>
   The gang, along with other trafficking operations, is accused of
numerous assassinations of police, prosecutors, judges and rivals
in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Mexico's attorney general nor the army had made
any comment on Labra's arrest by late Saturday, Labra family
attorney Gustavo Galvez Reyes confirmed his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent profile, the Mexico City daily Reforma said Labra
owned several hotels and nightclubs in the Tijuana area. The
profile said anti-narcotics investigators believe Labra has been a
major partner in the gang since about 1990, when it began to take
over narcotics trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the newspaper said that some investigators believed
Labra -- married to the Arellano Felix brothers' aunt -- had become
the key figure in the organization, though attention has continued
to focus on brothers Ramon, Benjamin and Francisco Javier.

<HEADLINE> Close Aide to Iran President Shot  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Attackers shot and wounded a leading
reformist who is a close aide to President Mohammad Khatami on
Sunday, before escaping on a motorcycle, Iran's official news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian was hit in the shoulder and face outside the
Tehran Municipal Council building in central Tehran, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, who is a member of the municipal council, was
hospitalized after the attack, a journalist at the Sobh-e-Emrouz
daily, which is managed by Hajjarian, said on condition of
anonymity. Details on his condition were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian is a former hard-liner who founded the notorious
Intelligence Ministry. He began to speak out for freedom of
expression and greater political plurality after being removed from
his position of influence and silenced for opposing the eight-year
presidency of Hashemi Rafsanjani, who stepped down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian later became an adviser to Khatami when he succeeded
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's legislative elections, which were swept by
the reformists, Hajjarian angered many of the losing hard-liners
with provocative statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to clean the Parliament,'' he said during an election
rally. ''Some of the current members of Parliament are too old and
not usable any more and we have to put them in the garbage bin and
throw them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hajjarian was summoned to court by the Tehran Justice
Department over an article in the Sobh-e-Emrouz, which, according
to the prosecutor, insulted Islam. He was released after being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   When the reformists allied to Khatami swept parliamentary
elections last month, it dealt a serious blow to the hard-liners,
who have tried to preserve the strict Islamic rule that has been in
place since Iran's 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian was elected to the municipal council in February 1999
with the second greatest number of votes behind another top
reformist, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   Before the municipal polls -- the country's first local elections
since the 1979 revolution -- Hajjarian, Nouri and three other
reformists were among 50 candidates disqualified by the board for
their moderates views. But Khatami ruled the disqualifications
illegal.

Fake Explosive Device Found on Jet

   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines flight attendant was stunned Saturday to
reach into a child's backpack for crayons and find what looked like an explosive
device, prompting an emergency U-turn and landing at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport. Chutes on the MD-80 series airliner were deployed and
passengers slid to the ground after the emergency landing, airport spokesman Bob
Parker said. The boy, 8 or 9 years old, was by chance carrying a backpack
identical to the one used in the test. The boy laid his pack on a security
checkpoint conveyor belt at the same time as the ''passenger'' in the test put
the identical bag on, and the boy picked up the wrong bag on the other side.

Zimbabwe Head Backs Farm Occupation

farms so long as they are peaceful. The comments were likely to harden the
standoff between the government and white farmers who produce the bulk of the
nation's marketed crops, including tobacco. Squatters have occupied the
properties, claiming rights to land farmed by descendants of British settlers.
Mugabe has been accused of promising free land to shore up his ruling party's
collapsing support before elections in April.

<HEADLINE> Director Mendes Takes Top DGA Honor  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''American Beauty'' director Sam Mendes won
the top honor Saturday from the Directors Guild of America,
solidifying his chances to take home an Oscar for the dark satire
of suburban family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes, an acclaimed stage director, won the guild award for his
first feature film, which stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as
a couple whose dysfunctional relationship erupts in violence.
</P>
<P>
   The award was presented by last year's guild winner, ''Saving
Private Ryan'' director Steven Spielberg, whose DreamWorks SKG
studio released ''American Beauty.'' Spielberg also received the
guild's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes cited directors who have influenced him, including Alfred
Hitchcock, Billy Wilder and Clint Eastwood. He also thanked
Spielberg and DreamWorks for giving him the ''American Beauty''
script.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to the studio for giving a bloke from England a
movie about the American suburbs and letting me make the movie I
wanted to make,'' Mendes said.
</P>
<P>
   The award firms up Mendes' position as front-runner for the
Academy Award on March 26. Mendes also won a Golden Globe for
''American Beauty'' in January.
</P>
<P>
   Only four times in the 52-year history of the Directors Guild
awards has the winner failed to receive the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to win an Oscar for the movie,'' Mendes said. ''But
this is an award in its own right because it comes from
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' leads all films with eight Oscar
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The other guild nominees were Frank Darabont for the
supernatural prison tale ''The Green Mile''; Spike Jonze for
''Being John Malkovich,'' a bizarre take on identity and body
snatching; Michael Mann for ''The Insider,'' the story of an
ex-tobacco executive who blows the whistle on ''60 Minutes''; and
M. Night Shyamalan for the ghost story ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Darabont is the only DGA nominee who did not also receive an
Academy Award nomination for best director. Lasse Hallstrom took
the fifth Oscar nod for ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Spielberg received the lifetime award, the audience
viewed clips from his movies, including ''Jaws,'' ''Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ''Empire of the Sun'' and ''Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   He said backstage that as with his seven children, he tries not
play favorites among his own movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love them all equally, but I love 'Schindler's List' just a
little bit more,'' Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg paid tribute to his own directing heroes, including
Orson Welles, Akira Kurosawa and Robert Wise, thanking the latter
for ''letting me sneak onto the set of 'The Hindenburg.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg is one of the four past Directors Guild winners who
did not win an Oscar, for ''The Color Purple'' in 1985. The others
were Anthony Harvey for ''The Lion in Winter'' from 1968; Francis
Ford Coppola for ''The Godfather'' from 1972; and Ron Howard for
''Apollo 13'' from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to guild awards for ''The Color Purple'' and
''Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg won for ''Schindler's List,''
and he was nominated for ''Jaws,'' ''Close Encounters of the Third
Kind,'' ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ''E.T., the
Extra-terrestrial,'' ''Empire of the Sun'' and ''Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime Achievement Award formerly was named for pioneering
silent-film director D.W. Griffith. The guild decided to drop
Griffith's name last year because of criticism over black racial
stereotypes in the director's movies, including the Civil War epic
''Birth of a Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg said he agreed that Griffith's movies propagated
stereotypes but that he still should be remembered as a pioneer who
helped create the industry and invented the job of director.

passengers slid to the ground after the emergency landing, airport spokesman Bob
Parker said. The boy, 8 or 9 years old, was by chance carrying a backpack
identical to the one used in the test. The boy laid his pack on a security

<HEADLINE> Director Mendes Takes Top DGA Honor  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''American Beauty'' director Sam Mendes won
the top honor Saturday from the Directors Guild of America,
solidifying his chances to take home an Oscar for the dark satire
of suburban family strife.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes, an acclaimed stage director, won the guild award for his
first feature film, which stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as
a couple whose dysfunctional relationship erupts in violence.
</P>
<P>
   The award was presented by last year's guild winner, ''Saving
Private Ryan'' director Steven Spielberg, whose DreamWorks SKG
studio released ''American Beauty.'' Spielberg also received the
guild's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to the studio for giving a bloke from England a
movie about the American suburbs and letting me make the movie I
wanted to make,'' Mendes said.
</P>
<P>
   The award firms up Mendes' position as front-runner for the
Academy Award on March 26. Mendes also won a Golden Globe for
''American Beauty'' in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' leads all films with eight Oscar

<HEADLINE> EU Expected To Back German IMF Pick  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union finance ministers were
expected Monday to back Germany's second choice to head the
International Monetary Fund after the previous EU-backed candidate
failed to overcome U.S. objections.
</P>
<P>
   Horst Koehler was proposed by Germany last week following
Washington's effective veto of Caio Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   Although they eventually backed Koch-Weser, some EU nations
shared U.S. concerns that the German deputy finance minister lacked
the political clout needed to run the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's EU partners have been quicker to accept Koehler, who
currently heads the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
</P>
<P>
   French Finance Minister Christian Sautter last week said Paris
supported Koehler as an ''admirable candidate who has solid
international financial experience.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, British officials said London was also backing the
German. Italy signaled it was falling into line behind Koehler over
the weekend after failing to muster support for the candidacy of
its own Treasury Secretary Giuliano Amato.
</P>
<P>
   With the four largest EU nations indicating support for Koehler,
he was expected to win the backing of the entire 15-nation bloc
when the finance ministers take up the issue at their regular
monthly gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from Portugal, which currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency, worked through the weekend to secure a united front at
Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the managing director of the IMF has been
European, while an American heads the World Bank. Washington says
it sticks by that arrangement, despite its objections to
Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is for a European candidate who has strong
qualifications,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said during
a visit to EU headquarters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. administration has not publicly declared its position
on Koehler, but reports Saturday in the German news weekly Der
Speigel said Washington was lobbying against the new German
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The transatlantic wrangling over the job has encouraged
criticism from Asia, Latin America and Africa over the customary
division of top positions at the international finance
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has put forward its own candidate, Eisuke Sakakibara,
while a number of African nations have proposed Stanley Fischer, a
U.S. citizen who has been acting IMF head since Frenchman Michel
Camdessus stepped down in February after 13 years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Says No Oil Deal Made Yet  </HEADLINE>
By SAEED AL-NAHDI, 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- Iran's oil minister said Sunday that no
agreement has been reached about raising OPEC oil production, and
that the cartel will decide on the issue when it meets in Vienna
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said upon arrival in Oman that the
decision on raising output cannot be made by any individual country
but will have to be made by the 11-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, no decision has been made about whether or not to
increase production levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zanganeh has been visiting oil producers ahead of the March 27
OPEC meeting. He was in Saudi Arabia last week, and is due to
arrive in the United Arab Emirates later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Following a brief meeting with his Omani counterpart, Mohammed
al-Rumhi, Zanganeh said his talks are mainly aimed at coordinating
positions and exchanging views ahead of the forthcoming OPEC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Iran's current position is that it supports an
extension of the ongoing OPEC production cut, which expires at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In agreements signed in 1998 and 1999, non-OPEC Oman joined OPEC
and non-OPEC producers in removing about 5 million barrels a day
from the market through March 31, 2000, to boost oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy Said Recovering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Economic Planning Agency will soon report
signs of incremental, self-sustained economic recovery, the Nihon
Keizai financial newspaper said Sunday, citing no sources.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would be the first time since April 1997, when the
government raised taxes and sparked a recession, that the EPA would
have used the word ''recovery'' in its monthly report, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA expects corporate investment, particularly by
information-technology companies, to power a recovery, as there are
still few signs of increased consumer spending, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report was to be presented to the Cabinet on Friday.
Phones at the EPA office rang unanswered on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is experiencing its longest economic slump in decades.
Gross Domestic Product figures for the October-December period are
due Monday. EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya said recently that they will
probably show shrinkage. GPD is a measure of all goods and services
produced in a country.

<HEADLINE> GM May Become Fiat's New Partner  </HEADLINE>
By PETER W. MAYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italian automaker Fiat is on the verge of striking a
partnership deal with General Motors, Italian news reports said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Turin-based company is expected to make a formal
announcement of a deal with the U.S. automaker during a board
meeting on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''An inevitable move,'' Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino
said of an alliance between Fiat and a foreign carmaker. ''Whoever
wishes to hold on to Fiat in its present form risks marginalizing
it further and further,'' he told the Rome daily La Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, GM spokesman Tony Cervone declined to discuss the
reports, saying ''it would be inappropriate to comment on
speculative rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an obvious trend in the industry toward consolidation,
and there have been a lot of rumors and speculation floating around
about where the next consolidation might be,'' Cervone said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat is Italy's largest private employer and a national
institution. But it has slipped for years in the European market
and taken a beating in South America, where car sales plunged with
the 1990s economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Its share of the Italian market, once 60 percent, has dwindled
to 39 percent as competition eroded its dominance. In 1998, Fiat
claimed only 11 percent of car sales in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the merger trend among major automakers, and rumors
linking Fiat to General Motors, DaimlerChrysler and other
companies, the Agnelli family's hold on Fiat has remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   But Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's honorary chairman, recently said that
the company -- whose makes include Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari
sports cars -- was on the lookout for international partners.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged for Century of DMV Fees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Robert Challender of Reno expected to be hit
with a late fee when he showed up a month late to register his 1978
Datsun.
</P>
<P>
   But what he didn't plan on was a $378,426.25 bill sent to him by
the Department of Motor Vehicles, an amount that included about
$260,000 in late fees and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them to take me to jail if they had to. I wasn't
paying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DMV officials blamed the mixup on conversion of data to the
agency's new computer system and ended up charging Challender the
same $60 fee he paid last year.
</P>
<P>
   Challender apparently was billed for late charges accrued since
1900, when the only motor vehicles were some experimental horseless
carriages, officials said. They added that the problem wasn't a Y2K
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope we don't see that again,'' DMV spokeswoman Kim Evans
said.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Say Stay With Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not sticking with exercises to build strength
may leave a person too weak to do what has to be done around the
house, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that strength is important for preservation of
function,'' said researcher Steven N. Blair of the Cooper Institute
for Aerobics Research in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And the lifestyle limitations commonly associated with the aged
can afflict the out-of-shape middle-aged, said the study by Blair
and his colleagues in the American College of Sports Medicine
journal, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers followed 3,069 men and 589 women, ages 30 to 82,
who were given physical exams, including a strength evaluation, at
Cooper Clinic between 1980 and 1989. The participants had to be
free of any history of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, high blood
pressure and cancer at that time.
</P>
<P>
   On a treadmill exercise test, the participants had to exercise
hard enough to reach at least 85 percent of the maximal heart rate
predicted for people of their age. They also were given tests of
upper and lower body strength, and were rated from 0 to 6 based on
the results. Scores of 5 and 6 were grouped as high-strength.
</P>
<P>
   After an average of five years, the participants responded to a
mailback questionnaire on their abilities to do recreational,
household and personal care activities. These activities ranged
from cooking and getting dressed to scrubbing floors and walking up
10 stairs without resting.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had tested in the high-strength group were less likely
than those with low strength to report later any type of functional
limitation, the researchers found. In men, only 3.2 percent of the
high-strength group reported a limitation, compared with 8.3
percent of those with lower strength. In women, 4.7 percent of the
high-strength group and 13.5 percent of those with lower strength
reported a limitation.
</P>
<P>
   Although older people most commonly have to live with functional
limitations, ''the association between muscular strength and
endurance and the subsequent prevalence of functional limitations
indicates that this relationship persists even among middle-aged
adults,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic endurance is not the only way to stay active; strength
work has a role, too, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers noted their work left some unanswered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists could not be sure the participants had no
limitations at the start of the study. But the researchers
considered the participants' high scores on the treadmill test and
their freedom from heart disease and other debilitating conditions
as signs the subjects were healthy at the start.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also could not be sure the participants who were
strong at the start kept up, in the intervening years, the activity
levels that help people to stay strong. Blair surmised they
probably did, however, make activity a habit.
</P>
<P>
   The study offers new encouragement for sedentary people not to
give up on the possibility that they could start an exercise
program and benefit from it, said Miriam Nelson, director of the
Center for Physical Fitness at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real point of the study and other recent research is that
no matter what age you are, starting and sticking with it can have
very profound effects on your function as you grow older,'' said
Nelson, who was not involved in the study.
</P>
<P>
   People in their 50s and 60s who take up exercise can reverse
much of the loss that had been blamed on aging, said Nelson, author
of the book ''Strong Women Stay Young.'' Even people in their 90s
can make surprising strength gains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise cannot ward off all the age-related changes in muscle,
although it can control the damage. Muscle begins to shrink after
the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, researchers increasingly believe that much of
the muscle loss that middle-aged and other people believe to be
caused by age is really caused by inactivity, which can be reversed
by exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Strength exercise can range from lifting weights at a health
club to carrying around milk jugs or doing home improvement
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not very surprising that those individuals who were not
very active in the baseline had more functional limitation
problems,'' said Chhandra Dutta, director of musculoskeletal
research at the National Institute on Aging. ''It goes back to the
old adage of use it or lose it.''

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania Debates Future of Elk  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARYS, Pa. (AP) -- The sky is clear, the sun is shining
brightly and the temperature has inched into the 30s -- all of which
makes the elk in Rawley Cogan's trap skittish.
</P>
<P>
   It is just before 9 a.m. on a February morning, and Cogan is
run-down, in no mood for complications. A few hours earlier, the
state Game Commission's elk biologist was sitting on a lawn chair
inside a smelly, cold trailer watching through night-vision glasses
as two dozen elk dug around for feed on a farmer's snow-covered
field.
</P>
<P>
   He had set a trap -- a pen baited with field corn and alfalfa.
Elk milled in and out, and at 1 a.m., after eight hours of
watching, Cogan shut the door by remote control. Eight animals
pawed around inside. In a few hours, he will haul them 30 miles
southeast and release them -- if, that is, all goes well.
</P>
<P>
   All has not always gone well in the three years of
Pennsylvania's project to expand the range of its 566-strong herd,
one of the largest east of the Mississippi River. Like every move
to reintroduce wild animals into new areas, the program is
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, there's a twist: Even though the elk are
entering sparsely populated mountain wilderness, it has taken only
one private landowner to complicate things.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Waltz, 55, is a former teacher who cultivates 15 acres of
vegetables along the Susquehanna River, on the eastern fringe of
the elk herd. In 1999, he shot nine elk -- six in a single week -- as
they munched his corn, trampled his pumpkin vines and stepped on
his squash.
</P>
<P>
   Waltz, the only farmer in a remote region of hunting camps,
state forests and tiny, scattered towns, says he'll shoot more this
year if the Game Commission does not move the elk. It is legal to
shoot animals damaging crops.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the point of view, that makes him one of two
things: hero for the private landowner, or enemy of
environmentalists, local businesses who benefit from elk tourism
and sportsmen who favor expansion to clear the way for a hunt in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: ''He can have an impact on elk
expansion,'' Cogan said. ''He already has.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltz is frustrated about being singled out as the chief enemy.
He points out that he is not the only one upset about the elk.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have always shot elk in their fields, though never in
such extreme numbers. And homeowners, fed up with seemingly
domesticated elk, supported Waltz after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's Rocky Mountain elk herd, which numbered just 38
in 1974, grows by 12 percent to 14 percent each year. That has led
to more conflicts, mostly with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The trap-and-transfer plan, started in 1996, tries to move from
harm's way elk wreaking havoc on farms in Elk and Cameron counties.
The other goal is to expand the herd enough to support an elk hunt
for the first time since 1931.
</P>
<P>
   But when Cogan released 33 elk in Clinton County in 1998, the
hunt started a little early.
</P>
<P>
   Waltz blames the Game Commission for choosing a bad release site
-- three miles from his property -- then refusing to right the wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just being jerks, is what it is,'' said Waltz. ''I'm
not proud of shooting elk. But when you're put against the wall,
put against the wall, put against the wall ... .''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to chase the elk off his land, harmlessly shooting them
with pellets. Still they returned, sometimes the same night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to shoot the elk,'' his wife, Connie, said. ''We
want them moved out of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers have fenced in fields to keep elk out, but Waltz
refused; he objected to opening the rest of his land to the public.
So in exchange for a six-month cease-fire, the Game Commission
agreed to remove elk within one mile of Waltz's fields.
</P>
<P>
   But with growing season ahead, no one considers that a solution.
Waltz said the commission reneged on a three-mile elk-free zone,
and his cease-fire ends May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought maybe this summer, my life would be back to
normal,'' he said. ''It seems like we're going to be back on the
hot seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cogan: ''There'll be more elk to shoot, and I'd be
surprised if he doesn't shoot more. I'm convinced of one thing:
Killing elk doesn't solve anything. Who wins?''
</P>
<P>
   Cogan planned to release as many as 40 elk in the new State Game
Lands No. 321, a 4,300-acre plot on the west branch of the
Susquehanna River near Sproul State Forest. The closest town is
Karthaus (population 500), except for the 15 people living a few
miles away from the release site in Pottersdale. Just 3,000 people
live in this 450-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
   But the release site is only 10 miles downriver from the Waltz
property in Cook's Run -- a distance the elk can easily cover in a
few days. So the Game Commission cut its trap-and-transfer in half,
moving only 16 elk.
</P>
<P>
   Even that may be too many.
</P>
<P>
   ''That area can support a lot of elk,'' Cogan said. ''But if
those elk pack up and walk down the river and go to Adam Waltz's
and he kills them, what've we accomplished?''
</P>
<P>
   If Waltz shows no signs of backing down, neither does Cogan.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy or not, trap-and-transfers continued as planned this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   One February morning in St. Marys, about 130 miles northeast of
Pittsburgh, Cogan and his crew creep quietly along the trap, trying
not to spook the elk. But three dozen high school students are here
to watch the trapping, and the elk see them through the cracks in
walls of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   One, a cow, panics. Taking a running start, it leaps atop the
8-foot fence, teeters on the edge and topples outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I said it could happen. It happened. Cow just took a
run, got up on a chute, fell down, broke her neck,'' Cogan says in
the same gentle voice he has used to soothe jumpy elk for years.
''That's the first time it's happened to us. It's unfortunate, but
it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew returns to work, trying to scare the elk out of the pen
and into narrow chutes, where they could pen them, attach a radio
collar and an ear tag and take a slug from the ear as a tissue
sample.
</P>
<P>
   Four workers, hidden by boards, stand alongside the chutes. One
elk sprints in, and they release a guillotine-style door behind it.
Another follows, and the workers run to blindfold them, stroking
their necks to calm them. The first two elk, 400-pound cows, crash
against the sides and top, trying to leap out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally they settle down, and Cogan and the workers lean in. Two
hours later, the two cows and five calves are inside their
temporary home, a fenced-in four-acre plot. The trailer hatch
popped, the elk sprint out uncertainly, look about, then dash down
the hill toward the river. Come spring, they will roam free.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan watches silently as they disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to do is put an animal back in an area where
it once lived,'' he says on the ride back north. ''These are 400
square miles where almost no one lives. Why shouldn't they be here?
Because one or two people don't want them?''
</P>

<HEADLINE> African Democracies Make Progress  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Vandals attack homes and cars owned by
political activists. Separatist rebels launch election day
offensives. Polling stations open late and lack sufficient voting
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The recent presidential ballot in Senegal was far from
trouble-free, but it shows a growing African resolve to bring power
closer to the people, some observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The imperious president has not disappeared, but Africans no
longer accept him willingly,'' said Adama Gaye, editor of the
London-based West Africa magazine. ''The new generation wants
leaders who understand their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty out of 53 African heads of state were elected in ballots
that included serious rivals, compared to just a handful two
decades ago. As education and press freedom slowly improve in the
more stable parts of the continent, people are demanding a say in
the political process.
</P>
<P>
   After inconclusive results in last Sunday's ballot, President
Abdou Diouf is expected to square off against his longtime rival,
Abdoulaye Wade, in a second round on March 19 -- a first in Senegal,
where the ruling Socialist Party has easily won previous elections.
Wade has warned of a public uprising if he loses.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other mixed successes recently on this troubled
continent.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa held its second democratic election last year after
decades of apartheid rule. Neighboring Mozambique held its second
elections in December after a brutal civil war, though the main
opposition party disputed the results.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Zimbabwe, voters turned out in surprising numbers to
reject a constitution that would have increased the powers of
President Robert Mugabe. It was Mugabe's biggest defeat since
independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the continent, Algeria elected its first
civilian leader in 24 years last year, though the country continues
to be torn by an Islamic insurgency that has killed an estimated
100,000 people in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans remain skeptical of the ballot process. Democratic
change does not always bring freedom or a better life.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivory Coast, which along with Senegal had been a bastion of
stability in volatile West Africa, the elected government of
President Henri Konan Bedie was toppled in a popular Christmas Eve
coup.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party had held power since independence from France
in 1960, but faced mounting unrest, a declining economy and
allegations of corruption. The military junta has promised
elections to restore civilian rule, but has not set a date.
</P>
<P>
   In the West African nation of Liberia, where elections took
place the year after a ferocious seven-year civil war ended in
1996, warlord-turned-President Charles Taylor threatened to restart
the fighting if he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   The first democratically elected president in largely desert
Niger was unable to resolve his country's desperate economic
problems and quickly lost support. After two subsequent coups,
Niger held another round of voting last year. A former military man
won.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Senegal, where the economy is growing by 5 percent a
year and civil servants get regular paychecks, some voters are
reluctant to trust their future to opposition candidates who
represent the fearful unknown. The Socialist Party has ruled there
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Deep seated ethnic and religious divisions sometimes overwhelm
the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's mainly Tutsi government has refused to allow elections
until radicals from the country's Hutu majority, who were
implicated in the 1994 genocide that claimed more than 500,000
lives, no longer pose a rebel threat.
</P>
<P>
   Elections in Nigeria last year brought a return to democracy
after nearly 16 years of military rule. But the country has been
ravaged by mounting ethnic and religious violence under President
Olusegun Obasanjo. Fighting between Christians and Muslims over
calls to implement Islamic law, or sharia, has cost hundreds of
lives in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Africa's heads of state have been in power for
at least 10 years, according to the U.S.-based Freedom House and
other sources. Only 12 countries have totally independent electoral
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Until African countries successfully deal with the overwhelming
social problems that overshadow their politics, they seem destined
to continue to struggle with democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to talk about democracy when you have nothing
to eat,'' Gaye said. ''This is Africa's problem.''

<HEADLINE> Korea Economic Boom Leaves Some Out  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Two years ago, business was so bad at
Seoul's biggest shopping center that bored employees often
outnumbered customers. Today, with the economy blooming again,
they're busy unpacking boxes of new goods for eager shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like we never had an economic crisis,'' said Lee Hyun-ja,
a saleswoman at the Lotte Department Store.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics look good. Unemployment and interest rates are
down; the stock market and economic growth are up.
</P>
<P>
   But some people don't have anything to celebrate as South
Korea's export-oriented economy regains its footing in the world
marketplace. Thousands haven't gotten back jobs and savings that
were swept away when Asia's currency crisis tumbled much of the
region into recession and rippled out to trip the economies of
Russia, Brazil and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis, many South Koreans handed over gold
and other valuable heirlooms to the government to help bail out the
country. The lingering victims of the financial upheaval have
enjoyed no such solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Seoul, a city-run shelter called the House
of Freedom provides lodging for 1,000 people, more than a third of
whom lost their jobs and homes during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Bok-nam, 48, moved into the shelter a year ago after his
brother, who was also his business partner, committed suicide by
swallowing sleeping pills when their business failed.
</P>
<P>
   Their main client, a construction company, couldn't repay them
for building materials they had supplied and Lee ended up on the
run from angry creditors. Now a construction worker, he earns $330
a month, just a tenth of his previous income.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe large corporations are healthier and owners richer now.
But what about small companies that went bankrupt and employees who
got laid off?'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and two daughters have stayed with a relative since he
sold their house to pay debts. He says he also attempted suicide,
slitting a wrist and swallowing sleeping pills at a motel.
Employees there found him and he recovered in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lee later moved into the shelter because he was ashamed to stay
with his family. Confucian values still prevalent in South Korea
teach it is a disgrace for a man, the traditional head of the
family, to be unable to feed his loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some 46,000 small- and medium-size companies collapsed during
the economic crisis. With South Korea's economy rebounding, nearly
30,000 new companies were set up last year.
</P>
<P>
   In other signs of a strong recovery, the economy grew 10 percent
last year, after a 5.8 percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is still a problem. The jobless rate was just 2
percent before the crisis hit in 1997, then soared to 8.6 percent
as South Korean companies failed or laid off workers to stay
afloat. With the recovery, the rate has come down to a little over
5 percent, but the figure doesn't reflect the many employees who
switched from full-time to part-time work.
</P>
<P>
   The government provides welfare for the jobless, but critics say
bureaucratic procedures make it hard to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Even for recent university graduates, it's often hard to find
work.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Soo-bum graduated with an engineering degree from a Seoul
university a year ago but still has no job. Fewer than half the 60
students in his class are working. Before the crisis, engineering
classes boasted an almost 100 percent employment rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even those who found jobs get paid so little compared to
before the crisis. As for me, I have no idea what to do because
there are still few job openings,'' said the 28-year-old Kim, who
like many single Koreans lives with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit Co., South Korea's largest job search firm, said the
nation's 30 largest conglomerates used to hire about 16,000 to
17,000 university graduates annually before the crisis. Hiring was
virtually suspended in 1997, and rose to 7,000 in 1998 and 10,000
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The number of homeless rose during the crisis, although the
government did not collect figures until homelessness became a
serious problem in early 1998. Today, there are about 4,000
homeless people, which is down about 11 percent from a year ago, in
a population of 47 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most stay in small shelters run by religious or civic groups
that do not have the money to house many people.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Losing Working-Class Image  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago's neighborhoods are losing their working
class image block by block.
</P>
<P>
   Modest bungalows are being bulldozed and replaced by four-flat
apartment buildings and luxury townhouses. Dilapidated warehouses
are being converted into pricey lofts. Long-forgotten vacant tracts
in some poorer neighborhoods now boast rows of townhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city is rejuvenating from the center out,'' says Don
DeBat, a real estate columnist for Crain's Chicago Business.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say the boom has a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about the total change of the makeup of our
community,'' said Alderman Gene Schulter.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents complain that developers are draining their
neighborhoods of character. They say four-flats squeezed onto
blocks of single-family homes create street congestion and limit
views, and that some people may be priced out of the housing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also complain that architects are overusing one design --
a turn-of-the-century, red-brick four-story flat.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that there is a cookie-cutter mentality in
Chicago,'' said Bill Lavicka, a renovation specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the architecture is out of the drawer; you just pull
out a ready-made plan without much thought about site conditions,''
adds Ken Schroeder, an architect and University of Illinois
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Some community groups and aldermen are fighting back, demanding
new zoning to limit development to single-family homes, imposing
height restrictions and required more parking spaces per new
development.
</P>
<P>
   In the ritzy Gold Coast neighborhood, a preservation group
raised $500,000 on its own to fight off two new high-rises, one of
which would have blocked the sunlight from a cherished playground.
</P>
<P>
   City Planning Commissioner Christopher R. Hill acknowledges that
the city's response has been piecemeal but says it is contemplating
a major rezoning. He argues that the boom has helped make Chicago
more livable, and dismisses the idea that architects are simply
using the same design over and over.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, new zoning will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Pat and Maribeth Lynch moved into a tree-lined
neighborhood of mostly single-family homes on the North Side, a
developer knocked down a one-story building next door and replaced
it with a building four times the size, holding seven condominiums
and two retail spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynchs and community groups protested, but the developer
wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were going to build it regardless of what people said,''
Pat Lynch says. ''They just want to build their buildings and get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the development company's principals, James Matanky, says
he understands residents' concerns but wonders where to draw the
line: ''We're not living in a suburb which requires two acres per
lot. We live in the city of Chicago and as long as you provide a
quality product in the permitted range, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his company tries to accommodate neighbors, ''as long as
it makes economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Matanky's company bought the one-story building for $450,000 and
sold the seven condos for $180,000 to $330,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The boom also has raised concerns about affordability and
stability. As new luxury homes and condos raise property values,
longtime residents feel it in their tax bills. And many are priced
out of the market altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how to fight the capitalist system,'' says
Alderman Ted Matlak, whose ward covers the up-and-coming Bucktown
neighborhood. ''If you can charge $2,000 for an apartment, how can
you expect them to take $200?''

<HEADLINE> Russia Says It Reclaimed Village  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops have surrounded rebels
who seized a village in southern Chechnya and were sweeping the
village's shell-shattered, abandoned homes for militants, the
military said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel sniper fire could be heard from hilltops near
Komsomolskoye, indicating that resistance hadn't been wiped out.
Rebels seized the village a week ago, and Russian warplanes, tanks
and howitzers have been firing on it ever since. Convoys of tanks
and infantry descended on the town Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The military command said Sunday that Komsomolskoye was one of
only two pockets of resistance remaining in the Argun Gorge, a key
mountain pass through southern Chechnya. The other is near the
towns of Selmentauzen and Ulus-Kert -- the site of heavy bombing,
shelling and some ground fighting for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have squeezed the rebels in Komsomolskoye into
the town center, the military command press service said Sunday. A
large group of rebels tried to escape Saturday, but were
''scattered'' by Russian forces, the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels embarrassed the Russian command by seizing
Komsomolskoye from federal control last Sunday. The ensuing week of
battle has razed or damaged nearly every house in town, and almost
all residents have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''The village has been completely destroyed,'' said Zeinab
Salimova, who left Komsomolskoye and joined other refugees in the
neighboring republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its ground campaign in Chechnya in September to
fight Islamic rebels who attacked the neighboring republic of
Dagestan in August. After six months of war, Russian troops control
most of Chechnya. Yet Russia has been unable to rout the militants,
even though Russian troops have greater numbers and superior
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations have criticized the war's high civilian
casualties and expressed concerned over alleged human rights abuses
by Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a delegation from the Council of Europe visited
refugee camps in Ingushetia. The day before, the delegation had
visited the shattered Chechen capital, Grozny, and a Russian
detention camp where inmates allegedly have been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member delegation is investigating the allegations to
determine whether to suspend Russia's membership in the Council of
Europe, the continent's leading human rights body. Lord Judd, head
of the delegation, said Russia must respond to Western concerns to
avoid being suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us will want to see some very convincing progress,
change, between now and the beginning of April,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few refugees were allowed to talk to the visitors. Malika
Madaeva, a 42-year-old from Grozny who has been living in a camp in
Ingushetia for four months, was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was brought, surrounded. None of us could come up to him
and they took him away,'' she said of Judd. ''I wish he could see
what was really happening. How many innocent people were killed,
how much destruction. He was shown what Moscow wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Rally To Support Haider  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Vastly outnumbered by police and opponents, 350
neo-Nazis on Sunday marked the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi
annexation of Austria with a march through central Berlin intended
to show support for a far-right Austrian party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 people were arrested before and during the march,
including several radical leftists who threw stones at neo-Nazis
and police. One officer was hit in the head and taken to a hospital
with a possible concussion, police spokeswoman Gabriele Gedaschke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police used a water cannon repeatedly to disperse
stone-throwers along the march route and at the Brandenburg Gate,
where it ended. But Gedaschke said no serious disturbances or other
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing violence, the city had sought to ban the march,
organized by the extreme-right National Party of Germany under the
motto ''We are one people -- national solidarity with Vienna.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, an appeals court overturned the ban on free
speech grounds.
</P>
<P>
   March organizers said they wanted to protest European Union
sanctions leveled against Austria for including Joerg Haider's
far-right Freedom Party in its new government. Haider's party
campaigned on an anti-immigration platform.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who is stepping down as leader of the party, has
apologized for comments he made in the past that praised aspects of
the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 police were deployed to prevent violence and keep
the neo-Nazis from marching through the politically charged
Brandenburg Gate, where Hitler's troops once staged their
torchlight parades.
</P>
<P>
   The march ended instead on the gate's west side, while thousands
of people gathered on the opposite side for a ''Europe without
Racism'' rally featuring music and speeches by Wolfgang Thierse,
president of the German parliament, and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''A strong anti-fascist alliance is the right answer to
extreme-right attacks,'' Thierse told the crowd, calling for ''the
ostracism of racism and intolerance.'' Police estimated the crowd
at the rally at 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's neo-Nazi march was to go through the city's Kreuzberg
district, a heavily Turkish neighborhood that is also a base for
hard-core leftists. It was rerouted by police at the last minute
''to avoid confrontation'' after they found roadblocks erected on
some streets.
</P>
<P>
   Turks are the largest minority in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Before the march began, 10 people were arrested on charges such
as displaying banned Nazi symbols or uniforms. Five people from the
''Anti-fascist Action Berlin'' were arrested for violating public
assembly laws. Several stone-throwers were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, some 500 neo-Nazis were allowed through the gate
during a protest against plans to erect a national Holocaust
memorial nearby. It was believed to be the first neo-Nazi march
through the gate since the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Lamarr Includes Local Cop in Will  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- When screen legend Hedy Lamarr died, she
left her stamp collection to her 11-year-old grandson, her estate
to her children, and $83,000 to a police officer who occasionally
ran errands for her.
</P>
<P>
   Lamarr, who starred in films including ''Tortilla Flat'' and
''Samson and Delilah'' and was once billed as the world's most
beautiful woman, died Jan. 19 at age 86.
</P>
<P>
   Her will was filed Friday in Seminole County Circuit Court, and
it contained a few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lamarr's son and daughter, the list of those she
picked to share her wealth included her personal secretary, a
California engineer she had never met and Altamonte Springs Police
Lt. Chuck Stansel.
</P>
<P>
   Stansel met Lamarr late in her life while delivering a message
and befriended her after she called him to request an errand. His
family eventually became regular guests at Lamarr's home, helping
her shop for groceries and visiting the Austrian-born actress at
least twice a week.

<HEADLINE> Aid To Be Rushed to Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Aid officials said Sunday they plan to
rush seed along with emergency food supplies to thousands of flood
victims, most of them poor farmers, to help them rebuild their
lives and reduce their reliance on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   With most crops in southern and central Mozambique destroyed by
the surging waters that struck last month, officials focused on the
next planting in late April. They hope by the next harvest four
months later, subsistence farmers and their families will once
again be able to feed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't start getting seeds to the farmers now, they will
miss the September harvest and we will have to support them until
April 2001,'' said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization estimates the deluge
that engulfed central and southern Mozambique a month ago, and
surged again two weeks later, wiped out 10,000 hectares of maize,
rice and bean fields and thousands of head of cattle. Some 80
percent of Mozambique's 20 million people survive by farming.
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter million people are temporarily housed in 96
makeshift, mostly squalid, muddy camps in central and southern
Mozambique. Fearing more flooding from heavy rains forecast in the
next 10 days, authorities have urged flood survivors not to return
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed number of dead from flooding grew to 492 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the floodwaters have receded, more bodies have been pulled
from the mud,'' said Antonio Machere, spokesman for Mozambique's
National Institute for Crisis Management, adding that he expected
the number to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a second complete day of sunny weather on Sunday
allowed aid groups to ferry at least 100 tons of aid to camps for
displaced people on the southern bank of the Limpopo River,
according to Machere.
</P>
<P>
   Aid organizations said the clear weekend weather helped them
make up for time lost during three preceding days of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been moving not just food but water purification
equipment and shelter items like plastic sheeting ... it has been
the best couple of days we have had recently,'' said Ian Macleod of
UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   However, Macleod warned that storms forecast for the next few
days in the waterlogged central region, where the Save River burst
its banks, could once again stall aid efforts. The south, including
the sodden Limpopo River valley, was forecast to remain dry.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Mozambican city of Palmeira, U.S. soldiers loaded
2.5 tons of clothes aboard a helicopter for delivery 45 miles north
to Xai-Xai.
</P>
<P>
   Aid efforts are heavily dependent on helicopters, which are an
expensive and inefficient way to deliver food. The helicopters
currently being used, supplied mostly by the militaries of several
Western nations, can carry only a few tons of food per trip.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is examining how to speed up road
repairs, which would allow trucks carrying up to 20 tons of food to
reach the camps.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 59 aircraft are taking part in the aid operation and
more than 2,200 international personnel are in Mozambique. About
half are from foreign militaries, including the United States,
Germany, Britain, Spain and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Floods Add to Mozambique's Hardship  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- If there were a competition to
determine which country had suffered the greatest misfortunes,
beleaguered Mozambique would surely be a strong medal contender.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's flooding, which turned much of southern Mozambique
into a vast muddy lake, was merely the latest calamity to befall
the southeast African nation with a long history of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   The list of woes seems interminable: centuries of subjugation
under Portuguese colonial rule, 17 years of civil war, a president
killed in a suspicious 1986 plane crash, unpredictable weather that
swings between drought and flooding, periodic outbreaks of cholera
and the constant threat of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   The latest catastrophe was particularly cruel because Mozambique
was enjoying at least a small taste of economic success following
the long civil war that ended in 1992 and left the country among
the poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country was just beginning to see the light of day,'' said
Jackie D'Almeida, 45, who heads the country's effort to remove land
mines left from the war. ''Now it seems like we are regressing
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The floods devastated the impoverished villages in central and
southern Mozambique, where the typical resident is a subsistence
farmer who counts himself lucky if he earns as much as a dollar a
day.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million of the country's 20 million people now need aid,
and many are living in cramped camps, their homes and possessions
washed away by the churning waters of the Limpopo and Save rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The national economy had been growing at nearly 10 percent a
year, and the evidence is visible on the streets of Maputo, the
once gracious capital city that had lapsed into deep decay during
the long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, South African tourists head for the tropical islands just
off the Indian Ocean coast, and feast on oversized shrimp. New
boutiques offer imported goods and add a splash of color to the
previously glum commercial district. In the sultry evenings,
there's a waiting list at the outdoor cafes along the city's broad
avenues.
</P>
<P>
   D'Almeida, the mine clearer, has lived an eventful life that
reflects the country's many troubles. As a young man in the early
1970s, he was jailed for planting a bomb in his fight against
Portuguese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese spent nearly 500 years in Mozambique, but aside
from some stately colonial architecture, they left the country
largely undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   When they fled in a rush in 1975, newly independent Mozambique
had only a handful of college graduates and almost no doctors,
teachers or businessmen. Schools and hospitals were scarce, even in
the main cities, and most Mozambicans couldn't read. There was no
one who had experience in running a government.
</P>
<P>
   The country swiftly descended into a savage civil war, and
D'Almeida, by then freed from prison, spent years in the bush as a
government military officer fighting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing, South African-backed insurgents terrorized rural
villages, frequently chopping off ears, noses and lips of their
civilian victims. Villages hit by the rebels weren't hard to
identify -- many residents wore clothes fashioned from tree bark and
occasionally ate fried grasshoppers to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitter war, the former combatants now confine their
quarrels to peaceful debate. Former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama is
now the leading opposition figure, and won 48 percent of the vote
in last December's presidential election. On D'Almeida's
mine-clearing team, 165 of the 500 members are former rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Maputo's street signs still reflect the government's old
socialist ideology -- Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Mao Tse-tung all
have palm-lined avenues bearing their names.
</P>
<P>
   But President Joaquim Chissano, who narrowly won re-election in
December, has been pushing market reforms for nearly a decade.
Mozambique's poverty is still extreme, even by African standards.
Life expectancy is just 42 years, and literacy is only 40 percent,
according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, primarily from South Africa, have been
willing to put their money in Mozambique, however, and the country
has earned praise from international financial organizations for
selling off more than 1,000 state-run companies to private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''International investment and assistance were playing an
important role in developing our economy, and we hope people will
not be deterred by the floods,'' said Foreign Minister Leonardo
Simao, who is working closely with the dozens of aid groups now in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now momentum for helping Mozambique, and we need to
make the best of this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Text of Pope's Forgiveness Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from Day of Pardon Mass at St. Peter's
Basilica on
Sunday, where Roman Catholic leaders asked God's forgiveness for a
host of sins by Catholics throughout history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy confesses sins against the people of
Israel:
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us pray that, in recalling the sufferings endured by the
people of Israel throughout history, Christians will acknowledge
the sins committed by not a few of their number against the people
of the Covenant and the blessings, and in this way will purify
their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Response by Pope John Paul II:
</P>
<P>
   ''God of our fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants to
bring your Name to the Nations: We are deeply saddened by the
behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these
children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we wish to
commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the
Covenant. We ask this through Christ our Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger on ''sins committed in the service of
truth'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us pray that each one of us, looking to the Lord Jesus,
meek and humble of heart, will recognize that even men of the
Church, in the name of faith and morals, have sometimes used
methods not in keeping with the Gospel in the solemn duty of
defending the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Response by the pope:
</P>
<P>
   ''In certain periods of history Christians have at times given
into intolerance and have not been faithful to the great
commandment of love, sullying in this way the face of the Church...
.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Francis Arinze on sins against women and ''the unity of
the human race:''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us pray for women, who are all too often humiliated and
marginalized, and let us acknowledge the forms of acquiescence in
these sins of which Christians too have been guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Response by the pope:
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord God ... at times the equality of your sons and daughters
has not been acknowledged, and Christians have been guilty of
attitudes of rejection and exclusion... .''

<HEADLINE> Fishing groups object to loss of Coast Guard boat at Manasquan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANASQUAN, N.J. (AP) -- The removal of a heavy-surf rescue boat
from the U.S. Coast Guard station at Manasquan has prompted sport
and commercial fishing organizations to forge an unusual alliance
to lobby for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is in the process of replacing its aging fleet
of 44-foot rescue vessels with new, speedier 47-foot boats. Station
Manasquan lost its 44-footer, the only rough-sea rescue boat it
had, in June. But it is not scheduled to get one of the new boats.
</P>
<P>
   That means vessels from Coast Guard stations almost 30 miles
north and south of Manasquan Inlet will have to answer distress
calls once waves reach a height of 8 feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Four commercial and sport-fishing organizations joined in a
letter to members of the New Jersey congressional delegation last
week asking them to seek more money for the Coast Guard budget so
the Manasquan boat can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This endangers the lives of the tens of thousands of boaters
who use this inlet and the surrounding ocean waters,'' the letter
said. ''Quite simply, it is a long ride for a vessel from either
Barnegat or Sandy Hook to come and rescue a sinking vessel off of
Manasquan.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest remaining vessel at Manasquan is a 41-foot utility
boat, but the station commander, Chief Warrant Officer Rob Wyco,
said it is not capable of handling heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't put that boat out in the surf, because it's going to
capsize,'' Wyco told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has five Coast Guard small boat stations -- Sandy
Hook, Manasquan, Barnegat Light, Atlantic City and Cape May -- five
substations and an air station at Atlantic City, where six rescue
helicopters are based.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at Manasquan is symptomatic of ills that plague
the entire Coast Guard as it is asked to take on more assignments
with fewer resources, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Duties include search and rescue, marine safety, environmental
protection, illegal immigration control and drug interdiction. But
the service's active duty contingent of 35,000 has not grown since
the mid-1960s and its budget was cut $400 million between 1994 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Fote, legislative chairman of the Jersey Coast Anglers
Association, said the Manasquan situation is of special concern in
light of the growth of New Jersey's recreational boating industry
and the large fleet of party boats based in the Manasquan and Shark
River inlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about two of the busiest inlets on the Eastern
Seaboard,'' Fote said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lovgren, vice president of the Fishermen's Dock Co-operative
and a director of the Garden State Seafood Association, said the
union of commercial and sport fishermen underlines the urgency of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get the commercial and recreational communities
working together on something, doesn't that say it's important?
We're usually at each other's throats,'' Lovgren said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland, vice
chairman of the House Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
subcommittee, said LoBiondo supports additional funding. But the
issue will have to be addressed during the federal budget
appropriations process just now getting under way, said spokeswoman
Bethany Blankley.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said the decision about where to put the
new rescue boats was made after a careful study of search and
rescue data.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a system we use to decide where to put the boats to
get the best use of them,'' said Cmdr. Dean Lee of the Coast
Guard's Mid-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would we like to have one (47-foot lifeboat) at every station
if we had unlimited funds? Absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> Southern Delaware changing with rush of development  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEWEY BEACH, Del. (AP) -- Just a few steps off the road and black
mud sucks at Bruce Richards' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He is walking along Delaware's Coastal Highway, across from the
resort town of Dewey Beach with its popular bars, shops and seaside
homes. In front of him is a bowl-shaped field of soggy earth, a
marsh with a view of Rehoboth Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that view, and the proximity to the beach, a boggy
wetland has become a hot piece of property. The owner, Richards
said, is entertaining several offers for development.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware's Sussex County, home to resorts like Dewey, Rehoboth
and Bethany beaches, is one of the fastest growing counties in the
Mid-Atlantic region, with developers snapping up open land around
the region's beaches and bays.
</P>
<P>
   The county is issuing building permits at a clip of about 2,000
a year. Construction of new homes and businesses is projected to
develop 37,223 acres over the next 20 years, according to county
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that new construction is expected to take place along
Delaware's beaches, which have long been nicknamed ''The Quiet
Resorts.'' Some are questioning whether the rate of development
will change the area's highly prized -- and quiet -- way of life.
</P>
<P>
   That concern has taken on a name: Americana Bayside.
</P>
<P>
   Carl M. Freeman Associates is proposing to build nearly 2,900
homes on 865 acres west of Fenwick Island, along with an 18-hole
golf course, 200,000 square feet of shops and offices and a grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   The project would take 10 years to complete at a pace of 300
homes a year, said Frank Kea, the Freeman developer overseeing the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a pretty monumental project,'' said Richards, who is
executive director of the Delaware Center for the Inland Bays, an
environmental advocacy group. Richards said the center has taken a
neutral stance on the Americana Bayside project -- so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to seriously impact the character of this area,''
he said. ''The question is, when is enough? I don't have that
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders are flocking to Delaware's beaches like prospectors to
a gold rush. Besides Americana Bayside, another developer is
looking at 1,900 acres of coastline, said Robert Stickels, Sussex
County administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Some here use the word ''inevitable'' when they discuss
development. And there is good reason: With Washington, Baltimore
and Philadelphia ringing the state, and New York City just a ride
up the New Jersey Turnpike, one-third of the nation's people live
within a seven-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Delaware study predicts the population along
Delaware's Atlantic coastline will swell dramatically in the next
20 years. For example, the town of Lewes is anticipated to grow by
56 percent, from 13,628 in 1990 to 21,300 in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ''The land is cheap,'' Stickels said. ''And it's the ocean -- the
ocean is the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Sussex County is expected to grow by 60 percent to more
than 182,000 people by 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of the
Census.
</P>
<P>
   For those who see the onslaught of new building as the end of
Delaware's beaches, Americana Bayside has become a rallying cry.
One of those critics of development is Til Purnell, a
housewife-turned-activist.
</P>
<P>
   When Purnell returned to Delaware in 1976 after her husband
retired from the foreign service, she said she was appalled then at
the rate of beach development. Each year, she said, it gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going on in Sussex County is plundering,'' she said.
''We are the trustees of a way of life, and that's all about our
natural resources. And those resources are getting squandered
without any regard to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell is lobbying state lawmakers to stop the project. State
Sen. George Bunting, a Bethany Democrat, and state Rep. Shirley
Price, a Millville Democrat, have publicly questioned the Americana
Bayside plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kea said it is unfortunate that Americana Bayside has drawn the
negative attention because he believes the project has much to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the project retains 290 acres of open space and
wetlands. He said it would send $66 million into the local economy
in each year of construction, and would pay for upgrades to roads,
sewers and police that would benefit others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Change is hard, and this area is undergoing a lot of change
right now because of the development pressure,'' he said. ''I wish
Bayside wasn't the catalyst of all this, but it seems we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americana Bayside project will be discussed at a Sussex
County zoning hearing April 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''People, landowners, do have a right to do certain kinds of
development,'' said Finley ''Butch'' Jones Jr., president of the
Sussex County Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at serious property rights issues,'' Jones said.
''This county is going to grow, there's no doubt about it.
Everybody wants to go to the beach.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary laughs at show mocking her and Rudy; he reprises drag role  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton passed another
initiation rite in her adopted state, laughing throughout a spoof
on New York politics that made a lot of jokes -- some of them crude
-- at her expense.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican Senate rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was also
roasted during the event staged Saturday night by the Inner Circle,
a group of local political reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor nearly stole the show by staging a rebuttal in
which he appeared in full drag -- blonde wig, dress, makeup. It was
a reprisal of the ''Rudy/Rudia'' role he first performed in 1997,
inspired by the Broadway musical ''Victor/Victoria.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and first lady also met for the first time since she
began campaigning here over a year ago. They shook hands and
exchanged pleasantries when she entered the room, but when she
walked away he turned to reporters and said: ''I'm very, very
encouraged that we are drawing a lot of out-of-towners to this
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   During intermission, they bumped into each other backstage as
they greeted the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear you're the star,'' Clinton told the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gonna see, we're gonna see,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to see it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor sat with his aides and actor Danny Aiello, and Clinton
sat two tables away with Daily News publisher Mort Zuckerman.
Clinton's campaign manager Bill deBlasio was seated at the same
table as Giuliani's campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   The show is renowned for its rollicking tastelessness and
outrageous jokes. One gag featured the Hillary character taking a
subway to Shea Stadium in Queens ''where I can watch my favorite
team, the New York Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   When a rider explained that the Yankees actually play in the
Bronx in Yankee Stadium, Hillary answered: ''Sorry ... We live in
Chappaqua now, you know. That's Indian for 'The Land of Separate
Bedrooms.' '' Clinton laughed heartily at the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Her character then asked for directions to Times Square, adding:
''My husband wants me to pick up a few things for him at the Virgin
Megastore.'' Clinton grimaced slightly but maintained her good
humor, smiling and applauding throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   As she got up at intermission, she remarked with a laugh, ''I'm
still standing.'' Asked backstage, ''Are you enjoying yourself?''
she said, ''I am!''
</P>
<P>
   The show's plot featured a hapless Hillary being hauled off to
jail for campaigning in Times Square, while Rudy picked on homeless
people. President Clinton showed up, but instead of bailing out his
wife, he sprung Jennifer Lopez and left Hillary in the slammer with
rap mogul Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's elaborate rebuttal included a live stage show with
the cast of ''Saturday Night Fever,'' and videotaped skits based on
five musicals.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Rudia'' skit, the mayor spritzed his ample faux bosom
with perfume only to have Donald Trump -- the real Donald Trump --
sniff it, then bury his head in it. Then, as Rudia pondered which
hat to buy, comedienne Joan Rivers -- again, the real Rivers -- began
shrieking:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you think you are, Hillary Clinton? Can't you make your
mind up about anything?''
</P>
<P>
   In his ''Damn Yankees'' skit, the mayor donned a baseball
uniform and told team owner George Steinbrenner that he's not sure
he wants to run for Senate. ''I want to manage the Yankees,'' he
confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe Torre's job?'' Steinbrenner responded. ''But he's doing a
great job!''
</P>
<P>
   ''Between me and you, George, I think the team was a little
shaky last year,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage Clinton met the reporter who portrayed her, Sheila
Stainback, a Court TV anchor who had donned a wig with poufy blonde
hair for her act but told Clinton she panicked after seeing a photo
of the first lady voting early on Primary Day with her hair
straight and unstyled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Oh my God,' I've got to comb this wig down,''
Stainback said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was just, jump out of bed and try to vote on time,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This looks a little like it, right?'' Stainback asked,
gesturing to the wig.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like it!'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met Zenia Mucha, top aide to New York's Republican
Gov. George Pataki. Former mayor Ed Koch introduced the first lady
to Mucha, calling them ''the two most powerful women in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The $400-a-head black tie dinner at the New York Hilton benefits
homeless shelters, soup kitchens, educational programs and other
local charities.

<HEADLINE> Parents of murdered girl continue to lobby lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Janice Grieshaber remembers being a typical
suburban ''PTA mom'' before her daughter Jenna was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after the tragedy, she and her husband Bruce
are among the most prominent advocates for crime victims at the
state Capitol. The Syracuse-area couple is now a potent political
force.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing Bruce and I have learned is that when something bad
happens in your life -- and bad things can happen to anybody -- the
best way to deal with it is to empower yourself by facing it,''
Janice said.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy the Grieshabers face daily is the November 1997
beating death of their 22-year-old daughter in her Albany apartment
at the hands of a parolee. The couple made a decision soon after to
channel their private grief in an unusually public way.
</P>
<P>
   The Grieshabers became tireless lobbyists for a law to curtail
parole for violent felons. They are credited with pressuring the
Democratic-led state Assembly back to the state Capitol in the
summer of 1998 to pass ''Jenna's Law,'' named in honor of their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their lobbying, the Grieshabers created a
not-for-profit foundation for nonviolence named for Jenna. The
foundation's goal is to help crime victims and eradicate the
sources of violence. The couple says all this work is for Jenna --
they are determined that she never be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a decision to become parents and that doesn't end when
your child's life ends,'' Janice said. ''We're still Jenna's
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice, 50, gave up her job teaching children with special needs
to counsel victims and coordinate help through the foundation.
Bruce, 53, kept his job in the insurance business but routinely
gives speeches during lunch hours and after work. Their daughter
Erica also is involved and helped out with a fundraising concert in
Albany last week.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also is involved in a mentoring program. And it
distributes to needy and neglected children a book called ''Old
Turtle,'' a copy of which was found in Jenna's apartment. The
dreamy fable about God and acceptance was one the young nursing
student would read over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a real part of Jenna's life,'' said Bruce, noting that
the book is now touching other lives.
</P>
<P>
   And the Grieshabers remain familiar faces at the state Capitol.
Building on their success with Jenna's Law, they are now seeking
passage of a bill that would make it easier to convict and keep sex
offenders in prison.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference in support of the bill staged last week
by Assembly Republicans, lawmakers huddled around the Grieshabers
as they walked in, waiting for a chance to say hello and shake
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Assembly Minority Leader John Faso believes Jenna's
Law would not have passed without the Grieshaber's work.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia County Republican explains their success like this:
''They're straightforward, they're honest, they're committed and
they're tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grieshabers freely admit that their work for Jenna has taken
over their lives. But they see it as a good thing. Janice said all
the people they talk to and help makes them stronger. And as their
faces have become more well known, more people talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   They realize there is whispered criticism that they have allowed
politicians and the press to exploit their status as victims. But
Janice says: ''We just laugh. Don't tell me we don't use you
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the point. They believe they need the press and the
politicians to get help them change the system, for Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be at this forever and ever ...'' said Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Being a thorn in people's sides,'' Janice concluded.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard: Safety crackdown already saving lives  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) -- Halfway into a six-month program to make
sure commercial fishing vessels are safe, the Coast Guard is
reporting a decrease in the number of lives lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Seven lives have been lost so far this winter, according to
statistics compiled by Coast Guard offices throughout the East
Coast, Gulf of Mexico and Great Lakes region in December, January
and February.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with 22 deaths during the same period last year,
and 13 in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard believes at least some of the decrease can be
attributed to Operation Safe Catch, in which inspectors seek out
high-risk boats and keep them in port until they are repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting word out to fishermen that you need to have the
right safety equipment, you have to know how to use it and you have
to be conscious of the stability of your vessel,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
John Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Coast Guard's Atlantic Area
Command, based in Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of fatalities has been cut, the number of lost
boats is about the same: 17 so far this winter, 19 in the same
period last year and 15 in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates that regulations focus more on surviving an
accident than preventing one, the Coast Guard said. Though
inspectors encourage fishermen to correct hazardous conditions
discovered during a voluntary dockside exam, they have no way to
compel compliance, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Operation Safe Catch, inspectors board boats at sea, which
they are entitled to do, and ask for permission to board vessels in
port. They check immersion suits, survival rafts, distress signals,
emergency position indicating radio beacons, fire extinguishers,
high-water alarms, hull integrity, damaged hoses and overloading of
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 82,000 commercial fishing vessels within the Atlantic
Area Command, the Coast Guard so far has identified 592 as
high-risk vessels. They either were in poor condition with
inadequate safety equipment, had a history of repeated calls for
rescue or engaged in higher-risk activities such as one-person
operations far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fisherman John Fernandez III said Operation Safe
Catch is a good idea and seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only ones that don't (support it) are true idiots,'' said
Fernandez, who owns two shrimp boats that operate in the Gulf of
Mexico and a scallop boat based in Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez added that it can get expensive to comply with safety
regulations to carry items such as life rafts, but said, ''You just
have to bite the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Safe Catch will run until May 31. The Coast Guard then
will analyze the operation to decide whether to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Safe Catch was prompted in part by a rash of fatal
clam boat sinkings in early 1999, including two off the New Jersey
coast that claimed eight lives.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Voters Reject New Initiatives  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Voters in Switzerland, which accounts for an
estimated half of the world's national ballot questions,
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal Sunday to speed up the
referendum process.
</P>
<P>
   In nationwide balloting on a wide range of measures, voters also
threw out proposals to halve road traffic, ban in vitro
fertilization and introduce quotas for women in parliament and
other public jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout of 41 percent was average for this small Alpine
nation. Voters in Switzerland's 26 cantons (states) voted against
every proposal except an uncontroversial one sponsored by the
government to simplify the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of voters -- or 1.33 million people -- handed a
clear defeat to the proposal for ''the acceleration of direct
democracy,'' sponsored by the head of a discount supermarket chain
and with right-wing political backing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters have once again shown their political maturity and ...
weren't taken in by misleading arguments,'' Justice Minister Ruth
Metzler said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Swiss rules, 100,000 signatures on a petition prompt a
referendum to introduce a new law, and 50,000 signatures can
challenge a proposed government law.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would have imposed a 12-month limit between the
time a petition is submitted to the government and the actual
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Around 30 proposals are currently under government or
parliamentary consideration and in the long line for voting. The
initiative's backers said proposals are too often put on a back
burner for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities argued the 12-month cap would cripple any meaningful
debate, thus weakening democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Radical plans to ban fertilization outside the body and the use
of donor sperm were opposed by 72 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the proposal for ''procreation that respects human
dignity'' argued their campaign at least opened a debate on the
subject. But Metzler described the vote as a show of ''solidarity
with childless couples.''

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Hold National Elections  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spaniards on Sunday chose between
conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party and
Joaquin Almunia's Socialists in a general election that revolved
around economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls gave Aznar and his Popular Party a lead of 4
to 5 percentage points over the Socialists. If the polls reflect
the final result, Aznar would once again fall short of an outright
majority in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies and need to form a
coalition. Voters were also choosing 208 senators.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 police and Civil Guards provide security
across the country amid fears of violence by the Basque separatist
group ETA, which has staged three car bombings since ending a
14-month truce in December.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported from the Basque country or elsewhere
Sunday. Initial results were expected late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, a 47-year-old former tax inspector, is seeking another
four-year term on the strength of an economy that grew 3.7 percent
last year. The jobless rate has dropped from a staggering 23
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He took office in 1996 after unseating Socialist Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, who had governed for nearly 14 years and whose
fall was mostly blamed on corruption scandals that tainted his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Socialists are led by Almunia, 51, a former
cabinet minister who claims Spain's economic bonanza has benefited
mainly the wealthy, in particular business people close to Aznar.
He wants to impose a one-time windfall tax on former state-owned
companies and earmark the money for pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to galvanize leftist forces, his party has struck an
alliance with the communist-dominated United Left, Spain's third
largest party, which for years had accused the Socialists of being
centrist sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Aznar sought support from regional center-right
nationalist parties in the Basque country and Catalonia to form
government.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins this time, Aznar is again expected to have to seek a
deal with the Catalans. His party has fallen out with moderate
Basques over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was overshadowed by three car bomb deaths blamed on
the armed Basque group ETA. Both Aznar and Almunia reject ETA's
separatist goals, so the Basque conflict has not been a major issue
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's political allies, Euskal Herritarrok, which has two seats
from 1996 called on its supporters to boycott Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, blamed for nearly 800 deaths in its campaign for an
independent Basque nation, called a cease-fire in September 1998.
The peace process fell apart after a single round of talks.

<HEADLINE> UAE: Oil Boost Consensus Is Unclear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Following a meeting with
his Iranian counterpart, United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Obaid
bin Saif al-Nasseri said Sunday it was not clear whether a
consensus existed within OPEC on raising production at the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the time being, it is not clear whether we've reached a
consensus (on raising production). But OPEC will always make the
right decision, and that decision will be made on March 27,'' when
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in
Vienna, al-Nasseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said before meeting
with al-Nasseri that more discussions were needed before making a
decision on output.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much and when we increase production depends on more
consultations,'' Zanganeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on recent U.S. statements that the market needs
a supply increase of 2.5 million barrels a day, al-Nasseri said,
''We are consulting with our colleagues (from OPEC) and we are
trying to reach an agreement on the level of production the market
needs. It is wrong to determine a figure before the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said all options were still open on whether to maintain or
increase current output.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Zanganeh said in Oman that no agreement had been
reached about raising OPEC oil production.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters upon arrival in Oman that the decision on
raising output cannot be taken by any individual country but will
have to be made by all 11 OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
   Zanganeh has been visiting oil producers ahead of the OPEC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Following a brief meeting with his Omani counterpart, Mohammed
al-Rumhi, Zanganeh said his talks were mainly aimed at coordinating
positions and exchanging views ahead of the forthcoming meeting in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   He said Iran's current position is that it supports an extension
of the ongoing OPEC production cut, which expires at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to define any figures for the size of increase
at the present time,'' he said. ''We aren't taking any final stance
with yes or no, and all these ongoing talks between OPEC countries
revolve around exchanging our views to reach an appropriate
decision at OPEC's next meeting,'' Zanganeh said.
</P>
<P>
   In agreements signed in 1998 and 1999, non-OPEC Oman joined OPEC
and non-OPEC producers in removing about 5 million barrels a day
from the market through March 31, 2000, to boost oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, crude has surged from $10.72 a barrel on Dec. 10,
1998 to a nine-year high of $34.20 in trading Tuesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Zanganeh's comments, Iran, generally a price hawk, has
recognized that the international oil market currently needs more
supplies. Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer, has indicated it
wants to increase production to lower the prices.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement following a meeting between Zanganeh and his
Saudi counterpart, Ali Naimi, in Riyadh Wednesday called for the
need for ''timely oil supplies'' to ensure market stability.
</P>
<P>
   That was taken as a strong indication Iran was on board to agree
to a rise in OPEC production at the Vienna meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Iran and the United Arab Emirates are major oil producers with
output quotas of 3.359 million barrels per day and 2 million
barrels per day respectively.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Misses Mass Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An ailing Cardinal John O'Connor skipped Mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday because he was too weak to
attend, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor remained at his residence, and planned to celebrate
Mass at home, said the spokesman, Joseph Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's feeling very weak,'' Zwilling said. ''He gets up and does
some things but he's very limited in what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, recuperating from brain tumor surgery he underwent
last year, attended last week's Mass but did not deliver his usual
homily. He missed Mass the week before.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's poor health prevented him from celebrating Mass on
Ash Wednesday, and it's unclear whether he will be on the church
steps overlooking Fifth Avenue during the St. Patrick's Day parade,
as is his custom.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal is expected to retire as soon as Pope John Paul II
names his successor as Archbishop of New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Rodolfo Garcia, an Associated Press
reporter who helped chronicle Nicaragua's emergence out of civil
war, a papal visit, volcanoes and floods, died in Managua after a
long illness. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia joined The Associated Press office in Managua in 1986
after working for Radio Nicaragua, where he was director of
short-wave broadcasts, and after helping found a local news agency,
Agencia de Noticias Nueva Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   For the AP, he covered the war between the Sandinista government
and Contra rebels, the Sandinistas' loss of power at the ballot box
and the country's sometimes turbulent effort to put years of war
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   He also reported on volcanic eruptions, the 1996 visit of Pope
John Paul II and the ravages of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush and Gore running even in NJ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush are off to an even start in New Jersey, according to a poll
that also indicates the two will have to court a large group of
voters who are either undecided between them or dissatisfied with
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, was favored by
39 percent of those surveyed in the latest Star-Ledger/Eagleton
Poll, released Sunday. Bush, the probable Republican nominee, was
favored by 36 percent. The poll's margin of error of plus-or-minus
4 percentage points puts the pair in a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also indicates considerable skepticism about both
men. Thirteen percent of those surveyed said they were undecided
between Gore and Bush. And 12 percent said they would vote for
neither candidate or would like to vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted with 626 registered voters between Feb.
28 and March 9, the day after the Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state starts off the general election campaign as a
toss-up, with a large number of voters open to persuasion,'' said
poll director Cliff Zukin. The findings indicate neither candidate
has a ''strong mooring'' in New Jersey, Zukin added.
</P>
<P>
   The findings significantly differ from surveys in the last two
presidential elections at similar points in those campaigns. For
example, 9 percent of those surveyed in June 1996 said they were
undecided and 2 percent said they would vote for someone other than
the major party nominees, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   And in April 1992, when the choices were Clinton and President
Bush, 7 percent said they were undecided and 1 percent said they
would vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Independents, who make up about 56 percent of registered voters
in the state, are split in opinion, according to the poll.
Thirty-four percent prefer Bush, while 31 percent say they would
vote for Gore, a statistical dead heat. Sixteen percent of
independents said they are undecided, while 19 percent said they
don't like either candidate or are looking for another choice.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Jahn, a retired preschool teacher from Princeton, said
she is among those who are not terribly satisfied with the choice
being offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think George Bush is intelligent enough. I think he
doesn't have the ability to see things through from the start to
the finish,'' said Jahn, 67. ''Gore is not terribly interesting and
doesn't capture my imagination.''

<HEADLINE> Chief Rabbi Wants Holocaust Apology  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's chief rabbi said Sunday he was
''deeply frustrated'' by Pope John Paul II's failure to mention the
Holocaust in his appeal for forgiveness for the sins of Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Israel Meir Lau joined other Israelis in expressing hope
that the pope omitted the Holocaust from Sunday's service only
because he is planning a specific apology during his Holy Land
pilgrimage next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''To mention the Inquisition from the year 1492 and to exclude
the Wannsee conference from 1942 demonstrates a severely warped
view of history,'' Lau said in a statement. Wannsee Lake in Berlin
is where the Nazis planned the elimination of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Jewish leaders do not directly blame the church for
the Holocaust, the systematic murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis
and their allies during the 1939-45 German occupation of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the role some Catholics played in helping to carry out
the genocide, the church's silence, and the ideological succor the
Nazis drew from the church's voluminous anti-Jewish doctrines --
most repudiated only in the years after the Holocaust -- have led to
deep-seated skepticism of Vatican statements among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   During the service at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the
pope referred to the Jews in a prayer: ''We are deeply saddened by
the behavior of those who in the course of history have caused
these children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we
wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau emphasized that he welcomed such statements. He said they
led him to hope that the pope was reserving his Holocaust apology
for his visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope deeply that the pope of today, whom I appreciate very
much for his doings and for his condemning anti-Semitism, will
complete the asking of forgiveness next week in Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem,'' Lau told Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   The director of Yad Vashem also said he was moved by John Paul's
words -- but that he expected more next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to pay tribute and commemorate the remembrance of the
Holocaust and I know that he is going to address'' it, Avner Shalev
said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is getting very positive press in Israel, with stories
appearing in newspapers each day about the warm relations he has
enjoyed with the Jews dating back to his youth in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Maariv daily related how, as a priest, John Paul
persuaded a Catholic couple not to baptize a Jewish orphan in their
care, instead urging them to track down his relatives. Yediot
Ahronot interviewed survivors from his boyhood town, Wadowice, who
will greet him at Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, who led the delicate negotiations with the
Vatican before the establishment of ties with Israel in 1994, noted
that the pope has often emphasized the church's responsibility for
past persecutions of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's statement Sunday was ''an added incentive and
guidance for Christians to behave today differently from the way
they did in the past, and I think from that perspective, the Jewish
people should welcome these kind of statements,'' Rosen said. But
he added that he too hopes the pope will be ''more direct'' next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that it would be a while before the book is
closed in Jewish-Catholic relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may one day forgive the church for what it did to us,''
said Yosef ''Tommy'' Lapid, a Holocaust survivor who heads a
populist party.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Plans Women Status Changes  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of Muslim
fundamentalists and representatives of women's groups took to the
streets of two Moroccan cities on Sunday, holding opposing rallies
over a government plan to give women more rights.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which would offer women greater educational
opportunities and help those going through divorce, drew what
observers estimated to be at least 500,000 fundamentalists to
Casablanca in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We defend Islam with our bodies and souls,'' the crowds
chanted as they marched -- men and women in separate columns --
through downtown Casablanca under the eyes of police and soldiers.
''Men and women are equal before God,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalists, some crying ''Allah Akbar'' (God is great)
and holding aloft the Koran, the Muslim holy book, denounced the
plan as ''anti-Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Casablanca march drew some 200,000 people,
but observers said more than double that number attended the rally,
which was supported by the Justice and Spirituality movement of
Abdesslam Yassine.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital city of Rabat, just north of Casablanca, between
200,000 and 300,000 people representing women's groups, human
rights movements and political parties marched in support of the
plan, some chanting, ''No to reactionaries.'' At least six
government ministers took part in the march, which ended with a
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the plan would fully replace the practice of
repudiation, or automatic divorce by a husband, with court divorces
and provide for equal division of money and property. It would also
support a literacy program for rural Moroccan women, 60 percent of
whom are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan has sharply divided Moroccans in the year
since it was unveiled in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabat march had long been planned to roughly coincide with
International Women's Day, celebrated last Wednesday. Then, last
week, Muslim fundamentalists announced their own plans for a
countermarch.
</P>
<P>
   Yassine has been under house arrest outside Rabat for a decade,
but his movement has grown increasingly vocal since King Mohammed
VI took the throne following the death of his father, King Hassan
II, last July.
</P>
<P>
   The new monarch has moved quickly to bring a variety of social
and human rights reforms to his kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Popular Party Favored in Spain Vote  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spaniards on Sunday chose between
conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party and
Joaquin Almunia's Socialists in a general election that revolved
around economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   After the polls closed, the Eco-Consulting exit poll for Spanish
National Television gave the Popular Party 41.6 percent of the
vote, against 34.6 percent for the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's party would win between 168 and 172 seats in Parliament,
compared to 156 it had in the outgoing legislature. The exit poll
gave the Socialists between 130 and 134 seats, down from 141.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Popular Party has won this election,'' said Mariano Rajoy,
the party's campaign manager. ''The Spanish people have given us
broad support to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists were quick to point out that exit polls have
erred in the past, while other political groups criticized the
Popular Party for claiming victory while official counting had yet
to begin.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls are confirmed, the Popular Party would once again
fall short of an outright majority in the 350-seat Congress of
Deputies and need to strike a deal with a smaller party. Voters
were also choosing 208 senators.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 police and Civil Guards provided security
across the country amid fears of violence by the Basque separatist
group ETA, which has staged three car bombings since ending a
14-month truce in December.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported from the Basque country or elsewhere
Sunday. Initial results were expected late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, a 47-year-old former tax inspector, is seeking another
four-year term on the strength of an economy that grew 3.7 percent
last year. The jobless rate has dropped from a staggering 23
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He took office in 1996 after unseating Socialist Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, who had governed for nearly 14 years and whose
fall was mostly blamed on corruption scandals that tainted his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Socialists are led by Almunia, 51, a former
cabinet minister who claims Spain's economic bonanza has benefited
mainly the wealthy, in particular business people close to Aznar.
He wants to impose a one-time windfall tax on former state-owned
companies and earmark the money for pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to galvanize leftist forces, his party has struck an
alliance with the communist-dominated United Left, Spain's third
largest party, which for years had accused the Socialists of being
centrist sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Aznar sought support from regional center-right
nationalist parties in the Basque country and Catalonia to form
government.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins this time, Aznar is again expected to have to seek a
deal with the Catalans. His party has fallen out with moderate
Basques over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was overshadowed by three car bomb deaths blamed on
the armed Basque group ETA. Both Aznar and Almunia reject ETA's
separatist goals, so the Basque conflict has not been a major issue
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's political allies, Euskal Herritarrok, which has two seats
from 1996 called on its supporters to boycott Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, blamed for nearly 800 deaths in its campaign for an
independent Basque nation, called a cease-fire in September 1998.
The peace process fell apart after a single round of talks.

<HEADLINE> Albright Aide: Stop Kosovo Violence  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) --Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's spokesman chastised Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders
Sunday for failing to contain violence, warning that Western
determination to help them is weakening because of constant attacks
on minority Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told Kosovo's leaders
that their Western allies were disheartened in their inability -- or
unwillingness -- to stem ethnically motivated attacks and curb
rampant criminality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply disappointed by the failure of Kosovo Albanian
leaders in all aspects of Kosovar Albanian life ... to make hard
decisions -- to alienate their friends,'' Rubin said. ''It's one
thing to fight your enemies, but true leadership comes when you can
confront your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that with every attack on Serbs or other
non-Albanians, ''our determination to help Kosovo weakens.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest violence, NATO peacekeepers rushed Sunday to the
Serb village of Suvi Do after unknown assailants raked the
settlement with gunfire at about noon. No one was hurt in the
10-minute barrage, Serb sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is visiting the province at a time of new tensions in
Kosovska Mitrovica, one of the few Kosovo cities in which a
significant Serb population still remains. Recent attempts by NATO
to repatriate ethnic Albanian refugees to the largely Serb northern
part of the city have prompted riots.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers have also expressed alarm about a recent surge
of violence just outside Kosovo's administrative boundary in
southern Serbia, where a new group of ethnic Albanian militants has
emerged to fight what they describe as harassment by Serb police
forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO's top general in Kosovo, German Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, promised that Kosovo's borders would be further
fortified to prevent the export of weapons or fighters to help
ethnic kin.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's mission takes advantage of the ties he developed last
year with leading politicians of the former Kosovo Liberation Army,
the militant ethnic Albanian group that battled Serb forces loyal
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   He met with Ibrahim Rugova, the president of Kosovo's largest
political party, and with Hashim Thaci, the former political leader
of Kosovo's rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is scheduled to visit a family in the western city of
Djakovica that has six male family members still missing, months
after the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Milosevic's government rounded up
ethnic Albanian civilians during the final days of the NATO air
campaign and transported them out of the province to be used as
bargaining chips in any negotiations on Kosovo's future. Kosovo's
Albanians say there will never be peace in the province without a
full accounting of the missing and those held in prisons in Serbia
proper.

<HEADLINE> Priest Not Charged in Egypt Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A Coptic priest who was among about 160
people being investigated for their alleged role in Egypt's worst
communal violence in decades has been exonerated due to lack of
evidence, Egypt's State Security Prosecutor said in a report
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Father Gabriel Abdel-Masih, along with at least 15 others,
escaped charges for the Dec. 31-Jan 2 violence in the southern
Egyptian towns of el-Kusheh and Dar el-Salam. Twenty-three people
died, mostly Christians, after riots erupted following an argument
between a Muslim customer and a Christian shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Saraya's report, released a day after Egypt's chief
prosecutor charged 136 people for the violence, said the accused
were being referred to criminal court in Assiut, 180 miles south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The charges ranged from murder, grand theft and looting to
arson, destruction of property and ownership of an unlicensed
weapon, the report said. Many of the charges carry the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 people, including Father Abdel-Masih, were not
charged due to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Saraya's office earlier had accused Abdel-Masih of ''leading a
gang which attacked a section of the population, a criminal
conspiracy to kill and destroy properties, attempted murder and
possession of firearms.'' The priest said he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Christians, who are mostly Orthodox Copts, comprise 10
percent of the country's 64 million people and have generally lived
peacefully with the overwhelmingly Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   A Saturday report from Chief Prosecutor Maher Abdel-Wahed's
office said the violence had not been religiously motivated, and
that ''no religious clergymen or fanatics or defendants of any
political affiliation'' have been charged.
</P>
<P>
   El-Kusheh came to world attention in 1998 when its Christian
residents accused police of widespread torture during a murder
investigation. The government denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egypt has released 2,040 prisoners, including 840
affiliated with Islamic militant groups, to mark this week's
Islamic Eid al-Adha holiday, the Interior Ministry announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The militants released included a large number of Islamic Jihad
members, who were pardoned for the first time in 10 years, said
lawyer Saad Hassab Allah. Also set free were members of al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, whose leaders have called for a
cease-fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eid amnesty also extended to 1,200 criminals who had served
more than half of their sentences with good conduct, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported. Muslim countries often pardon prisoners
at the beginning of the Eid, Islam's most important holiday.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Gov.: GOP Must Court Moderates  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANALAPAN, Fla. (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman said
Sunday that the GOP must convince voters that the extreme right
wing of the party does not represent the whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality for us is we have to convince enough of the
American people, especially those who are in the center, that our
party shares their concerns and shares their ideas,'' she said at a
meeting of the Washington-based based Republican Leadership
Council. ''There is no time to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman accused Democrats of portraying the party as one that
has forgotten its roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what Al Gore and the Democrats want to do ... persuade
people that the Republican party has left them,'' she said. ''This
year our biggest challenge is to make sure this tactic doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The RLC, formed in 1997 by moderate Republican leaders, supports
candidates who are fiscally conservative but socially inclusive.
Michigan Gov. John Engler, Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and Florida
Rep. Mark Foley were among those who attended the three-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever captures the center is going to find themselves the
victor,'' said Mark Miller, the council's executive director. The
RLC does not officially endorse candidates, though many on the
council have publicly endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Former Maine Gov. John McKernan, Bush's New England regional
chairman, said Bush needs to choose a running mate who will appeal
to the large groups of independents and moderate Democrats who
voted for rival John McCain, who suspended his campaign last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is absolutely crucial that Governor Bush chooses
someone'' who is a centrist reformer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida's presidential primary approaching on Tuesday, Bush
and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
were campaigning in the state over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended the annual strawberry festival in Plant City, near
Tampa, on Sunday. Gore planned a health care event in Miami on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she is confident Bush will win in November, but is
concerned that the Democratic Party will ''demonize'' the GOP by
focusing on the so-called extreme right wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   She said Bush can appeal to the party as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush is not a dummy,'' said Whitman, an abortion rights
supporter and Bush backer who also has been mentioned as a possible
vice presidential candidate. ''He knows he needs to appeal to the
moderates. He knows what he needs to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Bush is anti-mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is far to the right,'' said Chris Lehane, the Gore
campaign's spokesman. ''He is anti-choice, anti-gun control,
anti-patients bill of rights, anti-environment and he's dead wrong
when it comes to his economic policies.''

<HEADLINE> Close Aide to Iran President Shot  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A close confidant of the Iranian president
was shot at close range and seriously wounded Sunday in a shocking
daylight attack reminiscent of last year's killings by vigilantes
who sympathize with Iran's hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian, a pillar of President Mohammed Khatami's
popular reformist movement and a member of Tehran's municipal
council, was rushed to the hospital after a gunman on a
high-powered motorcycle approached and fired at him twice while he
was on his way to work, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   He was hit by one bullet, which remained lodged in the back of
his neck, doctors at the Sina Hospital in Tehran said. At least one
doctor said there was a possibility of permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Majid Ansari, a reformist member of parliament who visited the
hospital late in the afternoon, said Hajjarian was breathing on his
own after being taken off a respirator. Iranian television reported
Sunday night that Hajjarian had regained consciousness. Later,
under tight security, he was wheeled to another hospital building
and could be seen wearing an oxygen mask.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the shooting, dozens of security checkpoints
were set up across Tehran. Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi said
the assailants have been identified, but he did not say who they
were.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our efforts are now under way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's legislative elections, which were swept by
reformists allied to Khatami, Hajjarian angered many of the losing
hard-liners with what they considered provocative statements.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami's 1997 election, vigilantes believed to be allied
with hard-liners have attacked several leading reformists. Many
others have said they received anonymous death threats. Public
anger against the hard-liners mounted after it became known that
''rogue'' Intelligence Ministry agents had killed five dissidents
in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, director general of the Sobh-e-Emrouz daily and a
former deputy intelligence minister, had been clamoring for answers
about those killings and other secret Intelligence Ministry
activities.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, one witness told The Associated Press, two men on a
motorcycle approached Hajjarian outside the municipal council
offices in central Tehran. Both assailants wore helmets. One of
them got off the motorcycle, aimed a handgun at Hajjarian and fired
two shots from less than three feet away, the witness said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a witness,
councilman Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, as saying the assailant
targeted Hajjarian's temple. But the gunman's hand trembled,
Tabatabaei said, and the bullet hit Hajjarian's face.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers rode a 1000 cc motorbike, said Ali Rabiei, the
secretary of Iran's top security body, the Supreme National
Security Council. Only security forces and police can use that
category of motorcycle, while civilians are restricted to 250 cc
engine capacity.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but pro-reform
newspapers and Hajjarian's reformist allies were quick to blame
Islamic hard-liners who have done everything in their power to
oppose reforms initiated by Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, once a hard-liner himself, began to speak out for
freedom of expression and greater political plurality after being
silenced for opposing the eight-year presidency of Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who stepped down in 1997. He later became an adviser to
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hajjarian Terrorized,'' screamed a front-page headline in the
pro-reform Aftab-e-Emrouz daily. Hundreds of supporters, clutching
copies of the newspaper above their heads in a silent protest to
the shooting, waited for hours outside the Sina Hospital in central
Tehran. Some chanted a special Shiite Muslim ''appeal'' prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Khatami Culture Ministry said in a statement that
Hajjarian was targeted by ''opponents of freedom,'' IRNA reported.
''Bullets cannot halt the trend of establishment of democracy in
Iran,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in the central province of Yazd, Khatami condemned
Sunday's attackers as ''terrorists'' who have ''no place among the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every key minister and scores of lesser officials stopped
at the hospital out of respect for Hajjarian. The visits
underscored Hajjarian's status in Khatami's reformist movement.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists' parliament victory last month dealt a serious
blow to the hard-liners trying to preserve the strict Islamic rule
that has been in place since 1979, when the Islamic revolution
installed the rule of the Shiite clergy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a hard-line election supervisory body said it was
canceling results from three constituencies where at least five
reformists won. The announcement by the Guardian Council provoked
protests from residents. The pro-Khatami Interior Ministry called
the Guardian Council's move unfortunate and unreasonable.

<HEADLINE> Whitney museum exhibit sparks family feud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's latest art controversy has turned
into a family feud, with members of the blueblood Whitney clan on
opposing sides over an upcoming exhibit at the Manhattan museum
that bears their name.
</P>
<P>
   Former Whitney Museum of American Art president Flora Miller
Biddle, a granddaughter of museum founder Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney, is defending a piece in the upcoming Whitney Biennial that
drew criticism from another family member.
</P>
<P>
   Biddle and her daughter Fiona Donovan, both museum trustees,
endorsed a piece that links Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to Nazism as ''a
wholly legitimate and powerful artwork'' by an internationally
known artist.
</P>
<P>
   They called it ''regrettable that so many have chosen to lash
out at an artist who has consistently been a voice of social
conscience, and who has been especially critical of the vestiges of
Nazism in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a daughter-in-law and granddaughter of Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney objected to the work by German-born artist Hans
Haacke, saying it was demeaning to victims of the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter-in-law, Marilou Whitney, said she would resign from
the museum's fund-raising committee, cut the institution out of her
will, and divert $1 million she'd planned to give it this year to
the Whitney Gallery of Western Art, in Cody, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Sunday New York Post, she said the Whitney
museum was ''free to associate itself with trash,'' but she did not
want people to mistakenly assume she approved of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't approve of anything that incites hate,'' she told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Gertrude's granddaughters, Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney Conner, sided with Marilou Whitney, calling the Haacke
piece ''a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither branch of the family mentioned the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, part of the prestigious Whitney Biennial, opening
March 23, includes a row of garbage cans, recordings of marching
feet and quoted remarks by Giuliani last fall about a controversial
exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The words appear in a Gothic
typescript commonly used in Nazi-era Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had attacked the Brooklyn exhibit over a painting of
the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung, saying it was
offensive to Roman Catholics. He tried to revoke the museum's
public funding but was overruled by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani criticized the latest show as trivializing the
Holocaust, but acknowledged that as a private museum the Whitney
had no responsibilty to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Whitney director Maxwell Anderson said, ''I
regret any discomfort we may cause supporters of the museum,''
adding that he ''would be saddened'' if it prompted any to resign.

<HEADLINE> Spoofs Target First Lady, Guiliani  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton passed another
initiation rite in her adopted state, laughing throughout a spoof
on New York politics that made a lot of jokes -- some of them crude
-- at her expense.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican Senate rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was also
roasted at the annual event staged by political reporters, but he
nearly stole the show with his own scripted performance in full
drag -- blonde wig, dress, makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's event was the first time the mayor and first
lady had met face-to-face since she began campaigning here over a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries when she entered the
room at the New York Hilton, but when she walked away, he turned to
reporters and said: ''I'm very, very encouraged that we are drawing
a lot of out-of-towners to this performance.''
</P>
<P>
   During intermission, they bumped into each other backstage as
they greeted the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear you're the star,'' Clinton told the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gonna see, we're gonna see,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to see it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual show -- a $400-a-head black tie dinner that benefits
homeless shelters, soup kitchens, educational programs and other
local charities -- is renowned for its rollicking tastelessness and
outrageous jokes.
</P>
<P>
   One gag featured the Hillary character taking a subway to Shea
Stadium ''where I can watch my favorite team, the New York
Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   When a rider explained that the Yankees actually play in Yankee
Stadium, the Hillary character answered: ''Sorry ... We live in
Chappaqua now, you know. That's Indian for 'The Land of Separate
Bedrooms.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laughed heartily at the joke and smiled and applauded
throughout the evening, though she grimaced when her character
asked for directions to Times Square and said: ''My husband wants
me to pick up a few things for him at the Virgin Megastore.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's plot also featured a hapless Hillary being hauled off
to jail for campaigning in Times Square, while the Rudy character
picked on homeless people. President Clinton showed up, but instead
of bailing out his wife, he sprung an actress and left Hillary in
the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton got up from her table during intermission, she
remarked with a laugh: ''I'm still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the event's annual tradition, only the mayor gets a rebuttal
during the show, and Giuliani made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   His elaborate performance included a live stage show with the
cast of ''Saturday Night Fever'' -- with Giuliani doing John
Travolta moves in a white disco suit -- and videotaped skits based
on five musicals.
</P>
<P>
   In the drag skit, ''Rudy/Rudia, ''a take on the musical
''Victor/Victoria,'' the mayor spritzed his ample faux bosom with
perfume only to have Donald Trump -- the real Donald Trump -- sniff
it, then bury his head in it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Rudia pondered which hat to buy, comedienne Joan Rivers
-- again, the real Rivers -- began shrieking:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you think you are? Hillary Clinton? Can't you make your
mind up about anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The skit was a reprise of his 1997 performance at the annual
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's show, the mayor sat with his aides and actor
Danny Aiello, and Clinton sat two tables away with New York Daily
News publisher Mort Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates' campaign managers were seated across the
room -- together.

<HEADLINE> Symington To Face Civil Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK GRAHAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Ousted Gov. Fife Symington is returning to a
courtroom, this time defending himself in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
against accusations he defrauded blue-collar workers' pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every bank in town was fooled for years, so it shouldn't be
unusual for our client to be fooled,'' said Mike Manning, an
attorney for the six union pension funds suing Symington in the
trial that begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Symington was convicted in 1997 on six of counts of bank and
wire fraud. The convictions were later overturned on appeal but
prosecutors have asked for a rehearing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the former developer and politician has been
reinventing himself, attending culinary school, working as a radio
commentator and serving as a political adviser to some Arizona
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy case dates to 1990, when the pension funds loaned
Symington $10 million, on his personal guarantee of repayment, to
finance the Mercado, a retail-office complex in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Low sales and low occupancy rates plagued the development,
forcing Symington to default. In 1995 he declared bankruptcy and
refused to repay the loan, which has swelled to $18 million with
interest.
</P>
<P>
   While still governor, Symington spent four months facing
prosecutors' accusations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government, armed with 10,000 documents, portrayed Symington
as an arrogant schemer who fabricated illusions of prosperity or
poverty to save his withering real estate empire.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned as governor after his conviction on charges of using
false financial statements to obtain several loans -- including the
$10 million pension funds loan. He was found innocent on a charge
that he used his clout as governor to extort concessions on the
pension funds' loan.
</P>
<P>
   It was another smudge on Arizona's image. Gov. Evan Mecham had
been impeached and removed from office in 1988 after the state
Senate convicted him of misusing $80,000 in state funds and
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Symington faced 2{ years in prison, until the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last June overturned his convictions, saying one
juror was improperly removed during deliberations. Prosecutors may
seek a new trial and have asked the full appellate court to
reconsider the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Manning will argue that Symington misled the pension funds with
false financial statements claiming a net worth of $12 million when
he knew the Mercado was a money loser. He plans to use witnesses
and excerpts of testimony from the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had no intention of honoring the guarantee when he signed
it,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Symington's attorney, Robert Shull, argues the pension funds
knew or should have known about his client's and the Mercado's
precarious financial state.

<HEADLINE> Dole: McCain Gained Power in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- He pummeled fellow Republicans, but John
McCain has acquired a potent national following and will return to
the Senate more powerful than when he left to challenge George W.
Bush for the party's presidential nomination, one congressional
veteran said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see a different John McCain coming back to the Senate,''
former majority leader and 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole said on CBS's
''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Suddenly he's this national leader, this national figure, very
well known,'' Dole said of the Arizona senator. ''Every time he
speaks, there'll be a lot of people around the country listening.''
</P>
<P>
   That constituency makes McCain prime material for the No. 2 spot
on the GOP ticket, voluntarily or not, according to Dole. But
first, McCain and Bush must soothe the bitterness left over from
their nomination fight, which ended last week when McCain pulled
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think right now it looks good'' for a Bush-McCain ticket,
said Dole, who spoke with McCain late last week. ''It depends on
what happens with Governor Bush and John McCain, their personal
relationship, what their both willing to do ... They'd be a great
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Not known for being a team player, McCain has said he has no
desire to be vice president and would rather resume his
chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   His independent streak helped galvanize what he called a
''McCain majority'' of voters from across the political spectrum to
vote for him, and advisers argue that it gives him some leverage in
the GOP although he alienated many by criticizing the hold
religious conservatives have on the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be alienated when he returns to Congress next
week -- even among Republicans who endorsed Bush, Dole predicted.
The former senator noted that some of the members seeking
re-election will want McCain to make appearances on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the future. And the future is winning, and that means
... an endorsement from McCain'' Dole added. ''A lot of his ideas
are going to have to be looked at.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Shut Down Opposition Radio  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police forced an opposition-run
radio and television station off the air Sunday, rounding up the
protesters who tried to protect the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the police action, 2,000 demonstrators gathered to
protest the shutdown of Radio Television Pozega, which is run by
the Pozega's opposition-controlled municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started Saturday when police and state officials
came to the station to shut it down because it allegedly failed to
pay state fees for using its frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The station's staff showed payment receipts to the police, and
broadcast an urgent appeal to its audience for people to come down
and defend the station from what it called another illegal closure
of nongovernment media in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred listeners responded and prevented police from
seizing the transmitter from atop a high-rise in Pozega, 60 miles
southwest of Belgrade. However, as the crowd diminished overnight,
police rounded up the remaining protesters and took the transmitter
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't let them get away with this,'' chief station editor
Branko Nikolic said by telephone. But he did not say what they
would do to get back on the air. Pozega police declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The station's FM radio covers an area populated by 250,000
people, and its television can be watched by about 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, a group of about 2,000 rallied in support of the
station. Nikolic said the gathering was peaceful, but ''showed that
people are resolved to defend the station.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of opposition Christian Democrats, Vladan Batic, said
the latest media crackdown amounted to ''a state of emergency'' for
the opposition. He gave the authorities seven days to reverse their
decision, or ''there will be many more protests.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation in Serbia is getting more complicated every
day,'' opposition Social Democratic leader Vuk Obradovic told the
Beta news agency. ''The authorities have definitely opted for
repression. They want to crack down on political opponents, but
also on free media because they are afraid of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition group, the Democratic Party, called for
protests Monday in several Serbian cities in support of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of media groups critical of authorities recently have
been shut down, severely fined or taken over.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on private and opposition-run media has intensified
ahead of local elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 protesters in nearby Cuprija gathered Saturday also
to demand their local radio station be put back on the air. It was
shut down last week.

<HEADLINE> Corruption allegations against cops expose weaknesses in system  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- One of four decorated city narcotics cops
recently arraigned in federal court for corruption had been removed
from the drug squad seven years ago because of FBI reports he was
shaking down dealers, a newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the FBI tipped the police commissioner that Darnyl
Parker, a decorated detective who warned schoolchildren about the
evils of drugs, had set up a drug operation for his twin brother,
The Buffalo News said in Sunday's editions. The FBI said it also
believed Parker was passing confidential police information to
dealers and stealing money from them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of the allegations against Parker, 40, is that he
helped his 21-year-old son start a cocaine business.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's arrest raises questions about the powers of the police
union and the department's program for investigating complaints
about officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so sad,'' said a teacher from School 81, where Parker
once took his anti-drug message. ''He's handsome, well-spoken and
was a wonderful role model for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the FBI tipped then-police commissioner Richard
Donovan about Parker, he immediately removed him from a federal
drug task force and transferred him out of the narcotics squad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Police Benevolent Association, a union, claiming Donovan
had no right to discipline Parker without formally charging him,
demanded he be given his job back.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator ordered Parker returned to narcotics. The city
also had to pay Parker $18,438 in retroactive overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was charged two weeks ago with taking bribes from a drug
dealer, passing on information about police raids, investing in
deals and stealing seized drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI alleges that the drugs recently went not to his brother
but to Parker's son, William, to set him up in the drug business.
He was charged as well.
</P>
<P>
   Parker is also accused of leading a rogue band of three other
Buffalo narcotics detectives in stealing more than $36,000 from an
FBI agent posing as a Jamaican drug dealer. Parker and fellow
detectives John Ferby, Robert E. Hill and David Rodriguez also are
accused of staging a phony drug raid. They were caught on videotape
looking for cash and narcotics in a drug house set up by the FBI
with hidden cameras and sound equipment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say they stumbled onto Parker again when they
questioned a drug dealer last year who had grown up with Parker.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer said that in early 1998 he began paying Parker $4,000
a month for protection and confidential police information. The
arrangement called for Parker to provide the names of police
informers and undercover officers, and to alert the dealer about
investigations around his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Scandals in police narcotics units are not limited to Buffalo.
In the past three years alone, major cases have been brought
against narcotics agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has experienced three narcotics scandals in the past 30
years, including one in 1990 which put seven patrol officers in
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials say the city may be worse-equipped to deal
with the problem than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Rocco J. Diina said Parker's earlier
grievance exposed a weakness in the department's ability to put
officers where they're best suited.
</P>
<P>
   There is no provision, short of formally charging a detective
with misconduct or a crime, for removing a detective from the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Robert Meegan, president of the Police Benevolent
Association, said the union did the right thing in the Parker case.
He noted that Parker was never charged criminally, based on the
1993 allegations. In fact, Meegan said, the department never even
conducted a formal investigation into the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Gibson, an activist for four decades on Buffalo's East
Side, is not optimistic that the latest investigation will have a
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it's in the headlines,'' she said. ''Three months
from now, everyone will forget about it, and it will be happening
all over again. The authorities will just forget about it. But the
people who live in the neighborhoods where the bullets are flying -
we won't forget about it.''

<HEADLINE> Continental fare increase remains in place  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- A fare increase of up to $40 per roundtrip
initiated by Continental Airlines remained in place Sunday as
competitors either matched it or continued to study the move.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental led the industry with a $20 hike in
January, blaming soaring jet fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines and Atlanta-based
Delta Air Lines said they have matched Continental's latest
increase. Northwest Airlines, based in Eagan, Minn., matched in
certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based United Airlines and St. Louis-based Trans World
Airlines were studying the increases, spokespersons said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest Airlines did not go along with the
increase. Attempts to reach officials Sunday from Tempe-based
America West Airlines or US Airways, with headquarters in
Arlington, Va., were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, American and Delta joined Continental in
attempting to raise fares as much as $30, but others held out and
the increase eventually was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, is attempting
this time to raise fares for roundtrip flights up to 500 miles by
$20, between 500 and 1,000 miles by $30 and flights more than 1,000
miles by $40.

<HEADLINE> Hunt for Md. Murder Suspect Stalls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLEYS QUARTERS, Md. (AP) -- Police were using autodialers to
warn residents by phone about a man suspected of four murders who
had evaded police for five days and was believed to be using
survival tactics to live in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The message was received by 1,700 households in the Bowleys
Quarters area of eastern Baltimore County. It included a
description of Joseph C. Palczynski, who police think is still in
the area where he allegedly kidnapped his ex-girlfriend and killed
four people. The ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Palczynski, 31, was made difficult by his outdoor
survival skills, said Baltimore County Police spokesman Bill
Toohey. He was last spotted wearing woodlands camouflage clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an experienced outdoorsman. He's physically fit and seems
to be comfortable out there,'' Toohey said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 100 people were hunting for Palczynski, and police
were using dogs and thermal imaging from helicopters in their
search of a circular area 11 miles wide.

<HEADLINE> President Works on Legislation Goals  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the election-year clock ticking and time
running down on his presidency, President Clinton is taking to the
road to sell several thorny pieces of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people talk about me now, I feel like I'm a witness at my
own funeral,'' Clinton said to laughter Sunday, and then added:
''You know, I've got nearly a year left in office, and a lot of
energy, and I've got a few ideas about what to do with the
remaining time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president planned road trips to promote several major
legislative initiatives: easing the cost of prescription drugs for
the elderly under Medicare, gun control, better consumer protection
in health care, an increase in the minimum wage and expanded China
trade, according to White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   The road show was to begin Monday in Cleveland, where elderly
Midwesterners who struggle to pay for prescription drugs will
endorse Clinton's plan to cover the cost as part of the federal
Medicare program that serves most older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Clinton's first major foray outside Washington to
talk about the drug issue this year, and the opening of what White
House strategists call a calculated effort to put a little hometown
pressure on Congress. Similar theme events are tentatively
scheduled throughout the spring, said one aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want members of Congress to hear it from their
constituents, from outside Washington,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave a glimpse of that on Sunday when he called for
tougher gun control legislation in an address to the National
League of Cities, and sought to enlist the help of the local
officials to join him in the fight for ''common sense gun safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We could use a little help from our friends, if you could just
nudge them (congressmen) along a little bit,'' Clinton told the
mayors from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the White House promoted the continuation of
the Department of Housing and Urgan Development's $15 million
''buy-back'' program to get guns off city streets. Administration
officials said they beat back an attempt by a House committee to
scrub the program last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the China trade deal the most important thing
before Congress this year. Clinton's chief lobbyist on the China
deal, Commerce Secretary William Daley, acknowledged last week that
the Clinton administration does not yet have the votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook may be slightly brighter for the prescription drug
plan, for the proposal to give patients the right to sue their
health plans if they are denied care, and for gun control. Clinton
wants to ban import of large-capacity ammunition clips, impose
background checks on buyers at weekend gun shows and require more
safety devices for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum wage legislation is in limbo after the House voted to
raise it last week but added tax cuts the White House calls
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say there is some Republican support for those
goals, and bipartisan self interest in passing some legislation
before the fall elections. Republicans, for example, have proposed
a prescription drug plan of their own, but it is more narrow in
scope.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take the unconventional line that things can actually occur
in election years,'' said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health care
policy expert. But White House strategists believe they can make
the arguments better away from the capital, instead of a string of
Rose Garden pronouncements at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy is hardly new, but it is being applied with some
urgency this year. Clinton has set two unofficial deadlines, one
for gun control in April and the other for the China deal in May.
He said he wants Congress to pass new gun control laws before April
20, the anniversary of last year's killings at Columbine High
School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges that the best hope for passing
contentious legislation in the Republican-led Congress will come
before summer, when the political parties name their presidential
candidates and legislators begin their own fall campaigns in
earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The even larger deadline, of course, is the end of the Clinton
presidency next January.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Director Honored  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The director of Oscar-nominated ''American
Beauty'' won the top award from the Directors Guild of America for
his dark satire of suburban family strife, an honor that is a
bellwether for the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award Saturday night, Sam Mendes talked about
the directors who have influenced his work, including Alfred
Hitchcock, Billy Wilder and Clint Eastwood. And he thanked Steven
Spielberg, whose DreamWorks SKG studio released ''American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to the studio for giving a bloke from England a
movie about the American suburbs and letting me make the movie I
wanted to make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes, an acclaimed stage director, won the guild award for his
first feature film. It stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as a
couple whose dysfunctional relationship, and their relationships
with the people around them, erupt.
</P>
<P>
   The award was presented by Spielberg, who won last year's guild
award for ''Saving Private Ryan'' and this year received the
guild's lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild award firms up Mendes' position as
front-runner for the Academy Award on March 26. Only four times in
the 52-year history of the Directors Guild awards has the winner
failed to receive the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes also won a Golden Globe for ''American Beauty'' in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to win an Oscar for the movie,'' Mendes said. ''But
this is an award in its own right because it comes from
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Spielberg received the lifetime award, the audience
viewed clips from his movies, including ''Jaws,'' ''Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ''Empire of the Sun'' and ''Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I love them all equally,'' he said backstage, ''but I love
'Schindler's List' just a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg also paid tribute to his directing heroes, including
Orson Welles, Akira Kurosawa and Robert Wise, thanking Wise for
''letting me sneak onto the set of 'The Hindenburg.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg is one of the four past Directors Guild winners who
did not win an Oscar, for ''The Color Purple'' in 1985. The others
were Anthony Harvey for ''The Lion in Winter'' from 1968; Francis
Ford Coppola for ''The Godfather'' from 1972; and Ron Howard for
''Apollo 13'' from 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Launches Veiled Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Sunday
launched what appeared to be a veiled attack on a fellow ex-coup
leader who is challenging the president in May presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias, the popular governor of oil-rich Zulia state
and a former military officer who helped Chavez stage a failed 1992
coup, announced his candidacy for president on Friday, immediately
changing the political climate in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in apocalyptic times. That is, you can't be with god
and the devil at the same time. There is no third option,'' Chavez
said in his weekly radio program Alo Presidente.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and two other former leaders of the 1992 coup attempt have
fallen out with Chavez, whom they accuse of betraying the original
goals of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has ruled largely unchallenged since his 1998 landslide
presidential victory from which Venezuela's two traditional parties
have not been able to recover.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is leading a ''democratic revolution'' aimed at
rooting out a corrupt oligarchy he blames for Venezuela's social
and economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to put the ''revolution'' back on track, Arias could
pose a challenge to Chavez largely because most Venezuelans believe
he does not belong to the ''old guard'' that the president is
wiping out.
</P>
<P>
   In his Sunday radio program, Chavez did not mention Arias or the
other former coup leaders by name, but implied they were being used
by forces opposed to his ''peaceful revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the opposition will ''disguise'' itself with ''new faces
and new names.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Chavez's ruling Fifth Republic Movement, known by its
Spanish acronym MVR, insist Arias does not pose a real threat, but
they have already begun planning a strategy to combat the Zulia
governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The party plans to show alleged connections between Arias and
the political ''old guard,'' and to disassociate him with the
change Chavez has promised for Venezuelans, MVR leader Tarek
William Saab said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez pushed through a new constitution last year that requires
Venezuelans to renew most public offices through elections on May
28.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who enjoys popularity ratings of around 70 percent, is
still expected to win the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Small Arms in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Eastern African officials and U.N.
representatives on Sunday began discussing ways of halting the
proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the Great Lakes
region and the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya convened the four-day summit, attributing the increase in
its crime levels to the availability of arms from neighboring
countries with internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana said there were an estimated 100
million illegal small arms and light weapons in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa are
the most volatile regions in Africa, we can safely assume that the
bulk of these arms are in this region,'' Godana said in his key
note speech.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the region has had more internal conflicts and
higher levels of crime, violence and insecurity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lakes region is made up of Kenya and Tanzania, as well
as Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi -- which are wrought with civil
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Horn of Africa includes Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia,
whose late dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 by a
coalition of rebels. Since then Somalia has split into fiefs
protected by clan militias.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is battling a low-level rebellion by the Oromo
Liberation Front, and fighting a border war with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Kenya's rural communities use firearms to raid each
other for cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania, which has no internal conflict, is burdened by
hundreds of thousands of refugees from Rwanda, Burundi and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Godana said the proliferation of arms in the area had led to the
''destruction of property and the immense loss of life, especially
of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts have prevented the countries from developing, and
have canceled much of any progress made earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi was scheduled to address the
delegates Tuesday. The meetings end Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Catholics Embrace Papal Apology  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. HUBBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Roman Catholic worshippers and clergy in the United States
met Pope John Paul II's historic gesture of atonement with
enthusiasm on Sunday, calling apologies for their brethren's
stumblings and sins needed and ''much overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing wrongs that touched on groups from gays to Gypsies,
the pontiff's centuries-spanning apology resonated among the
church's 48 million U.S. members. Most said they welcomed his
prayers with reflective relief.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily Catholic southern Louisiana, parishioners knew of the
pope's pardon even though some priests didn't mention the comments
during services.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Mass at St. Louis Cathedral in the heart of New
Orleans' French Quarter, Fred Robichaud said the apology was long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good idea, and probably something that should have been
done 50 years ago by Pope Pius XII,'' said Robichaud, 60. ''I'm
glad the pope was loving enough to recognize that something should
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's remarks punctuated a recent round of repentance by
Roman Catholic leaders begun last week in a Lenten address by
Cardinal Roger Mahoney, leader of the Los Angeles diocese.
Mahoney's apology reached out to gays and those of other faiths,
and said the church was ''aware of more sins than we can fully
enumerate here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston on Saturday, Cardinal Bernard Law apologized for
Catholic failings as old as American slavery and as modern-day as
sexual abuse by priests.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading into church at the city's Cathedral of the Holy
Cross on Sunday, some of the area's 2.25 million Catholics
expressed relief at the statements by Law and John Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some groups feel like they've been wronged by the Catholic
church, and I think they're right in some cases,'' said Michael
Brady of Boston outside the city's Cathedral of the Holy Cross. An
apology ''begins the process of healing, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   While giving credit to the pontiff, Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said the Holocaust
should have been mentioned specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statement would have more contemporary relevance if he had
included 'during the Nazi Holocaust,''' Hier said. ''We don't want
people to think that the pope was referring to yesteryear, 1,500
years back.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral, Mass was celebrated by
retired auxiliary Bishop Patrick Ahern in place of the ailing
Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were those who hated the poor for their poverty and
condescended to the weak,'' Ahern told Sunday celebrants. ''Through
their actions and attitudes, Christians had forgotten that the Lord
commanded us to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, Ohio, worshippers at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church
said apologies were not addressed in afternoon services. Not
everyone there saw it as an omission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was necessary to apologize,'' said Hokun Lee,
30.
</P>
<P>
   But fellow parishioner Mary Im, 54, disagreed. ''I think this
was the year to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Heidt of St. Mary's Parish Family in Bismarck,
N.D. called the pontiff's atonement ''much overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point,'' Heidt said, ''we've just got to say it's
past, mistakes were made. And we need to move on in brotherhood and
love of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baton Rouge, La., 83-year-old Doucette Pascal said ''the
brutality of the Crusades, and the fact that we didn't do more in
the Holocaust, was disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think his apology is overdue,'' she said. ''But it did
come.''

<HEADLINE> SAG Awards Are Tuneup for Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actors playing a jailed boxer, a slain
transsexual, an adulterous real-estate agent and a tobacco-industry
whistleblower were among nominees for the Screen Actors Guild
honors Sunday, the last big awards before the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The guild ceremony honors actors in five film and eight
television categories.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Directors Guild of America awards, held Saturday night,
the 6th annual Screen Actors ceremony offered a glimpse of how the
Oscars might shake out March 26.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous five awards shows, the actors guild has chosen
nine of the 10 performers who went on to win Oscars in lead-acting
categories. The guild has a 50-50 record on predicting Oscar
winners for supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild has a longer and more impressive track
record. In its 52-year history, only four guild winners have failed
to receive the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' director Sam Mendes won this year's
Directors Guild honor, beating Frank Darabont for ''The Green
Mile,'' Spike Jonze for ''Being John Malkovich,'' Michael Mann for
''The Insider'' and M. Night Shyamalan for ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Darabont is the only Directors Guild nominee who is not in the
running for an Oscar. Lasse Hallstrom, director of ''The Cider
House Rules,'' has the fifth Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated for lead actor by the actors guild were Jim Carrey as
the late comic Andy Kaufman in ''Man on the Moon,'' Russell Crowe
as ex-tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand in ''The Insider,'' Philip
Seymour Hoffman as a drag queen in ''Flawless,'' Kevin Spacey as a
husband mired in a whale of a mid-life crisis in ''American
Beauty'' and Denzel Washington as falsely imprisoned boxer Rubin
Carter in ''The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead-actress nominees were Annette Bening as a real-estate
saleswoman having an extramarital fling in ''American Beauty,''
Janet McTeer as a flaky mom in ''Tumbleweeds,'' Julianne Moore as a
cheating wife in ''The End of the Affair,'' Meryl Streep as an East
Harlem violin teacher in ''Music of the Heart'' and Hilary Swank as
a woman murdered after posing as a man in ''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore also was nominated for supporting actress for
''Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Contenders for supporting actor were Michael Caine in ''The
Cider House Rules,'' Chris Cooper in ''American Beauty,'' Tom
Cruise in ''Magnolia,'' Michael Clarke Duncan in ''The Green Mile''
and Haley Joel Osment in ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener both were nominated for
supporting actress for ''Being John Malkovich.'' Besides Moore, the
other nominees were Angelina Jolie for ''Girl, Interrupted'' and
Chloe Sevigny for ''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The guild awards included honors for a movie's overall cast. The
nominees were ''American Beauty,'' ''Being John Malkovich,''
''Magnolia,'' ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''The Green Mile.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Kill 11 in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Right-wing paramilitary groups killed 11
men suspected of being leftist sympathizers, authorities said
Sunday, the latest bloodshed in Colombia's north, where dozens have
been massacred in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 gunmen arrived Friday night at a series of farms
outside San Juan Nepomuceno and Maria La Baja in Bolivar state and
shot to death the men, all aged 25 to 35, said Marine Col. Rodrigo
Quinonez.
</P>
<P>
   Quinonez's units arrived on the scene Saturday and found the
local population terrorized, with 200 peasants already having fled
to Maria La Baja.
</P>
<P>
   He said a paramilitary officer in a camouflage uniform called
the victims by name, accusing them of being members of the leftist
rebel National Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar state and the Marines were offering a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the capture of the attackers, Quinonez said.
</P>
<P>
   The region is one of Colombia's most turbulent. Paramilitary
units vie for control of its mineral riches -- including the
country's most extensive gold deposits -- as well as the local
cocaine business.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-February, more than 60 people have been killed by
paramilitary units who believed they were sympathetic with the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cruelest actions, some 200 paramilitaries
massacred at least 36 people with guns and machetes on Feb. 16 in
the village of El Salado and another 17 in nearby Ovejas, according
to federal prosecutors. The most recent killings occurred just 30
miles away.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Minister Wants Answers  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- The environmental minister counted 41
mining sites in Romania that pose a danger to the environment, and
said Sunday he would demand that operators tell him what they were
doing to prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Romica Tomescu spoke two days after melting snow and
torrential rains broke a dam at the state-owned Baia Borsa mine,
235 miles northwest of Bucharest. The breach sent a wave of zinc-
and lead-laden waters into the Vaser River.
</P>
<P>
   That accident came six weeks after a cyanide spill killed tons
of fish in the Tisza River in Hungary and Yugoslavia. The Vaser
flows into the Tisza.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a private television station, Pro TV, Tomescu said
there were 41 dangerous mining sites in northern Romania, and that
he was demanding information from operators about dangers and
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
   He did not list all 41 sites, but mentioned a few near the towns
of Baia Mare, Zlatna and Hunedoara. Northwestern Romania is a major
mining area.
</P>
<P>
   A team of German experts, including Germany's environmental
minister, arrived in Bucharest on Sunday, and will travel to the
country's north Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to help prevent future accidents,'' Minister Gila
Altman told Pro TV.
</P>
<P>
   At the Baia Borsa mine, executive director Staicu Balanescu said
repairs to the dam could take up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian authorities have warned people against drinking the
Tisza's water or eating its fish, Pro TV said.
</P>
<P>
   In Budapest, Hungarian government commissioner Janos Goenczy
said the heavy metal contamination had entered the Tisza River east
of the cyanide spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means that the previously untouched parts of the river
are contaminated as well,'' he said. Goenczy expressed concern
about the long-term effects of heavy metal in the waterways, and
the danger of them entering the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Hungary's fresh water comes from outside of its
borders. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, said he hoped
international pressure would force Romania to sign an environmental
protection agreement with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.N. experts were also expected in Hungary late Sunday or
Monday to help assess the situation, Goenczy said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Arabs on Violence  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Lebanese and Syrian predictions of increased
violence if Israel withdraws from Lebanon without a wider peace
agreement drew warnings Sunday from Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions, timed for an Arab League summit staged to show
solidarity with Lebanon, also increased skepticism about the
prospects for peace with Syria, the main power in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''For ... years they told us we ought to withdraw without
conditions, and when we say we are about to do just that, they
threaten us,'' Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops have occupied a zone in southern Lebanon since
1985 to protect Israel's northern border from attacks. Israeli
leaders are planning to withdraw from Lebanon by July, with or
without advances in peace talks with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria is opposed to a unilateral withdrawal, which would
weaken its position in talks to recover its Golan Heights, captured
by Israel in 1967. Backing that agenda, Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud said in comments published Saturday that Lebanon cannot
guarantee security along its border after an Israeli pullout unless
the withdrawal is part of an overall Middle East settlement.
</P>
<P>
   That comment and similar ones from Syria drew sharp reactions
from Israel Sunday. Officials including Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said any post-pullout attacks on Israel's northern border would
invite heavy retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will allow ourselves freedom of action if there will be
attacks on soldiers or communities after Israel deploys on the
international border,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The army has already presented Barak with a number of withdrawal
plans, an Israeli official said Sunday on condition of anonymity.
They include one in which Israel would retain about five border
outposts located as far as 400 yards inside Lebanon to protect
border towns. But a continued Israeli presence in even a tiny part
of Lebanon could be used as a pretext for guerrilla attacks after
the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders accused the Lebanese and their Syrian overlords
of seeking excuses to keep the Lebanon conflict alive. Barak told
his Cabinet Sunday that ''These decisions do not contribute to the
peace talks or to any talks at all,'' his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down in January over Syria's
insistence on a prior commitment from Israel to withdraw from the
Golan Heights. Barak has strongly hinted that he would cede the
strategic plateau, but refuses to say so until he knows what
security guarantees Syria will agree to.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, one of Israel's chief rabbis said that he met with
a senior Syrian official at a wedding in New York City -- and that
the official brought a message of peace from Syrian President Hafez
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israel Radio from New York, Rabbi Eliahu
Bakshi-Doron said he spoke with Rashid Fahem for two hours at the
wedding, which was of a prominent Syrian Jewish couple living in
the United States. Bakshi-Doron is chief rabbi for Jews of
Sephardic or Middle Eastern origin. Israel Radio identified Fahem
as a senior official in charge of relations between the Syrian
government and New York's large Syrian Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his (Fahem's) words, Assad is looking for peace,''
Bakshi-Doron said. ''It appeared to me that he was sent to tell me
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi said that Israel's consul general in New York, Shmuel
Sisso, was also at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Report: 6 Crushed in Saudi Arabia  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- At least six pilgrims have been
crushed to death while performing Muslim rites as part of the
annual pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Jordanian and
Palestinian officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two Jordanian men in their sixties were killed Wednesday and a
Jordanian woman, also in her sixties, was crushed Friday in the mob
of people at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, an
official said. The official, who is leading the Jordanian
delegation to the hajj, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Youssef Salameh, head of the Palestinian hajj delegation, said
that three elderly Palestinian women also were crushed Friday at
the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The reports conflicted with that from Interior Minister Prince
Nayef, who gave a news conference Sunday evening in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Nayef said up to six people had been killed. Minutes
later, he was handed a piece of paper and altered his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The head of the general security department has just told me
there were only two deaths and they were the result of heart
problems,'' the minister said. He said four others had suffered
broken bones due to pushing around Zamzam, the holy well located
inside the Grand Mosque.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to immediately explain the conflict between
the two reports.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is a key issue during the hajj due to the massive
crowding. About 2.1 million pilgrims are expected to be in Mecca
this week for the hajj, whose main rituals begin Wednesday and last
until Saturday. Muslims are required to perform hajj at least once
in a lifetime if they can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims start arriving days before the start of the rituals;
more than 1.5 million gathered for prayers at the Grand Mosque on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the prayers, pilgrims pushed their way out of the mosque,
sending many elderly men and women to the ground. Some gasped for
air or called for help and many pilgrims were seen rushing to help
those who had fallen. Such commotion is normal during the hajj.
</P>
<P>
   Security is usually tight in and around the Grand Mosque, which
houses the Kaaba, an ancient cubic stone structure revered in
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Some 180 pilgrims died in a stampede during the rituals in 1998.
A similar stampede in 1994 left 270 dead.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 pilgrimage, fires driven by high winds tore
through a sprawling, overcrowded tent city at Mina outside Mecca,
trapping and killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has since installed fireproof tents, increased the
numbers of rescue vehicles and provided safer cooking stoves.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Opposes Lifting Gas Tax  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday
he opposes temporarily lifting a 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax
because of high fuel prices, but said the president ''will consider
all options'' to bring relief to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of lawmakers have begun gauging whether there
is enough support in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline
excise tax imposed in 1993 until prices at the pump recede.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has received a cool reception among lawmakers
involved in writing tax legislation, but some Republican leaders in
Congress have embraced the idea, noting that the tax was imposed
when Democrats held the majority -- and that Vice President Al Gore
cast the tie-braking vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., joined the chorus
against the tax this week, calling it the ''Gore gas tax.'' The
Senate began its two-week recess before considering the issue
further.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, appearing on Sunday television talk shows, noted
that Republicans were divided on the matter and said he didn't
think suspending the tax would help because the problem is scarcity
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would be taking $600 million a month out of the highway
trust fund,'' said Richardson on Fox ''News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Later appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' Richardson said of
reducing the federal gas tax: ''I don't think that will help
because the main problem is scarcity of supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he did not rule out the White House going along with a
tax suspension, should Congress want it. ''The president will
consider all options to bring relief to the American consumers,''
said Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3 cent tax passed by Congress in 1993 increased the
federal excise tax to 18.4 cents a gallon. In addition, most states
have their own gasoline excise tax, with amounts varying across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson reiterated -- as he has repeatedly this past week --
that he expects the OPEC oil producers to increase production,
although the amount and immediacy of the increases are unclear. The
oil ministers meet March 27 to consider production levels.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has refused to say how much added production will be
necessary, although noting that the world currently uses 2 million
more barrels of oil than is being produced, drawing down
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ''OPEC will increase production of petroleum (and) ... you will
see over the spring and summer stability in gasoline prices,''
predicted Richardson. ''It's going to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   That optimistic assessment is in contrast to the Energy
Department's own recent analysis that forecast rising gas prices
with national average prices of $1.80 this summer, and $2 gas in
some places -- even if OPEC countries substantially increase
production.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC producers cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day
in early 1999 to prop up prices that had plummeted to below $11 a
barrel. Since then a world oil glut has turned into shortages and
the price has gone as high as $34 a barrel, receding to $31.50 a
barrel on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has argued that producing and consuming nations need
price stability -- some producers suggest in the low $20s per barrel
-- while avoiding the wild swings that have marked the past two
years.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Hits S. Mexico, Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An earthquake shook a broad swath of southern
Mexico and Central America on Sunday, but there were few reports of
damage and none of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's National Seismological Service said the quake at 5:21
p.m. EST was centered in the state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan
border, and had a magnitude of 6.4.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas state civil defense officials said they had no immediate
reports of damage, but in those in Guatemala said it toppled power
lines onto houses in the municipality of Quetzaltenango in western
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The quake caused tall buildings to sway in Mexico City and was
felt at least as far south as San Salvador, almost 710 miles from
the Mexican capital -- a distance equivalent to that from New York
City to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> McCarrick: Pope apology shows need to fight ''sins of disunity''  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The spiritual leader of 1.5 million Roman
Catholics in northern New Jersey said Sunday's historic speech by
Pope John Paul II seeking forgiveness for the sins of Catholics
through the ages shows the need to fight against ''the sins of
disunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick said the pontiff's speech
made him ''proud to be part of a church who is humble enough to
admit the failings of its children, and strong enough to have the
courage to say, 'We are not perfect, and we are all sinners.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented moment in the history of the church, the
pope asked God's forgiveness for the sins of Roman Catholics
through the ages, including wrongs inflicted on Jews, women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We forgive and we ask forgiveness,'' he said at several points
during the solemn Day of Pardon Mass at St. Peter's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   The church burned heretics at the stake during the Inquisition.
Armies of the faithful slaughtered Muslims during the Crusades. And
during the Holocaust, some Catholics stood silent in the face of
Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy recalled the ''sufferings of the people
of Israel'' and asked divine pardon for ''the sins committed by a
not a few (Catholics) against the people of the Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of silent prayer, the pope responded: ''We are
deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of
history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking
your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff's message came through loud and clear, McCarrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be constantly challenged to strive for holiness, and I
think the Holy Father did that today,'' the archbishop said.
</P>
<P>
   He said John Paul spoke of ''the sins of disunity, the sins of
using force to promote the message, and the very difficult and
painful relations we have had with our Jewish brothers and sisters
through the years, and the terrible tragedy of some of us not
speaking out about what we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that we recognize these are things we need to
work on and overcome,'' McCarrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Jewish leaders praised the Pope's penitential words, but
said they expected more during the pope's March 20-26 visit to the
Holy Land. During his trip the pontiff will visit Israel's
Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, and the Western Wall, the holiest
site in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The director of Yad Vashem, Avner Shalev, called Sunday's day of
pardon both ''significant'' and ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''he has to pay tribute and commemorate the remembrance of
the Holocaust and I know he will do it,'' Shalev said in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau, also said he expects more and
described himself as ''deeply frustrated'' by John Paul's failure
to mention the Holocaust by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope deeply that the pope of today whom I appreciate very
much for his doings and for his condemning anti-Semitism will
complete the asking of forgiveness next week in Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem,'' Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarrick said the Pope has repeatedly spoken out about the
Holocaust, more so than any other non-Jewish religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Holy Father has spoken so often about his horror at the
Holocaust,'' he said. ''It's not as if this is the only thing he
has ever said. He has spoken about it time and time again, and
expressed his sorrow that there were many in the church who did not
speak out as much as they could.''

<HEADLINE> Trial Takes On Srebrenica Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Half a century ago, Europeans
watched a war crimes tribunal put Nazi leaders on trial and vowed
''never again'' to permit genocide on their continent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, prosecutors at another war crimes court seek to prove
that genocide occurred in spite of that vow. They are pressing the
charge against Gen. Radislav Krstic, for the worst massacre on
European soil since the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic, a Bosnian Serb, goes on trial Monday, accused of
ordering the July 1995 slaughter of Muslim refugees, mostly men and
boys, in the U.N.-designated ''safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia. The remains of almost 2,500 people have been found;
at least 4,500 people remain missing. He pleaded innocent to the
charges following his transfer to the Netherlands in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia is of profound significance, and not only to
settle the question whether the ''ethnic cleansing'' campaigns in
the 1992-95 Bosnian war constituted genocide, the most serious
international crime.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of forensic investigation at hundreds of mass
graves around Srebrenica, the trial is also expected to piece
together the puzzle of how the tragedy unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the tremendous number of volumes written about
Srebrenica, there are still many unanswered questions,'' said
prosecution spokesman Paul Risley. ''It will be very helpful to the
public, to journalists and to historians attempting to come to
terms with what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings will also be watched closely by bereaved wives,
mothers, sisters and daughters demanding to know how the victims
could be killed after repeated assurances of protection from the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations last year acknowledged its error in expecting
150 Dutch troops guarding the ''safe haven'' to deter thousands of
Serb fighters. Its report also conceded that air support for the
peacekeepers was late and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors assert the Dutch helped the Serbs round up Muslims and
have demanded that their commanders, along with U.N. civilian and
military leaders, be indicted for complicity. Prosecutors dismiss
those demands and will seek to focus on Krstic's culpability,
Risley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Avril McDonald, an expert in international criminal law at
The Hague's T.M.C. Asser Institute, said the U.N.'s role could
figure in the trial if Krstic's defense tries to use it to deflect
the burden of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could argue that this was an operation conducted with the
full cooperation and knowledge of the U.N. contingent on the
ground,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a lot of people, especially in Bosnia, this will be a
turning point for the tribunal,'' with its reputation riding on how
it judges the commander accused in the worst example of ethnic
cleansing, McDonald added.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be noteworthy, too, for the absence of Krstic's
superiors: former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military
chief Ratko Mladic. Also indicted for genocide at Srebrenica, both
men are believed at large in Serb-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic, arrested by NATO troops in December 1998, is the
tribunal's first defendant to have held the rank of general in the
period covered by his indictment.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the Bosnian Serb army's Drina Corps, he is
charged with every crime under the tribunal's jurisdiction:
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of
the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the general faces life imprisonment in a European
jail. Unlike the Nuremberg court, which sent 10 Nazis to the
gallows in 1946, the Yugoslav tribunal has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Srebrenica episode began July 6, 1995, when the Drina Corps
opened an assault on the Muslim enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic's lawyer, Nenad Petrusic, writes in his pretrial brief
that Krstic ordered the strike in response to Muslim attacks from
the demilitarized zone on outlying Serb villages ''in which they
used techniques of ethnic cleansing, burning houses and terrorizing
the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   Under bombardment, 20,000 Muslims were forced to seek refuge at
a U.N. compound and at Susanjari village on the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   At the compound, Krstic's soldiers separated the men and boys
from the women, according to the indictment, and other units under
his command intercepted a column of refugees trying to escape into
the woods from Susanjari.
</P>
<P>
   Over eight days, Serb army ''forces, under the command and
control of Ratko Mladic and Radislav Krstic, executed thousands of
Bosnian Muslim men,'' the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, Serb soldiers buried the bodies over a wide
area, prosecutors say. When word of the massacre got out, the Serbs
allegedly dug up many bodies and reburied them elsewhere in a
second attempt at concealing the atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   The trial begins at a time when the tribunal is tending toward a
strict view of the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, judges sentenced Croatian Gen. Tihomir
Blaskic to 45 years in prison, the longest sentence yet, for his
soldiers' murderous rampages in 1993 among Muslim villages in
central Bosnia's Lasva Valley. Blaskic claimed he was unaware of
his soldier's crimes because the chain of command was split and
reports of the atrocities were sent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic's counsel will present a similar defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused did not have at his disposal true information that
would indicate that some of his subordinates had committed
crimes,'' Petrusic, the lawyer, says in his brief.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War, Gov't Angered McVeigh  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Fighting in the Gulf War left Timothy McVeigh
angry and disillusioned, he said in an interview broadcast Sunday
on ''60 Minutes,'' and the clashes at Waco and Ruby Ridge showed
the federal government will use violence ''as an option all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with CBS' Ed Bradley, McVeigh did not say he
was innocent of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. The explosion killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   In his only other interview since his 1997 conviction, that same
year with the Buffalo News in New York, he also refused to say if
he was the bomber or knew who was.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers last week filed an appeal of his conviction and
death sentence, claiming pretrial publicity and defense attorneys'
alleged leaks of inflammatory stories to the press deprived him of
a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh said during the Feb. 22 interview at the federal
maximum-security prison in Terre Haute, Ind., that he was angry and
bitter after fighting in the Gulf War, where he won several medals
for heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went over there hyped up, just like everyone else. Not only
is Saddam evil; all Iraqis are evil. What I experienced, though,
was an entirely different ball game. And being face to face close
with these people in personal contact, you realize they're just
people like you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His anger deepened when Randy Weaver's wife and son were shot
and killed in a standoff with federal agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho,
in 1992 and dozens of members of the Branch Davidian sect died in a
fire after a 51-day standoff with federal officers in Waco, Texas,
eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh said U.S. citizens must keep government in check.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if violence is a way to do that, McVeigh said: ''If
government is the teacher, violence would be an acceptable option.
</P>
<P>
   ''What did we do to Sudan? What did we do to Afghanistan?
Belgrade? What are we doing with the death penalty? It appears they
use violence as an option all the time,'' McVeigh said in a
transcript provided by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He also told Bradley he could not ask him directly if he was the
Oklahoma City bomber because of his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the claims in McVeigh's motion for a new trial is that
images of him in an orange jumpsuit, leg irons and handcuffs two
days after his arrest prejudiced the jurors against them because
they were shown repeatedly. He said the pictures were ''the
beginning of a propaganda campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors who were interviewed by CBS, however, denied they were
influenced by the pretrial publicity. ''He's the Oklahoma City
bomber, and there is no doubt about it in my mind,'' John
Candeleria said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the federal prison in Florence, Colo., McVeigh said he
discovered that he and Ted Kaczynski, the convicted Unabomber, one
of his cellblock neighbors, shared some concerns and were similar
in that ''all we wanted out of life was the freedom to live our own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And if his latest appeal fails, McVeigh said he is prepared to
die.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to terms with my mortality in the Gulf War,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would do anything differently if he could relive his
life, McVeigh said: ''I've thought about that quite a few times.
And I think anybody in life says, 'I wish I could have gone back
and done this differently, done that differently.'
</P>
<P>
   ''There are moments, but no one that stands out.''

Pope Seeks Pardon for Catholics
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In an unprecedented moment in the history of the church,
Pope John Paul II asked God's forgiveness Sunday for the sins of Roman Catholics
through the ages, including wrongs inflicted on Jews, women and minorities. The
apology was a personal landmark for a frail, ailing pope who vowed to cleanse
and reinvigorate Catholicism for its third millennium. ''We forgive and we ask
forgiveness,'' he said at several points during the solemn Day of Pardon Mass at
St. Peter's Basilica.

Richardson Opposes Lifting Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today he opposes
temporarily lifting a 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax because of high fuel
prices, but said the president ''will consider all options'' to bring relief to
consumers. A growing number of lawmakers have begun gauging whether there is
enough support in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline excise tax imposed in
1993 until prices at the pump recede. The proposal has received a cool reception
among lawmakers involved in writing tax legislation, but some Republican leaders
in Congress have embraced the idea, noting that the tax was imposed when
Democrats held the majority -- and that Vice President Al Gore cast the
tie-braking vote.

Federal Drug Sentences Declining

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Average sentences for federal drug offenders declined

for certain types of defendants. The findings by Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse are somewhat surprising. The 1990s
saw tougher drug laws passed throughout the nation, federal drug-control
spending rose by nearly two-thirds to $16 billion a year in 1998, and federal
drug convictions climbed to an annual record of 21,571 in 1998.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States exported a record $181 billion worth of

it came back as assembled products, resulting in a record $40 billion trade

Nashville's win was just its third in 16 games, while Edmonton dropped its

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Arrest 6 Tamils  </HEADLINE>
By ASIF ANSAR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Police arrested six Tamils for a
suicide bombing that killed 21 people in a failed attempt to
assassinate Sri Lanka's defense minister and military chiefs,
police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The men were picked up Saturday in two suburbs near the capital,
Colombo, said Senior Superintendent of Police Bandula
Wickremesinghe, who is heading the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing Friday evening, on a route the minister was due to
take, failed because the bomber -- presumed to be a Tamil rebel --
prematurely detonated an explosive device strapped to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   It killed 21 people, including a suicide bomber. In a gunbattle
that ensued, a rebel was killed, and the bodies of two other rebels
were found at the scene. Hours later, four other rebels committed
suicide as police closed in on their hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   Wickremesinghe said he was looking into how the rebels -- who
were carrying rocket propelled grenade launchers and machine guns --
went undetected in the capital, where there are security checks at
every 500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were made after investigators found documents on the
dead rebels linking the six men to the plot to kill Defense
Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and the three chiefs of the armed
forces, he said, but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspect the attack was planned by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist group fighting for an
independent homeland for the island's 3.3 million Tamil minority.
</P>
<P>
   Though the civil war is being fought in the north and parts of
the east, the rebels have been able to attack in the capital as
well. But this was the first time a team of suicide bombers managed
to position themselves in a high-security area with an array of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's attack was the fourth carried out by the rebels since
December, when a suicide bomber targeted President Chandrika
Kumaratunga. She escaped, suffering a wounded eye while 25 others
were killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Rodolfo Garcia, an Associated Press
reporter who helped chronicle Nicaragua's emergence out of civil
war, a papal visit, volcanoes and floods, died Saturday after a
long illness. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia joined The Associated Press in Managua in 1986 after
working for Radio Nicaragua, where he was director of short-wave
broadcasts, and after helping found a local news agency, Agencia de
Noticias Nueva Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   For the AP, he covered the war between the Sandinista government
and Contra rebels, the Sandinistas' loss of power at the ballot box
and the country's sometimes turbulent effort to put years of war
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   He also reported on volcanic eruptions, the 1996 visit of Pope
John Paul II and the ravages of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was born in Nandasmo, a town about 15 miles south of
Managua. He attended the National Autonomous University of
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia suffered a series of illnesses last year, including
diabetes and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Ana Leonor Hernandez, and four
daughters.
Ignatius Kung
</P>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Cardinal Ignatius Kung, who spent 30
years in prison for defying attempts by China's communist
government to control Catholics through a state-run church, died
Sunday of stomach cancer. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Kung died at the home of his nephew, Joseph Kung. He had been
living there since coming to the United States in 1988 for medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people, because of his example, took the risk of
defending the church, of defending the pope and, as a result,
literally hundreds, or thousands, went to jail,'' said Joseph Kung,
president of the Cardinal Kung Foundation, which monitors the
millions of Catholics worshipping outside the official Chinese
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatius Kung, born in Shanghai in 1901, was named bishop of
Shanghai and apostolic administrator of the dioceses of Nanjing and
Suzhou only days after the communists founded the People's Republic
of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of following the government's orders, he shunned the
government-backed Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and
oversaw the Legion of Mary, a group of devout Catholics. He
continued to lead public devotions, sometimes under the wary eyes
of police, Joseph Kung said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he was arrested and brought before a mob in a stadium,
where he was accused of defying the church. When he was pushed to a
microphone to confess, he instead shouted, ''Long live Christ the
King, long live the pope,'' his nephew said.
</P>
<P>
   Kung was brought to trial and sentenced to life in prison for
leading a ''counterrevolutionary clique under the cloak of
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   A combination of campaigns by human rights groups, Kung's ill
health and China's desire to court the West gained his release 30
years later, in 1985. The government gave him permission to travel
to the United States in 1988 for treatment of hearing and heart
problems.

<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Tara Sloan, the swimmer who holds the
Canadian record in the 100-meter breaststroke, died Saturday from
injuries suffered in a car accident. She was 20.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan had been in a medically induced coma after the van she was
driving rolled on a southern Alberta highway March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was a five-time Canadian champion. In last summer's Pan-Am
Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, she finished eighth in the 200
breaststroke.

<HEADLINE> Belfour To Rejoin Stars Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas goalie Ed Belfour is expected to rejoin the
Stars on Tuesday, having been cleared by NHL officials who oversee
the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey said Belfour will begin
workouts with the team on Tuesday, but his next start will be
determined by coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be able to rejoin the team on Tuesday in New Jersey and
be able to pick up and go into his normal training and work,''
Gainey said Sunday. ''As soon as he's up to speed and feeling
comfortable, I'm sure Ken will put him back in goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour hasn't played since he was arrested last Wednesday for
aggravated assault on a hotel security guard and resisting arrest.
He spent six hours in police custody and has not been with the team
since, though he was never suspended by the NHL or the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have played three games with Manny Fernandez in goal,
winning their first in that span Sunday when Fernandez had 19 saves
in a 4-2 victory over St. Louis, the NHL's winningest team.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez likely will be in goal again Monday night when the
Stars open a three-game road trip at the New York Rangers. Belfour
will be eligible to return to the ice for Wednesday night's game
against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to mean a lot for our confidence,'' Fernandez said.
''We want him back as soon as possible. He'll be real pumped to
come back. He'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''Eddie the Eagle,'' Belfour has averaged 2.08
goals-against in 53 games this season. He was one of the heroes for
last season's Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Belfour met for two days with an independent
team of mental health and substance abuse counselors provided by
the league and the NHL Players' Association. Gainey said
confidentiality rules prevented him from commenting about the
report issued by that group.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour wasn't at Reunion Arena on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll try to handle it in the way that's smoothest for the
player and the team to reunite,'' Gainey said. ''To have him pick
up the thread of an MVP season is important for us and for Eddie.''

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels Keep NCAA Streak Alive  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina's worst season in a decade
won't keep the Tar Heels out of college basketball's showcase
event.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina was given an at-large berth to the NCAA
tournament Sunday night, extending to 26 the Tar Heels' record of
consecutive appearances in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned the No. 8 seed in the South, the Tar Heels will play
ninth-seeded Missouri in an opening-round game Friday in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our players were excited when they saw the announcement,''
coach Bill Guthridge said. ''I know they are not satisfied with our
record and look forward to competing in the NCAA tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's 18-13 record had fueled talk that the Tar
Heels' highest number of losses since 1989-90 might keep the team
out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of trouble in a program that has found it
difficult to maintain the lofty standards set by Dean Smith, who
retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina won at least one game in the NCAA tournament for
18 consecutive years before losing in the first round to Weber
State last year. This season, North Carolina lost four consecutive
games in January, dropping the Tar Heels out of the Top 25 for the
first time in a decade. They also lost five home games this season,
tying a school record, and it was ousted from the quarterfinals of
the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament by Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   While speculation about the Tar Heels' demise may make good
fodder for fans and the media, it's meaningless to the NCAA
tournament selection committee, according to one man who should
know.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holland, a former chairman of the committee, said the
panel is more impressed by a strong schedule, and on that front,
North Carolina has had few peers this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels' non-conference foes included Michigan State,
Purdue, Indiana, Louisville, Georgetown, UNLV, Miami and the
College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their non-conference schedule was just brutal,'' said Holland,
who was in Charlotte on Sunday to attend the title game of the ACC
tournament. ''I think any team that gets in with, let's say, 17 or
18 wins has to show the committee they want to be in the tournament
and that they're not afraid to play tough teams. And North Carolina
certainly has proven that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 10 teams that beat the Tar Heels this season have
won at least 16 games, and five of those have won at least 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am glad the committee rewarded us for playing a challenging
out-of-conference schedule,'' Guthridge said. ''I was afraid I may
have over-scheduled by playing what I believe is the most difficult
non-conference schedule we have ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Tar Heels were seeded so low in the NCAA
tournament was 1990, when they were assigned the No. 8 seed in the
Midwest. North Carolina won its opening-round game against
Southwest Missouri State before knocking off top-seeded and
top-ranked Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have outstanding talent and they play a great schedule,''
Mike Krzyzewski, coach of archrival Duke, said of the Tar Heels.
''They don't shy away from anybody, and they've had a winning
record in our league. They'll be very dangerous in the
tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Coaches Refuse To Wear Microphones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle SuperSonics coach Paul Westphal and
Toronto Raptors coach Butch Carter on Sunday refused to wear
microphones while coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't do it,'' Westphal said in a pregame interview
with KJR radio, explaining it would hamper his ability to coach and
he worried that tapes of his instructions to players could be used
by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The action means each team could face a $100,000 fine from the
league. Westphal said if the Sonics were fined, he would pay the
money himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an unfair restriction on my ability to compete,''
Westphal told Sonics play-by-play announcer Kevin Callabro.
</P>
<P>
   To increase TV ratings, which have fallen dramatically since
Michael Jordan left the game before the strike-shortened 1998-99
season, the NBA and NBC decided to put a microphone on coaches
during games, hoping to tap into conversations with players and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Miami Heat coach Pat Riley refused to wear the
mike. On Wednesday, the league announced that any coach refusing in
the future would have to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal earlier told the The News Tribune of Tacoma that
coaches may be inhibited in communicating to other coaches, the
referees and players.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you say something negative about a player on the other team
or your team, a referee, you can't tell me that somebody is not
going to hear that tape that you don't want to hear,'' he said.
''It's an unfair position to worry about how you are identifying
the problems. It inhibits the way you coach, the decisions.''

   PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush said today he is considering calling
for the suspension of a 4.3 cents-per-gallon ''Clinton-Gore'' gas tax hike to
combat high fuel prices. The Texas governor and presumptive Republican
presidential nominee also said the administration should be blamed for prices
that are approaching $2 per gallon because it has squandered the goodwill built
by his father in the Persian Gulf War and has no overall energy policy. As
president, Bush said he would urge Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Mexico to ''open the
spigots,'' and remind them of the U.S. role in the 1991 Gulf War and of its

McVeigh did not say he was innocent of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. The explosion killed 168 people. In

Sri Lankan Police Arrest 6 Tamils
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Police arrested six Tamils for a suicide bombing
that killed 21 people in a failed attempt to assassinate Sri Lanka's defense
minister and military chiefs, police said Sunday. The men were picked up
Saturday in two suburbs near the capital, Colombo. The bombing Friday evening,
on a route the minister was due to take, failed because the bomber -- presumed
to be a Tamil rebel -- prematurely detonated an explosive device strapped to his
chest. It killed 21 people, including a suicide bomber.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna's board of directors refused a $10 billion takeover
offer today and decided instead to split the company into independent health
care and financial services businesses. Aetna's board unanimously declined to
negotiate with two suitors who made a $10 billion takeover bid. Aetna will be
separated into two independent, publicly traded companies ''as soon as an
orderly separation can be achieved,'' Aetna Inc., based in Hartford, Conn., said
in a statement.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Duke and Michigan State were seeded No. 1 for the second
straight year in the NCAA tournament and will be joined by the Pac-10's Stanford
and Arizona as the top teams. Cincinnati, which had been ranked No. 1 in the AP
poll for 12 weeks but lost center Kenyon Martin to a broken leg last week, was
seeded second as the 64-team field was announced tonight. ''It's ridiculous,
totally ridiculous,'' Bearcats coach Bob Huggins said. ''We must be the first
team in history to be No. 1 in the RPI and not get a No. 1 seed.''

<HEADLINE> Machine Tool Spending Fell in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in January fell 13
percent from the previous month, but was up 5 percent from the
year-ago January, according to two industry groups.
</P>
<P>
   Companies spent an estimated $432 million for machine tools in
January, the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the
American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said in a joint
statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's was a significant decline from a revised $494 million for
December, but well above the $412 million spent in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the heels of a disappointing 1999, the industry is
optimistic for growth in 2000 as January orders reflect positive
activity,'' said Ralph J. Nappi, AMTDA president. ''Further
indication of a trend remains to be seen as the year unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are compiled from figures submitted by companies
participating in the U.S. Machine Tool Consumption report.

<HEADLINE> Continental Fare Increase Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A fare increase of up to $40 per roundtrip
initiated by Continental Airlines may stick, as competitors have
either matched it or continue to study the move.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in as many months that Houston-based
Continental has led bids to raise fares, blaming soaring jet fuel
prices. In January, Continental led the industry with a $20 hike.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines and Atlanta-based
Delta Air Lines said Sunday they have matched Continental's latest
increase. Northwest Airlines, based in Eagan, Minn., matched in
certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based United Airlines and St. Louis-based Trans World
Airlines were studying the increases, representatives said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest Airlines did not go along with the
increase. Attempts to reach officials Sunday from Tempe-based
America West Airlines or US Airway, with headquarters in Arlington,
Va., were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, American and Delta joined Continental in
attempting to raise fares as much as $30, but others held out and
the increase eventually was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, is attempting
this time to raise fares for roundtrip flights up to 500 miles by
$20, between 500 and 1,000 miles by $30 and flights more than 1,000
miles by $40.

<HEADLINE> Russian Reformers Support Putin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin won the backing
Sunday of some prominent Russian market reform advocates -- two
weeks before presidential elections he is expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, a leader of the Union of
Right Forces party, announced on ORT television Sunday that two
branches of the party would support Putin's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko gave no specific reason for the decision, saying only
that he was supporting Putin ''not as a person, but as an
institution of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Right Forces is in an awkward position, since one
of its leaders, Samara governor Konstantin Titov, is also running
for president. Titov is an aggressive reformer who has criticized
Putin for calling for stricter state control over some industries.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been vague about his plans for Russia's crippled
economy, but has said he would generally continue reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Voters admire Putin's hard-nosed pragmatic image, and seem
unconcerned by his silence about the economy. Polls show Putin
getting up to 60 percent of the vote, with his nearest challenger,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, receiving about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven candidates are running in the March 26 election.
Campaigning has been slack because Putin has been so far in the
lead since he took over as acting president when Boris Yeltsin
resigned Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Bush Blames Clinton on Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Sunday he is
considering calling for the suspension of a 4.3 cents-per-gallon
''Clinton-Gore'' gas tax hike to combat high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee also said the administration should be blamed for prices
that are approaching $2 per gallon because it has squandered the
goodwill built by his father in the Persian Gulf War and has no
overall energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bush said he would urge Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Mexico to ''open the spigots,'' and remind them of the U.S. role in
the 1991 Gulf War and of its economic bailout of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are countries with which we should have an enormous
amount of capital,'' Bush said after visiting the Florida
Strawberry Festival. ''These are countries where it wasn't all that
long ago that a President Bush helped Kuwait, or a United States
helped Mexico, and I think the fundamental question is 'Why not,
why can't the administration get anything done in the diplomatic
scene?''
</P>
<P>
   He later answered the question, saying of President Clinton: ''I
guess because his diplomatic policy is not that strong, his
standing in the world is not such that he can call upon our friends
when we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this weekend, Bush talked only about urging oil producers
to boost production for short-term relief from high prices, and to
increase use of natural gas and alternative fuel technologies in
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   His willingness to consider calling for a suspension of the gas
tax increase puts him at odds with Vice President Al Gore, the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson also does not support such a step, but said Clinton will
consider all options to ease the burden on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the tax increase, enacted as part of the
administration's 1993 economic recovery plan, brings in $600
million a month for road construction and repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that (a suspension) will help because the main
problem is scarcity of supplies,'' Richardson said Sunday on CNN's
''Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the
solution is ''tough negotiating with OPEC that we believe now is
going to be successful in increasing production and reducing the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush expressed
doubt about how much consumers would benefit if the tax is
suspended. He faulted Clinton, saying the president ''needs to act
much more aggressively than he has'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices were as low as 85 cents a gallon last year in some
parts of the country, and since have risen to more than $1.35 a
gallon. The Energy Department predicts prices could hit $2 per
gallon this summer -- when many Americans take to their cars for
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the increase was a March 1999 decision by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to sharply reduce
production as a means of driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, have targeted the 1993 gas tax hike -- which he calls ''the
Gore gas tax'' -- as a way of dealing with the problem. Gore's
tie-breaking vote in the Senate help push the proposal through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would oppose tapping the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a 600 million barrel stockpile in Texas and Louisiana set
aside by law for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't know how it's going to affect the overall price
of crude oil for the long term,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Hart Wins Honda Classic By a Shot  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- The biggest names in golf skipped the
Honda Classic, and they missed a wild finish Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was a four-way tie with two holes to play, then a 30-foot
putt that hung on the lip for 15 seconds before falling in, then a
one-stroke penalty after the round ended.
</P>
<P>
   The most excitement was generated by Dudley Hart, who birdied
the final four holes to overcome a three-shot deficit for his
second PGA Tour title.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who lives 20 minutes from the Heron Bay course, pleased
the gallery by playing the final 10 holes in 6-under-par. He shot
65 to finish at 19-under 269, one stroke ahead of Kevin Wentworth
and J.P. Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gratifying that I played well in front of all my family
and friends,'' said Hart, who earned $522,000. ''When you're trying
to get tickets for everybody and show them a good time, there can
be a lot of distractions. I'm glad I was able to put it all
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   His round was over before Hart became aware of one potential
distraction involving a putt by Brian Gay on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, bidding for his first tour title, appeared to tie Hart for
the lead when his 30-foot putt from the fringe sat on the lip, then
fell into the cup. But on the final hole Gay three-putted from 75
feet for his first bogey since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the round ended, rules official Slugger White assessed Gay
a one-stroke penalty at No. 17 because of the delay before the putt
fell in. That left Gay tied with Jim Furyk in fourth place at 17
under.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty resulted from rule 16-2, which states that when the
ball overhangs the lip, it is considered at rest 10 seconds after
the player reaches the hole. If the ball falls in after that, the
player is assessed a one-stroke penalty.
</P>
<P>
   White viewed television replays with Gay and determined that the
ball fell into the cup at least 13 seconds after Gay walked up to
the hole. He stood over the ball, waving his index finger as he
coaxed it into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Gay noted that he could have avoided a penalty by walking more
slowly to the hole, thus giving the ball more time to fall in
before the 10-second rule took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally I think it's a huge gray area,'' Gay said.
''There's a lot more leeway than three seconds, and it was a pretty
important stroke for me. ... Both of the guys I was playing with
thought I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the penalty dropped Gay from second place to fourth, it
cost him $88,933 -- more than he made all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 of the world's 30 top-ranked players skipping the
tournament, unfamiliar names dominated the leaderboard all week.
But the contenders played well down the stretch, and Hart played
the best.
</P>
<P>
   A strong wind that blew for most of the tournament died down as
the leaders reached the final few holes, and Hart took advantage.
Playing in the next-to-last threesome, he made a 20-foot putt at
No. 17 to tie Gay and Wentworth for the lead, then sank a 3-footer
at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The only other PGA Tour victory for Hart, 31, came in the 1996
Canadian Open. He said the win was especially gratifying because
his father is recovering from recent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad, I'm keeping this trophy,'' he said with a grin. ''You got
the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth, who had made only one cut in six previous tournaments
this year, shot 65 but couldn't hold his brief lead. Hayes, the
leader after the second and third rounds, struggled to a
final-round 70.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk, who came from six strokes behind with seven holes left to
win the Doral-Ryder Open last week, played the final six holes
Sunday in 3 under and shot 67. He nearly holed out from a trap for
birdie at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Davis Love III, the top-ranked player in the field, tied
the course record with an 8-under 64 and finished 12 under. ... Not
too colorful: The final threesome of Gay, Hayes and Jonathan Kaye
all wore white shirts. ... Because of the changing wind direction,
club selection on the 222-yard No. 15 ranged from a 4-wood to a
6-iron. ... Mike Hulbert finished 12 under to earn his first check
this year. He had missed the cut in all six previous tournaments.
... Casey Martin, who rode a cart after winning an appellate court
ruling last week, couldn't capitalize on an opening 66. He shot 75
Sunday and finished 5 under.

<HEADLINE> No.5 Mich St 76, No.25 Illinois 61  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A second No. 1 seed in a row is nice. So is
staying close to home in the Midwest Regional so the huge crowd of
Michigan State faithful can tag along.
</P>
<P>
   But the fifth-ranked Spartans are after something bigger, so
they'll save their celebrating for a few more weeks, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have a No. 1 seed. It says a lot about what
we've accomplished, but it's a new season,'' Morris Peterson said
after the NCAA tournament brackets were announced Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our eyes are on the national championship,'' Peterson said.
''Our seeding is not going to get us a national championship, so we
have to get ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (26-7) sealed its second straight No. 1 seed with
a 76-61 victory over No. 25 Illinois in the Big Ten tournament
championship game about 45 minutes before the brackets were
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans will play 16th-seeded Valparaiso on Thursday in
Cleveland. Illinois (21-9) got a No. 4 seed in the East Regional
and will play 13th-seeded Pennsylvania in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're not too worried about our seed. We're just
ready to play,'' Illinois' Cory Bradford said. ''We still feel good
about ourselves and we won't let this loss let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans stayed at the United Center to watch the pairings
announcement, cramming into a restaurant with about 100 family and
friends. When the No. 1 seeds were announced, the room erupted in
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Izzo pumped his fist and Mateen Cleaves, sitting next
to him, started clapping.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a (heck) of an accomplishment,'' Izzo said. ''I think
it's even tougher than people realize. Maybe even tougher than I
realize. To get to that level again, the Dukes have done it for
years, the North Carolinas. As I said before, that's where we are
trying to get this program and it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are starting in the exact spot they did last year,
when they advanced to the Final Four. They're also staying close to
home. regional semifinals and finals will be played in Auburn
Hills, Mich., a 90-minute drive from East Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ready to deal with (ticket requests),'' Cleaves said. ''If
I have to deal with that, then we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Spartans have been winning with defense all year,
that wasn't what did in Illinois on Sunday. It wasn't Peterson and
his amazing array of all-around skills or Cleaves steady
leadership, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was Andre Hutson's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson hit Bradford in the nose during a scramble under the
basket with 7{ minutes left in the first half, temporarily knocking
Illinois' leading scorer out of the game and permanently derailing
the Illini.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did make a little bit of a run and in games like this, so
close and so physical, one run can make the difference,'' Izzo
said. ''I think today it did make the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from the sight of their team leader collapsing as he
tried to walk to the bench, the Illini had four quick turnovers and
a fifth before halftime, and went 3-of-8 from the field. Their
defense collapsed, too, as Cleaves and Peterson led the Spartans on
a 20-8 run, taking a 35-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford returned for the second half, his nose swollen, bruised
and possibly broken, but it was too late. Hutson converted on a
three-point play and followed with a layup, and Peterson hit a
3-pointer to give Michigan State a 45-32 lead with 17:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was time for us to pick it up regardless of whether he went
out or not,'' Cleaves said. ''But when you have a guy like that
that goes out, you do want to pick it up a tad bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson finished with 14 points, four rebounds and three steals
and was named outstanding player of the tournament. Cleaves had 12
points and six assists. A.J. Granger led the Spartans with 17
points, and Hutson added 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford went 2-of-9 in the second half, finishing with 10
points on 4-of-15 shooting. Frank Williams led the Illini with 11
points and Cleotis Brown had 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have to win the little battles,'' Bradford said.
''They go for 40 minutes and we can for about 38{.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 13 minutes of the game, the Illini gave Michigan
State everything it could handle. The Spartans turned the ball over
six times, with Brown taking the sixth miscue in for a dunk and a
16-15 lead with 8:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the deflating collision. As they scrambled for a loose
ball under the Michigan State basket, Hutson elbowed Bradford and
he crumpled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just got poked in the nose,'' Bradford said. ''I fooled
around down there with their big guys and I got it broke.''
</P>
<P>
   After laying on the ground for a few minutes, he was helped to
his feet, but he managed to walk only a few steps before collapsing
again. The United Center went silent as he knelt on the floor, his
face buried in a towel, and the Illini watched their team leader in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need his shooting out there all the time,'' center Brian
Cook said. ''He's our best shooter and if he's not there, we miss
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When they retook the court, Lucas Johnson immediately turned the
ball over. Williams missed a layup, Sergio McClain had another
turnover, McClain's shot on the next possession was blocked and
then Brown missed a 10-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after Bradford left, Damir Krupalija finally found
the basket on a layup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Routs Portugal in Algarve Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUFEIRA, Portugal (AP) -- Cindy Parlow scored three goals as
the United States routed Portugal 7-0 Sunday in the first round of
the Algarve Cup international women's soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Fawcett, Tisha Venturini, Shannon McMillan and Julie Foudy
also scored for the defending World Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to start off such a high-quality tournament with a
game like this, especially coming back from my injury,'' said
Parlow, who upped her career international goal total to 29 in her
first game of 2000 after recovering from a hamstring pull. ''With a
new formation and some players in different positions, it builds
confidence for the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was delayed 75 minutes because of heavy rains and
eventually moved, from Francisco Viera Stadium in Silves to the
U.S. training site. As much as three inches of standing water
soaked the stadium field, promoting the Norwegian officiating crew
to deem the field unplayable and move the game.
</P>
<P>
   The delay didn't bother the Americans, who scored three goals in
a six-minute span during the game's first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-goal margin was the biggest ever for the United States
in the prestigious tournament, which the Americans haven't won in
five attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Coach April Heinrichs saw some value from the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Games offer a different kind of pressure than training,
especially in some of the tackling,'' said Heinrichs. ''Every now
and then it's good to have a game like this to establish some
possession and get our legs under us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans next play Tuesday against Denmark, the team they
beat in the World Cup opener last year. The final opening-round
game for the United States is against Sweden on Thursday. If the
Americans win their group, they advance to the final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the other Group A game, Sweden beat Denmark 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   In Group B, Sun Wen scored twice as China, which beat the United
States last year in the Algarve Cup final, but lost to the U.S.
team in the World Cup final, beat Canada 4-0. In the other Group B
game, Norway beat Finland 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Try To Reach Final Four  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michigan State, which reached the Final Four as the No. 1 seed
in the Midwest a year ago, gets to try to do the same thing this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-ranked Spartans secured the top seed in the Midwest
bracket by winning the Big Ten tournament championship Sunday. It
looked for much of the season as though Cincinnati would wind up as
the Midwest's top seed, but the Bearcats lost to Saint Louis in the
Conference USA tournament after their top player, Kenyon Martin,
got hurt early in the game. Cincinnati was made the No. 2 seed in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (26-7) have what it takes to make another run deep
into the tournament. They play tremendous defense, have superb
guard play led by Mateen Cleaves and they're experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ''These players, these seniors, have taken us so far,'' coach
Tom Izzo said after Sunday's 76-61 victory over Illinois in the Big
Ten tourney title game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's first-round opponent, Valparaiso, is in the
tournament for the fifth straight year and has a bit of experience
pulling off upsets. It was two years ago that Bryce Drew's
buzzer-beater got the Crusaders, then seeded 13th, past
fourth-seeded Mississippi in the first round of the Midwest
regional. But this time Valparaiso is the No. 16 seed, with a
record of just 19-12, and no 16th-seeded team ever has won an NCAA
tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State capped its remarkable season Sunday with a victory
over Oklahoma in the title game of the Big 12 tournament and was
rewarded with the No. 2 seeding. The Cyclones (29-4), picked to
finish no better than seventh in the conference, also won the
regular-season title with a 14-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   They are led by one of the most powerful players in the country,
Big 12 player of the year Marcus Fizer, who enters the NCAA
tournament with a ton of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to play to our potential to get the respect we
deserve,'' he said after scoring 22 points on Sunday. ''If you
don't respect us, we go out and beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones will play 15th-seeded Central Connecticut State
(25-5) in the first round. Central Connecticut, the champion of the
Northeast Conference, is making its first NCAA tournament
appearance since joining Division I in 1986. The Blue Devils
finished 4-22 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 and 4 seeds in the Midwest are Maryland and Syracuse.
Maryland (24-9) closed out the season by winning 11 of its final 14
games, and one of those losses came Sunday against Duke in the
championship of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (24-5) opened the season 19-0, but heads into the NCAA
tournament having split its final 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The region's fifth and sixth seeds have two of the richest
histories in the game. Kentucky (22-9) is making its 42nd NCAA
appearance, and its 86 game wins are more than any other team has.
No. 6 seed UCLA (19-11) has 11 championships to its credit.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are No. 11 seed Ball State and
12th-seeded St. Bonaventure. Ball State is making its first NCAA
appearance in five years, while St. Bonaventure hasn't been in the
tournament since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mystery teams in the region could be Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (23-9) lost their final four games of the regular
season, following the NCAA's suspension of star player Chris
Porter. But they regrouped during the Southeastern Conference
tournament and reached Sunday's title game, which they lost to
upstart Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, making its sixth straight appearance under coach Rick
Majerus, is the eighth seed and will play No. 9 seed Saint Louis
(19-13), which used its upset of Cincinnati to propel itself to the
championship of the Conference USA tournament.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Allison Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky starting guard Desmond Allison
has been suspended and is not expected to play again this season
following his arrest on drunk driving charges, coach Tubby Smith
announced Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension came on the same day Kentucky (22-9) received a
fifth seed in the Midwest region of the NCAA tournament. The
Wildcats will play 12th-seeded St. Bonaventure on Thursday in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, a 6-foot-5 sophomore from Tampa, Fla., was arrested
early Sunday morning in Lexington and charged with driving under
the influence. He had played in all 31 games this season, averaging
7.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Athletics Association's Student-Athlete Alcohol
Policy, Allison will be suspended temporarily. If he is convicted
of the charges, however, he will be suspended indefinitely and
forfeit his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have educated our team on the use of alcohol time and time
again, yet we have a young man who chose to put his life, and the
lives of others, in danger,'' Smith said in a statement. ''I am
deeply disappointed in his actions and it comes at a time when our
team and our fans should be excited about March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, Desmond will now have to pay the price, and we will
abide by the Athletics Association's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky athletics director C.M. Newton unveiled the policy nine
days after a Nov. 15, 1998 crash that killed Kentucky football
player Artie Steinmetz and Eastern Kentucky student Christopher
Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kentucky center Jason Watts, the driver of the truck,
pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless homicide but was released
on shock probation after serving four months of a 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kentucky basketball player, sophomore guard J.P.
Blevins, was suspended for a game and referred to alcohol
counseling after a public intoxication charge in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Elian Benefit Raises Thousands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- About $215,000 has flowed into Elian Gonzalez's
defense fund since fund raising began to help pay for legal costs
in the battle to keep the 6-year-old Cuban boy in the United
States, his family here says.
</P>
<P>
   More than $200,000 was raised through a radio marathon Saturday
on four Spanish-language stations, family spokesman, Armando
Gutierrez, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Those donations were added to $15,000 raised earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's donations included five $1,000 checks, including one
from Demetrio Perez, the Cuban-born director of the Lincoln-Marti,
the private school Elian attends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting all kinds of donations,'' Gutierrez said. ''And
we really haven't advertised it outside Miami-Dade County.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 others drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The boy quickly became the subject of an international
tug-of-war, with his father in Cuba demanding his return and his
relatives in Miami fighting to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the boy are awaiting a ruling from U.S. District
Judge K. Michael Moore, who heard arguments Thursday on whether to
interfere with a decision by federal immigration officials to send
Elian back to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Paper Interviews Israeli PM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Algerian newspaper has for the first time
published an interview with an Israeli prime minister, bringing
praise Sunday from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office issued a statement
Sunday saying it welcomed the publication Thursday of the brief
interview in Algeria's El Khabar. The story included a large,
front-page photograph of Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The story was followed Saturday by a vote of the Arab League in
Beirut that called upon Arab countries to reconsider normalizing
relations with Israel because of Israeli air strikes last month on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office ''expressed satisfaction with the publication,
its content and its display, especially in light of the decision of
the Arab foreign ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the daily, apparently by telephone, that there have
never been any official contacts between the two countries -- which
do not have diplomatic relations -- but ''certain people have
unofficially tried to bring the positions closer.'' He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Algiers can play a very important role in the Middle East
peace process,'' Barak told El Khabar. ''Any initiative of Algeria
in this direction would be warmly welcomed by me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barak declined to comment on a stalemate in
peace talks with Syria and a Syrian demand that Israel promise to
return the Golan Heights as a condition for resuming negotiations.
He also would not discuss his promise to withdraw troops from south
Lebanon by July, El Khabar wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika became the
first Algerian premier to publicly speak to an Israeli leader when
he shook hands with Barak at the funeral of Morocco's King Hassan
II.

Bush, Gore Heighten Campaign Charges
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush ate his way through a strawberry
festival today while Al Gore preached against racism, but the placid settings
did not deter a biting exchange between the two presidential contenders. Bush,
appearing near Tampa with his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said ''I wasn't
sure if it was an April Fool's edition'' when he picked up today's newspaper and
saw Gore promising to make campaign finance reform an issue. Meanwhile, in an
interview with The Associated Press, Gore said Bush's five-year, $483-billion
tax-cut plan would put Social Security, Medicare and health care in general at
risk.

Clinton Attacks NRA Over Gun Laws

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and a top official of the National Rifle
Association traded barbs today over a new advertising campaign in which NRA
President Charlton Heston all but accuses the president of lying in his
characterizations of the group as an impediment to sensible laws and public
safety. But the sparring was more broadly over Clinton's effort to win
congressional approval of some of the gun controls that have eluded him so far
and to inject the subject into the presidential campaign. Appearing on ABC's
''This Week,'' Clinton said the NRA was ''ruthlessly brutal'' in helping defeat
members of Congress who voted for laws such as the Brady Bill.

Pope Asks For Pardon of Catholic Sins

who vowed to cleanse and reinvigorate Catholicism for its third millennium. The
church burned heretics at the stake during the Inquisition. Armies of the
faithful slaughtered Muslims during the Crusades. And during the Holocaust, some
Catholics stood silent in the face of Nazi genocide.

Richardson Opposes Lifting Gas Tax

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today he opposes
temporarily lifting a 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax because of high fuel
prices, but said the president ''will consider all options'' to bring relief to
consumers. A growing number of lawmakers have begun gauging whether there is
enough support in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline excise tax imposed in
1993 until prices at the pump recede. Richardson, appearing today's television
talk shows, noted that Republicans were divided on the matter and said he didn't
think suspending the tax would help because the problem is scarcity of oil.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Buoyed by a robust economy, Prime Minister Jose Maria

absolute majority in Parliament. Jubilant supporters of Aznar's conservative
Popular Party waved red and yellow Spanish flags in a victory rally outside
party headquarters in Madrid. Party officials said the victory had given Aznar,
one of the European Union's last remaining conservative leaders, a clear mandate
to continue free-market policies that he credits for vibrant economic growth and

Japan's Economy in Recession

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy shrank in the third quarter of the fiscal year,
pushing it back into recession, the government said Monday, fanning doubts about
whether the country can overcome its worst economic slump in decades. The Asia
financial crisis, which began in Thailand in 1997, pushed Japan, the world's
second largest economy, into its worst recession since World War II. It later
began to recover, but consumer spending is still low, as many Japanese remain
nervous about the fate economy and the security of their jobs.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Amonte scored three goals and Alexei
Zhamnov had a goal and two assists as the Chicago Blackhawks beat
the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-1 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte scored two of Chicago's three unanswered goals in the
first period. Zhamnov, who scored the other goal in the frame,
assisted on both Amonte goals.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte completed the hat trick by scoring into a empty-net goal
with less than a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago swept a two-game, two-day Florida road trip. The Hawks
beat Florida 5-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Warriner scored a third-period goal for Tampa Bay, which
has dropped seven straight games. It's the third time this season
the Lightning have lost that many in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Zhamnov scored a rebound goal at 4:56 of the first. Two minutes
later Amonte scored from the slot, and then added his 36th goal on
the power play 1:33 before the period ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the goal, the Blackhawks are 2-for-25 with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defenseman Petr Svoboda played in his 1,000 career
game. During a pregame ceremony, it was announced that the
All-Star, who could have become a free agent following the season,
signed a new multiyear deal with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago played without left wing Eric Daze (back spasms) and
defenseman Bryan McCabe (cheek). Left wing Michal Grosek, acquired
from Buffalo in the Doug Gilmour trade, made his Chicago debut.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Johnny Newman came off the bench to
score a season-high 26 points and lead the New Jersey Nets past the
Orlando Magic 129-91 Sunday night for their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets ended Orlando's winning streak at three and moved
within three games of the Magic and the Milwaukee Bucks for the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, winner of nine of its last 12 at home, opened some
breathing room midway through the second quarter with an 18-6 burst
that produced a 59-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets never let Orlando get within 10 points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's final run at keeping the game close came late in the
third period, when a Pat Garrity jumper pulled the visitors within
81-70 with 2:50 remaining. But New Jersey answered with 14 straight
points, including the last five by Newman, in a run bridging the
third and fourth quarters that opened up a commanding 97-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell finished with 16 for New Jersey. Darrell Armstrong led
the Magic with 15.
Notes: Magic forward Ron Mercer sat out the game, serving a
one-game suspension for a post-game fight with Denver's George
McCloud Saturday night. ... Magic center John Amaechi was poked in
the eye, had his nose bloodied and went to the locker room for
treatment late in the first period but returned to action late in
the second. ... The Nets, who are 18-12 at home, play seven of
their next 10 games in New Jersey, while the Magic play four of
their next five on the road.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 93, Spurs 80  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nine months later than they needed to, the New
York Knicks defended their home court against the San Antonio Spurs
with the zeal of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell scored 24 points, Patrick Ewing added 21 and
Allan Houston had 20 as the Knicks beat San Antonio 93-80 Sunday in
the Spurs' first visit to Madison Square Garden since winning the
title there in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks dominated throughout, maintaining a double-digit lead
most of the second half to end San Antonio's three-game winning
streak and stay one game behind Miami in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest factor was the way the Knicks contained Tim
Duncan, the MVP of last year's finals when multiple injuries
limited the number of defenders New York had available against him.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at Duncan with double-teams every time he got the ball,
the Knicks held him to 15 points on 7-for-19 shooting and never let
him get into a groove. David Robinson led San Antonio with 22
points, although just 10 came after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson added 13 points, Ewing had 15 rebounds and moved
into 14th place on the NBA career scoring list, and Sprewell had
eight rebounds and seven assists. The Knicks outrebounded their
fourth straight opponent after being outrebounded in seven straight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing passed Robert Parish (23,334 career points) for 14th place
on his second basket of the game, a corner jumper over Robinson
midway through the first quarter for an 18-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had 14 points in the first quarter, scoring almost at
will against defenders Antonio Daniels and Jaren Jackson. But the
Knicks went into a slump when Sprewell took a rest early in the
second quarter, watching a 34-22 lead shrink to 42-41.
</P>
<P>
   After Robinson picked up his third foul and coach Gregg Popovich
got a technical for arguing, the Knicks closed the quarter with a
12-6 run -- including a 3-pointer by Chris Childs at the buzzer --
for a 54-47 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing took over in the third quarter, scoring 11 points as the
Knicks steadily built their advantage. Ewing started a 7-0 run with
a corner jumper and ended it with a pass to Houston for a jumper
that made it 71-55.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio got its deficit down to nine early in the fourth
quarter, but John Wallace spun in for a layup and Johnson hit a
3-pointer on the fast break to restore a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs pulled to 89-80 with 2:06 left, but Robinson missed a
jumper in the lane and Johnson wrestled the rebound away from
Duncan to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sean Elliott still expects to return to the lineup for San
Antonio on Tuesday against Atlanta, making him the first
professional athlete to come back from a kidney transplant. ''I
don't know if I have anything left to be afraid of,'' he said. ''It
can't be harder than what I went through last August.'' ... Antonio
Daniels made his first start of the season, with Mario Elie moving
from shooting guard to small forward and Jerome Kersey moving to
the bench. ... San Antonio guard Terry Porter, sidelined for four
games with a strained knee ligament, is targeting Thursday or
Saturday for his return. ... New York forward Marcus Camby, out
with a bad knee, has had his recovery slowed by the flu. ...
Charles Barkley, with 23,755 points, is the next player ahead of
Ewing on the career scoring list.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Tarkanian Back in Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- He's back.
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-year hiatus, Jerry Tarkanian is heading to the NCAA
tournament. His Fresno State Bulldogs meet Wisconsin in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers erupted Sunday in the Bulldog Brewery, where Tarkanian
and his team heard the news on television. ''Everybody was
excited,'' he said. ''But we knew we were going to get a bid. We
won our tournament. We won our last eight games.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State beat Tulsa 75-72 to clinch the Western Athletic
Conference championship Saturday night. The title didn't guarantee
the Bulldogs an NCAA tournament spot, because half of the WAC's 16
teams left for the Mountain West last year; neither conference had
an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   But it was pretty hard to deny the Bulldogs after a 24-9 record,
including three wins over Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian has led the Bulldogs to five straight seasons of at
least 20 wins, but Fresno State has not been invited to the NCAA
tournament in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have gone to the NIT the past four seasons, a move
that ''would have been devastating for the kids'' a fifth time,
Tarkanian said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian has battled with the NCAA for decades. His teams got
into trouble at Long Beach State and UNLV, and he spent years in
court fighting the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble has continued at Fresno State. A federal
investigation into allegations of point-shaving by Fresno State
players four seasons ago remains open. And several of Tarkanian's
players at Fresno have had serious legal problems, including
prosecution for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian is sixth on the NCAA tournament list with 37
victories. His UNLV team won the national title in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Arizona No.1, Woods Might Not Play  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Wildcats got the No. 1 seed in
the West, but along with it came the news that they apparently will
be without 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods for the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA
selection committee, said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were notified that Loren Woods would not play in the
tournament,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that prognosis, the selection committee still gave
Arizona the West's top seed because of the Wildcats' 86-81
homecourt victory over Stanford last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw Arizona play Stanford without Loren Woods and beat
them,'' Thompson said, ''so there was a test there.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (26-6) will play Jackson State (17-15) of the
Southwestern Athletic Conference on Thursday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Thompson's remarks, Arizona coach Lute Olson
insisted he had not been told by doctors that the back injury that
has sidelined Woods for the past five games would definitely keep
him out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''That information has not reached me yet,'' Olson said. ''(Team
trainer) Ed Orr is right here and Ed certainly would have told me
if he's gotten the final report from the doctors, unless somehow or
another the committee had information directly from the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood is a member of the NCAA
selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods can't play, Olson said his young team will just have to
do without him. Adversity is nothing new for the Wildcats, who went
almost the entire Pac-10 season without forward Richard Jefferson
because of a broken foot and has been hit with a number of
defections, injuries and other setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team knows that they lace 'em up and we'll play with
whomever we have,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a junior transfer from Wake Forest, has what has been
described as a compression injury to a disk in his back. Doctors
believe the injury occurred Feb. 12 at Washington State. Woods
continued to play until the pain grew unbearable following
Arizona's home victory over Southern California on Feb. 17. The
Wildcats were 3-2 without their center, beating UCLA, Stanford and
California at home but losing at Oregon State and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona finished tied with Stanford for the Pac-10 title but
received the conference's automatic NCAA bid because it beat the
Cardinal twice. Olson said anything but the No. 1 seed in the West
would have been unfair to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly didn't see any way they could not put our guys as
the No. 1 seed in the West,'' Olson said, ''particularly because
we've played so long without Loren Woods. We played and beat
Stanford without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said his video crew has a tape of Jackson State and was
making copies for the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''But as far as how they play or who they have or anything else,
I really don't know and I won't know that until that copy is made
and delivered to me so that I can get started on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats beat Jackson State 111-83 in Tucson early in the
1996-97 season, the year Arizona won the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played an up-tempo style, used a lot of people, but I
don't know if that's still what they're doing or not,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State earned the NCAA bid by rallying from a 14-point
halftime deficit to beat Southern University 76-61 for the SWAC
tournament title.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Stays Out West as Top Seed  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything that could've gone wrong for Arizona did this season,
yet the young Wildcats emerged as the No. 1 seed in the West
Region.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (26-6) tied Stanford for the Pac-10 title, but earned
the conference's automatic berth in the NCAA tournament with two
victories over the Cardinal. Stanford wound up as the top seed in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see any way that they could move us out of here with
the record that we've had against top 15 or 20 teams. I think it's
the best in the country of anybody,'' coach Lute Olson said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats will play 16th-seeded Jackson State (17-15)
Thursday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were sent there because the other half of the West
bracket is being played on Arizona's homecourt at McKale Center in
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain whether 7-foot-1 Loren Woods will return from a
back injury in time for Thursday's game. Olson said Sunday that he
hasn't been notified by doctors that Woods will be out for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have Richard Jefferson back. He returned three games
ago after breaking his foot in the first win at Stanford on Jan. 8.
He scored 19 points in the second win over the Cardinal last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the question had come up regarding our health
situation. Will Loren play? Will he not play?'' Olson said. ''But
we've played without him for the last month now and we still beat
Stanford, so on what basis would there be to not keep us in the
West?''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's roster was reduced to no more than seven scholarship
players -- all but one freshmen and sophomores -- because of
injuries, transfers, medical and academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think with a six-man rotation, we deserve to be the No. 1
seed,'' Arizona's Michael Wright said Saturday. ''We won the Pac-10
title. We deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, the No. 2 seed, will cross a few time zones to
Tucson for a first-round matchup Thursday against Northern Arizona
(20-10). The Red Storm (24-7) beat Connecticut 80-70 to win the Big
East Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. John's had to be the best No. 2 seed to be sent out of
their region,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Tucson on Thursday, No. 3 seed Oklahoma (26-6) will play
14th-seeded Winthrop (21-8) and No. 6 Purdue (21-9) takes on No. 11
Dayton (22-8) in a matchup of Midwest teams.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Louisville (19-11) has the unenviable task of playing
10th-seeded Gonzaga (24-8) of the West Coast Conference. Last year,
the Zags came within one win of the Final Four, losing by five
points to eventual champion Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake, No. 8 Wisconsin (18-13) takes on No. 9 Fresno
State (24-9), with the winner likely facing Arizona in the second
round. That would make for an intriguing matchup between Wildcats
coach Lute Olson and Jerry Tarkanian, who has the Bulldogs in the
tournament for the first time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian, the subject of a decades-long investigation by the
NCAA, returns to the tournament for the first time since leading
UNLV to the Final Four in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The other games Thursday in Salt Lake are fourth-seeded
Louisiana State against No. 13 Southeast Missouri State (24-6) and
No. 5 Texas (23-8) against 12th-seeded Indiana State (22-9) of the
Missouri Valley Conference.
</P>
<P>
   LSU is back in the NCAAs for the first time in years under coach
John Brady, who replaced Dale Brown in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, co-champions of the Southeastern Conference and 26-5
overall, are in the same region as Arizona, which lost at Baton
Rouge this season.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Brady think of the possibility of playing them
again?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say when people ask me that,'' he said
Sunday. ''Arizona is fine. We beat them at our place. I don't think
Arizona is looking forward to playing us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State is another team with a storied past that is back
in the tournament. The Sycamores haven't been to the NCAAs since
Larry Bird led them to the 1979 title game, where Indiana State
lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar traded higher against the yen early
Monday after Japan reported a larger-than-expected contraction in
the economy in October-December. Tokyo stocks slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.51 yen, up 0.23 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 106.22 yen on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 33.91 points,
or 0.17 percent, to 19,716.49 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed up 88.07 points, or 0.45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened slightly against
the yen after Japan's Economic Planning Agency said gross domestic
product, the total value of Japan's produced goods and services,
fell 1.4 percent in October-December over the July-September
period.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in GDP, more than expected because market analysts
had predicted a fall of only 0.9 percent, raised doubts about
whether the nation can overcome its worst economic slump in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.38 yen, down
from 102.84 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started lower as some investors were
discouraged by the GDP data, a key indicator of the economy's
viability.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impact of the EPA announcement appeared limited.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was factored in for the most part,'' said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.91 to
9,928.82 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 23.13 points, or 1.42 percent, to 1,710.17
points. The TOPIX closed down 10.47 points, or 0.64 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Friday, it settled at 1.8200 percent
and its price stood at 99.83.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champ Swingley Far Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNALAKLEET, Alaska (AP) -- Defending champion Doug Swingley was
so far ahead Sunday in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race that his
closest competitors think it will be nearly impossible to catch
him.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley of Lincoln, Mont., left this checkpoint 851 miles from
the race start in Anchorage at 9:34 a.m., after completing the
90-mile run from Kaltag in about nine hours. He reached Shaktoolik,
171 miles from the finish line in Nome, at 2:17 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley had the checkpoint to himself during a six-hour break
here Sunday. And with his nearest challenger hours behind him, the
Montana musher wasn't feeling lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just like being by myself where I'm not affected by anybody
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof arrived one hour and 17 minutes after
Swingley's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt said he got a chance to see Swingley's team up close on
the Kaltag River.
</P>
<P>
   ''He passed me on the river. He was flying,'' Gebhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   If Swingley keeps up the pace, he could cross the finish line
about 250 miles away in Nome sometime Tuesday afternoon to complete
the race in about nine days. Swingley set the course record for the
southern route in 1995 with a time of nine days, two hours and 42
seconds set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt, competing in his fourth Iditarod after finishing sixth
last year, said Swingley can't be overtaken at this point, even if
he slows his team from its 10 mph pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to have a problem, a big problem, like his sled falling
into the ocean,'' Gebhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhart hit the trail again at 4:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As for teams falling farther behind, they're not trying to catch
Swingley at this point, Gebhardt said. Mushers, such as three-time
winner Martin Buser of Big Lake and the race's only five-time
winner Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, have been reduced to a
''maintenance run'' where they've given up trying to win, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramy Brooks of Healy, who arrived third at 11:58 a.m., said his
team was running as well as he hoped but Swingley was too far ahead
to catch. He was looking forward to the race being over.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to get there and get it all done with,'' said
Brooks, who last year won the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest, a race many
mushers consider tougher than the Iditarod.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope for the other mushers was if Swingley got caught
in a storm along the Bering Sea Coast on his way to Nome or if
something else unexpected occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless some major catastrophe happens, ... it's his race,''
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Boulding of Manley moved into second place Sunday when
he passed through the Unalakleet checkpoint without resting his dog
team. Boulding, a 58-year-old trapper, is running his seventh
Iditarod and finished fifth last year. His best finish was in 1998
when he finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Iditarod winner Jeff King of Denali Park, fifth into
Unalakleet, said if Swingley continues to have good fortune and his
dog team keeps up the pace he could break his 1995 record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug really poured it on, didn't he? It's amazing,'' King
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt said Swingley's dogs may have the advantage because the
Montanan trains them in the mountains where the air is thinner.
When he brings them to Alaska, they perform well in what for them
is oxygen-rich air.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing we can do about that,'' Gebhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley said he planned to slow his team down between here and
the next checkpoint at Shaktoolik, 42 miles away. Even if he kept
up the same pace, he said he didn't think he could beat his record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm already off record pace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley was comfortable enough with his team's performance to
change leaders in Unalakleet, putting an inexperienced 2-year-old,
Cloud, next to her mother, Stormy. He attached a line between
mother and daughter to help Cloud get the hang of being a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about anything,'' Swingley said when asked how
his race was going.

<HEADLINE> Coach Stunned by Cincy's No.2 Seed  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Coach Bob Huggins called Cincinnati's slide to
a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament a ridiculous, crazy and
historic development.
</P>
<P>
   He also wondered aloud why the Bearcats seem to get such
disappointment on selection Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we always the ones that have to make history?''
Huggins said with an edge to his voice and a set of keys twirling
around his left hand. ''That's what I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Bearcats have fumed about repeatedly being sent
to Utah for the tournament, getting paired with Temple and winding
up with a lower seed than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was incredulous Sunday that the NCAA selection committee
stripped the Bearcats of a No. 1 seed because they lost Kenyon
Martin to a broken leg while losing their first game in the
Conference USA tournament three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins had been convinced that the double-barrel loss of the
game and the star center wouldn't affect Cincinnati's seeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think there was any question,'' he said. ''We're No.
1 in the (Rating Percentage Index). Tell me the last time a team
that was No. 1 in the RPI hasn't had a No. 1 seed. ... I mean, it's
crazy. I don't understand that. I don't understand the rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA selection committee, said
the committee considered what the Bearcats will be like without
Martin, who broke his leg three minutes into a 10-point loss to
Saint Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played one game -- 37 minutes -- without Kenyon Martin,''
Thompson said. ''Those are the things that are very hard to project
or predict because we base it on who will be playing this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said it shouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do they know how good we are without Kenyon?'' Huggins
asked. ''From what the guy just said, they judged what we were for
37 minutes without Kenyon. Did they take into (account) the fact
that our guys just sat there and watched a very traumatic
experience? Did they take that into consideration?''
</P>
<P>
   The loss cost Cincinnati a chance to play in Cleveland as the
No. 1 seed in the Midwest. Instead, the Bearcats became the No. 2
seed in the South and will play North Carolina-Wilmington (18-12)
on Friday in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Martin broke his leg last Thursday in the conference tournament
in Memphis, Tenn. He watched the selection show in private with
teammates, then was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He called it,'' forward Jermaine Tate said. ''He said we were
going to go South and get a No. 2 even before it came down.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction when he turned out to be correct?
</P>
<P>
   ''We were shocked but not surprised,'' Tate said. ''It was kind
of an insult, but Kenyon's hurt. We just have to go out and prove
that we're still a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Ryan Fletcher, who will move into the starting lineup
with Martin hurt, understood the selection committee's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can kind of justify it either way,'' Fletcher said. ''I
can see them giving us a No. 1 because of the regular season we
had. But at the same time, there's the fact that we lost the
opening game of our conference tournament and we lost our best
player. I can understand that they're giving us a No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fulfilled all the criteria they said to fulfill,'' Huggins
said. ''They said to play a great nonconference schedule -- we've
done that. We've gone through our league undefeated. We're No. 1 in
the RPI. It's not like we haven't done what we're supposed to do.''

<HEADLINE> Leafs' Berard May Lose Sight in Eye  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan
Berard could lose the sight in his right eye, which was hit by the
stick of Ottawa's Marian Hossa.
</P>
<P>
   Hossa was following through on a shot when his stick struck
Berard during the second period of Toronto's 4-2 victory Saturday
over the Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we saw him get hit, we knew it was very, very
serious,'' Berard's father Wally said, after arriving Sunday
afternoon at Ottawa Airport from Boston. ''We just saw the big pile
of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, in his fourth season in the NHL, crumpled to his knees
with his forehead on the ice in a pool of blood. He was taken from
Corel Centre on a stretcher and rushed to Ottawa Civic Hospital,
where he underwent surgery overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prospect of regaining vision in the eye is slim but
further evaluation will take place,'' the Maple Leafs said in a
recorded message.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, who turned 23 on March 5, might be released from the
hospital on Monday, and then return to Toronto, according to his
agent Tom Laidlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not too positive, but until we've pursued all angles that
we can pertaining to specialists, I don't think anybody has given
up hope yet,'' Laidlaw said. ''But obviously it is a pretty serious
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   It is suspected the orbital bone surrounding the eye was broken
and Berard, who does not wear a visor, might have also suffered a
cut to his eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw the trainer rush out onto the ice with a towel, and a
lot of things went through our minds,'' Wally Berard said. ''He's
so young, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was living his dream. And now, I think this might be the
end of his career. We've got our fingers crossed. But it looks like
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In several days, after swelling goes down and bandages are
removed, doctors will re-examine the eye and determine Berard's
long-range prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to see our son, give him a hug and tell him
everything is going to be OK,'' Berard's mother Pam said. ''Raising
six kids -- four boys and two girls -- you learn to just leave things
like this in the hands of God and let faith take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wally Berard: ''It's one of these freak accidents that
happen in hockey. You never expect them to happen, you hope they
don't happen, but they do. Our only concern right now is that Bryan
is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Leafs president Ken Dryden and forward Steve Thomas also visited
Berard on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough time, and he needs to know there's a ton of
people around to support him,'' Laidlaw told the Ottawa Citizen.
''His parents are the kind of people who can deal with this.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever he needs, they will help him through it, but they're
also tough love type of people and will tell him he has a life to
live. Bryan was raised well and he has a big heart. He will do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hossa, who received a double high-sticking penalty, was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know he was behind me when I shot the puck,'' said
Hossa, a talented forward who was a finalist for rookie of the year
last season. ''After I saw lots of blood, it was scary. It's a
really bad feeling. I can't do anything about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leafs general manager and coach Pat Quinn didn't buy the
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guys who play with their sticks up like that are either dirty
guys or scared guys,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident was deemed accidental, Hossa was not given
a major penalty. Pam Berard said the family has accepted Hossa's
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know it wasn't his fault,'' she said. ''We know it was an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard's teammates, who did not practice on Sunday, were
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard it was pretty nasty,'' Thomas said. ''Bryan was very
scared and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know exactly how he's feeling,'' said Ottawa's Chris
Phillips, who started wearing a visor after suffering an eye injury
two years ago. ''They told me it was along the same lines as what I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, from Woonsocket, R.I., has three goals and 27 assists in
64 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a terrible, traumatic thing for anyone. But if you're 35
and have had a long career and won Stanley Cups, it would be
somewhat easier to understand,'' Laidlaw said. ''In this case,
there was the potential for a long career.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard was chosen first in the 1995 entry draft by Ottawa. He
refused to play for the Senators and was traded to the Islanders,
where he won the Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders subsequently traded Berard and a sixth-round draft
pick to Toronto for goalie Felix Potvin and a sixth-round pick in
January of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Berard played for Team USA at the 1998 Nagano Olympics and the
1997 world championships.

lead and held off the SuperSonics 99-97 Sunday for their first win

28 points from second-year forward Rashard Lewis and 22 from Gary
Payton. Horace Grant added 13.
</P>
<P>
   Although they never led, the Sonics had two chances to win late
but Payton missed a layin with 6.5 seconds left and the Sonics down
98-97.
</P>
<P>
   After Toronto's Muggsy Bogues made just one of his free throws,
the Sonics called time out. They set up a play for Lewis, but his
3-pointer was blocked by McGrady as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was 11-of-22 from the field and made 11-of-12 free
throws. He also had nine rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics started Jelani McCoy in place of Baker, who averages
17 points per game, and also sent in Greg Foster in the first
quarter. But it was Lewis, who finished two points short of the
career-high 30 he scored last month at Dallas, got the bulk of the
playing time in the last three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Payton ended up with triple-double, scoring 22 points to go with
10 rebounds and 10 assists, but was just 8-for-23 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got to within three points, 50-47, on Payton's jumper
with 58.1 seconds left in the half. It was the closest Seattle had
been since trailing 4-2 early. Lewis scored eight of his points and
Brent Barry had six, hitting two 3-pointers in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle trailed 47-38 with 2:56 left in the half on Christie's
3-pointer, but outscored Toronto -- which had been 0-2 in previous
outings at Seattle -- 9-3 down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto controlled the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter scored 13 of his points in the quarter, including a
3-pointer with 45 seconds to give Toronto a 31-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics made just 8 of 28 shots in the period.
</P>
<P>
NOTES:@A national TV audience saw Sonics coach Paul Westphal but
didn't hear him as he chose not to wear a microphone per new NBA
guidlines. The Sonics coach issued a brief statement before the
game. ''It really is not to be defiant,'' said Westphal, who could
face a $100,000 fine. ''After all, I love this game. I simply
cannot do what I truly believe seriously impedes my ability to
compete. I hope we can get back to playing and watching the best
game in the world without any further needless conroversy.'' ...
Toronto is one of only three teams (Seattle, San Antonio) to have
beaten all four current division leaders (Miami, Indiana, Utah, Los
Angeles Lakers).

<HEADLINE> South Whipping Post For Champs  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA South Regional became the whipping post for champions
that didn't fare so well in their conference tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats (28-3) were a certain No. 1 seed until the
Conference USA tournament, when star center Kenyon Martin broke his
right leg in a stunning 10-point loss to Saint Louis. Now,
Cincinnati is No. 2 in the South behind Stanford (26-3), which
received a top seed for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Huggins was clearly perturbed by Cincinnati's slide,
pointing out that his team is No. 1 in the Rating Percentage Index
(RPI). The Bearcats had hoped to play in Cleveland with a top seed
in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell me the last time a team that was No. 1 in the RPI hasn't
had a No. 1 seed,'' Huggins said, fuming. ''It's crazy. I don't
understand that. I don't understand the rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   He blasted the NCAA selection committee for taking into account
that Cincinnati won't have Martin, one of the favorites for
national player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do they know how good we are without Kenyon?'' Huggins
said. ''They judged what we were for 37 minutes without Kenyon. Did
they take into (account) the fact that our guys just sat there and
watched a very traumatic experience? Did they take that into
consideration?''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 seed in the South is Ohio State (22-6), a Final Four
team a year ago. The Buckeyes were also in contention for a No. 1
until the Big Ten tournament, when they were stunned in the
quarterfinals by a Penn State team they already had beaten twice.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major conference champions also were placed in the
South after tournament defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (24-6), the No. 4 seed, shared the Southeastern
Conference title with three other teams but was hurt by a loss to
South Carolina in the quarterfinals of its league tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (21-10), co-champion of the Big East, lost to St. John's
in the semifinals of the conference tournament. With that, the
Hurricanes slipped to No. 6 in the South, one spot behind Big East
rival and defending national champion Connecticut (24-9).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's North Carolina (18-13), which survived its highest
number of losses since 1989-90 to extend its record streak of NCAA
appearances to 26 in a row. The Tar Heels are seeded eighth in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our players were excited when they saw the announcement,''
coach Bill Guthridge said. ''I know they are not satisfied with our
record and look forward to competing in the NCAA tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina won at least one game in the NCAA tournament for
18 consecutive years before losing in the first round to Weber
State last year. This season, North Carolina dropped out of the Top
25 for the first time in a decade and was ousted from the
quarterfinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament by Wake
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina got in, albeit with its lowest seed since 1990,
because of a non-conference schedule that included Michigan State,
Purdue, Indiana, Louisville, Georgetown, UNLV, Miami and the
College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am glad the committee rewarded us for playing a challenging
out-of-conference schedule,'' Guthridge said. ''I was afraid I may
have over-scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Regional opens Friday with the first of two rounds at
Nashville, Tenn., and Birmingham, Ala. The regional semifinals and
finals will be held in Austin, Texas, the following week.
</P>
<P>
   At Nashville, Cincinnati starts off with North
Carolina-Wilmington (18-12); Tulsa (29-4) takes on UNLV (23-7);
Ohio State (22-6) meets Appalachian State (23-8) and Miami faces
Arkansas (19-14), the surprise winner of the SEC tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford highlights the Birmingham half of the bracket, opening
against South Carolina State (20-13). North Carolina meets Missouri
(18-12); Tennessee takes on Louisiana-Lafayette (25-8); and
Connecticut plays Utah State (28-5).

<HEADLINE> Surfside Wins Santa Anita Oaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Surfside, a filly perhaps headed for the
Kentucky Derby, beat Kumari Continent by three-quarters of a length
Sunday in the $300,000 Santa Anita Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Pat Day, Surfside covered 1 1-16 miles in a relatively
slow 1:44 on a fast track and, as the 2-5 favorite in a field of
five 3-year-old fillies, paid $2.80, $2.40 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the fourth straight and seventh in nine lifetime
starts for Surfside, and the winner's share of $180,000 raised the
career earnings of the Kentucky-bred daughter of 1977 Triple Crown
winner Seattle Slew to $1,040,230.
</P>
<P>
   Kumari Continent, ridden by David Flores, crossed the finish
line a nose in front of fast-finishing Classy Cara and returned
$3.80 and $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   Classy Cara, a 21-1 longshot ridden by Iggy Puglisi, was 1}
lengths ahead of Rings A Chime and paid $2.10 to show. Spain
finished last in the 61st running of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside finished third in the Breeders' Cup Fillies race at
Gulfstream Park on Nov. 6. Then, she won the Hollywood Starlet by
seven lengths, the Santa Ysabel Stakes by eight lengths, and, on
Feb. 12, the Las Virgenes Stakes in the mud by three-quarters of a
length over Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ''She sort of labored a little bit in the stretch, I had to get
after her a bit,'' Day said of Surfside. ''She needs to keep
stepping up to the plate, she needs to work hard to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the performance might have diminished Surfside,
Day replied, ''She's not diminished in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting won the Santa Anita Oaks last year in 1:43
1-5, and Hedonist prevailed the year before in 1:44. Each of the
previous 15 winners was clocked in 1:43 3-5 or faster. The stakes
record of 1:41 1-5 was set by Bold 'n Determined in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Colors, won the race in 1:42 in 1988, went on to become
the third and last filly to win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key word is won,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said, adding
that Surfside will run next against males in the $1 million Santa
Anita Derby on April 8. The Kentucky Derby will be contested four
weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got grandiose ideas, we're looking down the road,''
Lukas said. ''They don't give us anything extra for winning by six
or seven lengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Surfside, never far off the pace, took the lead for good on the
final turn, but wasn't assured of victory until shortly before the
finish.

Bush, Gore Trading Barbs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Governor George W. Bush bitterly criticized each other as they campaigned
today. Bush, appearing near Tampa with his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said
''I wasn't sure if it was an April Fool's edition'' when he picked up today's
newspaper and saw Gore promising to make campaign finance reform an issue.
Meanwhile, in an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said Bush's
five-year, $483-billion tax-cut plan would put Social Security, Medicare and
health care in general at risk.

Cohen To Seek Vietnam POW Answers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A quarter century after the end of the Vietnam War, at
the start of a new era of U.S. military commitment to Asia's future, Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Vietnam early Monday to push the pace of
reconciliation. Cohen's trip is intended to reinforce the Pentagon's commitment
to finding, recovering and returning to their families the remains of 2,000 U.S.
servicemen still unaccounted for from the war. But it also is aimed at conveying
the Clinton administration's interest in building a new relationship between
American and Vietnamese armed forces -- an interest Vietnam seems to share.

Clinton Attacks NRA Over Gun Laws
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and a top official of the National Rifle
Association traded barbs today over a new advertising campaign in which NRA
President Charlton Heston all but accuses the president of lying in his
characterizations of the group as an impediment to sensible laws and public
safety. But the sparring was more broadly over Clinton's effort to win
congressional approval of some of the gun controls that have eluded him so far
and to inject the subject into the presidential campaign. Appearing on ABC's
''This Week,'' Clinton said the NRA was ''ruthlessly brutal'' in helping defeat
members of Congress who voted for laws such as the Brady Bill.

Pope Asks For Forgiveness of Catholic Sins
</SUBHEAD>

   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II reached a personal landmark today when
he asked God's forgiveness for the sins of the Roman Catholics through the ages,
including wrongs inflicted on Jews, women and minorities. ''We forgive and we
ask forgiveness,'' he said at several points during the solemn Day of Pardon
Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The church burned heretics at the stake during the
Inquisition. Armies of the faithful slaughtered Muslims during the Crusades. And
during the Holocaust, some Catholics stood silent in the face of Nazi genocide.

Report: 6 Crushed in Saudi Arabia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- At least six pilgrims have been crushed to death
while performing Muslim rites as part of the annual pilgrimage in the holy city
of Mecca, Jordanian and Palestinian officials said today. Two Jordanian men in
their sixties were killed Wednesday and a Jordanian woman, also in her sixties,
was crushed Friday in the mob of people at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam's
holiest city, an official said. Safety is a key issue during the hajj due to the
massive crowding. About 2.1 million pilgrims are expected to be in Mecca this
week for the hajj, whose main rituals begin Wednesday and last until Saturday.
Muslims are required to perform hajj at least once in a lifetime if they can
afford it.

Johnson added 13 points, Ewing had 15 rebounds and Sprewell had eight rebounds

poll for 12 weeks but lost center Kenyon Martin to a broken leg last week, was

totally ridiculous,'' Bearcats coach Bob Huggins said. ''We must be the first

<HEADLINE> Caine, Jolie Take SAG Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angelina Jolie won the Screen Actors Guild
award Sunday for supporting female actor in a movie for her take on
a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl, Interrupted.'' Michael Caine
took the supporting male actor honor for his role as an
ether-toking abortionist in ''The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards could give Jolie and Caine a lift come Oscar time.
Jolie also won a Golden Globe in January for ''Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very aware of how an Oscar can help your career,'' Jolie
said backstage. ''It sounds corny, but the nomination, it's my
first time, maybe my only time, and I'm going to enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox, who announced this year he is leaving ABC's
''Spin City'' because of his fight with Parkinson's disease,
received the award for male actor in a comedy series for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You were kind enough to give me one of these last year,'' Fox
said, referring to the guild statue. ''Just so you know, they
really scare small children.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said backstage he plans to continue acting but wanted out of
the grind of a weekly TV series. Besides working with a Parkinson's
foundation, Fox said he plans to have fun just ''taking my kids to
school, that kind of stuff. Just having five minutes to actually
figure what the hell that crayon drawing is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kudrow was honored as female actor in a comedy series for
NBC's ''Friends.'' The cast of NBC's ''Frasier'' won the ensemble
acting award for a comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   The guild ceremony honors actors in five film and eight
television categories.
</P>
<P>
   Edie Falco and James Gandolfini won female and male acting
honors in a dramatic series for the acclaimed mob drama ''The
Sopranos.'' The HBO series also won for ensemble acting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any of us thought anyone would watch the show in
the beginning,'' Gandolfini said. ''We figured people would just
think it was a bunch of lunatics from New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Poitier was honored with the guild's life achievement
award. The tribute included clips from such Poitier films as ''A
Place in the Sun,'' ''To Sir With Love'' and ''In the Heat of the
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The guild ceremony honors actors in five film and eight
television categories.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Directors Guild of America awards held Saturday night,
the 6th annual Screen Actors ceremony offered a glimpse of how the
Oscars might shake out March 26.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous five awards shows, the actors guild has chosen
nine of the 10 performers who went on to win Oscars in lead-acting
categories. The guild has a 50-50 record on predicting Oscar
winners for supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild has a longer and more impressive track
record. In its 52-year history, only four guild winners have failed
to receive the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' director Sam Mendes won this year's
Directors Guild honor, beating Frank Darabont for ''The Green
Mile,'' Spike Jonze for ''Being John Malkovich,'' Michael Mann for
''The Insider'' and M. Night Shyamalan for ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Darabont is the only Directors Guild nominee who is not in the
running for an Oscar. Lasse Hallstrom, director of ''The Cider
House Rules,'' has the fifth Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated for film lead actor by the actors guild were Jim
Carrey as the late comic Andy Kaufman in ''Man on the Moon,''
Russell Crowe as ex-tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand in ''The
Insider,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman as a drag queen in ''Flawless,''
Kevin Spacey as a husband mired in a whale of a mid-life crisis in
''American Beauty'' and Denzel Washington as falsely imprisoned
boxer Rubin Carter in ''The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead-actress nominees were Annette Bening as a real-estate
saleswoman having an extramarital fling in ''American Beauty,''
Janet McTeer as a flaky mom in ''Tumbleweeds,'' Julianne Moore as a
cheating wife in ''The End of the Affair,'' Meryl Streep as an East
Harlem violin teacher in ''Music of the Heart'' and Hilary Swank as
a woman murdered after posing as a man in ''Boys Don't Cry.''	   The guild
awards included honors for a movie's overall cast. The
nominees were ''American Beauty,'' ''Being John Malkovich,''
''Magnolia,'' ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''The Green Mile.''

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Leader Announces Measures  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- President Hugo Banzer announced an
emergency economic plan to bring Bolivia out of an economic slump
blamed in part on the war on cocaine trafficking and a regional
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer, speaking on national TV Sunday evening, said the
measures are necessary to alleviate an economic crisis and boost
Bolivia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The measures include the establishment of a $500 million fund to
offer short- term loans for farmers hurt by devastating floods and
lower export prices. The fund would also assist manufacturing
companies, which have seen a drop in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer also announced the elimination of a 5 percent tax on the
import of capital goods required by the industrial and handicraft
sectors, loans for low-income housing projects and investment of up
to $750 million in new road construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's top priorities has been to rein in
cocaine trafficking activities in Bolivia before his term ends in
2003. His government has made significant inroads into controlling
contraband activities that employed tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   But the destruction of more than half of the country's coca leaf
production has also left thousands of Quechua and Aymara Indian
farmers without a livelihood and depressed the economy in regions
where cocaine trafficking activities once thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's economy has been growing at an average of 4 percent a
year until last year when economic growth barely reached 2 percent.
Two-thirds of Bolivians, however, live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia, a country of eight million located in the heart of
South America, is a pioneer in structural economic reforms, which
are considered a model for the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey won top
acting honors Sunday from the Screen Actors Guild for their roles
as a dysfunctional couple in the suburban satire ''American
Beauty,'' positioning them as frontrunners at the Oscars later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' also won the guild's ensemble acting award.
The movie leads all contenders with eight Oscar nominations. The
Oscars ceremony is March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, who already has a supporting actor Oscar for ''The Usual
Suspects,'' thanked his ''American Beauty'' co-stars, saying they
were ''the reason I was able to come to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised director Sam Mendes and said ''if this is my
best work, you are the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Bening thanked her co-stars and family, including husband Warren
Beatty and their three children. She is eight months pregnant with
their fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing to all the actresses out there,'' the 41-year-old
Bening said. ''Don't wait to have a baby. Do it now.''
</P>

take on a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl, Interrupted.'' Michael
Caine took the supporting male actor honor for his role as an

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Yarnall Pounded  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The New York Yankees better think twice before
trading Ramiro
Mendoza for help in the outfield.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall, expected to be New York's fifth starter this season,
was pounded for 10 runs and eight hits in one inning of a 14-3 loss
to the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday in Dunedin, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   With Darryl Strawberry suspended and Paul O'Neill and Tino
Martinez slipping a bit in recent years, New York is in the market
for a left-handed bat and is rumored to be interested in Anaheim's
Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   But the likely price would include Mendoza, who provides
insurance if Yarnall falters or age catches up to David Cone or
Roger Clemens, both 37.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, pitching is our strength,'' said Yankees manager Joe
Torre, who is hesitant about trading Mendoza. ''I'm of the mind you
have to keep the other team from scoring. We've been to the
playoffs four straight years ... pitching is responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall, who missed his first two scheduled starts because of
back stiffness, allowed three home runs, including Raul Mondesi's
grand slam. He also walked one and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed of course. I think that's the worst I've ever
done in my career,'' Yarnall said. ''My back felt good, everything
felt fine. I had no control the whole inning.''
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit a three-run homer, Jose Cruz had a two-run shot
and Shannon Stewart added an RBI single for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Myers, Fla., Nomar Garciaparra showed no ill-effects
from the knee injury that kept him out of action for Boston's first
10 exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good. Good to be out there and getting the kinks
out,'' he said after going 1-for-2 at the plate and leaving as
planned following three innings of Boston's 9-8, 12-inning loss to
Philadelphia. ''I just went out there and did my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra led off the bottom of the first by lining a single
to center, then came up again in the first and popped out. He made
a throwing error in the first before fielding two grounders without
trouble in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why they call it spring training. It's a time to get
back acclimated to the games,'' Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   At Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Jose Lima pitched four
scoreless innings and Julio Lugo hit a game-winning, two-run homer
in the ninth inning as Houston's Dominican players helped the
Astros beat Boston 3-2 to complete a sweep of the two-game series
in their home country.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Dodgers right-hander Carlos Perez spent eight hours
in jail after getting arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in
Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Gabbard said officers received a call
Saturday night about a vehicle in which the driver appeared
unconscious at a traffic light. Police said they found Perez asleep
in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just fell asleep,'' Perez said. ''That's the only thing I
can say. Nobody got hurt, I didn't hit nobody. It's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Tigers (ss) 5, Royals 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Juan Gonzalez broke open a scoreless tie with
a three-run homer, his fourth home run of the spring, and Hideo

Braves 11, Indians 7:

</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Angel Pena's three-run homer with two outs

<HEADLINE> RCA Dome is Everyone's Aim  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two times the Final Four was played at the RCA Dome, Duke
and Arizona left Indianapolis as national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Both are seeded No. 1 for this year's tournament that will end
there April 3, and should be joined by another top seed, Michigan
State, and Connecticut, a team trying to repeat as national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   The RCA Dome, however, hasn't been kind to teams trying to
repeat -- UNLV and Kentucky both had their attempts at consecutive
titles end on that court.
</P>
<P>
   The journeys to Indianapolis should be interesting, especially
in a season when there are so many teams that have causes to rally
around.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, seeded No. 1 for the third straight year and last season's
national runner-up, will see a familiar foe in the second round in
eighth-seeded Kansas. The Jayhawks were the team the Blue Devils
beat to win it all in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In the regional semifinal they'll face fourth-seeded Illinois,
which will be coming off a second-round win over Florida, coach Lon
Kruger's old team. The Blue Devils beat the Illini in Chicago early
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the East bracket will feature the tournament's
big upset, No. 14 Hofstra over third-seeded Oklahoma State. Temple
will get through to the regional final only to see coach John
Chaney's dream of his first Final Four end against Duke. That same
thing happened last season in the East regional final and in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The South has Stanford as the No. 1 seed, but the Cardinal will
have trouble getting by fifth-seeded Connecticut in the regional
semifinal. The Huskies have looked like a different team lately,
winning six straight to reach the finals of the Big East
tournament, while Stanford lost two of its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Cincinnati, which enters the tournament without
injured center Kenyon Martin, will finally get past the second
round after three straight years of disappointment and then earn
Ohio bragging rights in a much-anticipated regional semifinal
matchup with No. 3 Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State starts its run at a second straight Final Four in
the Midwest. The Spartans will get some revenge for a
regular-season loss to Kentucky with a regional semifinal win.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the bracket has two of the cause teams -- No. 6
UCLA, which played most of its season without suspended forward
Jaron Rush, and No. 7 Auburn, which will be without suspended
forward Chris Porter. Both will have their runs end in the second
round as Maryland beats UCLA and Iowa State downs Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland will prevail in the regional semifinal only to fall to
Michigan State in the round of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which might be without center Loren Woods, who has
already missed five games with a bad back, will end LSU's best
season in years in the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, a team that dealt with six weeks of turmoil by
winning 11 of 12 games and the Big East tournament, should reach
the regional finals for a second straight year, only to fall a game
short of the Final Four once again.
</P>
<P>
   Duke will avenge last season's loss in St. Petersburg, Fla., by
beating Connecticut in one national semifinal, while Michigan State
will keep Arizona from winning a second title with a freshman at
point guard, as it did with Mike Bibby in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Duke beat Michigan State in last year's Final Four, and in
keeping with the mode of avenging year-old losses, the Spartans
will win their first national title since 1979, a year they came
through a regional in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Drop Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks dropped sharply early Monday after the
government announced a deeper than expected fall in economic
growth. The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 298.91 points,
or 1.51 percent, to 19,451.49 at the end of the morning session. On
Friday, the average closed up 88.07 points, or 0.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.09 yen, down 0.19 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 106.22 yen on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices opened lower as some investors were
discouraged by the 1.4 percent drop in gross domestic product in
the October-December quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei average dropped further as high-technology issues,
including Sony, Softbank, and Hikari Tsushin -- the market's
darlings until last month -- suffered a pummeling.
</P>
<P>
   ''These issues were just too expensive,'' said Garry Evans, a
strategist at HSBC Securities Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in GDP, more than expected because market analysts
had predicted a fall of only 0.9 percent, raised doubts about
whether the nation can overcome its worst economic slump in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 81.91 to
9,928.82 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar initially was higher after the
GDP announcement. But the greenback moved lower after modest
dollar-selling by U.S. players, although Japanese players were on
the buying side, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides remained rather cautious about a possible central
bank intervention, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Bank of Japan intervened in Tokyo to stem
the dollar's decline against the yen - the second such action this
year by the bank since a similar intervention on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   A strong yen could hurt the nascent economic recovery by making
Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and cutting into earnings
of exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.26 yen, down
from 102.84 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 56.11 points, or 3.43 percent, to 1,577.19
points. The TOPIX closed down 10.47 points, or 0.64 percent, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8500 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8200 percent. Its price
fell 0.05 point to 99.78.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Soccer Executive Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An unidentified gunman shot and killed
Arturo Bustamante, a Colombian soccer executive, as he left a
country restaurant Sunday with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante took three bullet wounds in the attack just south of
Medellin, the country's second-largest city, and died en route to
the hospital, said Gen. Alfonso Arrellano, operations director of
the national police.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment we don't know the motive for the killing,''
Arrellano said.
</P>
<P>
   The silver-haired Bustamante was a member of the executive
committee of the Colombian Soccer Federation and had lost two sons
in recent years, both murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the federation's president,
Alvaro Fina, or the national team coach, Luis Garcia, who were in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian soccer has been plagued in recent years by several
violent deaths.
</P>
<P>
   They include the fatal 1994 shooting of Andres Escobar, a star
player whose error against the United States caused an an own goal
during that year's World Cup, contributing to Colombia's early
elimination.

Richardson Opposes Lifting Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High fuel prices caused Energy secretary Bill Richardson
to oppose temporarily lifting a 4.3 cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, but said
President Clinton would consider all options to bring relief to customers. A
growing number of lawmakers have begun gauging whether there is enough support
in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline excise tax imposed in 1993 until
prices at the pump recede. Richardson, appearing on Sunday television talk
shows, noted that Republicans were divided on the matter and said he didn't
think suspending the tax would help because the problem is scarcity of oil.

Pope Prays For Catholic Forgiveness
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In an effort to cleanse and invigorate Catholicism for
its third millennium, Pope John Paul II asked God's forgiveness Sunday for the
sins of Roman Catholics through the ages. The church burned heretics at the
stake during the Inquisition. Armies of the faithful slaughtered Muslims during
the Crusades. And during the Holocaust, some Catholics stood silent in the face
of Nazi genocide. Several Jewish leaders praised his penitential words, but said
they expected more during the pope's March 20-26 visit to the Holy Land.

Meanwhile, in an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said Bush's
five-year, $483-billion tax-cut plan would put Social Security, Medicare and

<HEADLINE> Fed Law Officers Grow 11 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of federal law enforcement officers
grew by 11 percent from 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About half the growth of approximately 8,000 men and women was
in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Within that agency,
the number of Border Patrol officers alone rose from 5,441 in 1996
to 7,714 in 1998, an increase of 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, federal agencies employed about 83,000 full-time law
enforcement officers with arrest powers and firearms authorization,
according to the Justice Department Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   That included 16,552 in the INS, 12,587 in the Bureau of
Prisons, 11,285 in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10,539 in
the Customs Service, 3,587 in the Secret Service, 3,305 in the Drug
Enforcement Administration, 2,705 in the Marshals Service and 1,723
in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said women accounted for 14 percent of federal
officers in both 1996 and 1998, the last year for which statistics
have been compiled. the number of minority officers increased from
28 percent to 29 percent during the two-year period, with Hispanics
comprising 15 percent of the officers in 1998 and blacks 11
percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Rolls Up Delegate Totals  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A smaller-than-expected turnout of about 11,000
people at the
first Democratic weekend caucuses in Minnesota gave Vice President
Al Gore a near sweep as anticipated in a binding presidential poll.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore also was expected to pick up all 20 delegates at stake
after a resounding victory Sunday at caucuses in Nevada where there
were even fewer voters.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 of 17 counties reporting in Nevada, Gore had 92 percent
of the vote to 8 percent for Bill Bradley and others. Although no
official delegate assignments were made by the party, state
chairman Rory Reid noted that Bradley would have had to get at
least 15 percent of the votes cast in either of Nevada's two
congressional districts to win any delegates. He said there was no
hope of him reaching that threshold.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 Democrats voted Sunday in Nevada, up from about
600 four years ago, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, DFL party spokeswoman Karen Louise Boothe blamed
the low turnout for the Saturday and Sunday caucuses there on a
switch from holding the meetings on Tuesdays and on Bill Bradley
dropping out of the race for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former New Jersey senator could pick up a couple of
delegates, Boothe said. ''Right now, he has the possibility of
gaining a couple of delegates in a couple of districts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Results were still out Sunday night for the binding presidential
poll in a couple of state senate districts. Boothe said state party
officials wouldn't know the results until Monday at the earliest.
''I think it's safe to say it's a near sweep for Gore,'' Boothe
said.
</P>
<P>
   With 114 of 126 precincts reporting, Gore received 74 percent of
the votes to 14 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has 91 Democratic delegates up for grabs, and most
were to be assigned during the weekend caucuses. The binding poll,
however, is not a winner-take-all contest so delegates will be
distributed in proportion to votes received. Unless Bradley pulls
at least 15 percent in a district, he is ineligible for delegates.
He had yet to reach that threshold in incomplete returns.
</P>
<P>
   The DFL switched the meetings from Tuesday nights in hopes of
increasing turnout. Party officials had estimated turnout would be
15,000 people, down from the 17,000 who participated in 1996 and
1998 caucuses.

   The Sycamores won't have Larry Bird this time, but hey, they're
in and that's all that counts for a team that has struggled for two
decades since their best player ever left for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State coach Royce Waltman said he was a nervous wreck
waiting to hear Sunday whether his team would get an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just like our individual games, or the conference
season -- right down to the wire,'' said Waltman, the Missouri
Valley Conference coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sycamores (22-9) have been in the tournament only once
before, in 1979, when Bird led the team to a 33-0 record going into
the championship game against Michigan State and Magic Johnson.
Michigan State won, Bird left for the Boston Celtics and the
Sycamores went on to many losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ISU, which had several last-minute victories this season,
appeared on the NCAA's final bracket announced Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Players watching on television leaped to their feet and cheered
when they learned they were seeded 12th and will play No. 5 Texas
in the opening round. But for a while, they weren't so sure they'd
have anything to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw Pepperdine, UNLV, teams that had done what we had done
-- won the regular season'' title, Waltman said. ''We thought maybe
there was no room for us.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it was a great feeling when it finally came up.''

<HEADLINE> El Salvador Electing New Congress  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Salvador's leftist former
rebels claimed victory in election for mayor of the capital and
said they expected gains in voting Sunday that would shift the
balance of power in congress.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent mayor Hector Silva of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front proclaimed victory in San Salvador -- the most
important of 262 mayoral races in the nationwide elections.
</P>
<P>
   No significant results were yet in from voting for the 84-member
congress, but earlier polls had showed the Front -- known as the
FMLN -- poised to make gains there. Partial results were expected
overnight, though final results could take up to two days.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried by poll results, President Francisco Flores
earlier Sunday urged Salvadorans to vote against ''those who
opposed the establishment of our democracy.'' Flores' rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance party, known as ARENA, has governed
the country for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Flores' comments outraged leaders of the FMLN, which became a
political party following the January 1992 peace accord that ended
a 12-year civil war in which about 76,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ''What President Flores is doing is prohibited; he is not acting
as president. He is nothing more than a (party) campaign
activist,'' said Schafick Handal, a former guerrilla commander who
is seeking re-election to congress.
</P>
<P>
   But as the polls closed at 5 p.m., he expressed confidence that
the FMLN and its center-left allies would make significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a new balance of power in El Salvador,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva, a 53-year-old Boston-born gynecologist, claimed the first
victory in the municipal and legislative voting. He told a news
conference he had won a 57 percent to 39 percent victory over
ARENA's Luis Cardenal.
</P>
<P>
   His victory three years ago in the capital was the biggest
electoral boost the Front has yet achieved in the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the leftist party calls for halting the government's
privatization program, it has also called for cutting taxes and
tightening anti-corruption laws.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the FMLN could boost its share of seats in the
single-house congress to 30 or 32 from the current 27. Smaller
center-left parties also may advance. Polls indicate ARENA could
fall short of the 28 seats it now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls are two weeks old, since law prohibits releasing
polling data in the final 15 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral officials said fewer than 50 percent of the 3 million
eligible voters turned out to cast ballots for congressmen, mayors
and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament. Eight
parties were participating.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament Selections Made  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- There was little doubt Duke and Michigan
State would be seeded No. 1 in the NCAA tournament for a second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   A broken leg changed everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's Stanford and Arizona were selected Sunday as the
other two top-seeded teams, leaving Cincinnati, ranked No. 1 in the
AP poll for three months, seeded second.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats appeared to be a lock for a top seed, but star
center Kenyon Martin broke his leg in the Conference USA tournament
last week. Cincinnati lost the game and their No. 1 seed, which
would have allowed them to play a virtual home game in the first
round in Cleveland instead of traveling to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Huggins called the selection committee's decision
''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''How do they know how good we are without Kenyon?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, a No. 1 for the third straight year and the national
runner-up last season, was the top team in the East. The Blue
Devils (27-4) will play Friday in Winston-Salem, N.C., against
16th-seeded Lamar, which at 15-15 has the worst record in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (26-7), which reached the Final Four last season,
was No. 1 in the Midwest and will play No. 16 Valparaiso on
Thursday in Cleveland. The Spartans' seven losses are the most ever
for a No. 1 seed, one more than Georgetown had in 1982 and North
Carolina in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 champion Arizona (26-6) was No. 1 in the West and will
play No. 16 Jackson State on Thursday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (26-3), which lost twice to Arizona this season, was
seeded No. 1 for the first time and will play in the South, opening
against No. 16 South Carolina State on Friday in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools -- Central Connecticut State, North
Carolina-Wilmington and Southeast Missouri State -- are making their
first appearances in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The longest wait that ended Sunday belonged to Hofstra, which
had not been in the field since 1977. The other waits of over 20
years that ended belonged to St. Bonaventure (1978) and Appalachian
State and Indiana State, which made their last appearances in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   That Appalachian State team was coached by Bobby Cremins, who
retired earlier this season at Georgia Tech, while the Indiana
State team was led by Larry Bird and lost in the championship game
to Michigan State and Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State is in for the first time since 1984, and coach
Jerry Tarkanian hasn't been in the tournament since leading UNLV to
the Final Four in 1991 as the Runnin' Rebels tried to repeat as
national champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very excited,'' Tarkanian said. ''The university's
been waiting a long time for the opportunity to get to the Big
Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years North Carolina was a team on
the bubble. The Tar Heels' selection extended their record of
consecutive tournament appearances to 26 years. The second longest
streak also continued, with Arizona making its 16 consecutive
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Three conferences had six teams selected -- Big 10, Big 12 and
Southeastern -- and the Big East had five. Conference USA and the
Pac-10 had four teams each, while the Atlantic Coast Conference had
only three teams selected for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, a team considered by many as a possible No. 1 seed, was
No. 2 in the East and will play Lafayette on Friday in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams seeded No. 2 besides Cincinnati were Iowa State
in the Midwest and St. John's in the West.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cincinnati, Huggins was shocked that his team didn't get
a top spot after a 28-3 season. One of those losses came against
Saint Louis in the Conference USA tournament when Martin was
injured at the beginning of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous, totally ridiculous,'' Huggins said. ''We must
be the first team in history to be No. 1 in the RPI and not get a
No. 1 seed. That's a historical thing those guys just did.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA selection committee, said
the Martin injury was the only reason the Bearcats were not seeded
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're clearly a different team without Kenyon Martin,'' said
Thompson, also the commissioner of the Mountain West Conference.
''The issue we had was, how different?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Arizona was seeded No. 1 even though 7-foot-1 center
Loren Woods might not play in the tournament because of a bad back.
Thompson said there was a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw Arizona play Stanford without Loren Woods and beat
them,'' he said. ''There was a test there.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Lute Olson said doctors hadn't told him the back
injury that has sidelined Woods for the past five games would
definitely keep him out of the tournament. Even so, he said he
wasn't surprised by the committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly didn't see any way they could not put our guys as
the No. 1 seed in the West,'' Olson said, ''particularly because
we've played so long without Loren Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa and Iowa State, both 29-4, have the most victories of any
team in the tournament, while Lamar and Jackson State (17-15) have
the most losses.
</P>
<P>
   The other games in Winston-Salem will be No. 4 Illinois against
No. 13 Pennsylvania; No. 5 Florida against No. 12 Butler; and No. 8
Kansas against No. 9 DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the schedule in Buffalo will be: No. 3 Oklahoma
State-No. 14 Hofstra; No. 6 Indiana-No. 11 Pepperdine; and No. 7
Oregon-No. 10 Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stanford-South Carolina State, the rest of the
games in Birmingham will be: No. 4 Tennessee-No. 13
Louisiana-Lafayette; No. 5 and defending champion Connecticut-No.
12 Utah State; and No. 8 North Carolina-No. 9 Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The other South bracket will be in Nashville, where Cincinnati
plays No. 15 North Carolina-Wilmington; No. 3 Ohio State faces No.
14 Appalachian State; No. 6 Miami goes against No. 11 Arkansas; and
No. 7 Tulsa plays No. 10 UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, No. 4 LSU plays No. 13 Southeast Missouri
State; No. 5 Texas faces No. 12 Indiana State; and No. 8 Wisconsin
goes against No. 9 Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   The other West bracket, in Tucson, Ariz., features St. John's
against No. 15 Northern Arizona; No. 3 Oklahoma-No. 14 Winthrop;
No. 6 Purdue-No. 11 Dayton; and No. 7 Louisville-No. 10 Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Michigan State-Valparaiso game in Cleveland,
No. 4 Syracuse faces No. 13 Samford; No. 5 Kentucky goes against
No. 12 St. Bonaventure; and No. 8 Utah plays No. 9 Saint Louis.

<P>
   Iowa State plays No. 15 Central Connecticut State in
Minneapolis; No. 3 Maryland faces No. 14 Iona; No. 6 UCLA goes

<HEADLINE> Clippers 112, Warriors 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Lamar Odom scored 14 of his game-high 29
points during the fourth quarter as helping the Los Angeles
Clippers break a 19-game road losing streak with a 112-103 victory
over the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, trailing after three periods, broke an 83-83 tie
by scoring seven straight points, capped by Odom's three-point play
with 8:01 remaining, and never looked back. Neither team held a
lead of more than four points in the game until that play.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won the season series against Golden State, 3-1. The
Clippers have won five straight games in Oakland since last losing
here to the Warriors on Dec. 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors had won 11 straight games when leading after three
quarters, becoming the final NBA team this season to lose when
ahead going into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers made 12 of their first 15 shots in the pivotal
final quarter to run up a 105-94 lead with 2:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Odom hit 10 of 19 shots from the field as the Clippers shot 52.8
percent for the game. Eric Piatkowski tossed in 20 points in 26
minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes paced the Warriors with 30 points and 10 rebounds.
Donyell Marshall added 22 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers won for only the third time in 31 games, while the
Warriors lost their sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors clung to a 49-48 lead at the half, getting 11 points
and seven rebounds from Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby kept the Clippers in the game with 14 first-half
points on 7-of-14 shooting, while Michael Olowokandi grabbed all of
his game-high 12 rebounds in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The Warriors scored 100 points for the first time in 11
games. ... Hughes suffered a mild sprained left ankle in the second
quarter, but on the floor to start the second half. ... The
Clippers are now 2-37 when trailing at the half. ... The Clippers
did not commit their first turnover until three minutes into the
second quarter. ... The Warriors are 0-16 when opponents shoot
better than 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> ACC Gets Three NIT Entries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Atlantic Coast Conference has as many
entries in the National Invitation Tournament -- three -- as it does
in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, North Carolina State and Wake Forest all were chosen
by the NIT, which begins play Tuesday night. NC State (17-12) will
be at home against Tulane (20-10) to open the event, with Wake
Forest (17-14) at Vanderbilt (19-10) also that night.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (19-11) is home for Georgetown (18-14) on Wednesday
night, when 10 games will be held.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East also had four teams invited: the Hoyas, plus
Villanova, Notre Dame and Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova (19-12) is at home for Delaware (24-7) on Wednesday,
the same night the Irish (18-14) are home against Michigan (15-13).
The Scarlett Knights (15-15) are at Kent (21-7) on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other first-round matchups Wednesday feature Princeton (19-10)
at Penn State (15-15); Marquette (15-13) at Xavier (20-11); Bowling
Green (22-7) at Brigham Young (20-10); New Mexico State (22-9) at
Arizona State (18-12); North Carolina Charlotte (17-15) at
Mississippi (17-13); South Florida (17-13) at New Mexico (17-13);
and Long Beach State (24-5) at California (16-14).
</P>
<P>
   The other games Thursday have Massachusetts (17-15) at Siena
(23-8); Southern Illinois (19-12) at Colorado (18-13); and Southern
Methodist (21-8) at Southwest Missouri State (22-10).
</P>
<P>
   All games are played at campus sites until the semifinals on
March 28 and the finals on March 30 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''As it played out on Wednesday as I watched our conference
tournament, I felt pretty good,'' Bowling Green coach Dan Dakich
said. ''But as things kept going on and on and on, I could see us
getting squeezed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (22-7) won the Mid-American Conference's East
Division, but lost early in the MAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little shocked except that as I studied it, the upsets
kept coming,'' Dakich said. ''The teams like St. Louis, Arkansas
and St. Bonaventure had their great runs. I think those bids affect
our league.''
</P>
<P>
   One coach thrilled to be going to the NIT was Southern Illinois'
Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a positive step for us,'' he said. ''The kids were
hungry and they bought into what we wanted.''
