<HEADLINE> Turkish University Students Stage Protest in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 4 (Xinhua)-- Thousands of students staged a
demonstration today to protest against tuition hikes, local
televisions reported.
</P>
<P>
They clashed with police who were trying to bar them from
demonstrating downtown.
</P>
<P>
The students called for reforms in the education system, the
abolishing of tuition and fees and an end to discussions on the
privatization of higher education.
</P>
<P>
Despite the breaking of the windows of a nearby bank and some
scuffles with police that resulted in a number of arrests, the
protest ended relatively peacefully.
</P>
<P>
But organizers called on students to rally again in Ankara
Monday to protest against the hikes.
</P>
<P>
In a related action, a group of students are conducting a
hunger strike on the grounds of the Yildiz Technical University
(YTU) in Istanbul and have barricaded themselves inside rooms of
one of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to the privatization of higher education," a
spokesperson for the hunger strikers said.
</P>
<P>
The education system in Turkey is facing a shortage of
funds, infrastructure and staffing resources.

<HEADLINE> Leading Sinn Fein Member Denies IRA Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein's senior member Martin
McGuinness dismissed the suggestion that the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) could split and the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland
would be threatened, according to a BBC TV report this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
George Mitchell, chairman of the international commission in
charge of arms decommissioning in Ulster, told BBC TV this morning
that not all on the IRA side favored the ceasefire announced 17
months ago and the potential for some elements to take direct and
violent action remained.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the former U.S. senator urged leaders of all
political parties in Northern Ireland to redouble their efforts to
get all-party negotiations on the future of the troubled province
going as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But McGuinness said that since the ceasefire the IRA had proved
itself to be "a disciplined and cohesive organization."
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe there is any danger of a split" within
the IRA, he said.

<HEADLINE> African Women Call For Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading professional African
woman has voiced strong appeal for an end to conflicts, warning
there could never be human development in Africa without peace.
</P>
<P>
The President of Medical Women International Association
(MWIA), Dr. Florence Manguyu, were addressing the "human values and
sustainable development" lecture opened in Nigeria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Africa is too preoccupied with wars and armed conflicts to
think of peace, and even in African countries where there are no
threats of war, the governments have been preparing themselves
for war with imaginary enemies, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan paediatrician urged Africans to learn to discuss
their differences because "we have more similarities to bring us
together than differences to divide us".
</P>
<P>
The MWIA president identified three key features in economic
performance and human development in Africa in the last ten years
-- poor domestic resource mobilisation, increasing aid dependency
and a growing debt problem.
</P>
<P>
She advised Africans to take note of the situation where
Africa's traditional allies and supporters have directed their
aid elsewhere and turned their backs on Africans after the end
of the cold war.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Appoints New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein today
appointed Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti as the kingdom's
new prime minister, asking him to form a new cabinet to replace
the administration headed by outgoing Prime Minister Sharif Zeid
Ben Shaker.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti has started his consultations with parliamentary
blocs and independent figures since Saturday on the formation of
the new government, Radio Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti is expected to finalize the makeup of his cabinet
Monday before he leaves for London for a private visit.
</P>
<P>
After accepting the resignation of Shaker and his government,
the king praised him as being at the helm of government at a
critical phase in Jordan's history, according to Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Shaker, the king paid tribute to the
accomplishments of the outgoing government, which was formed on
January 8, 1995, to boost economic developments and efforts to
bolster peace after Jordan regained its territorial and water
rights under a peace treaty signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time for a new generation of Jordanians
to take up the responsibility and face up present challenges and
work for the fulfillment of future aspirations.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the appointment of Kabariti as
new prime minister shows the King's efforts to enable the new
generation of politicians to take over power from the old guard,
inject new blood into the existing political system and introduce
profound change in the bureaucracy of the country.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Jihad Vows to Avenge its Activists' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Islamic
Jihad movement said in Gaza today that the organization will
avenge the death of its two activists, who were killed Saturday
night by the Palestinian Police.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Television's report, thousands of mourners
in Gaza attended today's funeral of Amir Arraj and Eyman
Ruzeineh, both had been reportedly on the wanted list of the
Israeli Security Services for their involvement in planning the
Beit Lid double-bombing which killed 20 Israeli soldiers and a
civilian one year ago.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian police statement said that when a patrol had
gone to a house in the Shati refugee camp to arrest Mahmoud Zatmar
and Riyad Abu Hashish, suspected of involving in the Beit Lid
bombing, gunmen in another room opened fire at the policemen.
</P>
<P>
Police ordered the gunmen to put down their weapon and
surrender, and when they refused, the police opened fire and a
grenade exploded in the room.
</P>
<P>
Two bodies, later identified as Amir Arraj, 25, from the Rimal
quarter of Gaza City, and Eyman Ruzeineh, 30, from Jabalya refugee
camp, along with another grenade ready to explode and two more
grenades, were found in the room afterward.
</P>
<P>
However, residents in the Shati camp said the shoot-out began
when four or five plainclothes policemen stormed the house,
arrested two men, and then chased two other men into a room, one
of them holding a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
Police told them they had one minute to surrender and
shot them when they refused.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic Jihad leader called the killings "a criminal
act" and said his movement demands an explanation of why the
two men, who he claimed were not armed, were killed "without
resistance" when it was possible to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gaza police called on Islamic Jihad leaders to act
responsibly. Senior Palestinian security official Mohammed Dahlan
said he hoped that the incident would not affect the positive
relationship between the Palestinian Authority and the
Islamic Jihad movement.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Situation in Serbia Critical, Says Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Red Cross and
other state institutions has warned that humanitarian supplies
have long been exhausted and that about 700,000 refugees in Serbia
are in the most difficult predicament in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Yugoslav Red Cross, Serbia
has 450,719 refugees from the period 1991-1995 and 286,959 exiles
from the Republic of Serb Krajina who arrived in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross said today its warehouses were practically
emptied six months ago, but international humanitarian
organizations did not evaluate and assess the situation in this
aspect until now so as to ask for new funds for their work in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross said international humanitarian aid have sent in
about 18,000 tons of food, 54 percent of which were flour, since
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
When this amount of aid is placed in proportion with the number
of refugees, one person only gets 17.5 kg of humanitarian aid each
month, which comprises one litre of table oil, one kg of sugar,
two cans of corned beef, three cans of sardines, and 10-15 kg of
flour, the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that the main reason for this disproportion
in needs lies in the number of refugees and displaced persons
registered by international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the humanitarian
office of the European Union, and the World Food Program have on
their lists 160,000 refugees and 175,000 displaced persons, while
the Yugoslav Red Cross has counted 185,294 refugees and 289,438
among displaced persons in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, about 50,000 persons from the Bosnian Serb Republic
should be added to this list, the Red Cross said, as they also
take aid from the Red Cross although they have no refugee status.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that even though a peace deal has been
struck in Bosnia, both the Yugoslav authorities and
representatives of international humanitarian organizations
estimate that the repatriation of refugees from Yugoslavia will be
a slower process than it seems to be, and therefore more and
urgent humanitarian aid is needed from the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-German Sharp Row on Future of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain has now a hot
dispute with Germany on the Future of the European Union as
politicians and newspapers united to condemn German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Kohl in a speech in Brussels said that the
European Community's integration program could not be held
up by British doubts.
</P>
<P>
+The slowest boat must not determine the speed of the
fleet,+ and Europe risked war unless it integrated further,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Britian's Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind replied: +The
convoy ceases to exist if you do not accommodate all the
ships within the convoy, so you have to find a balance.+
</P>
<P>
Rifkind told BBC radio on Saturday: +There are
differences between Germany and Britain. I don't want to
pretend we see eye-to-eye on these matters because they wish
to advocate a greater degree of integration than we believe
the people of Europe will be comfortable with+.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, a strong right-winger who challenged Prime
Minister John Major in the Tory leadership contest last
Summer, said that Kohl was living in the Germany of the
1930s rather than the future.
</P>
<P>
+I don't think it's the European Community which has kept
the peace in Europe since the Second World War. I think it
is NATO, and the fact that the main European countries have
very different attitudes to the countries of the 1930s,+ he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tristan Garel-Jones, a former British minister for
Europe, said in an article written for the Sunday Telegraph
weekly that Kohl's message +is clear: you must all do what
we say or there will be war.+
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times in an editorial said: +If Germany cannot
be relied upon to act responsibly in the Europe of
nation-states, its good behavior will hardly be guaranteed
by camouflaging its power in a renamed D-mark zone called
Emu.+
</P>
<P>
+Europe's leaders have a heaven-sent opportunity to shape
a new destiny for this strike-riven continent based on
cooperation and partnership in a true community of nations.
More than ever, it is clear that moving towards a European
superstate via a single currency would kill that dream stone
dead,+ it added.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday weekly commented that a united Europe
would also be a Europe dominated by Germany.
</P>
<P>
+A united Europe would be a German Europe aided and
abetted by those who relied on its handouts and who have
given us such disaster as the common Agricultural Policy,+
it said.

By handing out a 2-0 win over Hong Kong this afternoon, China
came out the winners of the Asian Cup Group Two soccer qualifying
tournament which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Macao beat the Philippines 5-1 earlier this afternoon to finish
third in the group.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Cup finals are slated for December this year in the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"I did refuse to make any pre-game comments, but our team were
unbeaten throughout the tournament here. That's most important,"
said Qi, who has been blamed by some of Hong Kong media for his
refusal of interviews ever since his arrival here on January 26.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong team played a solid defensive game in the first
half which caused some problems to my team," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
"But our players did better in the second half. The tactic of
swift counter-attacks were proved by the game as effective, which
brought about two goals for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former Chinese national player declined to the idea that
the current Chinese team was far much weaker than the one which
won the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The two teams could not be compared as they worked under very
different conditions. The present team has very short time, only
10 days for the whole team, before coming to Hong Kong," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
"And some players are very tired, especially those who played
the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup and the Shanghai-Hong Kong Cup
events," he said. China won both the annual interpot events.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese victory smashed to pieces Hong Kong's
dream of repeating a surprise 1985 victory over China in a World
Cup Asian Zone Group 4 qualifier in Beijing, its coach was happy
with the players.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of them did what they could and I hope the Hong
Kong spectators really enjoyed the game," said Tsang Wai-chung.
</P>
<P>
"We'd planned to manage freezing the 0-0 score for at least 15
minutes in the second half and then we would try to do something.
We lost the first goal just after a bit more than five minutes.
That destroyed my game," admitted the coach.
</P>
<P>
"And three games in six days killed all my players. We'd never
done this before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some felt it was quite unusual for his decision of substitution
when the second half was half-finished. "We know we had to win to
qualify (for the finals) and that why I decided to field an
attacking player to encourage other for a more aggressive play,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
"They (Chinese) know we could not play an attacking game
especially against China. As we attack, we leave much space
behind, which is bad. This is not the game we're good at.
</P>
<P>
"But we did much better in the first half. We got corner-kicks
and free kicks. Although we didn't have much chances, we brought
about surprises," he added.

<HEADLINE> Serb Police Allowed to Stay in Sarajevo for 45 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Serb police have been
allowed to stay in Serb Sarajevo districts to be handed over to
government control for 45 more days until March 19.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a meeting between NATO commanders,
U.N. civilian mediator Carl Bildt and Bosnian government leaders
late Saturday night. Under the Bosnia peace accord, all military
forces must be withdrawn by midnight Saturday from the areas to be
transferred to the other side, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued today, NATO commander Leighton
Smith and Carl Bildt said the five suburbs would not come under
full administration of the Muslim-Croat federation until March 20.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the present civil authority, including the police
forces, can remain in place provided they do not act in a manner
inconsistent with the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
Federation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The efforts were aimed at preventing a mass exodus of Serbs
from Sarajevo. Thousands of Serb Sarajevons have already fled to
other Serb areas for fear of possible retaliation or
discrimination after their hometowns were put under Muslim
jurisdiction since March 19.
</P>
<P>
The NATO peacekeeping force will at the same time keep presence
in the areas concerned and monitor the peace process, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Muslim government was not happy with the
decision to prolong the presence of the Serb police in the Serb
Sarajevo areas but agreed under pressure from the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Police Officers Held Hostage by Prisoners  in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Two police officers were held
hostage by two prisoners for two-and-a-half hours at the lock-up
area of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Saturday, the
first such case ever happened in Singapore, local television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The TV report quoted police as saying that a prisoner, who was
being escorted to a cell after taking bath Saturday afternoon
suddenly turned violent and with the help of the other prisoner in
the cell, they overpowered a male and a female officer on duty.
</P>
<P>
One of the prisoners broke a mirror in the lock-up office and
threatened to harm the woman officer with a jagged piece of glass.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, who were being remanded for capital offenses,
demanded immediate release, when the Police Special Tactics and
Rescue Unit was called in and the team, which entered the lock-up
area by force, managed to surprise the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The two prisoners were detained and the officers held hostage
were rescued unharmed. Local television said this was believed to
be the first case here where officers were held hostage by
prisoners in a lock-up.
</P>
<P>
Benedict Cheong, director of the Police Operations, said that
there was no possibility of the two prisoners escaping as the main
gate was kept locked all the time and the keys were held by other
officers outside the lock-up area.

<HEADLINE> China Qualifies for Asian Cup Soccer Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China beat Hong Kong 2-0 to
win the first place of Group Two at the Asian Cup soccer
qualifying tournament here this afternoon and qualified for the
finals slated for December this year in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were goalless in the first half.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier game, Macao defeated the Philippines 5-1 after
leading 2-0 in the first half. With the victory, Macao won the
third place of the group and the Philippines finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China already obtained the finals berth when Chinese
star forward Peng Weiguo scored the team's and the game's opening
goal in the sixth minute. His triumphant header came after his
team was awarded a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
And in the closing minute, China's Wei Qun dribbled the ball to
some 20 meters away from the Hong Kong goal. He scored the second
goal of the Chinese team after making a tricky move that beat Hong
Kong's goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
The passive but tight defense of the Hong Kong team caused much
trouble to the attacking Chinese. Peng Weiguo launched the team's
first shot in the fifth minute and three minutes later, the Hong
Kong side was awarded with the game's first corner kick.
</P>
<P>
China's star striker Fan zhiyi bombarded the Hong Kong goal
with three consecutive heading shots, all of which flew off the
Hong Kong goal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese switched into a more clever play in the second
half. They drew the Hong Kong players with them with their
tactical retreats and then launched sudden offensives towards the
backyard of the opposing side.
</P>
<P>
The tactic worked right at once and, at the sixth minute, Fan,
the Chinese striker, opened the score with a swift header.
</P>
<P>
It foiled Hong Kong's planned game which aimed at freezing the
scoreless state for at least 15 minutes in the half so as to "do
something" as its coach Tsang Wai-chung said.
</P>
<P>
Eager to level the score, the Hong Kong team launched an
all-round attack, with its forwards dribbling as far as into the
Chinese goal area.
</P>
<P>
But still they failed to put in any goal, although with chances
as corner kicks and free kicks.
</P>
<P>
And then came Peng Weiguo's pleasant shot which sealed the
Chinese victory. Peng was carried out of the ground in the first
half for a short treatment for foot injuries. He went back into
action minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The game shattered Hong Kong's dream of repeating their feat 10
years ago when they scored a surprise win over a stronger Chinese
team in the last game of the fourth group at the World Cup
qualifiers, in Beijing.

</P>
<P>
However, name and nationality of the injured foreigner are
yet to be identified, officials said.
</P>
<P>
With rescue workers rushing into the stricken areas where

have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, measuring 7.0 on the Richter Scale, hit Lijiang and
Zhongdian counties in northwest Yunnan yesterday evening. By 22:00
(Beijing time) tonight, at least 228 people have been killed and
3,800 seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Local seismologists said that 184 aftershocks have been
recorded for the past 26 hours, including 26 measuring between 3.0
and 3.9 on the Richter scale and 18 between 4.0 and 4.9. The
strongest aftershock so far measures 4.8.
</P>
<P>
They warned that in the coming three days, the area is likely
to suffer strong aftershocks measuring between 5.0 and 6.0.
Usually, earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 can cause severe damage.
</P>
<P>
The predicted aftershocks are most probably affect the more
populous northern part of the area, local officials said, adding
that the provincial government has cautioned local residents
against the danger.
</P>
<P>
At present, rescue operations are well under way under the
direction of the relief headquarters headed by Provincial Governor
He Zhiqiang. A delegation of the central authorities led by
Vice-premier Wu Bangguo has flied to the quake-stricken area today
to direct the operations.
</P>
<P>
About 1,550 local army officers and men and 350 militiamen have
been sent to help with the rescue work. A number of medical teams
have been or are on the way to the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
In another development, The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC)
appealed to the international community tonight for humanitarian
aid to the area.
</P>
<P>
Sun Baiqiu, vice-president of the RCSC, said that his society
has already begun rescue operations in Yunnan and expects prompt
assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC has informed the International Red Cross (IRC) and the
red cross societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan of the situation in
the disaster, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Red Cross Society has sent to the quake-stricken
area 900,000 yuan worth of disaster-relief goods including food,
clothes, medicine and quilts, and the RCSC has prepared 400,000
yuan worth of medicine and clothes that will be transported there
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, located on a major fault line between the Eurasian and
Pacific Rim tectonic plates, is one of China's most seismically
active regions, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1930 three earthquakes measuring above six on the Richter
Scale have been recorded in the area. The latest one was in last
October when a magnitude 6.5 quake hit the province, killing 51
and injuring hundreds.

HAIKOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic experts in Hainan,
China's largest special economic zone, have proposed further
opening to join the current free trade trend in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Scholars at the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Research

its geographical position to establish an export-oriented economy,
so as to join in time the economic take-off of the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Their proposals include issuing more preferential policies to
foreign investors, increasing agricultural and tourism input,
exploiting marine resources further, and developing a free trade
zone and an international tourism center.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province, separated from the mainland by the Qiongzhou
Straits, is the second-largest island in China, and was approved
as the country's fifth special economic zone in the late 1980s.

A U.S. soldier was killed on Saturday when he apparently

<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today directed the Philippine National Police (PNP) to intensify
the manhunt for the abductors of architect Gilbert Yu.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines (ISAFP) to extend support to the PNP in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the community, as the fifth pillar of the
criminal justice system, to provide information to the authorities
for the success of the hunt for the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The PNP's task force dragon is still verifying news reports
that Yu was released by his captors allegedly after his family
paid 10 million pesos (400,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation conducted by the task force revealed that
the victim, who just arrives from Hong Kong, was fetched by his
family and driver Vicente Porlayagan at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
When they reached the corner of Instruccion and Espana streets
in Sampaloc, Manila, an l300 van blocked the Mazda E-2000 van of
the architect.
</P>
<P>
Two armed men alighted from the l-300 van and shot the victim's
driver hitting him in the chin, and forcibly dragged Gilbert Yu
out of the vehicle into the waiting l-300 van.
</P>
<P>
The l-300 van then drove away towards Quezon city while the
wounded driver was brought to a hospital by the police.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Backs Stiffer Penalties for Drug Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today agreed on the need to reimpose stiffer penalties, including
death, for drug offenders in a bid to put teeth in the
government's drive against illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
He certified as urgent a bill filed by Senator Ernesto Herrera,
which seeks to restore the penalties provided under the dangerous
drug act of 1972 and reimpose the death penalty as a mandatory or
discretionary sentence for illegal drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The law reimposed the death penalty on certain heinous crimes,
including the importation, manufacture, possession, sale,
distribution or transport of prohibited drugs and the cultivation
of plants which are sources of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the law also specifies the quantity of drugs for which
the death penalty may be imposed.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
on Saturday warned that if the opposition in Zanzibar wanted
confrontation, the ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) was ready to
face them head on.
</P>
<P>
The warning was given when he was speaking at a rally at the
Dodoma Jamhuri Stadium to mark the 19th aniversary of the ruling
CCM.
</P>
<P>
"The winners have won, and losers have lost. But if they are
after confrontation we are ready for it," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Several parties raced in last year's multiparty elections and
the CCM emerged the winner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that Zanzibar and Mainland leaders were elected by
a majority of people as stipulated in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"This is time for all people to participate in the development
efforts of the country and not engaging in dangerous political
games," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president also underscored the importance of
self-reliance, saying that people should not expect everything to
be financed by the government or donors.
</P>
<P>
He said donor countries were tired of Tanzania's endless
dependence on them and had thus urged it to abide by its declared
self-reliance policy.  enditem

<HEADLINE> PLO Hails Egypt's Support for Palestinian Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- PLO official Saeb Erekat today
hailed Egypt's support for the Palestinian cause, saying that
Egypt plays a pioneering role in defending the rights of the
Palestinians and those of all other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, in an interview with Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of
Arabs) Radio, lauded Egypt's stance toward Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres' recent statements which dismissed Palestinian claims
on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peres told a convention of U.S. Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem last
Sunday that Jerusalem would never again be divided, ruling out the
possibilities of establishing an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who is now in Davos,
Switzerland, to attend the World Economic Forum, said Saturday
that the establishment of the Palestinian state is the only
guarantee for peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On the statements by Peres, Moussa said that Peres has no right
to interfere in Palestinian self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, member of the Palestinian legislative council, also
said that Peres knows the Arab-Israeli conflict in the region will
not be settled except through the setting up of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Under Palestinian-Israeli agreements, the final status of
Jerusalem will be decided in the final-stage negotiations between
the two sides due to start in May.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed the holy city as its unified capital.
</P>
<P>
On the PLO Executive Committee meeting to be held Monday in Al
Arish, Egypt, Erekat said the meeting under the chairmanship of
PLO leader Yasser Arafat is of vital importance as it will lay down
the foundations on which the Palestinian political life will be
based for the coming three years.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The outer wall of the Afghan
presidential palace was damaged when five rockets shelled Kabul
today, according to reports from the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that one rocket demolished a portion of the
northern wall of the official residence of President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Three people were injured when four other rockets hit an area
where some diplomatic missions were located, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
Kabul was attacked by bombing and shelling for a number of
times during the past two weeks after Rabbani's rivals rejected
his unilateral ceasefire offer last month to mark the Muslim
fasting month which began on January 21.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for these attacks though the
Taliban religious student militia were blamed for them.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has besieged Kabul since last October in a bid to
topple the Rabbani government and to enforce Islamic law
throughout the country.

SEOUL, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's LG Electronics
Corporation plans to produce color television sets in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on a commission basis
starting this year, the National Unification Board (NUB) said here

</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has recently approved LG's request

<HEADLINE> Solana Outlines NATO's Tasks in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said today in Munich, Germany that "1996 is the year in
which the alliance moves towards enlargement while solidifying a
special relationship with Russia."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Munich International Security Conference, Solana
stressed the importance of U.S. involvement in European security.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the alliance will restructure itself to
accommodate greater European defense responsibilities while
renewing the trans-Atlantic link, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a lesson in the positive turnaround of events in
Bosnia over the past six months, it is that the active involvement
of the United States in European security affairs continues to
make the crucial difference between success and failure," Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
"The No.1 lesson of the past few years is: working separately
and at crossed purposes, the U.S. and its European allies can
accomplish little; working together, in NATO, there is little that
they cannot achieve," the NATO chief commented.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing relations with the United States, Solana also
underscored a major role of European allies in the NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO needs to "create structures which permit the European
allies to assume greater defense responsibilities, principally the
establishment of Combined Joint Task Forces," he told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Solana reaffirmed that NATO this year is going to conduct
individual dialogs with countries interested in joining the
organization, most of which are former Warsaw Pact nations.
</P>
<P>
But Solana also said, apparently trying to appease Russia, that
"it is possible for NATO and Russia to work side by side as equals
in meeting the real security challenges facing the new Europe."
</P>
<P>
"We want to work closely with Russia because a healthy and
cooperative partnership between NATO and Russia can and must be
the foundation of security in Post-Cold War Europe," the Secretary
General said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a historical mistake to create new dividing lines
in Europe or otherwise isolate Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana also praised the work of NATO-led IFOR, the
multi-national implementation force, in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR mission "thus far has gone remarkably well, especially
in separating the (Bosnian government and rebel Serb) forces."
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday we reached at midnight one of the most important
milestones of our entire mission: the complete withdrawal of
forces from each party's areas which are to be transferred to
another party."
</P>
<P>
"If compliance is confirmed," he said, "it will mean that the
new and permanent map of Bosnia created by the Dayton accord is
beginning to take shape."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized NATO's readiness to do its "utmost to help
facilitate the work of the civilian reconstruction agencies in
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Solana also promised that the NATO will support The Hague War
Crimes Tribunal, investigating war crimes in the 42-month-long
conflict. "I pledge that NATO will help (bring war criminals to
justice) within its capabilities, indeed we are already responding
to requests from the Tribunal in securing access to evidence and
providing information to the investigations."

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Return to Affect Oil Prices: Gulf Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Some Gulf experts fear that
an Iraqi return to the world oil market would affect crude prices.
</P>
<P>
The news of negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations
on the terms of an oil-for-food deal has weakened the oil
prices, said today's Emirates News.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates News quoted Mohammed al Asumi, chief economist at
the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) state-run Emirates Industrial Bank
as saying that it is normal that the international oil market
becomes jittery and oil prices come under pressure when there is
information that fresh quantities of crude are about to find
their way onto the market.
</P>
<P>
"But that does not mean prices will collapse as was the case
in 1986 when there was a production war. The quantity Iraq will
be allowed to export could be absorbed provided there is
discipline within OPEC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations are to resume talks on the
oil-for-food deal in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts in the Gulf said they expected a positive outcome
from this round though the previous negotiations failed to yield
results.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N.-brokered deal, Iraq will be allowed to export 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of crude oil over a period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, averaged oil prices were 16 to 17 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
UAE officials believe that the return of Iraq, the second
biggest oil power in the world after Saudi Arabia, will not have
a strong influence on crude prices if OPEC takes action.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwaiti economist Jassim al Sadun doubted the ability of
OPEC, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will be happy with a
third-place finish at the medal tally with seven gold medals
during the week-long Asian Winter Games which opens here on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes aim to win six golds from the short-track
speedskating and one from the speedskating," South Korean
delegation chief Park Kap-Chul said here early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Women's short-track world record holders Kim Yun-Mi (500
meters) Chun Lee-Kyung (1,000 and 3,000 meters) Kim So-Hee (1,500
meters) will lead the South Korean hunt for gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Men's world champion Kim Yoon-Man is expected to lift at least
one gold medal from the speedskating.
</P>
<P>
"Since the South Korean hope is riding on ice, especially on
the short-track, I really hope the judges will be impartial," Park
said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the standard version, in which athletes race against the
clock on 400-meter ovals, the short-track speedskating have up to
six skaters maneuvering for position through tight turns on
111-meter track. Race strategy can be more important than times
and therefore the referees' judging is essential.
</P>
<P>
Park said that Japan, which had topped the medal standings in
the previous two games, will keep its number one spot with a
possible collection of 16 gold medals and China will have eight
golds to retain its runner-up position while Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan will take six golds apiece to vie for the fourth place
after South Korea.

billion U.S. dollars since Iraq invaded the country in August
1990, half of which was spent during the seven months of
occupation, and the government was urged to cut budget deficit, a
local news paper said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily Arab Times, a parliamentary report said
Saturday that there will be serious political and social
implications if no urgent and practical measures were immediately
implemented to check growing expenditures and eliminate a thorny
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that the budget deficit was mainly caused by
politically-motivated financial decisions that have no relations
with financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by a technical team set up by the Finance
and Economic Committee, will be submitted to the National
Assembly for discussion along with the government five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the state financial requirements
during 1995/96 and 96/97 fiscal years reach 5,670 million Kuwaiti
dinars (about 18.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Head of the technical team Ahmad Al-Nassar told reporters that
based on the government statistics and data, it has to be
admitted that Kuwait is facing tough financial situation. But
he added that if some sacrifices are made and the Assembly,
government and the people cooperate, it will be under control.
</P>
<P>
Nassar said that the team will submit one recommendation
that the government should submit a program proposing ways to
eliminate the budget deficit by the year 2000. The program
should be issued in the form of a law to compel both the
Assembly and the government.
</P>
<P>
The report also affirmed if no serious decision was taken,
Kuwait's economic and social future will be at risk.
</P>
<P>
There is no hope also, at least in the short term, of
a major improvement in oil revenues because neither prices
nor production is likely to increase.

<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading British newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The dispute between Britain and Germany over the
future shape of Europe broke into the open on Saturday, when
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind used language
reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher to condemn Helmut Kohl, the
German Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Research carried out by the Institute of Hydrology,
one of the world's prestigious water research center, has
for the first time revealed that acid rain is likely to
poison Britain's lakes and soil for centuries.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of university students are being misled
into thinking that media studies courses will qualify them
for a job in broadcasting. A new research suggests that only
about a quater of media courses include proper training and
in addition, only a third of full-time staff running such
courses have had experience in the industry in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- President Carlos Menem of Argentina is to visit
Britain this year in an effort to bury for good the

<HEADLINE> UAE's GDP Increases by 6.45 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) grew by 6.45 percent in
1995, according to Emirates Industrial Bank (EIB).
</P>
<P>
In a study published today by the official Emirates News Agency
(WAM), the bank said the GDP increased from 36.83 billion
U.S. dollars in 1994 to 39.2 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EIB attributed the growth, nearly double the 3.7 percent
rate recorded in 1994, to higher crude prices and expansion in
non-oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
It said the rise in crude prices to 16.8 dollars a barrel in
1995 boosted the oil sector's contribution to the GDP by 7.3
percent to 13.2 billion dollars from 12.3 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, oil prices were 15.5 dollars on average, the lowest in
five years.
</P>
<P>
With the proven reserves of nearly 100 billion barrels of
crude, the UAE produces some 2.16 million barrels of oil per
day.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, non-oil sectors also grew rapidly because of the
development mainly in the construction, trade and banking
sectors, the EIB said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the non-oil sector was due to the country's
policy of diversification of its economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, UAE's non-oil sector contributed to 66 percent of the
GDP.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Earthquake Toll Rises to 228 Eds: updated with key figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Latest reports said that 228
people have been killed, 3,700 seriously injured while more than
10,000 people suffered minor injuries in the strong earthquake
which rocked southwest China's Yunnan Province Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake which hit two counties in northwest Yunnan at
19:14 hours (Beijing time) Saturday measured seven on the Richter
Scale.
</P>
<P>
Official resources said that no overseas tourist was injured or
killed though the two counties are tourist attractions in the
province.
</P>
<P>
A relief headquarters with governor He Zhiqiang as the chief
has been formed to organize the overall relief work at an
emergency meeting called by the Provincial Government Saturday
evening. About 1,550 local army officers and men and 350
militiamen have been sent to help the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The provincial seismological bureau has also sent people to the
area to further monitor possible after-shocks. Three medical teams
are on the way to the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake is located at 27.17 degrees
north latitude and 100.5 degrees east longitude between Lijiang
and Zhongdian counties in northwest Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
In the seat of the Lijiang County, about 10 percent of the old
houses have been toppled, water and power supply was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Early last month seismologists predicted that earthquakes
measuring six to seven on the Richter Scale may happen in that
region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1930 three earthquakes measuring above six on the Richter
Scale have been recorded in the area.

<HEADLINE> Two Islamic Jihad Activists Killed in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Preventive
Security agents raided a house in the Shati refugee camp near
Gaza City Saturday and killed two Islamic Jihad activists, after
they apparently refused to surrender, according to local media
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the two men might have been
involved in planning the Beit Lid double-bombing which killed 20
Israeli soldiers and a civilian one year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Sources in Gaza said the two men were suspected of
planning attacks against Israelis to avenge the killing of
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki in Malta three months ago.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian police statement said that when a patrol went to
the house to arrest Mahmoud Zatmar and Riyad Abu Hashish, gunmen
in another room began shooting at the policemen. Police returned
fire and a grenade exploded in the other room.
</P>
<P>
Two bodies, along with three other grenades, one being ready to
explode, were later found in the room.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies were identified as Amir Arraj, 25, from the
Rimal quarter of Gaza City, and Eyman Ruzeineh, 30, from Jabalya
refugee camp, both known as Islamic Jihad activists.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Shati camp said the incident began when four
or five plainclothes policemen stormed the house, arrested two
men, and then chased two other men into a room, one of them
holding a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
Police told them to surrender in one minute and shot them when
they refused.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic Jihad leader called the killings "a criminal act"
and said his movement demands an explanation of why the two men,
who he claimed were not armed, were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gaza police called on Islamic Jihad leaders to act
responsibly. Senior Palestinian security official Mohammed Dahlan
said he hoped that the incident would not affect the positive
relationship between the Palestinian National Authority and the
Islamic Jihad movement.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad, which means "holy war" in Arabic, has about 250
to 300 hardcore followers in Lebanon and similar number of
guerrillas in the Gaza Strip. It opposes the peace agreements
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization and has
claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed dozens of
Israelis in the past two years. Its hardliners refuse to
compromise on anything short of a Palestinian state in all of
Israel and the occupied territories.

<HEADLINE> Peres May Announces Early Elections within Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres will announce early elections within two weeks' time
even though the decision has been taken, according to Labor Party
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Peres will justify the decision for
early elections by claiming the need for a new mandate for the
government.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials are still talking about two possible dates of
early elections: May 21 or May 28. The elections were originally
set for late October this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres refused to commit himself to any date. He told
Israel Television Saturday night that he would decide on a date by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is pressuring me to decide before the proper time,
but no one is going to force my hand on this. I will decide
exactly when there is a need to decide," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres cited several justifications for calling for early
elections. One, he said, is because the election campaign has
essentially begun, and to have it last 10 months would be a
tremendous waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
He added that there are also many pressing national issues to
be decided that require the government to seek a new mandate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres discounted reports that the U.S. has
expressed concern that early elections could interfere with
progress in Israel's peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio last Friday that he and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher had discussed the issue of early
elections by phone.
</P>
<P>
"He (Christopher) told me that the United States has no
intention whatsoever to interfere with the elections," said
Peres. "I told him that there was not and will not be any link
between elections and the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Christopher is due to arrive here
this evening on a new shuttle visit to Israel and Syria. He will
probably discuss with Peres the issue of early elections once
again.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi to Build Third Plant in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Automotive
Manufacturing Corp. (PAMCOR), the local assembler of Mitsubishi
cars, will build a third assembly plant next year in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new plant will meet a forecast increase in car demand and
carry out some of the operations farmed out by its Japanese parent
company.
</P>
<P>
Melchor Dizon, PAMCOR's vice president for marketing, said over
the weekend that about two billion pesos (80 million US dollars)
will be allotted for the project.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be built in a 50-hectare site in the Calabarzon
area, will manufacture up to 40,000 units yearly beginning in
1999.
</P>
<P>
PAMCOR's two existing plants in Cainta, Rizal are estimated to
turn out 60,000 units annually once an ongoing expansion program
is completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
Dizon said the plant will also assume some labor-intensive
functions, such as the manufacture of automotive parts, which made
Mitsubishi's operations in Japan very costly when currency markets
fluctuated wildly last year.
</P>
<P>
PAMCOR slipped to third place in terms of market share last
year. A report from the Chamber of Automotive Manufactures of the
Phils. Inc. said that the company sold 12,486 units or about 17
percent of total cars sold, compared with 25 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Dizon said that the company hopes to regain its second-place
rank this year from Nissan Motor Phils. Corp., whose sales rose 43
percent from 9,062 units to 12,978 units last year.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. continued to lead the pack,
accounting for 17,107 units, or 24 percent of total sales.

TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Giant-killer Iva Majoli of
Croatia upset Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in straight set to win the
926,250-dollar Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The injury-plagued 18-year-old Majoli, who shocked world
co-number one Monica Seles on her way to the final, swept the
final in 6-4, 6-1 victory over the Spanish former world number one.
</P>
<P>
Majoli suffered injuries to her shoulder and right knee during
a match against Dutch power-server Brenda Schultz-McCarthy and
strained her left thigh in beating rising 15-year-old Swiss star
Hingis Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The win earned Majoli 200,000 U.S. dollars and reduced her
win-loss record against Sanchez Vicario to 1-3.
</P>
<P>
She also gained 465 points, including 205 bonus points, which
will improve her ranking to a career high of fourth next week from
her current eighth, according to a WTA spokeswoman after the game.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, who last won at the German Open in May, had to
be satisfied with the runner-up prize of 100,000 U. S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> OCA President Assures Bangkok Will Host 1998 Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, Northeast China, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian
Olympic chief has given a go-ahead to the organizers of the 1998
Summer Asian Games in Bangkok who have been worried for several
years that their host right could be deprived following numerous
complaints about their lack of preparation.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an Asian Games in Bangkok in 1998," said Sheikh
Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) who is attending the Third Asian Winter Games which opens on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The OCA president told the press Sunday morning that the OCA's
executive board on Saturday refused some OCA member countries'
proposal to take the Games away from Bangkok on the grounds of its
snarled traffic, heavy pollution and lack of commitment.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Fahad said that at least four meetings between the OCA
officials and the Bangkok organizers would be held before the OCA
General Assembly in December 1997 to hammer out some problems
remaining.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been working desperately to show the OCA that it
was very serious about the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Authority of Thailand has revamped its committees
and the organizers had sent a full progress report by January 5,
the deadline set by the OCA.
</P>
<P>
The OCA president also said that the Asian sports governing
body would cover the expenses of one athlete and one official from
each OCA member country who takes part in the Asian Games, both
summer and winter.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Fahad then said that the OCA would pay more attention
to the marketing of the Asian sports.
</P>
<P>
"The OCA earned only 150,000 U.S. dollars from the Seoul Asian
Games," he said. "The Bangkok Games is expected to make 50 to 70
millions dollars and the OCA will receive five percent or 2.5 to 4
millions dollars."
</P>
<P>
The president added that the 2002 Summer Asian Games in Pusan
of South Korea was predicted to make 100 millions dollars and 53
millions would go to the OCA.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Fahad suggested the host for the Summer Asian Games be
rotated among the four parts of Asia -- North, South, East and
West Asia. "That will be good for a well-balanced development of
the Asian sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OCA is also planning to increase the size of the Summer
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will have 36 title and performance sports in the Pusan
Games and 12,000 or 13,000 athletes and officials will be
there," said the president.

of the investors.
</P>

During the month of January, the DSE was forced to close five
days owing to opposition strike.

<HEADLINE> Hefty Deposits Increase Slows Down Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sustained and sharp increase in
individual bank savings has contributed to China's anti-inflation
drive, according to a recent article in China's leading newspaper,
the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that China contained price hikes within 15 percent
last year and that the growth rate of currency in circulation
dropped to the lowest level since 1992 would be attributed to the
continued and big increase in individual bank deposits," said the
article in Tuesday's issue of the paper.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the central bank, the People's Bank of
China, showed that China's individual bank deposits neared 3,000
billion yuan (about 375 billion US dollars) by the end of
1995. The figure represents a net increase of 800 billion yuan
over the previous year, or four times that of the total personal
deposits five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Huge amount of cash flowing back to banks through deposits has
helped ease the pressure on the market as people choose to save
rather than to spend, said the People's Daily article, adding that
the high interest rate plus the inflation-beating subsidy rate is
the main forge behind the strong momentum of deposit growth.
</P>
<P>
The deposit growth, meanwhile, provides "stable" sources of
capital to banks. The some 3,000 billion yuan deposits now
constitute about half of banks' working capital, or account for 60
percent of China's total bank outstanding lendings.
</P>
<P>
But the growing deposit pool on the other hand could build up
inflation pressure as it indicates people's growing purchase
potential.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the current political and economic stability are to
stay and positive measures are taken, the huge deposit pool could
not turn out to be a real threat," said the article.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that as a developing country, China faces
capital shortage, therefore attracting deposits should be a basic
policy. It quotes experts as saying that the government should
keep the interest rate on deposits higher than inflation rate to
stimulate the depositors' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested measures be taken to encourage proper
spending so as to balance potential demand. To that end, the
article called for speeding up the reforms on housing and medicare
system.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU to Strengthen Foothold in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) hopes to
forge a political and economic partnership with Asia to strengthen
its foothold in the world's most economically dynamic region and
match a strong US presence here.
</P>
<P>
According to Assistant Trade and Industry Secretary Edsel
Custodio, a mechanism for regular economic and political dialogue
will be the highlight of a first ever summit between EU leaders
and the heads of 10 Asian countries to be held in Thailand on
March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
While there are already links between Europe and the US and
between the US and Asia, there is no network connecting Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to build the third leg in the world network,"
Custodio explained. "We hope to achieve a framework for dialogue
on common concerns."
</P>
<P>
According to an agenda prepared by senior officials from the
seven members of ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea, the meeting
will cover the political and security situations in both regions,
the role of the United Nations in the post-cold war period, arms
control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
EU and Asian officials also hope the summit would boost
economic ties between the two regions. Although trade is steadily
expanding, European investments in the region is miniscule.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the 15-member EU and the 10 Asian countries
totaled 238 billion US dollars in 1992. The region, however,
received only about one percent of the EU's total overseas foreign
investments that year.
</P>
<P>
Aside from increased trade and investments and closer
networking between the private business sectors of the two
regions, EU and Asian leaders will vow to "strengthen
multilateralism and open regionalism".
</P>
<P>
A declaration of support for the World Trade Organization as
the global trade arbiter will be made.
</P>
<P>
EU and Asian countries have often complained that Washington
forced trading partners to grant concessions by threatening them
with unilateral sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Custodio said that leaders will also pledge to cooperate on
global issues such as the environment, drug trafficking, terrorism
and international crime, human resource development,
infrastructure and poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Inland Areas Hold Growing Appeal to Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sumitomo Bank of Japan opened
a representative office here Tuesday, signaling the bank's
interest in making inroad into China's central and west regions.
</P>
<P>
The launching of Sumitomo Bank's agency in this city in
southwest China could cater not only to the needs of three large
Sino-Japanese auto and motorcycle joint ventures but also serve as
the springboard to more business opportunities in the country's
vast hinterland, said Yoshihiko Kawabata, the bank's Chongqing
chief representative.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the attraction of inland areas is growing as
the central government will shift development priority to these
areas in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic development in regions along the
Yangtze River is gearing up under the push of prospering Shanghai
and Pudong New Area and the multi-billion Three-Gorge-Dam project.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese banker's view is shared by more and more overseas
financial institutions which are in a rush to open agencies in
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the People's Bank of China Chongqing
Branch, officials from 18 overseas banks including those from
Japan, the United States and France, visited Chongqing in 1995 to
explore business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Bao Shen Bank from Hong Kong set up a representative office in
the city last year, becoming the first overseas financial
institutions housed in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Kawabata from Sumitomo Bank said that his office will also
provide financial services to large Chinese enterprises and
introduce the city to more Japanese investors.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Loses 88,000 Hectares Of Forest Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia loses 88,000
hectares of forest every year while the annual tree plantation in
the country covers only 6,000 hectares of land, Ethiopia's
National Population Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistical data released by the office said that the decline
of forest coverage to only three percent of the land in the
country was a result of higher consumption of fuel wood for
energy purposes.
</P>
<P>
The statistical data recalled that 40 percent of the land in
the country was covered by forest about 75 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Accoridng to the data, fuel wood covers 80.7 percent of the
energy consumption of the country while electricity, petroleum
and charcoal satisfy only 1.7 percent of the demand.
</P>
<P>
It said that the annual loss of two billion cubic metres of
soil in the country indicates the wide spread of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The need for more farmland following the explosion of
population in the nation has also contributed for tree-felling,
the decline of soil fertility and the deterioration of
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The office urged the public to exert maximum effort to protect
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the Population Office, the nation has a
population of 56.6 million, second largest in sub-Saharan Africa.
And, the population will reach 112.5 million by the year 2007 if
the three percent growth rate continues. enditem

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Gold Price in HK Continues to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Gold price in Hong Kong hit a
five-year high at the weekend with closing price at 416.59 US
dollars on Friday and 414.96 US dollars on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Within a week, the price rose about 10 US dollars. The drastic
rise of gold price in Hong Kong coincided with the price surge on
the global gold market,
</P>
<P>
Spot transactions in gold hit 1,496 yen per gram in Japan's
over-the-counter markets Saturday, hitting a two-year high.
</P>
<P>
Overnight in London on Friday, gold prices shot up 10 US
dollars to 417 US dollars, the highest since February 1990.
</P>
<P>
Local gold analysts predict that the gold price rally is still
in its early days and over the next six months, the price may rose
to 440 or 450 US dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
The experts attributed the rise in gold price to the lowering
of bank interests, increasing demand for gold, seasonal purchase
and reduction of supply.
</P>
<P>
In recent two months, the US Federal Funds and major US
commercial banks as well as Hong Kong banks had lowered their
interest rates by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Morning Post said that with lower interest rates making
investments such as bonds less attractive, investors and
speculators have begun to find buying and selling gold more
appealing.
</P>
<P>
It said that gold has cast off its image of an unprofitable
investment, attracting huge purchases from speculative US
investment funds, adding that some big investors like George Soros
had decided to switch from stocks and shares to gold transactions
in short term.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the World Gold Council suggest that world
consumption rose by 16 percent in the first nine months in 1995
compared with the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Asia appears to have caught the gold fever. The
driving force behind the gold price hike are mainly investors from
India, China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In India, consumption rose 26 percent last year, as gold is
brides' favorite gift in wedding.
</P>
<P>
Local gold dealers said, gold jewelry sales usually go up in
China and other Chinese communities in Asia in early February, as
people buy gifts for Lunar New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Peter Munk, Chairman of Barrick Gold Corporation, said that
more and more people in the Far East are getting wealthier and
they tend to purchase gold to maintain the value of their money.
</P>
<P>
The drop in gold supply was partly due to an increase in
forward sales by gold producers, especially South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Morning Post said that production by the world's leading
South African mines fell by more than 12 percent over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
Paribas Capital bank analyst said that such a fall would
inevitably affect the gold market because no other country had
the reserves to make up for the lost production.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will give more opportunities to multinational companies,
export-oriented projects and new and hi-tech projects as one of
the measures to open wider to overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Senlin, governor of the province, told a conference
attended by deputies to the provincial people's congress, today
Guangdong will transfer some shares to overseas investors

fields forbidden by the state.
</P>
<P>
He said the province also supports overseas-funded enterprises
to form enterprise groups with domestic enterprises so as to
expand production scale and improve quality. Overseas investors,
he said, are encouraged to start enterprises in Guangdong in the
form of BOT (building, operation and transfer), especially in the
trades encouraged in the state policy and public works in cities.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Zhu said, Guangdong will experiment other ways such as
compensation trade, international leasing, capital mortgage,
auctioning and investment by overseas foundations.
</P>
<P>
By now, investors from more than 70 countries and regions have
invested in the economically booming Guangdong. By the end of
1995, the province has used 53 billion US dollars of overseas
investment. More than half of the 500 world business giants have
invested in the province.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrary Fees on Overseas-Funded Businesses Banned in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The overall financial burden on
overseas-funded ventures has been reduced by 30 percent thanks
to provincial efforts to stem extra-tax fees, according to an
official.
</P>
<P>
A document signed by governor Chen Mingyi last month has banned
18 unreasonable fees and lowered the rates of another 51 kinds of
fees, bringing the overall financial burden on overseas-funded
businesses down by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 714.5 million yuan in unreasonable fees on such
businesses has been uncovered and annulled, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Zhang Jiakun will lead a team to oversee the
implementation of the document and those departments that continue
to collect arbitrary fees will be seriously dealt with, the
official stressed.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Become China's Pillar of Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Yu Guosheng, a farmer of Shitan
Village, Zhejiang Province, east China, did not dare to imagine
his mighty success when he raised 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars)
to set up a garment processing mill 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
So far, his mill has grown into a herculean industrial group
making three million Zephyr-brand garments every year, and its
registered capital increased to 260 million yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bounty reward for our sharp sense of market
opportunity rather than the hard work, though our diligence is
known by the country," said the 37-year-old chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
As lucky as thousands of rural garment plants which mushroomed
over the past decade, his business timely grasped the opportunity
arising with the take-off of the national garment industry.
</P>
<P>
The chance is meteoric but valueless. When the planned economy
gave way to a market-oriented industry within the country's
garment sector, the odds were shifted to those township
enterprises which have a more flexible management system than
their state-owned rivals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the China National Textile Council show
that the share of township enterprises rose to 60 percent of the
country's garment output value during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), and replaced the leading position of
state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
The share even expanded to 70 percent or more in some major
garment suppliers of the country, including Sichuan , Zhejiang,
Anhui and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, chairman of the China Garment Association, said
that such a galloping development of township enterprises is a
major factor behind the whole industry's fast development in the
past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Also, the shifting of garment producing bases from urban area
to countryside conforms to the requirement of developing a
labor-intensive industry here, Dong noted.
</P>
<P>
At present, the township garment enterprises have occupied a
lion share among the domestic hard brands, Dong said, adding that
the first places of both casual wear and shirt sales are being
taken by the township plants in east China's Jiangsu Province and
southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of large enterprise groups have taken shape
after more than 10 years' capital accumulation. A dozen of
township plants reaped more than 100 million yuan-worth of sales
each last year, and that of Hongdou Group, one of China's biggest
township enterprises, topped one billion yuan in sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Dong predicted that in next few years, the country will see
more garment producers shift to rural areas and the
non-governmental sector in the urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Export Electricity to Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will export electricity
to Laos, government officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Vietnam Electricity Corporation is working
on plans to transmit power westwards from Vietnam's biggest Hoa
Binh hydro-electric power plant in the north to several border
provinces in Laos.
</P>
<P>
The sale of electricity to Laos will help Vietnam to narrow its
trade deficit recorded last year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam earned an average 70 U.S. dollars per capita
from export while spent 100 dollars on import.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade volume reached 12 billion dollars
in 1995, a 2 billion dollar increase over its target.
</P>
<P>
But the country experienced an overall trade deficit, which
amounted to 2.1 billion dollars last year.

<P>
BRASILIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The share price of a Brazilian
state-owned enterprise rose 6.9 percent in the Rio de Janeiro
stock exchange following the discovery of a gold mine with a
reserve of 150 tons in the state of Para.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Maria Pereira, general manager of the Vale do Rio
Doce Company, which is scheduled to be privatized this year, said
the company's shares worth 37 million U.S. dollars were negotiated
Friday, the biggest volume in a day since January 2, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The gold mine, with an estimated value of 2 billion dollars,
would have an impact on the privatization of the company, which
had an estimated asset of 10 billion dollars before the discovery
of the mine, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
Pereira estimated that the company's total value now could rise
to 13 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Australia have already shown their interest in buying
51 percent of the company's shares.

COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka marked today its
48th National day amid tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
Troops mounted extraordinary security measures in the city of

<HEADLINE> Kohl Cautions NATO About Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Western countries should be
prudent on the issue of NATO's eastward expansion, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned at an annual international meeting
of defense experts in Munich today.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be wrong to talk about the issue (the NATO's
eastward expansion) with the air of a victor.
</P>
<P>
"We must consider the understandable security interests of
Russia and Ukraine," Kohl told the informal 33rd International
Security Conference, formerly the "Wehrkunde" Conference or the
International Defense Studies Conference.
</P>
<P>
He described as "legitimate" the demand of east European
countries to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
adding that the Oder-Neisse River (between Germany and Poland)
should not be the final eastern border of the European Union (EU)
and the NATO.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor criticized Western countries for not
giving enough consideration to the psychological state of Russian
leaders in the past.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Western countries should stop lecturing on
others.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Kohl also said the EU should strengthen its
defense policy and proposed that the West European Union (WEU)
play a major part in the EU's defense.
</P>
<P>
The WEU groups most but not all the members of the EU and the
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin at the
conference said Russians are opposed to the NATO's expansion
eastward.
</P>
<P>
He stated that it would be regarded as a failure of Russia if
the NATO advances eastward after the German unification.
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin criticized Western countries for not fulfilling
disarmament promises.
</P>
<P>
He also echoed Russia's fear that Western countries may deploy
nuclear weapons in the former Warsaw Pact countries.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon, who also attended the
conference, said his country will resume an active role in the
NATO on the condition the alliance reform.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, France withdrew from the NATO military structure which
has traditionally been under U.S. command.
</P>
<P>
Millon said the Military Committee of the NATO should be a
political and military link.
</P>
<P>
The "Wehrkunde" Conference was initiated in 1963 by Ewald
Heinrich von Kleist, publisher of the European Defense Studies
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Though an informal meeting, it has been attended by high-level
officials including the NATO's secretary general and defense
ministers of Western countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S Defense Secretary William j. Perry will also attend this
year's meeting on Sunday.

<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) Saturday finalized the draft of its election manifesto which
will be published very soon, according to an inside source.
</P>
<P>
The draft manifesto brought into focus mainly the "economic
progress" made during the BNP-ruled period as of 1991 without
highlighting political issues.
</P>
<P>
However, BNP Chairperson and Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia
may indicate a possible way out of the current political stalemate
in her scheduled state of the nation address on radio and
television on February 12.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's meeting, BNP leaders decided to postpone the
campaign trip of the Prime Minister to any of the district towns.
But the BNP chairperson is likely to visit divisional towns -
Rajshahi, Sylhet and Chittagong from the next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more incidents of anti-polls violence were reported
from different districts. The mainstream opposition parties
continued to urge people to resist the "one-party farcical"
election scheduled on February 15.

<HEADLINE> Former S. Korean Leader Uses Slush Fund for New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President
Chun Doo-hwan, indicted for bribery, insurrection and treason,
admitted today that he had used 114 million U.S. dollars to form a
new political party and boost his influence since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Chun made the confession when he was questioned by a special
investigation team about how the 1.23-billion-dollar slush fund he
had established was used, a prosecution official announced.
</P>
<P>
"We have found out that following the three-party merger in
January 1990 under the Roh Tae-woo administration, Chun gave 114
million U.S. dollars to people of various strata as part of a
ground-leveling for his political comeback," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chun and his aides had contacted some 200 people between March
1990 and September 1995 in secret attempts to create a new party
by the end of this month, so as to help Chun take part in the
general elections scheduled for April 11, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Chun is now receiving medical treatment at the National Police
Hospital here after his three-week-long hunger strike, which he
began as a protest against his arrest on December 3, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chun, an army strongman after the 1979 military mutiny, seized
power on August 27, 1980, and had ruled the nation until February
1988. He was replaced by Roh who stepped down in February 1993.

<HEADLINE> Samper Backs Witness Assassination Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Pizano today de-linked his government with the
slaying of Elizabeth Montoya de Sarria, a key witness in the probe
into the alleged use of drug money in Samper's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I reject the linking of my government with this outrage, and I
ask national opinion to support the authorities in their
investigations and at my request they must carry them to the last
consequences," said Samper Pizano.
</P>
<P>
Samper assured that he had requested General Prosecutor Alfonso
Valdivieso Sarmiento, National Police Commander Rosso Jose Serrano
Cadena and DAS Director Marco Tulio Gutierrez to clear the
situation, immediately after he got the news.
</P>
<P>
Montoya was reportedly assassinated Thursday in an apartment in
a section north of Bogota. She was considered a potential witness
in the probe into the alleged use of drug money in the 1994
election campaign that made Samper president.
</P>
<P>
The name of Montoya came to public attention after the local
weekly "Semana" published the transcripts of two telephone
conversations she had with the then presidential candidate Samper
and with his campaign treasurer, antiques dealer Santiago Medina.
</P>
<P>
The victim was the wife of former agent Jesus Amado Sarria
Agredo, now in the El Barne Jail, near Tunja, in the eastern
department of Boyaca, charged with several crimes related to drug
trafficking and illegal enrichment.
</P>
<P>
When Amado Sarria was informed of the assassination and asked
who could have killed her, he said, "It could have been the
government, because of all the things she knew."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Latest reports said that 210
people have been killed and another 3,700 seriously injured in the

Scale.
</P>
<P>
A relief headquarters with governor He Zhiqiang as the chief

emergency meeting called by the Provincial Government Saturday
evening. About 1,550 local army officers and men and 350
militiamen have been sent to help the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
The provincial seismological bureau has also sent people to the
area to further monitor possible after-shocks. Three medical teams
are on the way to the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake is located at 27.17 degrees
north latitude and 100.5 degrees east longitude between Lijiang
and Zhongdian counties in northwest Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
In the seat of the Lijiang County, about 10 percent of the old
houses have been toppled, water and power supply was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Early last month seismologists predicted that earthquakes
measuring six to seven on the Richter Scale may happen in that
region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kohl Calls for Fuller Integration of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
called Friday for greater European unity at multi-speeds so that
the move of some EU members toward fuller intergration is not held
back by the others, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sensible alternative to ever closer integration of
European peoples...We need Europe in order that our joint word has
weight in the world," he stressed in a speech at Louvain
University in central Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Kohl received an honorary doctorate there for his role in
European construction.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if the drive to continue unification falters
then it will not just be a standstill but a reverse."
</P>
<P>
"You mustn't let the slowest ship determine the speed of the
convoy. If one partner does not want to or cannot implement
certain stages in integration, that must not prevent the others
from moving ahead and developing strengthened cooperation open to
all," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kohl acknowledged that the European Union (EU) was entering a
period of soul-searching as it continued its drive to merge
national currencies into one -- which is scheduled to be completed
before 1999 -- and set out to review the Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
"If Maastricht is not taken forward then it will not stand a
chance in the face of the challenges of the 21st century," Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for widening the EU by taking in central and
east European countries.
</P>
<P>
Kohl described widening the EU as a question of identity,
saying it would be fatal for the EU if the union closed its door
and lose vitality.
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that Poland's western border will remain the
union's eastern border for very long," Kohl concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- This leading industrial city
of China will make unremitting efforts to set up 28 large
enterprise groups this year, whose output value will account for
one sixth of the city's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Economic Commission, eight out of
these enterprise groups will reap an annual sales volume exceeding
five billion yuan and 20 of them three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Vice-Mayor Jiang Yiren said that this will bring into
full play the city's industrial advantages as a whole and create a
new situation for its industrial development.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that these enterprise groups, bonded by assets
and driven by famous brand products, will operate in line with the
law of the market economy so as to make up each other's
deficiencies and seek common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
An official with the commission said that some enterprises are
still running in the red because of fund shortage and irrational
economic system.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector now contributes 57.5 percent to the local
economy as against 66 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the city's gross industrial output value

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia to Become Main Chilean Copper Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asia will become a
vital market for Chilean copper as its consumption of the metal is
driven up by fast economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the region, demand for refined copper rose by 75 percent
from 2 million tons in 1985 to 3.5 million tons in 1994, far
outstripping the 4-percent increase in the rest of the world, said
the Chilean Copper Commission in an analysis published here today.
</P>
<P>
The commission said Southeast Asia has expanded its share of
the world consumption from 20 percent to 30 percent in just 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Total Chilean refined copper shipments went up by 33 percent
from 892,000 tons in 1985 to 1,193,000 tons in 1994, while
shipments to the Southeast Asian markets surged by three folds
from 154,000 tons to 614,000 tons during the period.
</P>
<P>
The region thus absorbed more than half of the Chilean copper
shipments, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that Japan's copper demand has slipped,
after a surge in the 80s to the top level of 1.6 million tons in
1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Southeast Asian countries showed a sustained growth in
their demand, which constituted 60 percent of the total
consumption in the region.
</P>
<P>
China can be expected to import more copper and increase its
consumption of the Chilean metal as its national economic
development steps up, said the study.

PRAGUE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A number of small political
parties in the Czech Republic merged into one party today in an
effort to make themselves more competitive in the June general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Agrarian Party, the Christian Social Party, the Liberal
Union and several other parties made the decision at a meeting
here attended by 86 party representatives, who unanimously agreed
on the merger.
</P>
<P>
The representatives said the new party, named as the Czech
Moravia Central Union or the CMUS, will adopt a middle-of-the-road
policy, inclining to neither the left nor the right. It will also
work to get the support of grass-roots people.
</P>
<P>
At present, these small parties have support ratings of between
1 percent and 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Deepen Relations With Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has set as its new
task the boosting of its ties with the outside world in an effort
to enhance its status as a big country in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said in an interview with
the Panorama weekly published today that Kazakhstan managed its
foreign affairs in a more pragmatic way in 1995, improved its
international status and created favorable external conditions for
reforms at home.
</P>
<P>
While denying that the country's foreign policy focused on
Asian countries in 1995, he said Kazakhstan indeed further
developed relations with its neighbors such as Russia, China,
Kirghistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
However, it also increased cooperation with the United States,
the European Union and some European countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev said his country is trying its best to strengthen
cooperation with China, whose economic potential and international
status have been rising.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry has serious difficulty in providing
funds for the country's missions abroad.

<HEADLINE> South African Wins African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa downed Tunisa
2-0 in the final to win the 20th African Nations Cup soccer
tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Mark Williams sent the home fans into a frenzy with
all the two goals in the space of 90 seconds late in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Williams, an international player in English first division
club Wolverhampton, was an unlikely hero having earlier in the day
been dropped from the starting lineup for the first time in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
When starting forward Philemon Masinga, who had missed the
semifinals through suspension, limped off midway through the
second half, the stage was set for Williams to forever etch his
name in South African folklore with 18 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Khumalo sent a perfectly freekick in from the left and
Mark Fish leapt to head the ball goalwards.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian goalkeeper Chokri El Ouaer blocked Fish's header and
Eric Tinkler flung himself at the loose ball at the far post when
El Ouaer jumped again in time for a great reflex save. But Sizwe
Motaung seized on the rebound and chipped the ball back for
Williams to head home.
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes later the substitute bore down on El Ouaer and
fired accurately into the net between the keeper and the far post
for 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia had surprised South Africa during a pulsating first
half by showing more inventiveness and flair that they had
hitherto been credited with. Mehdi Slimane and Adel Sellimi
constantly harrassed the home defense.
</P>
<P>
In the other match before the final, Zambia beat Ghana 1-0 to
take the third place and Ghana finished in the fourth at the
15-team and 22-day tournament which started on January 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 171 people have been
killed and another 570 people seriously injured in a strong
earthquake which rocked southwest China's Yunnan Province
Saturday evening, latest local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake which hit two counties in northwest Yunnan at
19:14 hours (Beijing time) Saturday measured seven on the Richter
Scale.
</P>
<P>
A relief headquarters with governor He Zhiqiang as the chief
has been formed to organize the overall relief work at an
emergency meeting called by the Provincial Government Saturday
evening. Local army units have been sent to help the rescue
work. The provincial seismological bureau has also sent people to
the area to further monitor possible after-shocks. Medical teams
have also rushed to the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake is located at 27.17 degrees
north latitude and 100.5 degrees east longitude between Lijiang
and Zhongdian counties in northwest Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
In the seat of the Lijiang County, about 10 percent of the old
houses have been toppled, water and power supply was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Early last month seismologists predicted that earthquakes
measuring six to seven on the Richter Scale may happen in that
region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1930 three earthquakes measuring above six on the Richter
Scale have been recorded in the area.

<HEADLINE> EU Rejects Brazil's Demand for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
rejected Brazil's demand for further tariff cuts to compensate its
export losses incurred by the entry of its three important trading
partners into the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
Brazil complained that after Austria, Finland and Sweden joined
the EU, they suspended the tariff reductions granted to Brazilian
products such as coffee beans and instant dehydrated coffee,
tobacco, fibers, steel sheets, and ethyl alcohol, which weigh
heavy in the country's balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government made the request at a meeting in
Geneva on Friday, but it was rejected by the EU, according to
sources close to the Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian negotiators asked for an extension of the range of
tariffs on Brazilian products exported to the EU members.
</P>
<P>
But EU representatives argued that even if Brazil sustained
losses in its export of these products, it at the same time
benefited from the EU enlargement with the entry of Austria,
Finland and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will resume their discussions on the matter at
their meetings in the future, said the sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's total demand for

<P>
ZAGREB, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. secretary of state Warren
Christopher on Saturday met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic,
pressing the government side for the full implementation of the
Bosnian peace agreement, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the meeting, Izetbegovic
said that he and Christopher had agreement that the military
provisions of the peace accord was being carried out well, but
there were some obstacles in the implementation of the civilian
aspects of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic promised to free immediately all remaining
prisoners of war still detained by the government and that all
foreign troops would leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The issues of the POWs and foreign troops have been two primary
concerns for the United States because deadlines for compliances
as spelled out in the peace agreement have slipped past.
</P>
<P>
The United States would continue offering support to Bosnian
government and its people, Christopher said, adding that the
country's future depends, first of all, on the full implementation
of the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was also quoted as saying that his country would
help all sides in order to create open society in Bosnia, and that
this would be a difficult task because of all suffering caused by
the war.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also met President of the Bosnian Federation
Kresimir Zubak and former Prime minister Haris Silajdzic in the
U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, as well as Carl Bildt, the international
community's High Representative for implementation of the peace
accord.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President to Visit Britain This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos Menem
is to visit Britain later this year in an effort to promote
relations between the two countries, according to diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major extended the invitation to
President Menem when the two leaders met last October at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first Argentine President's visit to Britain
in 14 years after the Falklands War between the two nations in
1982.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said that Britain has refused to name
the date for the visit until the two countries concluded a pact on
fishing conservation around Falkland (Malvinas) Islands.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that both sides would start their talks on
protection of fish stocks in Buenos Aires on February 28.
</P>
<P>
Both the authorities of Falkland and the Government of
Argentina give fishing licenses to foreign vessels that has raised
the fears that fish stocks may be endangered in the region.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella is reported as saying
earlier this week in London that he hoped the talks would be over
quickly and the two sides could make arrangement for the
presidential visit.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Gets OAU Grant For Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) has given the 16-state Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) 200,000 dollars in support of its peace
efforts in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The money is the continental body's financial support for the
ECOWAS-led peace monitoring force, ECOMOG, in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive-secretary, Edouard Benjamin, was quoted
today by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying that the OAU's
gesture was an expression of African "solidarity".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that other international organisations
would follow the example.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, which sent ECOMOG to Liberia in August 1990, has
organised many peace talks to help end the Liberian civil war,
which started in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
The last peace accord on Liberia, an ECOWAS member, was signed
in the Nigerian capital Abuja in August 1995 by all the parties
to the Liberian conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja peace accord provides for a cease-fire, disarmament
of the estimated 60,000 Liberian combatants and the setting up of
a six-member collective preidency.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has since appointed former Zimbabwean president Canan
Banana its special envoy to Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Pledges to Maintain Open Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo pledged here today that his country would maintain
its push for an open economy that he said helped his nation emerge
from a financial crisis early last year.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Mexico is coming out of this crisis much quicker
than we did from earlier ones is because we have a free trade
system,... and because we pursued our policy of structural
reform," Zedillo told the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum (WEF) at the eastern Swiss resort of Davos.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that today the imbalances that
triggered the crisis have been largely corrected: the current
account is back to equilibrium, the debt is one tenth of what it
was a year ago, foreign reserves are 4.5 times larger than a year
earlier, and the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.6 percent to
5.2 percent within six months.
</P>
<P>
"The future holds much promise for Mexico", he said. The
government is committed to sound macroeconomic management and
structural reform through liberalization and privatization
policies. Steps have also been taken to foster savings, in
particular with a sweeping reform of the national pension system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, renewed efforts are being made to improve
education and training. Political stability will be ensured in the
years to come as democracy will be further built up.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
Zedillo emphasized Mexico's "unshakable adherence to free trade"
and rejected the claim that NAFTA may be held responsible for
Mexico's trouble and described it as "an unwarranted, illogical
and ridiculous assertion."
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the Mexico-like financial crises in the
future, Zedillo stressed that international financial
institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank, should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
His remarks won support from top officials from the two
institutions attending today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the
IMF, said that the IMF does not have sufficient financial
resources for the management of repeated Mexico crises. Therefore,
he called for more financing from member countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that although international organizations are well
equipped to deal with crisis, they would need a strengthened
mandate to deal with those that can be anticipated in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James Wolfensohn agreed that international
organizations have "adequate architecture" to cope with future
challenges. It was all important, however, that emphasis be put on
a cohesive approach with the IMF, World Bank and the World Trade
Organization (WTO) working closely together. And this cooperation
should be expanded to bring in the private sector and
non-governmental organizations.

from external donors and private individuals.
</P>
<P>
The two-day media experts meeting, called by ECOWAS, was
attended by representatives from ten of the 16 member countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Turns Out Black Horse Winner In Africa Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Ye Xingzeng)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's soccer
team today turned out a black horse winner in its first-ever
African Nations Cup contest as substitute Mark Williams scored a
consecutive two goals to beat Tunisia 2-0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia defeated Ghana 1-0 to clutch the third
place in the biggest sports event in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The South African bench player, who replaced injured striker
Philemon Masinga in the 60th minute, scored two goals at the 73rd
and 75th minutes in the match held at the First National Bank
Stadium in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela led 85,000 fans to hail the brilliant
performance of the South Africa's national soccer team, the
"Bafana Bafana" (meaning young boys) in the thrilling competition.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the game was held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Also present were South Africa's Deputy President F W De
Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, and African Football
Confederation President Issa Hayatou.
</P>
<P>
The first half was a goalless draw, though South Africa's
national team "Bafana Bafana" (meaning young boys) made every
effort to control the field.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian midfielder Soufiane Feki brought South African
midfielder John Mosheou down in the 69th minute and a free-kick
was awarded to the "Bafana Bafana".
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Khumalo sent the kick into the goalmouth. However,
in a flurry of action, the ball was turned against a defender by
midfielder Eric Tinkler and bundled back into Williams' path in a
crowded penalty area.
</P>
<P>
The marksman headed the ball past a diving Tunisian goalkeeper
into the net to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
While Tunisia hardly got over the setback when Khumalo sent a
throughpass a minute later and Williams was set free in no man's
land to punt the ball in for the second.
</P>
<P>
"Winning the cup is a great feeling and I'm thankful I played
a part in it," said Williams, adding the victory was a result of
"excellent teamwork".
</P>
<P>
"I was always strong in the belief that we would pull off the
big one," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 20th African Nations Cup soccer tournament kicked off on
January 13 in Johannesburg, attended by 15 African national
teams.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Peace Process In "Grave Danger": U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. special envoy has pointed
out that the peace process in Liberia "is in grave danger" in the
wake of "attacks on ECOMOG (the west African peace-keeping force
in Liberia) and the inability of the (Liberian) transitional
government to rapidly end the violence".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to Liberia, Dane
Smith, made the comment in Liberian capital Monrovia on Friday at
the end of a three-day working visit to the west African country.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Smith met with members of the collective
Presidency, other government officials, ECOMOG high command,
representatives of UN agencies and aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Attacks on ECOMOG and the government's inability to end the
violence have raised serious doubts in the international
community about its commitment to the peace process," Smith was
quoted today by a report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These doubts have been heightened by reports of fighting in
the southeast and continued problems of (aid agencies) access to
the needy in various parts of the country," he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord signed last August by all parties
to the Liberian conflict, a six-man collective presidency and a
cabinet have been set up to run Liberia till the elections next
August.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, 1995, ECOMOG began a deployment throughout
Liberia in preparation for the disarmament of some 60,000
fighters of Liberia's armed factions, due to begin in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
However, the exercise met a setback when militia of the armed
faction Ulimo-J attacked the peace-keepers on December 28,
forcing ECOMOG to temporarily suspend the deployment last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. special envoy, members of the Liberian
government now conditioned disarmament on the conclusion of an
agreement on the status of ECOMOG force and the creation of a
separate security force alongside ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy urged the collective presidency "to reaffirm
both in word and in deed" its commitment to the Abuja agreement
by facilitating completion of deployment and issuing orders to
fighters to disarm to ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls 1996 Crucial Year for Middle East Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Arafat said
here today that 1996 is a crucial year for Middle East talks and
Syria and Lebanon have realized the urgency of reaching a Middle
East peace agreement because of elections in Israel and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, president of the Palestinian National Authority told
the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) that he
welcomed the two nations' decision to attend a recent Middle East
meeting in Barcelona, Spain, after boycotting WEF economic summits
in Casablanca and Amman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres told the meeting Friday
that he was hopeful that talks with Syria and Lebanon would lead
shortly to a comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also noted that Israel was committed by an international
agreement to reach agreement by next May at the latest on all
outstanding issues in the treaty with the Palestinians, namely
Jerusalem, refugees, borders and water.
</P>
<P>
He complained that in the past 15 months, Israel had closed
Gaza and the West Bank to the outside world for 247 days, costing
the region more than 6 million U.S. dollars, more than the
Palestinians had received from donors.
</P>
<P>
"Only private small businessmen, Palestinian businessmen,...
saved us from starvation... with what we call money from under the
carpet," Arafat added. This enabled the Palestinians to save 36,000
jobs in Gaza and 22,000 in the West Bank, he told a session on the
Palestinian economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted that exactly two years ago at the annual meeting
he had held talks with Peres, then Israeli Foreign Minister, and
the Egyptian Foreign Minister that "contributed to achieving
important steps in the march towards peace."

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Christopher Hold Talks on Regional Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher discussed
peace agreement and bilateral relations today and expressed
satisfaction with their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the two-hour talk, Milosevic said that
Christopher's visit, the first by a U.S. Secretary of State in
five years, was very important and that it represented a symbolic
indication of an improvement in the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that he and Christopher had basically discussed
two important topics, the full implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement and bilateral relations, and both sides were optimistic
about the two issues.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Christopher told reporters his
basic task in the tour of the former Yugoslavia was to secure a
further implementation of the Dayton accords. He
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he was leaving Yugoslavia with the belief that
the implementation of the peace agreement would continue and that
he hoped that the gradual promotion of bilateral relations would
continue.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived at Belgrade earlier today to pay a one-day
visit to Yugoslavia, the last leg of his current tour to the
Balkan region. He has visited Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to
discuss the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been seeking to be reintegrated into
international community after nearly four-year isolation and the
improvement of relations with the United States would help to this
end.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted a government statement as saying that
Yugoslavia expects the United States to show understanding for and
give support to the reactivation of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia within international organizations and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Secretary of State Christopher should give an
impetus to the future development of bilateral relations and to a
better mutual understanding between Yugoslavia and the U.S. and
should encourage the forces of peace and equality in the world,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher left Belgrade this afternoon for Israel to begin
his Middle East tour.
