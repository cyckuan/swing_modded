<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls on Israel to Join NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Council adopted at
an emergency meeting here today a resolution calling on Israel to
join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid and permanent
delegates to the 22-member league met today to discuss possible
radiation leakage from Israel's Dimona nuclear plant in the
southern Negev desert.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the request of the Palestinian Authority
to try to forge a joint Arab stand on the dangers posed by the
possible radiation leakage, called for the liquidation of the
Israeli nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has so far refused to join the NPT and open
its nuclear facilities to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
The country is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons,
though it has never admitted this.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted at today's meeting also called on the
international community and the five permanent member states of
the U.N. Security Council -- China, the United States, Russia,
Britain and France -- to turn their attention to dangers posed by
the Israeli nuclear armament.
</P>
<P>
It urged the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
other international organizations concerned to make an immediate
inspection of the Dimona nuclear facility regarding its radiation
levels and the effects which the possible radiation leakage might
have on environment and underground water in the region.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting, the Arab League Council expressed its full
support of the efforts aimed at freeing the Middle East from all
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority have voiced
concern over the possible leakage reported by Israeli television
last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, denied any leak from Dimona, some 60
kilometers from the Egyptian border.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Legislator Meets Cuban Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said here
today that the friendly and cooperative relations between China
and Cuba have entered a new stage of stable development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who arrived here Monday on a four-day official visit to
Cuba, made the remark during his meeting with Ricardo Alarcon de
Quesada, president of the National Assembly of People's Power
(NAPP) of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon, for his part, welcomed Qiao, saying his visit is an
indication of the deep friendship between the two countries, the
two peoples and the ruling parties of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the strengthened friendly cooperation between the
Chinese NPC and Cuba's NAPP has not only promoted mutual
understanding and friendship, but also enhanced their exchange of
experience.
</P>
<P>
He said the frequent exchange of visits by leaders of both
countries in recent years has stepped up the development of
bilateral friendly and cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon reiterated Havana's positions on Taiwan, human rights,
Tibet and the resumption of China's status as an original
signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba has been all along supportive of China's sacred
cause of peacefully reuniting the country and opposes any kind of
remarks or actions that might lead to the division of China.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said that to support China on international issues is a
basic point in Cuba's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and Alarcon thanked each other for the two countries'
mutual support on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that Cuba's socialist construction experienced a
period of complex process, but under the leadership of Fidel
Castro, president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, Cuba has been
bravely fighting the difficulties and various forces of sabotage
and won.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the Chinese people very much value their
friendly ties with Cuba, the first Latin American nation to
establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said to further strengthen cooperation between China and
Cuba is of great significance in the present world, which is
undergoing dramatic changes. He noted the mutual cooperation and
support that have foiled attacks by some Western countries against
China on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Qiao presented a wreath at the Monument of Jose
Martin, Cuba's national hero, poet and writer.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting between Qiao and Alarcon, China's NPC
presented a batch of office necessities, including computers,
television sets and audio-video equipment, to Cuba's NAPP. Qiao
was on hand at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Qiao meets later today with Castro, who will hold a welcoming
banquet in honor of Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the fourth leg of Qiao's current tour, which has
already taken him to Ukraine, Russia and Greece. After Cuba, Qiao
will go on to Canada on a 10-day official visit.

<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Defense Headquarters
today reiterated the neutrality of the West African Peacekeeping
Force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, particularly in the wake of
the renewed fighting in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Fred Chijuka, Director of Defense Information, said
here that ECOMOG had continued to maintain its neutrality so that
the force could "continue to enjoy the confidence of all
Liberians."

While describing the fighting in Monrovia as "unfortunate",
the defense spokesman urged Liberian faction leaders to "come
together" and facilitate the realization of peace in the war-torn
country.

ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops are
continuing the search-and-destroy operation against a group of
Kurdish rebels encircled in southeastern Turkey, Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Lashes Out at Turkish-Israeli Military Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul today lashed out at a military cooperation agreement
signed between Turkey and Israel in February, describing it as a
"flagrant threat" for the current peace negotiations in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in his office, the defense minister also
termed the Turkish-Israeli agreement "an offense against the
security of the Arab nation, and a threat to the Syrian strategic
and political security in the present stage."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is a new and dishonored attempt to exert
pressure upon Syria," he said, "and it could not be explained but
within the framework of a schemed campaign headed by Israel and
sponsored by some active international parties."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the campaign was "aimed, at first, at
bringing pressure to bear on the Syrian negotiator, and,
secondly, at disrupting Syria's ability of defense."
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the name, the Lebanese defense minister
accused Turkey of "distracting Syria from the central issues,
through raising the problem of water at one time, and the
problem of some minorities at another."
</P>
<P>
Calling the military cooperation between Turkey and Israel a
"sinister pact", he said that it was part of a scheme for forming
an alliance against the legitimate Arab interests, and the Arab
efforts toward a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
But, he underlined that this attempt would only make Syria
and Lebanon "more persistent" in their national position to resist
against the Israeli occupation and to achieve a comprehensive and
just peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Opens Living Memorial To Slain SACP Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today opened the Chris Hani Water Supply Scheme, a
"living memorial" to the slain South African Communist Party
(SACP) leader at Hani's childhood village in Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
Hani was assassinated on April 10, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mandela said Hani's sudden
loss to the community and nation could never be made good. His
death was a national tragedy "because the entire nation lost a
leader, a friend, and a fighter".
</P>
<P>
"It is deeply moving to be gathered here to launch this
project, on what could otherwise be a forgotten hillside. It was
from the dust of this neglected village that a giant of our
nation, Comrade Chris Hani, rose," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to Hani, Mandela said seeing the plight of the
area was "enough to make one understand the sacrifices that
Chris made in order to help destroy a system that was doing such
harm to his people".
</P>
<P>
After returning to his rural home in Lower Sabalele after 30
years in exile, Hani himself noted that little had changed and
that women were still walking five kilometres to fetch water.
</P>
<P>
The Chris Hani Water Supply Scheme formed part of the larger
Cofimvaba Rural Water Supply Scheme funded by the Department of
Water Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims to Smash Turkish Espionage Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today it
has smashed a Turkish espionage ring mostly made up of Turkish
diplomats in the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
But the announcement, made by intelligence director general of
East Azarbaijan province, did not give the total number of the
arrested.
</P>
<P>
In the announcement, the intelligence director general accused
four Turkish diplomats of having links with the espionage ring and
conducting spying activities, and the four accused are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Ardal Kuzoghlu, Turkish political attache at the consulate in
Orumiyeh; Khalil Olomoz, political attache at the Turkish Embassy
in Tehran; Ali Hussein Hakan Kadakal, political attache at the
Orumiyeh Consulate; and Qadri Jan, political attache at the
consulate in Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence director general, who was not identified by
name, said further information on the espionage ring will be
put forward to the media and the public in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence officer was quoted as saying that confessions
of those arrested and the documents discovered from
the spy den indicate that the spies garnered information and
put it at the disposal of the Turkish Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the ring conspired against the Islamic
Republic of Iran and intended to interfere with Iran's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
They were trying to form clandestine groups in an effort
to carry out unlawful operations and acts of sabotage against
the sovereignty of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the confessions of the members of
the espionage ring indicate that a number of Turkish
intelligence officers, who were planted under the guise of
diplomats at the Turkish embassy in Tehran and its consulates
in Tabriz and Orumiyeh, spearheaded these covert activities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest move taken by the Iranian
government would further deteriorate the already-sour relations
between Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold
after the publications of news reports that Turkey and Israel
signed a military agreement under which the Israeli air force is
permitted to train in the Turkish sky.
</P>
<P>
Iran has warned against the Turkish government that it
would pose threat to the national security of the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said that the
presence of foreign forces in the region is not acceptable
to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If the news is correct, it is going to hurt the feeling of the
Islamic nation," Habibi said in a meeting with visiting Turkish
Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Toygun.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Toygun said that Ankara attached great importance
to its friendly relations with other countries. It would not
allow any country to disrupt its friendly relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian report, the Turkish official denied
that his country did not allow Israel to use its airspace and
base.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Iranian official news agency IRNA as
saying that his country did not intend to create tension in
the region, especially with Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati Monday night, Toygun said that the news about allowing
Israel use Turkish airspace was "blown out of proportion by
the world media."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese family of three
members were released today by militia of Roosvelt Johnson in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia, the Lebanese state-run National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Secretary General of the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry Taher Hassan as saying that he was informed by Lebanese
Charge d'Affaire Mansour Abdullah in Monrovia that until 2:00
p.m. local time (11:00 GMT), one of the six Lebanese families,
which had been seized by Johson's militia, was released.
</P>
<P>
The National News Agency reported that some Lebanese were
allowed Monday to hide in the U.S. embassy in Monrovia as a result
of the contacts conducted by Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Other Lebanese still remain in the Lebanese Embassy in the
Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister announced Monday night that six
Lebanese families comprising 25 persons had been held captive by
Johson's militia in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese private Central News Agency said tonight that
40 Lebanese were seized by a fighting faction in Monrovia,
including some diplomats kidnaped from the Lebanese embassy last
Saturday when the armed clashes in the Liberian capital erupted.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Lebanese were among some 600 civilians held as
hostages, who have been used as "body shields" by the fighting
militia, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes erupted in Monrovia last Saturday, causing
immediate concern of the Lebanese government on the security of
the 1,500 Lebanese in that city.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders and government ministers are holding intensive
consultations and are seeking help from other countries in order
to secure the safety of the Lebanese in Monrovia and to evacuate
them in an emergency case.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nabih Berri announced this afternoon that a ship
was moving toward the Monrovia port and would arrive there at any
moment to take the Lebanese who want to leave that
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The year 1995 witnessed a stable
economic development in Cyprus with growth rate estimated at five
percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cautious Calm Returns to South Lebanon Following Morning's Escalation (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Following an escalation of tension
in south Lebanon this morning as a result of retaliatory Hezbollah
attacks in northern Israel, a cautious calm returned to the area
later this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah (Party of God), announced in a statement that around
7:11 a.m. (04:11 GMT) this morning it fired "a number of Katyusha
rockets in three batches" at the Jewish settlements of Kiryat
Shmona and Naharia in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
It said that the attack came as "a revenge for the Israeli
massacre in which the blast of four mines at Barashit village led
to the killing of a child, and the wounding of several others."
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported earlier that Mazel Imad Farhat, 16,
was killed by a blast of a mine planted on a branch road leading
to the southern Lebanese village of Barashit opposite to an
Israeli-occupied buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The blast also wounded the victim's brother, Ibrahim, 8, and
Mohammed Hussein Obeid, 6, and Ali Kamal Shehab, 25, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating retaliatory attacks for the mine blast, the
Israeli army ordered Monday night local residents in northern
Israel to resort to shields and put the Israeli occupation forces
and their surrogate militia, the South Lebanese Army, in the
buffer enclave in south Lebanon at alert.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed that the Galilee panhandle in northern
Israel was hit this morning by Katyusha rockets and 13 Jewish
settlers were wounded, including a woman who was in a dangerous
situation.
</P>
<P>
It added that following the attack, explosive experts in the
Israeli army searched the area in order to check out the number of
the Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Islamic Resistance also carried out this
morning an attack on the Israeli position of Al-Ibad in the
occupied border strip "with suitable weapons," the armed wing of
the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah announced in another
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "Amal" movement, a pro-Syrian Shiite group
which is also engaged in a guerrilla war against the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon, announced that a group of its
fighters launched a "surprising attack" on the Israeli position
at Hamid.
</P>
<P>
"The fighters used machineguns and anti-tank rockets in the
attack, destroying the front defender of the position and killing
a member of the Israeli client militia," the Amal said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the attack was mounted also in a revenge for the
massacre at Barashit Monday night.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to retaliate for the morning's Katyusha
attack, six Israeli warplanes carried out at 8:15 a.m. (05:15 GMT)
air raids at the vicinities of the southern Lebanese villages of
Majdal Salem, As-Sawana, Al-Ghanduria and Kharbat Salem in the
western sector of south lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army sources in the area reported that the Israeli
warplanes fired eight air-to-surface rockets, without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces in the so-called "security zone"
also bombarded a number of suspected guerrilla targets, causing a
serious material loss to the village of As-Saltania.
</P>
<P>
Before the bombardments, several Israeli helicopters flew
intensively at low altitude over the western and middle sectors of
the south.
</P>
<P>
At 3:15 p.m. (12:15 GMT), the Israeli helicopters flew back to
the areas to carry out reconnaissance missions, but there were no
more reports on air raids, bombardments or exchanges of fire in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the killing of civilians at Barashit, Hezbollah's
Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah saw that the event was a
"clear breach" of what was called the "July understanding," a
U.S.-mediated tacit agreement which put an end to an Israeli
blitz against Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel promised to refrain from attacking
civilian targets in south Lebanon, in exchange for Hezbollah's
guarantee for the security of the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah stressed today that the repeated killing of children
and civilians "is an untolerable thing."

<HEADLINE> Swaziland To Assist Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of Swaziland
has launched a multi-million dollar loan scheme to assist the
small and medium business, said the South African Press
Association today.
</P>
<P>
The 44 million Rand (about 11.5 million U.S. Dollars) loan
scheme was introduced by Swazi King Mswati III.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Finance was quoted as saying in
Mbabane, capital of Swaziland, that the loan scheme would be
operated through the intermediate institutions such as banks.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme is intended to enable Swazis who are unable
to provide the loan security usually required by commercial banks
to obtain loans to start their own business projects.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> US Considers Evacuating Nationals From Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is considering
evacuating its nationals from Monrovia, capital of the war-torn
West African state of Liberia, as widespread factional fighting
continued for a consecutive third day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Liberian civilians have sought refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Monrovia, according to a report today from the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
And a U.S. military team has been ready to fly to Liberia to
evacuate 450 U.S. nationals amid what Washington called
"unconscionable" violence in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael Mccurry said no decision had yet
been taken on a possible evacuation of the U.S. citizens, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes resumed on Monday morning after a brief period of calm
the previous night.
</P>
<P>
There was fierce fighting around the barracks of the Barclay
Training Center which house many soldiers of Liberia's former
regular army and now one of the warring factions, the Armed
Forces of Liberia (AFL).
</P>
<P>
However, fighting in Monrovia seemed to have died down late on
Monday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Another report reaching here Monday said the fighting between
them and a rebel faction had apparently halted after the
intervention by the Chairman of the West African regional bloc of
ECOWAS, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, among others.
</P>
<P>
The AFL, largely made up of members of the Krahn ethnic group,
appeared to have sided with troops loyal to Roosevelt Johnson,
the former leader of the Krahn wing of another faction, the
United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J).
</P>
<P>
Reports say gunmen loyal to Johnson had kidnaped six Lebanese
families in Monrovia, and the Lebanese Embassy in the Liberian
capital had also been attacked three times.
</P>
<P>
But the assailants had failed to break in, the report quoted
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz as saying in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
An attempt made early on Saturday by the allied armed forces
of the interim government to arrest Johnson on a murder charge
led to a confrontation with his armed loyalists, who later moved
to the Barclay Barracks.
</P>
<P>
The barracks were reported to be surrounded by troops loyal to
Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, two biggest warlords who sit
shoulder to shoulder on the interim cabinet, the six-men Council
of State which was set up last September.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the two strong men wanted to remove
Johnson, widely considered as an ambitious renegate, permanently
from Liberia's political arena.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, 1995, Liberia's warring factions signed a peace
accord in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, marking a renewed hope to
end the six-year civil war in the West African state.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process was again put in a fragile state
following fresh fightings among the warring factions, said
diplomats in the country.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Business in Cuba Booming Despite US  Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian business in Cuba continues
to boom despite the recent U.S. legislation that seeks to punish
foreign firms from investing in the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Canadian firms are rooted in Cuba, mostly joint
ventures with Cuban government agencies, making Canada one of
Cuba's largest investors, today's Canadian newspaper The Gazette
reported.
</P>
<P>
Around the Cuban capital of Havana and other towns, signs for
Pizza Nova, Labatt's Ice beer, ExportCanada, Delta Hotels and a
dozen mining companies are becoming quite common, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There's money to be made in Cuba," said Cy Makjin of CIMC, a
Toronto-based firm providing management services to Caribbean
Diesel in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Rather than being frightened off by the recent Helms-Burton
legislation that exposes Canadian firms who deal in confiscated
Cuban properties to lawsuits in the U.S., Makjin said he is
looking for more opportunities in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canada became Cuba's top trading partner with close
to 450 million U.S. dollars in two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. legislation does not seem to have dampened
Canadian enthusiasm for Cuba among established firms, it has
caused some anxiety and possibly deterred others from making the
jump to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
According to a Canadian official, the potential for an
"investment chill" remains real, especially until the U.S. spells
out how it intends to enforce the legislation and which firms will
be affected.
</P>
<P>
Paul Zyla, chairman of the Caribgold Resources, said most
Canadian mining firms are involved in exploration of properties
that were considered state-owned even before the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at Helms-Burton, but I don't think we're
affected," he said, adding that applies to most of the Canadian
firms.
</P>
<P>
Tom Smeenk of MacDonalds Mines said that his firm is so bullish
on Cuba that it is expanding its gold exploration activities to
look for oil on a 9,900-square-kilometer concession in central
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He actually sees some advantages for Canadians because of U.S.
animosity to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. absence has created an investment vacuum in Cuba, and
"that means we can be a big player there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Whales Die in Collision With Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Some of the world's rarest whales
are running a collision course with large ships off the east
coasts of Canada and the United States, resulting in the death of
at least three adult northern right whales over the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
All three whales, weighing as much as 15 tons each and 15
meters in length, one in the Bay of Fundy, one off Georgia and the
other off Cape Cod, appeared to have suffered fractures and
internal injuries after being hit by ships, according to today's
Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
While many whale deaths are never recorded because the bodies
are never found, studies indicate that as many as 15 of the 30
right-whale deaths believed to have occurred since 1987 were
caused by human activity.
</P>
<P>
The recent deaths are particularly troubling to researchers who
study the huge whales because there are only about 350 northern
right whales in existence from Greenland to Florida, and there are
concerns that increased shipping, fishing and even whale-watching
could drive them to extinction.
</P>
<P>
Whale researchers in Canada and the United States want their
governments to protect the whales by restricting the activity of
ships and fishing boats where whales congregate, and by
encouraging vessels to carry warning devices that would scare
whales away from a potentially deadly encounter.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Envisions New Approach to Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Environment Minister
Sergio Marchi said he wants to try a new approach to curb
pollution by asking industries to strike formal agreements or
covenants with the communities they affect.
</P>
<P>
The method would be based on negotiations involving communities
rather than on regulations enforced through the courts. Under this
system, an industry would commit itself to reducing pollution by a
certain amount over a set number of years.
</P>
<P>
The industry would be held accountable for its performance at
the end of that period. "If promises had not been kept, government
would have an ironclad case to intervene," Marchi was quoted as
saying by today's Canadian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that he did not intend to drop regulations
altogether. Revising the Canadian Environmental Protection Act
remained one of his priorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Marchi took over the environment portfolio in January. Asked
about his priorities in coming years, Marchi said it was essential
to rebuild support for the environment in government, the media
and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The federal government had no intention of abandoning
environmental protection to the provinces under the guise of
harmonization, Marchi added.

<HEADLINE> US Has Keen Interest in Afghanistan: Senator Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has keen
interest in Afghanistan, said Senator Hank Brown, who just
returned from a 36-hour trip to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, he described his visit to
Afghanistan as a "wonderful opportunity," to meet leaders of
various factions to try to assess their points of view.
</P>
<P>
He said almost all Afghan leaders he met had called for an end
to outside interference in the internal affairs of their country.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the things we talk about with the administration
as to what kind of initiative the United States could take."
</P>
<P>
However, he maintained that the United States should not in any
way advise Afghans as to what to do.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution to the conflict should be of Afghani origin and
not American origin," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has keen interest to end the tragedy in
Afghanistan and will make substantial humanitarian contribution to
the country through the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Afghanistan, the senator from Colorado had
separate meeting with Kabul regime's strong military commander
Ahmed Shah Masood, Foreign Minister Najibullah Lafraie,
Hezb-i-Islami Chief Gulbudddin Hekmatyar, Governor of Nangarhar
province Haji Abdul Qadeer and chief of pro-Rabbani
Ittehad-i-Islami Abdur Rasool Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Brown's trip comes ahead of a planned visit to Afghanistan
later this month by US Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asian Affairs Robin Raphel.

LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) veterinary
committee is to hold a special meeting in Brussels Wednesday to
discuss a possible partial lifting of the worldwide ban on British
beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The BBC television quoted EU agriculture spokesman Gerry Kiely
as saying today that the EU veterinary experts would consider
lifting the ban on some individual British beef products.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the product most likely to be affected
was gelatin, a glutinous material obtained from animal tissues by
boiling.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the EU Commission would consider a total
lifting of the ban early next month in the light of action taken
by the British government to wipe out the BSE or mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> International Conference Discusses Impact of Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Presidents of Ukraine and
Belarus today appealed to the international community to help
their countries recover from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
They said cash and aid were urgently needed to ease the
suffering of thousands of people in the Ukraine, Belarus and
Russia still affected by the world's worst nuclear disaster 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents were addressing a four-day international
conference commemorating the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in
Ukraine. The meeting, which opened here today, will discuss the
impact of the radioactive fallout from the station and other
issues, including safety improvements at the 15 Chernobyl-type
reactors still in operation.
</P>
<P>
About 700 representatives attended the conference, co-sponsored
by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the European Union
Commission and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent a message to
the conference, in which he said "the consequences of the
Chernobyl accident cannot be regarded as the problem of a few
countries."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, experts at another meeting on the Chernobyl
accident called for extensive measures to assure the safety of
Chernobyl, which is still in operation, and the safety of the
concrete sarcophagus around the destroyed reactor.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded on April 26, 1986, and
caused serious radioactive fallout, forcing thousands of people
out of their homes and contaminating thousands of square
kilometers of land.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Continue Importing Semen From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean veterinary
official said today the country will continue to import cattle
semen and embryos from Britain despite an outbreak of the fatal
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Director in the Department of Veterinary
Services, Welboourne Madzima, said measures would be effected to
prevent the disease from spreading to Zimbabwe, a major beef
consumer.
</P>
<P>
"We import semen and embryos because we consider these to be
safe," said Madzima, adding his department had been aware of the
outbreak of the mad cow disease in Britain since 1988.
</P>
<P>
His comments follow sentiments by some of the country's 400
commercial farmers that Zimbabwe should immediately ban the
importing of any cattle products from the U.K. until the mad cow
disease is under control.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be a game of retaliation here. We have been
doing and still do all necessary checks to ensure we don't import
mad cows," He said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a net exporter of beef to the European Union, but
importer of cattle semen and embryos from Britain and other European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Child Agency Blamed for Failure to Protect Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- New York City's Administration
for Children's Services has been criticized for its inattention
and ineptitude that led to the beating death of a six-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today frontpaged a report which finds
failures in the city's child protection agency and calls for its
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
The report said that six-year-old girl Elisa Izquierdo had been
sexually abused by her father and was beaten to death by her
mother in Manhattan last year.
</P>
<P>
This case was far from unique. According to a report released
by the New York State Monday, there were hundreds of cases of
other abused children.
</P>
<P>
However, the child protection agency failed to perform even the
rudimentary responsibilities, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
In one out of five cases reviewed by state auditors, the report
said, caseworkers failed to conduct face-to-face interviews with
all the children in a home. In two out of five cases, the
caseworkers failed to check past child abuse reports. And in 10
percent of the cases, the agency did not begin to investigate an
initial report within the 24-hour period required by its rules.
</P>
<P>
City officials, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Monday
acknowledged the severity of the problems outlined in the state
and city reports and pledged to take effective steps to improve
the child protection system.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Spending To Remain Low In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Continued instability of commodity
prices in Zimbabwe will impede economic growth as spending power
will be greatly reduced, with consumers completely shunning
certain goods, the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe said today.
</P>
<P>
Muchaneta Nyambuya, managing director of the council, said the
economy should be opened further to allow more entrants in an
effort to increase competition which he said would improve the
quality of goods and result in reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
He said since western-backed economic reforms were introduced
in 1990, prices had been escalating, adding consumers would have
appreciated a decrease in some prices so that on average the
prices would be constant.
</P>
<P>
The consumer watchdog estimated that the majority of
Zimbabwe's 10.5 million people live below the "comfortable line",
barely able to afford a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
He said consumers were also affected by the high rate of
inflation that was fueled by the government's excessive borrowing
on the domestic market and high recurrent expenditure.

<HEADLINE> EDS-updated hke -- New Japan-U.S. Servicing Pact to Cover Weapon Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A new security accord allowing
Japan to provide U.S. forces with weapon parts, currently banned
under Japan's three "no weapons exports" principles, is to be
signed with the U.S. next week, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will greatly enhance Japanese-U.S. security
ties in terms of both quality and quantity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Japan would be able to offer goods and
services to U.S. forces over and above the present bounds of the
Japan-U.S. security framework, which limits Japan to granting
U.S. forces the use of facilities and land in the country, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The draft bilateral Acquisition and Cross-Serving Agreement
(ACSA), a copy of which was obtained by the paper, said the two
nations would exchange services and goods on three
occasions: joint exercises and training, U.N. peacekeeping
operations and humanitarian international relief activities.
</P>
<P>
The draft covers 15 items that Japan would offer the
U.S. military such as food, water, fuel, clothing, spare parts and
components, transportation, repair and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates that goods and services offered under
the bilateral accord will not be transferred to a third party
other than the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Government sources were quoted as saying that the Japanese
government is going to handle the concept as "an exception" to
the "no weapons export" principles, as it did in 1983 when it
provided weapons technology to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The pact is expected to be formally signed when Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet in
Tokyo on April 17.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether such a cross-service agreement
would be applied in emergencies, the paper said, noting that the
draft did not say whether the pact's application is limited to
peacetime.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of an ACSA accord has been one of the key
pending issues between the two countries regarding security
cooperation since Washington requested it in 1983.

HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Aids organizations in Zimbabwe
today praised Vice-President Joshua Nkomo for breaking a trend in
Zimbabwe by publicly announcing that his second son, Ernest
Thuthani (41), died of the incurable disease.
</P>
<P>
The organizations expressed hope that Nkomo's revelation would
de-etigmatize the disease and help people to accept it as any
other disease which they could discuss openly.
</P>
<P>
At the burial of his son on Saturday, Nkomo surprised hundreds
of mourners when he told them his son was among thousands of
young Zimbabweans who were being wiped out by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Aids Networ (ZAN) is planning to meet President
Robert Mugabe soon to discuss the possibility of declaring aids a
national disaster to give the nation the impetus to provide more
resources to combat its spread.
</P>
<P>
ZAN Chairman Masimira said, "aids is becoming the single most
hindrance to economic development and yet official statistics do
not portray its seriousness."
</P>
<P>
Health experts estimate that one in every 10 Zimbabweans have
been infected by the HIV virus and that more than 150,000 people
had developed full blown Aids since testing began in 1987. These
people were now dying at the rate of about 300 a week.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Earn Over 440 Million US Dollars from Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers are expected to
earn nearly 4 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (444 million US Dollars),
Zimbabwe Tobacco Association said today.
</P>
<P>
Public relations director of the association Lal Taylor said
that all is set for the opening of this year's flue-cured tobacco
auctions on April 23 in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said curing of this year's crop had been completed while
grading was in progress.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting a slight reduction in the crop size from the
original 210 million kg to about 200 million kg. But still, we
have a good quality drop," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said growers expected prices to either equate those paid
during the 1995 auction season, or increase on the back of firm
demand from world merchants.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the Zimbabwean crops was expected to rise following
reports that output in Brazil which is a major producer in the
world had this year declined by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the decision by the United States government to
increase Zimbabwe's tobacco export quota by 20 percent to about
12 million kg per year had cheered many growers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the world's top three flue-cured tobacco
producers after Brazil and the United States and, last year, just
over 198 million kg were sold earning farmers in excess of 389
million US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Blue Team Wins Second CBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Though Hu Weidong, MVP player of
the CBA League this season, scored a game-high 35 points, his Blue
Team still lost to the White Team 98-106 Tuesday night at the CBA
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
The Blue, with 2.13-meter Wang Zhizhi playing at the basket,
built a 42-41 halftime lead before the more 3,000 spectatores at
the University Gymnasium of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
White, headed by head coach of the league's champion August
First Wang Fei who also led the Red Team to win the first CBA
All-Star game last April, jumped to a 39-30 lead with five minutes
left in the first half before Gong Xiaobin of Shandong keyed the
Blue a 10-0 run.
</P>
<P>
Both sides played a seesaw second half with five times lead
exchanging.
</P>
<P>
The White extended its advantage to 79-72 at the ninth minute
in the second half, but the Blue came back again as Gong, who led
his Shandong team to win fifth place this season, scored six
consecutive points and Liu Tie hit a three-pointer to help the
Blue go ahead 84-83.
</P>
<P>
The White managed to equal the score at 86-86 before Wang
Zhizhi's dunk with the seven minutes to play. Then the Blue
controled the game down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
The twenty All-Star players, who took part in the 1995-1996 CBA
league which ended on Sunday, were voted by fans earlier this

<HEADLINE> Industrial Conflict in West at 50-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Industrial conflict in the western
industrialized world has fallen to its lowest level for more than
50 years, according to the latest statistics issued by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
published by Britain's Department of Education and Employment.
</P>
<P>
In the five years between 1990 and 1994, only an annual average
of 100 working days were lost to labor disputes per thousand
employees in those countries, compared with 145 working days for
the five years before, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest fall in industrial conflict since 1990 was in
Denmark (an 85 percent decline compared with the 1985-1990
period), followed by New Zealand and the UK (79 percent).
</P>
<P>
Greece was the most strike-prone country in the OECD, with an
annual average of 3,729 working days lost per thousand employees
between 1985 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by Spain, which averaged an annual 565 working
days lost per thousand, and Canada, 326 days.
</P>
<P>
The most industrially peaceful country since 1985 has been
Switzerland, which recorded an annual average of only one working
day lost per thousand employees, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Japan came second, claiming to have an annual average of mere
four working days lost per thousand employees, followed by Austria
with five and Germany and the Netherlands with 12, the study
shows.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan, Pakistan to Enhance Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Azerbaijan President
Haider Aliyev and his Pakistani counterpart Farooq Leghari today
expressed their keen desire to enhance economic cooperation
between the two countries, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
The old, historical and cultural relationship between the two
countries can be further expanded and strengthened by enhancing
economic and trade cooperation, said Farooq Leghari at the
Presidential Palace when meeting Aliyev, who arrived in Islamabad
earlier today for a three-day state visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that Pakistan is busy in developing the Gawadar
Port which would provide the shortest and easiest route to
Azerbaijan and other Central Asian states to reach the warm
waters.
</P>
<P>
The area was endowed with vast and rich resources and the
planned gas and oil pipelines would benefit all countries of the
region including India, Iran and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the foreign and Pakistani private sectors to play a
major role in our economic progress and prosperity and are looking
forward to increasing cooperation in trade and joint-ventures
between the two countries," the Pakistani president said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari emphasized the need to focus more on peace, stability
and development in the region and for the economic and social
progress of the peoples.
</P>
<P>
Haider Aliyev express his hope that his visit to Pakistan
would help strengthen the bilateral relationship and enhance
economic cooperation between Azerbaijan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Both Azerbaijan and Pakistan are members of the Economic
Cooperation Organization, which was founded in 1985 aimed at
promoting economic and commercial relations among ten-member
countries -- Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan,
Kazakistan, Kirghistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Pakistan President Farooq Leghari visited
Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> New Japan-U.S. Servicing Pact to Cover Weapon Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A new security accord allowing
Japan to provide U.S. forces with weapon parts, currently banned
under Japan's three "no weapons exports" principles, is to be
signed with the U.S. next week, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will greatly enhance Japanese-U.S. security
ties in terms of both quality and quantity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Japan would be able to offer goods and
services to U.S. forces over and above the present bounds of the
Japan-U.S. security framework, which limits Japan to granting
U.S. forces the use of facilities and land in the country, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The draft bilateral Acquisition and Cross-Serving Agreement
(ACSA), a copy of which was obtained by the paper, said the two
nations would exchange services and goods on three
occasions: joint exercises and training, U.N. peacekeeping
operations and humanitarian international relief activities.
</P>
<P>
Government sources were quoted as saying that the Japanese
government is going to handle the concept as "an exception" to
the "no weapons export" principles, as it did in 1983 when it
provided weapons technology to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The pact is expected to be formally signed when Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet in
Tokyo on April 17.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether such a cross-service agreement
would be applied in emergencies, the paper said, noting that the
draft did not say whether the pact's application is limited to
peacetime.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of an ACSA accord has been one of the key
pending issues between the two countries regarding security
cooperation since Washington requested it in 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official: New Fighting in Liberia May Affect  Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in the west African state
of Liberia could hit the United Nations' repatriation plan for some
730,000 Liberian refugees, the United Nations High Commissioner For
Refugees (UNHCR) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"UNHCR is extremely concerned about the new breakout of
fighting in Liberia, specifically in and around Monrovia," UNHCR
spokesman Ron Redmond told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We fear this could pose a major setback to UNHCR's plans for
the repatriation over the next 18 months of some 730,000 Liberian
refugees, who are in neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in the capital Monrovia on April 6 after
government forces tried to arrest former government minister,
Roosevelt Johnson, leader of the ULIMO-J faction.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fighting could shatter the already fragile confidence
of refugees about the security situation in the country, where a
peace accord was signed last August, ending a six-year civil war
in which some 150,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the peace accord, some 30,000
refugees returned spontaneously, but mainly to border areas
near Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, where the situation was safer than
inland.
</P>
<P>
There are about 410,000 Liberian refugees in Guinea, 305,800 in
Cote d'Ivoire, 15,000 in Ghana, 4,700 in Sierra Leone and 4,000 in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said UNHCR favors a quick start to the repatriation
plan, but that depends on the deployment of West African
peacekeepers, progress in disarmament and demobilization of
troops, and the extension of areas under the control of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, UNHCR worries that the renewed fighting will
increase difficulties in winning financial support for the
18-month repatriation program. Some 60 million U.S. dollars are
needed to implement the program but UNHCR has only 5.1 million
dollars in hand.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that UNHCR is also concerned about some
120,000 Sierra Leonean refugees, most of whom are in camps in the
Liberian capital Monrovia, although no major security problems
have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
He added that UNHCR is also providing assistance to some of the
estimated 800,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in and
around Monrovia, where the prewar population was only about
500,000. The total number of IDPs is now about 1.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Peres Optimistic About Peace Process with Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres has shown that he is optimistic about peace process with the
Arabs while confident of success in the country's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
"I am the best-positioned person in this country to serve the
young generation, because what I am carrying is a message, not an
ambition," said Peres in an interview with The Jerusalem Post,
which was published today.
</P>
<P>
"This is my deep conviction. I think there is a great
opportunity to save the country from unnecessary wars. This is
what i am doing. The rest is secondary," he added.
</P>
<P>
In what regarded as a pre-election statement, Peres shrugged
off the policy of Likud, the largest opposition party, saying
that Likud, with its partners, "will have to renew the settlement
policy in the West Bank. This in my judgement will mean the end of
peace and the end of a hope for peace."
</P>
<P>
"I have said it many times; I am saying it again. From eggs,
you can made omelets, but from omelets, you cannot make eggs. They
are going to 'omelet' the whole West Bank beyond repair. And then
we shall become a binational state," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Peres said: "The likud sees in the autonomy a permanent
solution, and we see in the autonomy a step towards a permanent
solution."
</P>
<P>
Turning to his long-held vision of the future, Peres said: "We
are in a new age, Nobody can turn his back on history." "We are
in a transitional period. The old Middle East has not yet
disappeared completely and the new Middle East has not fully
arrived. We are in the middle of it, so we still suffer from the
past, and we still cannot see the fruits of the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the idea to separate Jews and Palestinians, Peres said: "I
distinguish between an economic (and political) separation, which
I was always against and I am still against. But otherwise if the
alternative is a binational state, I will support each nation
having its own entity. Clearly that is the meaning of
separation."
</P>
<P>
Touching on his position on Jewish settlement in a
final-status agreement, Peres said: "I don't think we have to
dismantle settlements. I don't think we have to add
settlements. This is my position. No adding and no dismantling."
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his vision of the future of Palestine, Peres
indicated he preferred a confederation between Palestine and
Jordan, saying that this will enable Israel "to secure the
demilitarization of all the territories (from which Israel
withdraws) in the future. There would be one army -- the
Jordanian and Palestinian army. It also means preventing a
conflict between the Jordanians and the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Dealing with negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, another
thorny issue in the peace process, Peres said that he will
continue to negotiate with Damascus, although talks have
essentially stopped for now.
</P>
<P>
He revealed: "I sent a message with the Americans to (Syrian
President Hafez) Assad. Assad says he wants peace in '96. I said
if we want a deal in '96, we have to fly high and fast, not low
and slow. This means that we have to negotiate differently. We
have to raise the level of negotiations to the top leadership of
the countries."
</P>
<P>
"I got a reply (from Assad via the Americans, saying): 'yes, we
can meet but I can't say the date.' ... I want to see what is the
pace of his movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres dismissed a suggestion that Israel should initiate a
unilateral withdrawal from the "security zone" in south
Lebanon. "It is impossible," he stressed. "It will worsen the
situation. In Lebanon, you have two forces, one force holds the
microphone -- that's the government; the other force holds the
rifle -- this is the Hezbollah. So what is the sense of making an
agreement with the microphone?"

<HEADLINE> Science Crucial to National Revitalization: Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
today that national revitalization can not dispense with advanced
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark when visiting an exhibition on scientific
development to mark the 10th anniversary of "Project 863", a major
hi-tech research program that was started with the support of Deng
Xiaoping in March 1986.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman visited the exhibition together with
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Both are members of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the pursuit of advanced science and technology is
endless in the process of revitalizing China. The current
exhibition not only displays the scientific achievements that have
resulted from Project 863, but have also made people aware of the
far-reaching significance of Deng Xiaoping's instructions on
carrying out Project 863.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China still lags far behind the advanced countries
in the development of science and technology, and greater efforts
are needed for China to keep pace with international advances in
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
On display are 319 research findings, which account for one
fifth of the total achievements made over the past ten years.

<HEADLINE> China to Pay Greater Attention to Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will make greater efforts to
exercise surveillance and management over its two functioning
nuclear power plants this year, said a senior nuclear official.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power
plants have been operating well, Huang Qitao, director of the
National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA), told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Their sound operation has built up China's confidence in
further developing nuclear power, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
From now to the beginning of the next century, the country
plans to build another four nuclear power plants, with a combined
installed capacity of 6.6 million kw, in east China's Zhejiang
Province, south China's Guangdong Province and northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
China has drawn on lessons from the Chernobyl nuclear accident,
which happened in April 1986, he said. "In the process of nuclear
power development, China has always attached prime importance to
nuclear safety."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1984, the NNSA is responsible for review and
approval of the applications for safety licences of civilian
nuclear installations. It is required to hold safety licences for
each of the five major licences of nuclear installations, such as
review report for siting of nuclear installations, construction
permit, first fuel loading authorization, operating license and
decommissioning authorization.
</P>
<P>
Operation licences and other approval from the NNSA are also
required for operators. Besides, the country has sent technicians
to receive training in the United States, France and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The NNSA has also established offices in Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Chengdu, to take charge of the nuclear safety surveillance in east
China, south China and west China, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The director said China has adopted international standards in
enacting the national nuclear safety regulations. In February this
year, the 18th meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress
Standing Committee ratified the international "Convention on
Nuclear Safety", which has been open for all countries to sign
since September 20, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, China has established a three-level (national,
locality and individual nuclear power plant) system to cope with
nuclear emergencies. A committee with representatives from 20
departments to deal with such emergencies has also been set up.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Foreign Investors Favor Chinese Listed Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Late last month six senior managers
of a giant French company were selected to serve on the board of
directors of the Fuyao Glass Industrial Group in southeast China's
Fujian Province, a company listed on the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The managers were from the Saint Gobain Corporation, one of
France's top ten industrial groups and also one of the top 100 in
the world. It has bought 51 percent of one of Fuyao's affiliates,
and will join hands with Fuyao to invest in a new project in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Controlling 40 percent of China's automobile glass market,
Fuyao is the largest automobile glass producer in the country, and
has exported products to a dozen countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors now have stakes in 11 of Fujian's 14 listed
companies through setting up joint ventures, conducting
co-operation and holding stocks. They are involved in sectors such
as retail and those producing cement, automobiles, generators and
excavators.
</P>
<P>
"With a special economic zone in the port city of Xiamen and
two state-level bonded zones in Xiamen and Fuzhou, the provincial
capital, respectively, Fujian has and will retain preferential
economic policies drawn up by the central government," an analyst
said, explaining why foreign entrepreneurs choose Fujian's listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Reforms over the past 17 years have created a booming economy,
a large contingent of open-minded personnel with expertise and a
fine investment environment in Fujian, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The three major reforms in foreign trade policies China has
recently unveiled will help foreign-funded enterprises get
national treatment status, thus encouraging more involvement by
foreign firms in Fujian."
</P>
<P>
As an ancestral home of many overseas Chinese, Fujian has
advantages in overseas economic co-operation, especially with
Taiwan, and the listed companies have been busy upgrading
operation mechanisms and shedding administrative burdens to
promote the potential for growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
The listed companies are attractive to foreign investors
because they have wide markets and advanced management.
</P>
<P>
One of China's top 500 enterprises, the Fujian Cement Co. Ltd
has consolidated the prices of its products as key indicators on
the local cement market, and it has invested a large amount of
capital to modernize technology and expand production.
</P>
<P>
Impressed with the cement producer's high level of technology,
high returns and advanced equipment, Siemens, a German
conglomerate, has plans to buy shares in Fujian Cement.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of foreign firms in listed companies has
spurred their international integration, opened new channels for
foreign investment and turned their shares into favorite choices
for investors.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 foreign firms showed strong interest in China's listed
companies in key industries. The American car maker Ford bought
shares in an automobile manufacturing company in east China's
Jiangxi Province. At the same time, Isuzu, a giant Japanese car
maker, took shares in a van-manufacturing company in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Bulgaria has
trebled to nearly 60 million U.S. dollars in the first three
months of this year over the same period in 1995, a top government
minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic
Development Rumen Gechev also predicted that given a more
favourable environment, foreign investors could pour more than
one billion dollars into the country's privatization projects,
local press said.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the 60 million dollars invested in the first
quarter of this year, went to the food industry, and 20 percent to
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Gechev said foreign investment for the whole of 1996 will top
the 300 million dollars previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the decision by Britain's Rover car company to
pull out of a joint project with Bulgaria, Gechev said he hoped
the company would find a better partner in his country.
</P>
<P>
Rover had complained about an unsatisfactory investment
environment and poor sales.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Bulgaria has attracted some 900 million
dollars from abroad, including 578 million dollars of direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
Germany is still the biggest investor in Bulgaria, taking 36
percent of the country's total foreign investment, followed
by the Netherlands, which invested 30 million dollars in
the first quarter of this year, Sweden and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1996 Budget Encourages Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The business and people orientated
budget of the federal government of Nigeria this year as designed
to create a conducive atmosphere for private investments and for
social development, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Chief Anthony Ani was quoted by today's
News Nigerian newspaper as saying that the government has
realized it was a mistake to invest its meagre resources in
ventures better undertaken by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Nigeria gained eight billion Naira (about 364
million U.S. Dollars at the official transaction rate of 22 Naira
for one Dollar) from oil sales. But all of it was spent on
imports because "we were not producing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the New Nigerian forum that investment focus
of the government should be placed on petrochemical, steel,
fertilizer and all other sectors that would help in the
industrial take-off which Nigeria has not been doing in the past.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the government in the 1996 budget, which
was released on February 15, opted to see that the quality of
life of the average Nigerian is improved by investing more in
agriculture, roads, railways, water supply, education and health.
</P>
<P>
On exchange rate, the minister said policy direction was
toward bringing down the autonomous market exchange rate from the
current 85 Naira for one Dollar to a level that they could merge
with the official transactions rate of 22 Naira for one Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Indian Plants Ordered to Pay for Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, April 9 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court today
served an ultimatum on over 137,000 local polluting plants in
Delhi, urging them either to pay their share for pollution
treatment or face immediate closure.
</P>
<P>
According to the Supreme Court order, the industrial units,
located in 28 industrial areas in the capital, must pay 20 percent
or 40 crore rupees (about 11.4 million US dollars) of the total
200 crore rupees (about 57 million dollars) needed for
establishing effluent treatment plants in the industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
The court did not give a specific deadline for the factories to
pay their share but said it would resume hearing on the issue on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
The court also said that all these industries already operating
in the newly created industrial zones in the capital should be
directed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee to set up
primary pollution control devices. If they failed, they would be
closed, the court noted.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official on HK's Development Opportunity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's prosperity is mainly
the result of the endeavors of the Hong Kong people, in which the
Chinese constitute a dominant majority, senior Chinese official
Zhou Nan said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a gathering of Hong Kong Federation of
Industries, Zhou, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
said that Hong Kong's industrial sector has played an important
role in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He urged the sector to seize opportunities and create new
miracles at the time when Hong Kong is facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the process of Hong Kong's economic development, he
said that in the early 1950s, confronted with the disastrous blow
to entrepot trade caused by the Western embargo on China, Hong
Kong entrepreneurs with the Chinese as their main body wisely
judged the situation and took "processing trade" as the path of
industrial development and within about 20 years managed to
transform the manufacturing industry into the biggest industrial
sector, which then represented one third of the total GDP and half
of the whole employed population of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, Hong Kong became the world's biggest exporter of
more than ten categories of goods including garments, toys,
clocks and watches.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Hong Kong entrepreneurs set up tens of
thousands of factories in south China and some other areas and
through combining Hong Kong's capital, management and
international marketing skills with the labor and land resources
in the mainland, the international competitiveness of Hong Kong's
economy was further improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that Hong Kong's economic ascendance is in no
way a reflection of the so called "colonial pattern" but instead a
successful example of the "Chinese Economy" as analyzed in detail
by John Naisbitt in his new book "Megatrends Asia", adding that
Hong Kong's prosperity is mainly the result of the endeavors of
the Hong Kong people, in which the Chinese constitute a dominant
majority.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Opens Emergency Meeting on Possible Israeli Radiation Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An emergency meeting of the Arab
League Council opened here today to discuss possible radiation
leakage from Israel's Dimona nuclear plant in the southern Negev
desert.
</P>
<P>
Permanent delegates to the 22-member league are attending the
meeting, called by the Palestinian Authority to try to forge a
joint Arab stand on the dangers posed by the possible radiation
leakage.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will review several proposals put forward by some
member states to tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would present a number of official statements on the
range of the reported leakage at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side would urge the Cairo-based Arab League to
appeal to the international community to demand an inspection of
Israel's nuclear plants by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority have voiced
concern over the possible leakage reported by Israeli television
last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, denied any leak from Dimona, some 60
kilometers from the Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has so far refused to join the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and open its nuclear facilities to
international inspection.
</P>
<P>
The country is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons,
though it has never admitted this.

Zhou said that Hong Kong's economy today also faces new
challenges, which are not political but economic ones. In terms of
growth rate, the local GDP enjoyed an annual increase in real
terms of 11.7 percent during 1960's, 9.2 percent in 1970s and 7.4
percent in 1980s. For the first five years of 1990s, it has
decelerated to about five percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is known for its highly developed trade, finance and
service industries, but relatively behind in the development of
manufacturing and science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of experts and business people are concerned
that if the trend goes further down the road, Hong Kong's economic
structure will gradually lose the support of the manufacturing
industry, which will disturb the economic equilibrium and
aggravate social problems like unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that over the last five years the proportion of
social welfare in the total financial expenditure of Hong Kong has
increased by more than 70 percent while the public expenditure
that has gone to hi-tech and high value-added industries is
only 0.05 percent of the total, which is nothing compared with three
percent in developed countries and nearly two percent in the other
"three little dragons."
</P>
<P>
Faced with the challenges to Hong Kong's economy, some people
in the industrial circles have raised the subject of "Hong Kong's
Second Industrialization," that is, while developing its service
industry, how Hong Kong should at the same time accelerate the
development of hi-tech and high value-added industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that Hong Kong has a good infrastructure, a huge
fund-raising capacity, flexible operation mechanisms and highly
developed market networks, which are the advantages for the
development of hi-tech and high value-added industries in the
days to come.
</P>
<P>
He said that in less than 500 days, Hong Kong will completely
throw off the yoke of colonialism and return to the embrace of the
great motherland. Everyone who loves the motherland and loves Hong
Kong is looking forward to this great moment.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland will serve as
a new starting point for Hong Kong to move towards further
prosperity. Since the late 1970s, the force to push Hong Kong's
economic development has mainly come from the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that beginning from this year, the Chinese
mainland has entered its 9th Five-Year Plan period. The
development opportunity provided by the implementation of the 9th
Five-Year Plan and the long-range plan for the year 2010 will
cover all fields in Hong Kong's economy, benefiting all sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hong Kong people, with the Chinese residents
as its main body, have created, with their own hand, Hong Kong's
prosperity in the past.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the creativity and
the pioneering spirit of the Hong Kong people will be brought into
full play, as they get rid of barriers of colonialism and they
will make Hong Kong more beautiful and more prosperous after 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Air Force unleashed
fierce air attacks against Hezbollah, or Party of God, targets in
south Lebanon this morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched following Hezbollah fired Katyusha
rockets on northern Israel. Twenty-six people were sent to
hospital, but most of them suffered from effects of the shock
while the others had light injuries: a woman was in moderate
condition and five were treated for less serious wounds, the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Several houses in Kiryat Shmona were damaged and one which was
emptied at the time was directly hit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Katyusha rockets fell on Kiryat Shmona and Western Galilee
around 7:00 a.m. local time after the local residents spent the
night in their air shelters.
</P>
<P>
They had been warned that Hezbollah would most likely wage
rocket attacks because they accused Israel of killing a
16-year-old boy and wounding other civilians in Barasheet in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli military authorities said that it did not
operate in the area surrounding the the village of Barasheet. Major
General Amiram Levine, head of the Northern Command, said that the
boy was killed when an old land mine went off.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for this morning's rocket
attacks, saying that it was to avenge the explosion in Barasheet
and warning that it would respond to Israel's any military
reactions against civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao today said the rebellion in the ruling Congress
Party in various parts of the country would not have any adverse
impact on the party's poll prospects in the general election, the
Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
"The average congressmen are still loyal to the party and they
know why the rebel leaders have been expelled," Rao said in
Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh on the eve of embarking his election
campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were seen as the first public reaction of the
Congress Party president on the intra-party squabbles.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party Monday expelled some former ministers and some
other party members for contesting against the party's official
candidates. It also suspended party membership of veteran leader
G.K. Moopanar who led a rebellion in Tamil Nadu recently in
protest against the party leadership's alliance with AIADMK, the
ruling party in the southern state.
</P>
<P>
Rao also dispelled the pre-poll surveys which predicted a hung
parliament in the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
"People know it (a hung parliament) will not be good. ...people
know how to avoid instability," he said. Stability is the major
plank of the Congress party's election manifesto.

<HEADLINE> 50 Iranians Arrested for Violating Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 people, including three
mayors, were arrested, lashed and fined for violating the election
law, an Iranian Justice Ministry official revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Razini, Chief of Tehran's Justice Department, was quoted
by Tehran Radio as saying that some 10 officials of the
municipalities, including three borough mayors in Tehran province
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not identify these people, who
reportedly broke the election law during the first round of
Parliamentary elections on March 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
The violations included usage of governmental facilities and
distribution of fake posters, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The official added that most of the violations were committed
by the municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the announcement by Razini was meant
to hurt the election chances of the liberal group known as G-6
backed by moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi has emerged as the main
figure in the G-6. The group supports development programs
adopted by President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi has been the target of attacks by the right-wing
press for using government funds for G-6 election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening newspaper Kayhan quoted Razini as saying
that "the officials (of G-6) should control the people working
under them so that they would not commit any violations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Razini told the paper that there were 200 cases of election
violations, out of which 100 cases were already processed.

(561 million US dollars) last year after open policy was carried
out in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1995, the Philippine government has
opened its domestic insurance industry, both life and non-life, to
foreign players. This has drawn a large amount of capital infusion
into the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Insurance Commission, last year,
total investments of insurance companies were placed at 50 billion
pesos (2 billion dollars). Majority of this was invested in the
stock market while about 33 percent was infused in government
securities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total premium income of the life sector for the
year was 10.6 billion pesos (411 million dollars) which recorded
19 percent increase from the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Benefit payments also increased about 24 percent to its current
total of 4 billion pesos (150 million dollars).

COLOMBO, April 9 (Xinhua)-- A force of 600 home guards is set

infiltration, according to police sources here today.

Units of this new force will be posted in areas of the
Moneragala district bordering Eastern province in a security
cordon geared to interdict infiltrating LTTE units.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Velayati said that Tehran is
closely monitoring the military cooperation between Ankara and Tel
Aviv, Iran's state-owned Tehran Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Ali
Taygun, Velayati said, "Iran considers it against the interests of
the Islamic world to provide any facilities to the Zionist
regime."
</P>
<P>
"Although the Turkish Defense Ministry has denied certain parts
of the news published on the agreement, Iran is concerned over
providing any facility to the Zionist regime on the grounds that
such concessions are against the vital interests of the Islamic
world and the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Taygun denied that his country had put its airspace and base at
the disposal of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the minister as saying that his country did
not intend to create tension in the region, especially with Iran
and the news about allowing Israel to use Turkish airspace was
"blown out of proportion by the world media."
</P>
<P>
He said that Ankara will never jeopardize its relations with
any country in the region, particularly, Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)
today made public a draft political report reviewing the
achievements made and outlining its tasks for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The report is to be submitted to the eighth national congress
of the CPV, which is scheduled for the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference introducing the main points of the
document, Hong Ha, secretary of the CPV's central committee, said
the report has been subject to discussions at all levels of the
party over the past months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the "renewal decade" in Vietnam has reaped
"great achievements" and that the tasks set by the seventh party
congress for the 1991-1995 period have basically been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The report said Vietnam has got out of a socioeconomic crisis,
but added that the situation in a number of areas has yet to be
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Vietnam's path to socialism has been more and
more clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
The report sets two strategic tasks for the CPV and the
Vietnamese people to perform: to build socialism and defend the
motherland; to speed up industrialization and modernization to
make Vietnam a basically industrialized state by around 2020.
</P>
<P>
From now on to the year of 2000, the report said, Vietnam will
continue its renewal process by developing a socialism-oriented
economy based on multi-ownerships, administered by the state, and
operating under market mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The CPV in the report also called for greater efforts to
reinforce the party and enforce discipline among its members.
</P>
<P>
Hong Ha said the full text of the report will be published by
mass media on Wednesday for public comment.

<HEADLINE> South Mogadishu Schools Closed Down For Fear Of Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Primary and intermediate
schools of South Mogadishu, Somalia, are being closed for
security related reasons.
</P>
<P>
The administration of Imam Al-Shafi'i school, the largest in
Mogadishu, said the measure was taken to avoid human catastrophe
owing to the eminent clashes between the warring factions of
Osman Hassan Ali Atto and General Mohamed Farah Aideed in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The administration further said one of the stray rounds of
mortar shells had hit their school, but fortunately caused only
material damage to the infrastructure of the school.
</P>
<P>
They said the close of the school was a prudent decision taken
to safe the children until the volatile situation subsides. Imam
Al-Shafi'i, which accommodates more than 1,200 children together
with all the Koranic schools in the residential areas close to
the war affected zones were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Two other big primary schools run by Al-Islah Charity, about
eight kilometers away from the battle fields, are likely to be
closed soon for similar reasons. According to one of the
teachers, no responsible person dares to keep that big number of
children together where stray rounds of mortar shells could reach
them. Also, all civilians living in the area have been evacuating
today their children and valuables to relatively safer areas of
the war torn capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fear of a possible new rund of fighting is growing in
Mogadishu after the opposing militiamen of Osman Atto and Aideed
still remain in their defensive positions while there are no
peace negotiations continuing among the rival clansmen of Aideed
and Atto belonging to the Habar Gidir clan, All business stalls
along side the K-4 and K-5 and Afgoye roads in the city have been
also deserted in fear of looting by the warring militiamen.
</P>
<P>
It was only yesterday when three aid agencies had evacuated
their international staff from Mogadishu owing to the
deteriorating security situation in South Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Hale-Bopp May Be One of Brightest Comets in 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hale-Bopp comet is set to
become one of the brightest comets of the 20th century, Chinese
astronomers have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Its visit to the solar system - just once every 4,200 years,
will give millions of people a rare heavenly treat when it reaches
its full brightness next year.
</P>
<P>
Currently Hale-Bopp is orbiting near the planet Jupiter, about
800 million kilometers from the sun, sources with the Purple
Mountain Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
It may be one of the brightest comets in the century by April 1
next year when it reaches its nearest spot to the sun, said Chen
Daohan, a research fellow at the observatory.
</P>
<P>
According to China's astronomical records for over 2,000 years,
there are about 30 comets that can be seen in every century, and
brighter comets appear once 20 years, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Hale-Bopp was 1.07 billion km away from the sun in last July
when it was discovered by two amateur astronomers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Hale-Bopp was 250 times brighter than the
Haley's comet if the latter were put in the same distance.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Observatory and the Shanghai Observatory had shot
pictures of Hale-Bopp comet in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The comet's nucleus is 40 km in diameter, and its 'hair'
indicates intensive activities inside.
</P>
<P>
In August, September and October last year, French astronomers
discovered three dust explosions around the comet, each explosion
lasted for two days, and the comet was three stellar magnitudes
brighter compared to before.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the world also found out that the comet spewed
out 1,000 kg of carbon monoxide per second when it was 900 million
km from the sun, which is equal to the spewing amount of the
Haley's comet when it was 130 million km from the sun.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Hale-Bopp will send out 50 times more gas
by next spring, and a long tail will make it more visible to the
eye.
</P>
<P>
Latest observations and calculations show that the Hale-Bopp
has a cycle of 4,200 years, and it will reach its perigee on March
23 next year when it reaches a distance of 190 million km from the
earth. The closest it will get to the sun by a distance of 130
million km on April 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
By that time, people will be able to see the comet with their
naked eyes.
</P>
<P>
Observation of the comet is of great significance for
scientific research, Chen Daohan said. The orbit of Hale-Bopp is
almost vertical to that of the earth, so that scientists will be
able to catch some primitive information on the verges of the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
In that sense, scientists will able to know the chemical
components of the sun's primordial nebula, and information on the
solar wind at the south and north poles of the sun, which may
reveal the secret about the sun's origin.

<HEADLINE> China's "King of Sugarcoated Haws" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese never forget the fun
of buying "sugarcoated haws on a stick", a kind of traditional
Chinese food, from pedlars with pocket money as youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Coated with sugar, the delicious haw fruit has been made with
big-sized haws, a Chinese speciality recorded in ancient books
more than 3,000 years years ago.
</P>
<P>
Everything changed three years ago, when the first famous
brand, "Old Lady Gao Sugarcoated Haw", was created and began to be
produced in great quantities. It ended hundreds of years of
history in which the sugarcoated haws were home-made by a
sweet-toothed army of pedlars, making and selling the syrupy
treats as small scale street businesses.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yuzhi, a 72-year-old woman, had been selling sugarcoated
haws, which were renowned for their deliciousness, for 20 years in
the downtown areas of Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
After years of research, Lao Yanzhi, the son of Gao
Yuzhi, invented the first machine which helped remove the kern of
haw, making largeer scale production of sugarcoated haws possible.
</P>
<P>
Lao, 42, set up his sugarcoated haws processing factory
soon after inventing the machine, and registered the trademark
of his product as "Old Lady Gao Sugarcoated Haws".
</P>
<P>
His factory, now mainly mechanized, produces 30,000 strings of
sugarcoated haws of various kinds every day for Shenyang alone.
</P>
<P>
Having been approved as an exporter of haw-related
products in China, Lao is in discussions with businessmen from
Singapore, in an attempt to pave a way for his "Old Lady Gao
Sugarcoated Haws" to travel abroad.

TIANJIN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An abandoned oil well near Tianjin
has been brought back to life to produce 30 tons of crude oil a
day.
</P>
<P>
New drilling technology was brought in to rescue Zao 1286-4
well from a life of retirement.
</P>
<P>
The output of the Dagang oilfield near the port city of
Tianjin, has been growing continuously with application of new
theory and technology.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95), the oilfield
invested 158 million yuan (about 19 million US dollars) in
technology upgrading. But the field has recovered 400 million yuan

up from the 24,594 gwh posted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Energy, the rise in the energy
consumption was due to increased business activities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, power generation reached 33,210 gwh in 1995, 9.03
percent up from the 30,460 gwh posted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Department of Energy said that
energy supply should equal demand and the disparity was either
used for station services or declared system losses.
</P>
<P>
System losses were either due to heat loss during transmission
from the station to the end user or through electricity pilferage
or theft.

HANGZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in rural Zhejiang are
earning professional qualifications after digging into homework
lessons.
</P>
<P>
Almost 44,000 farmers decided to undertake home education
through correspondence courses in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The spread of knowledge and new agricultural technology has
earned over 100 million yuan in profits for farmers in Zhejiang,
a coastal province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 new technologies and products, as well as almost
1,500 key agricultural technologies, have been demonstrated to
farmers through lectures and symposiums since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Officials told Xinhua that local governments have attached
great importance to popularizing advanced practical technology in

<HEADLINE> Coarse Food Grain, Wild Vegetables Favorite in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Wild vegetables, corn, millet and
other coarse food grain have staged a comeback on the dinner
tables of many families in north China's Inner Mongolia after
disappearing for decades.
</P>
<P>
The price of a bag of 400-gram of millet averages five yuan in
capital city Huhhot, higher than the cost of the same amount of
fragrant rice imported from Thailand, or four times of domestic
rice. And there is no lack of buyers despite of the staggering
price.
</P>
<P>
Newly developed semi-finished food made of corn flour, buck
wheat flour and oats have a ready market in many parts of the
region.
</P>
<P>
This indicates a change in people's mind on dietary habits and
a social progress, said a regional commercial official.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the historical change, the official said, coarse food
grain served as the principal food in the region two or three
decades ago, accounts for 70 percent of the total food
supply. Each family used to save the limited supply of flour and
rice for children and the old in the 1970s and the annual per
capita consumption of meat was no more than five kg. Now the per
capita consumption of meat is more than 40 kg.
</P>
<P>
With living standards improving since China's economic reforms
which began in 1979, people gradually replaced wild vegetables
with high-grade varieties. Chicken, duck, meat and fish have
become popular in home cooking.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, people came to realize that coarse grain food
contains many nutritious ingredients. Digging wild vegetables on
the outskirts while people are holidaying has become a fashion
nowadays.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Denmark, Sweden and Finland
have agreed to support the sign language program for the Eastern
and Southern Africa deaf people.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Regional Secretariat for the Eastern and
Southern Africa (RSESA) of the World Federation of the Deaf,
Francis Oranti Disclosed this in Dodoma, Central Tanzania on
Monday when closing a four-day electoral national conference of
the Tanzania Association of the Deaf (CHAVITA).
</P>
<P>
Oranti said that under the program, Denmark had accepted the
responsibility of making various sign language materials for
training, Finland would train sign language interpreters and
Sweden would deal with sign language dictionary printing and
research.
</P>
<P>
He explained that while training in sign language for Eastern
and Southern Africa for deaf people would be done in Kampala,
Uganda, the dictionary group would be based in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Sign language interpreters training will be held in either
Zambia or Finland," he added.
</P>
<P>
The RSESA chief clarified that the project, still resourcing
the funds, was an offspring of a seminar held in Kampala, two
years ago. During that seminar it was agreed to set up a new sign
language program to cater for all deaf people in the Eastern and
Southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Oranti urged the electorate and all other deaf members in
Tanzania to cooperate among themselves and other communities.
Without cooperation, he said, it would be very difficult for them
to develop.
</P>
<P>
During the elections, the out-going executive secretary,
Mrs. Lupi Maswanya, was unanimously elected CHAVITA national
chairperson for the next five years.

<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Some brands of fancy cakes,
bottled mineral water and powdered milk were among consumer
products which have failed quality tests by China's Ministry of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Health watchdogs from the ministry recently conducted a survey
on different brands of the three food commodities.
</P>
<P>
Among the ten brands of natural mineral water sampled, seven
passed the check, but the other three were classified as
unqualified because germs within the water exceeded the limits set
by state standards.
</P>
<P>
As for the 17 kinds of milk powder surveyed, nine passed, but
the rest failed to qualify for various reasons, with four
containing less than the specified amount of dried milk.
</P>
<P>
And in ten brands of cakes, germs within five exceeded the
state limits.
</P>
<P>
Describing the micro-organic contamination as a major hygiene
problem, an official with the health ministry urged producers and
sellers to halt the marketing of substandard foods, and improve
the quality of their products immediately.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Precious Metal Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' precious metal
exports in January this year improved 5.3 percent to 38.28 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Export Trade Promotions (BETP), this
was 1.91 million US dollars higher than the 36.37 million dollars
posted in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase was mainly due to the improved performance
of gold bullion and chromium ore exports.
</P>
<P>
Comprising half of aggregate precious metal exports, dollar
earnings from gold bullion were recorded at 19.5 million, up 32.2
percent from the 14.75 million dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A BETP official said that gold bullion exports have been on an
uptrend since the Central Bank liberalized the sale of gold.
</P>
<P>
In addition, gold prices on the global market are stronger this
year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged To Play Greater Role In Bosnia  Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian government minister
today urged Malaysia to play an important role in assisting
Bosnia-Herzegovina in its reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia-Herzegovina's minister of foreign trade and
international communications, Neven Tomic, told a seminar on
business opportunities in Bosnia-Herzegovina here today that
Malaysia, with its experience, could explore the privatization
programs in his country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians, he said, could buy land to venture into new
businesses in Bosnia-Herzegovina using Malaysian technology and
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Tomic said there were more than 2,000 planned projects that had
been abandoned because of the war, and these projects, ranging
from agricultural farming to hydro-electric power, could take off
with the support of investors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the World Bank estimated that at least 5.1 billion
U.S. dollars was needed in the first three years to reconstruct
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
"We were promised a lot, but the money promised for the
construction is coming very slowly and we hope that the second
donors' conference, which is scheduled to start in a few days in
Brussels, will speed up the realization of the given promises," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tomic, who is in Malaysia on a six-day visit, also said there
were a number of joint venture contracts that involved Malaysia
and his country, but the Bosnians were having problems in getting
bank guarantee.
</P>
<P>
But he said the visit of Malaysian prime minister Mahathir
Mohamad next week to Bosnia would see the signing of some new
agreements and the strengthening of relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Launches Drive for Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has ambitiously vowed to create west China's "silicon valley",
with a total output value of 2.5 billion yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a drive towards the goal, the province has implemented an
economic plan in a bid to give scope to science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a hi-tech industrial belt will be built in the
central part of the province, where top priority will be given to
eight sunrise industries, and 50 hi-tech products with high added
value and strong market competitiveness, will be developed.
</P>
<P>
Between 1955 and 1965, the Chinese Government embarked on a
number of key projects in Shaanxi. Now it is an important research
and production base for astronautics, space, weaponry,
electronics, machine-building, instruments and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
However, the combination of scientific achievements with
production is unsatisfactory, officials said, explaining that is
why they have forged the plan.
</P>
<P>
Sun Haiying, director of the Provincial Science and Technology
Commission, said four to five sunrise industries will take shape
by the year 2000 through the implementation of the plan, yielding
50 billion yuan worth of output value, and ten billion yuan in
profits and taxes. The hi-tech industry will account for more than
20 percent of the total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech industrial development belt, which will consist of
several industrial parks and development areas, will become home
to ten engineering technical centers and experimental bases,
covering electronic information, new materials, advanced
manufacturing techniques and biotechnics.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in China's Optical Telecom Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's research in optical cable
telecommunications has achieved major new breakthroughs, narrowing
the gap between the technical levels of China and developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists scored 168 academic achievements in optical
cable telecommunications fields during the past five years, with
most of the advances put into production.
</P>
<P>
So far China has developed the 565 Mb/s optical transmission,
which was adopted in the Shanghai-Wuxi and Shanghai-Nanjing
optical cable.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the progress in plesio-synchronous digital
hierarchy (PDH) fields, China's SDH (synchronous digital
hierarchy) development also gained momentum. Two SDH systems,
with transport speeds of 622 Mb/s and 155 Mb/s, respectively,
passed final testing, and has been used in the 715-km-long
Chengdu-Xichang-Panzhihua cable project.
</P>
<P>
This year, a SDH system with a transport speed of 2.488 Gb/s,
made its debut in Wuhan, pushing the country's SDH technical
benchmark to new heights.
</P>
<P>
Statistic show that the fledgling optical telecommunications
industry generated profits totaling 600 million yuan over the past
five years.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Experts Studying Deadly Mud-Rock Flows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Geologists in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have become the country's most reliable predictors
of mud-rock flows and landslides.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting the disasters in the province over the past five
years, 60 percent of their predictions proved to be accurate.
</P>
<P>
The geologists started their studies on the disasters in 1986,
said Zhou Juqian, deputy director of the Yunnan Provincial Geology
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute, with the help from the Chengdu-based Mountainous
Disaster and Environment Research Institute, conducted a general
survey on all the mud-rock flows and landslides which occured in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The survey resulted in the compiling of special 'disaster zone'
maps, pinpointing places where disasters are likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
Geologists, studying the pattern of the occurrences of mud-rock
flows and landslides, have been predicting the disasters for the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan suffers most in the country from mud-rock flows and
landslides. Over the past decade, 1,650 people have been killed by
the disasters, which also caused financial losses of two billion
yuan for the province.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Katyusha Rockets on Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired two batches of Katyusha rockets
into northern Israel at dawn today, wounding some 13 people,
officials and security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that its guerrillas fired the two batches of Katyusha
rockets at the Jewish settlements of Kiryat Shmona at dawn today.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah held Israel responsible for
the blast of a mine Monday night on a road near the southern
Lebanese village of Barashit, killing one civilian and wounding
three others.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in Kiryat Shmona said that the second batch of
Katyusha rockets were fired on northern Israel only five minutes
after the first round of the Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the Israeli army had ordered the local
residents at Kiryat Shmona Monday night to resort to shields, in
anticipation of retaliatory attacks by Hezbollah for the killing
and wounding of southern Lebanese civilians by the mine blast.
</P>
<P>
The added that the Israeli occupation forces and their client
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in south Lebanon were put in an alert Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for the Hezbollah to launch the
Katyusha attacks at northern Israel since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Shiite militant group fired some 28 katyusha
rockets in three batches between March 30-31, in revenge for the
killing of two southern Lebanese villagers in Israeli bombardments
at Yater in Bint Jail area.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah always considers the killing of southern Lebanese
civilians as a violation of a U.S.-mediated understanding which
put an end to an Israeli blitz in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "July understanding," Israel promised to
refrain from attacking civilian targets in south Lebanon in
exchange for Hezbollah's guarantee on the security of the
residents in northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Gunfire is Major Killer of U.S. Teenagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Gunfire is the second-leading
cause of death among Americans aged between 10 and 19, the
Children's Defense Fund said on Monday in its report.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a child died every 92 minutes from gunfire, most often
murdered, compared with one such case happening every 178 minutes
in 1983, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The leading cause of death among the youth remained accidents,
primarily involving motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"This information really should set off alarm bells for every
mother and father in America," said Enola Arid of the nonpartisan
advocacy group. "It is, unfortunately, not surprising. We have not
done what we should be doing to try and keep our children safe and
away from guns."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, data compiled by the National Center
for Health Statistics show the number of gunfire deaths among
Americans below age 20 increased 7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the 5,751 childhood gunfire deaths in 1993
showed 3,661 homicides, 1,460 suicides, 526 accidents and 104
unknown.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund complained that the government does too little
to keep guns away from schools and children and that Republicans
in Congress want to lift gun restrictions, including the 1994 ban
on assault-style weapons.

<HEADLINE> Trees Along Yarlung Zangbo River Beat Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Two million trees planted along a
Tibetan river have become a natural ally in the fight against
drifting sands and floods, local sources reported.
</P>
<P>
The middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, the largest in
the Tibet Autonomous Region, suffered from serious drifting sands
in winter and spring, and floods in summer.
</P>
<P>
Over two million trees have now been planted on about 1,700
hectares of land in Zedung, to protect against sands and floods.
</P>
<P>
While improving tree-planting techniques, local forestry
departments also introduced dozens of new tree species into the
region.
</P>
<P>
Most of the species are poplar and willow, chosen because
they were found to be able to survive for two or three months
underwater.
</P>
<P>
The discovery made 150,000 million hectares of sand beaches
suitable for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Dams were built vertically to the river banks, protecting trees
from being flooded, as well as slowing the river flow and creating
new land.
</P>
<P>
Every hectare of wetland created using this method cost only
1,500 yuan (181 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local forestry departments have prolonged the tree-planting
season from one month to five months - enabling planting to take
place in summer, winter, as well as in spring.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Loans in US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China has arranged a number of
major loans in US dollars for the Three Gorges project in central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Branch of the Bank of China, one of China's
four state commercial banks, has signed agreements to provide 100
million US dollars for the China Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation (CTGPDC), reports the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
To raise fund for the Three Gorges project, the largest scheme
of its kind in the world, China had planned to issue one billion
yuan (120 million US dollars) in bonds on overseas markets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"As our foreign exchange reserves swelled drastically in 1995,
the government decided to arrange part of the reserves as loans
for the project," an official with the State Planning Commission
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves surged to 73.5 billion US
dollars at the end of 1995, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
CTGPDC will use the loans to cover construction expenses in
1996, and buy advanced equipment, said officials with the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Branch of the Bank of China had offered 20
million US dollars in loans to the Gezhouba Group, the main
undertaker of the project, to import construction facilities.
</P>
<P>
China started to build the Three Gorges project last year.

<HEADLINE> Thai official calls US Turtle law Enforcement unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Thai Fisheries Department
official has said, "it's not fair that the United States forced an
internal law on other countries and it should not use
environmental issues as trade barriers."
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop Suraswadi, director of the Thai Fisheries
Department, said this when commenting on the US' enforcement of
trade restrictions aimed at conserving sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
He said the enforcement of trade restrictions would greatly
damage shrimp exports from Thailand to the US.
</P>
<P>
The US imports about 22.5 billion baht's (900 million dollars)
worth of shrimp products from Thailand every year, about 17
billion baht (680 million dollars) of this trade are from shrimp
exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The damage done to Thailand's shrimp exports to the US could be
worth about 5.5 billion baht (220 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop said that Thailand has no choice but to strongly
oppose the enforcement of the law. Thailand will ask the World
Trade Organization to consider and judge the dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Thailand has already three bills that could be
used to implement turtle conservation activities.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to explain this to the US but it doesn't listen
because it believes in its law and that every country must follow
its law," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton in
a memorandum issued here today called on federal agencies to work
with Mexico in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
A 13-point strategy put into effect by the President calls on
U.S. law enforcement agencies to share information with Mexico to
help fight the illegal drug trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It instructs the departments of Justice, State, Treasury and
Defense to ferret out large shipments of illegal drugs coming from
Mexico into the United States by air or land.
</P>
<P>
It also directs the agencies to assist Mexico by working to
reduce the U.S. demand for drugs and using high-tech means to
eradicate drug crops.
</P>
<P>
"In some modesty ways, it may be appropriate for the United
States to support their (Mexican) military and police forces with
either technical assistance, radars, cooperation of the Coast
Guard or other mechanisms," said General Barry McCaffrey, director
of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey led a U.S. delegation to Mexico last month for a
meeting in which both countries pledged to work together to combat
drug use, production, trade and money laundering. His office will

NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party
Monday took disciplinary actions against party rebels, expelling
three former ministers and some other party members from the
party, the Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three former ministers, Madhavrao Scindia, P. Chidambaram

in the Tamil Nadu Congress unit recently, was suspended from the
primary membership of the party.

Moonpanar has floated the Tamil Nadu Maanila Congress in
protest against the party leadership's decision to ally with the
ruling party AIADMK in the southern state.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil said "since Moonpanar is
not contesting, we have to first suspend him as per disciplinary
rules and then expel."
</P>

The Congress Party has also directed Pradesh (state) Congress
committees to immediately expel all those party members who are

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges U.S. to Pay Dues, Article Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the United States to pay 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in dues and assessments as the United Nations is on
the brink of financial disaster, according to a signed article
published here today.
</P>
<P>
"Americans need to know what's going on, because their country
took the lead in creating the organization, and its delinquency in
paying arrears is threatening it," Boutros-Ghali wrote in the
article.
</P>
<P>
"For four years, the Secretariat has carried out its mandates
under near impossible conditions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretariat had decided to cut 1,000 workers to lower
the budget, and the cuts of this magnitude could reduce the extent
and quality of the work the members want done, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russian Federation dominated the past-due
list, he said, adding that he was grateful that Russia decided
last month to pay 400 million dollars, including its full regular
assessment of 46 million dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
As the United States owed 1.5 billion dollars of dues and
assessments, the United Nations would run out of money by the end
of 1996 even with Russians' payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"When the League of Nations collapsed, many members were
surprised. They did not understand the depth of its problems.
Today, the United Nations, created 51 years ago, is in deep
trouble. This time around, there should be no surprises," the
U.N. chief added.

DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The all share price index on the

According to sources concerned here today, the price index

The day's trading was eventful as the number of losing issues

the price index was supposed to fall. But the fluctuation of the
price index ended in the plus column with a big gap, the sources
added.
</P>

The major cause of the big rise was gains on the high paid up

KATHMANDU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
hesitant to take back more than 200 Nepali girls who had worked as
prostitutes at brothels in Bombay, India, and were now in police
custody there, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The government had received a request from Indian authorities,
saying it wants to repatriate 218 girls detained in Bombay. But
Kathmandu has yet to respond to New Delhi's request, the Kathmandu

</P>
<P>
The Nepali girls were rescued recently during a police raid on
Bombay's red light area, as the Indian government is striving to
check the flourishing sex tourism in that country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two of these detained girls had died of
HIV/AIDS-related diseases and some of them had sent an SOS letter
to non-governmental organizations in Nepal appealing for their
early repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's hesitance, local social and women's
organizations were ready to assist the government in taking back
and rehabilitating these girls, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Seven local organizations had offered to take in a certain
number of girls after they are repatriated to Nepal, according to

Korean peninsula through "quiet diplomacy," a U.N. spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the noon news briefing, Ahmad Fawzi, deputy
spokesman for the secretary-general, said that the issue is very
high on Boutros-Ghali's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief has just returned from visits to China, South
Korea and Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say at this stage is that he is practicing what we
like to call quiet diplomacy which, by its very nature, is
confidential," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) announced last
Thursday that it would give up its duty, under the 1953 armistice
agreement, concerning the maintenance of the military demarcation
line (MDL) and the demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing the two parts
of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the DPRK said South Korea had "persistently
rejected" its proposals and "driven the situation to the brink of
war" under the protection of the United States. Some 37,000
U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said that South Korea, in violation of the armistice
agreement, had brought tanks, artillery pieces and heavy weapons
into the DMZ and deployed a large number of armed military
personnel there.
</P>
<P>
"Areas south of (the) MDL have been left without the real
meaning of a buffer zone and the DMZ established under the
armistice agreement has turned into an armed zone and a new attack
position for the invasion of the north," the DPRK statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that
South Korean troops would be given orders to shoot any DPRK troops
setting foot in the southern half of the DMZ.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Currency Devalued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Central Bank has
devalued taka, the currency of the country, against the US dollar
by over one percent to raise competitiveness of the exports.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement published here today, the
new rate, which took effect from Monday, has been fixed at TK
41.40 from TK 40.90 for buying and TK 41.60 from TK 41.11 for
selling by the Central Bangladesh Bank (BB) against one dollar.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that this is the first such step taken under the
caretaker government led by Chief Adviser Habibur Rahman and the
fourth since last September when ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia
took a number of fiscal and monetary measures to reverse the
inflationary trend and depletion of the foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
But sources concerned said that the inflation rate rose further
to 8.5 percent from just over 4 percent last June and the foreign
exchange reserve declined to as low as 2.24 billion dollars from a
record 3.4 billion dollars one year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of truck drivers in
Uruguay began an indefinite strike early this morning to protest
against mandatory technical inspections imposed by the Transport
and Public Works Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many roads were blocked by heavy trucks parked in a line in a
show of protest.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, Montevideo, more than a hundred trucks remained
parked around the docks.
</P>
<P>
Strike organizers said today that the walkout is a peaceful one
and would not affect normal traffic.
</P>
<P>
The truck drivers want the ministry to lower the cost of
inspections from 1,200 pesos (about 160 U.S. dollars) and stagger
the inspections to give them time to repair their vehicles and
adjust their schedules.
</P>
<P>
The ministry argues that the current security situation in the
country warrants the inspection system.
</P>
<P>
A committee comprising officials from the ministry, the Chamber
of Deputies and the truck drivers will be set up soon to try to
negotiate an end to the strike.

<HEADLINE> Romania Opens Oil, Gas Sector to Foreign Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government, lifting
a ban on foreign companies in its natural resources exploration,
has decided to open its oil and gas sector to foreign bidders.
</P>
<P>
Under a new law that took effects on March 29, foreign
companies are allowed to bid for the country's oil and gas
exploration and granted some preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
The law, ending a long-standing policy of denying foreign
companies access to the country's natural resources exploration,
aimed to inject foreign capitals into Romania's financially
trapped oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Romania, one of the oil-rich European states, began tapping oil
and gas in 1857. But more than 130 years of exploration has
depleted the oil and gas deposits in the shallow layers
underground, leading to a dramatical drop in oil and gas
production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Romania's oil output declined to 6.7 million tons from
14 million tons in 1975, while its gas production dropped to 18.2
billion cubic meters from 38.9 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, Romanian geologists believe huge reserves of oil and
gas may exist in the deeper layers underground, whose exploration
require tremendous investment that the government cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of fund forced the government to turn to foreign
companies for help in the exploration of its oil and gas
reserves.

<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A 10-km long dirty and chaotic
stretch of bank along the Yangtze River in Chongqing, the largest
industrial city in southwest China, has been replaced by a broad
highway.
</P>
<P>
It took the city government eight years to harness the bank
section, which was strewn with sewage, rubbish and dozens of
dilapidated houses and dangerous rocks, the "China Land News"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about this were common from people living in the
nearby old district of the city. In March 1993 the municipal
government embarked on a project to rehabilitate the section.
</P>
<P>
The city poured one billion yuan (about 120 million US dollars)
into the improvement of transportation facilities, control of
dangerous rocks and land prone to slide, sewage, construction of
green space and renovation of old houses, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Of the investment, over 100 million yuan came from the revenue
from renting out the redeveloped wasteland on the bank, it said.

SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The search continued
today for kidnapped architect Juan Carlos Gaviria, the brother of
Cesar Gaviria, the former Colombian President and current
secretary-general of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
Police and army units are pursuing the search in the eastern

Investigators from the regional prosecutor's office of
Risaralda are working on leads to find out where the victim is

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Employment Process of Foreign Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official reiterated that
any foreign talent agencies who intend to do business in job
placement in China will have to register at the State Bureau of
Foreign Experts (SBFE) first.
</P>
<P>
Foreign talent agencies which send less than 50 people to China
each year should sign cooperation contracts with intermediary
organizations which will place experts in a particular region,
today's China Daily quoted Xu Zhenyuan, deputy-director of the
State Bureau of Foreign Experts, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This move is to facilitate the fair distribution of experts in
terms of regions and subjects," Xu said, adding that it would also
make management easier.
</P>
<P>
China currently employs more than 70,000 foreigners each year,
including 14,000 cultural and educational experts and teachers
working in more than 1,100 universities, press, art, health and
sports institutions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to universities, primary schools, high schools,
vocational training schools and even kindergartens have begun to
hire foreign teachers, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulation promulgated by the bureau in 1993,
all foreigners seeking jobs in China should go through Chinese
intermediary organizations.
</P>
<P>
But experts continue to come through inter-government and
sister-city agreements, school cooperation, non-governmental
organizations and by self-recommendation.
</P>
<P>
However, some self-recommended foreign employees violated laws
during their stay or left their jobs without notifying their
employers.
</P>
<P>
The bureau held a talent fair at the end of last month for 21
existing intermediary organizations and 15 foreign talent agencies
in east China's Fujian province, in an effort to introduce and
promote these organizations.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 foreigners found jobs and the 15 agencies passed
the annual examination to become qualified for talent employment
brokerage business in China.
</P>
<P>
Xu also said that China's colleges and universities will have
more foreign professors teaching agricultural, technical, economic
and legal subjects.
</P>
<P>
He said that help from foreign experts is very important to
China's development. "Such a policy has not changed and will never
change," he added.

<HEADLINE> In Vitro Fertilization Gains Popularity in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Fertilization outside the womb,
or in vitro, is gaining popularity in Costa Rica in the midst of a
controversy over the practice.
</P>
<P>
At least seven women will be giving birth during the next seven
months thanks to the in vitro fertilization, a process in which an
egg extracted from a woman's body is fertilized in laboratory and
then inserted into her womb for development.
</P>
<P>
The practice, however, is facing criticism from the Catholic
church which does not accept the fact that many embryos have to be
discarded before one of them can be implanted successfully in a
woman's womb.
</P>
<P>
For the church, this represents a kind of abortion which its
doctrine rejects.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, fertilization outside the womb is an alternative
that is becoming more and more interesting for many couples who
would not be able to have children otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The first successful fertilization in the country was reported
in December 1994. Since then the practice has been spreading in
the central American nation.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Modernize Marriages In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipality issued a new
regulation governing marriage registration and its administration
this month to meet the needs of today's changing society, "China
Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, enacted on April 1, is expected not only to
intensify local authorities' oversight of marriage registration,
but also to further protect the legal interests of ordinary
Chinese citizens applying for marriage or divorce, according to an
official with the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
For example, the new regulation permits marriage applicants
with legal documents who are nevertheless denied permission to
register to take legal action against the relevant agencies in
accordance with the administrative Procedure Law.
</P>
<P>
Proper legal documents include local residential and identity
cards, certificates of marriage status and pre-marriage medical
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
Some aspects of the revised regulation are intended to dovetail
with laws issued in the last few years, including the
Administrative Procedure law and other laws focused on the
protection of women and children.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulation, official agencies, institutions and
non-government organizations are obligated to write certificates
of marriage status for their own employees applying for marriages
without taking any measures to limit or obstruct them from
registering for legal marriage with proper authorities.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also made clear that marriage registration
agencies are responsible for helping applicants if the man has
reached the age of 22 or the woman the age of 20, but the couple
has been turned down because of interference from their employers,
work units or other people.
</P>
<P>
The regulation has also added a series of stipulations aimed at
helping marriage applicants with special personal
back-grounds. These include the millions of members of floating
populations working in Beijing to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Instead of registering for marriage in their home towns as in
the past, these applicants are now allowed to go through legal
formalities for marriage in Beijing with a written trust deed by
their home town agencies.
</P>
<P>
Such revisions will be vital for marriage registration agencies
to play a key role not only in registering marriages but also in
supervising the management of marriage archives and assessing
penalties against various invalid marriages.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A new label for
environmentally-friendly Chinese products was made public here on
Monday, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
In related news, 17 products from 10 enterprises were given
special certificates for contributing to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They were the second group of green products designated by the
China Certification Committee for Environmental Labelling
Products, set up by the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
One of the new products to receive the eco-friendly label was a
phosphate-free fabric detergent which helps prevent a build-up of
organic compounds and thus serious pollution problems in rivers
and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The work of labeling products can not be separated from the
need to improve public awareness of environmental protection, NEPA
Director Xie Zhenhua said.
</P>
<P>
The first group of green products received their certificates
last year and were divided into seven categories, including
refrigerators containing few CFCs, which are believed to damage
the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The system of marking green products with a uniform label will
help the enterprises become more competitive in the international
market, Xie said.
</P>

China has been making efforts to obtain mutual approval of
environmental labels from countries like Germany, the U.S., Canada
and Japan.

BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
said China has made new progress in improving varieties of grain,
vegetables and new materials in space research over the past
decade.
</P>

Wang Tongyi, vice-minister of the Commission for Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense, said that about
5,600 scientists are doing research nationwide into some 400
aspects of space studies, including space-earth transportation,
large carrier rockets and space stations.
</P>

Some scientists are doing experiments on such materials as
protein crystals, cells, microorganisms and plant seed strains in
space by using recoverable satellites and carrier rockets.

space technology development and decided that the next generation
carrier rocket will use pollution-free, high-performance
propellant fuel.

<HEADLINE> Rules Needed for TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a shortage of programs,
funds and shrinking audiences, some TV stations choose to show
pirated or pornographic programs.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television was determined to
further control the television industry, meanwhile the
establishment of new TV stations requires authorization.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, China had only 15 television stations. Up to
the end of 1994, TV stations at and above county-level numbered
982, cable TV networks stations numbered 1,202, and educational TV
stations totalled 941. This was twice the number of stations in
the United States, and 24 times more than in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Still more TV channels do not necessarily mean more and better
programs.
</P>
<P>
It is expensive to set up and operate. The establishment of a
new station usually costs more than 10 million yuan, according to
the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
And running a TV station is a serious business. It demands
money and trained personnel, quality programming and good
management.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Yunnan province, more than 20 county
educational TV stations shut down at one time or another due to
lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
To survive, some TV stations have resorted to some questionable
methods.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a distillery paid 31 million yuan to buy just five
seconds of advertising time during the CCTV"s night prime time
broadcasts in 1995. In 1995 another distillery paid 66.7 million
yuan for the same coverage.
</P>
<P>
It was supposed the commercial would reach the biggest audience
nationwide, as CCTV is the nation's largest TV station, and the
commercial ran between two of its most popular programs.
</P>
<P>
But, it is open to question whether this money was well
spent. Recently, there are reports that many local TV stations
would air these two popular programs, but at the supposed golden
time for commercials, they would cut off the signal from the CCTV
and air locally-made commercials. Some local stations even
interrupt the CCTV news broadcast for their own commercials.
</P>
<P>
With the supervision of the State, hopefully the benefits of TV
stations can be maximized and the down sides minimized.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Discuss Further Split of Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia discussed
today how to split the Sevastopol-based warships and
non-Sevastopol-based port facilities of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was held at the port city of Sevastopol between
the Ukrainian navy and the Russian-led Black Sea Fleet Joint
Commission, according to the Ukrainian Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Both the Ukrainian and Russian deputies agreed at their first
discussion that the separation of the warships and port facilities
should be completed before May 31 this year, as set by the defense
ministers of their two countries earlier.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the separation of the Black Sea Fleet was
completed in late March this year. The second-phase discussion is
expected to deal with the split of the 54 warships and other
support vessels still moored at Sevastopol, shunning the thorny
issue of the future of the Sevastopol base itself, currently the
headquarters of the Ukrainian navy.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian news agency also reported that the Ukrainian and
Russian deputies touched upon the possibility of setting up a
joint naval base at Sevastopol for a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed
a document on setting up a government commission to study the
naval base issue.
</P>
<P>
The commission is to submit its proposals of the transfer to
the Russian navy of part of the port facilities at Novorossiisk,
Tuapse, Sochi and Gelendzhik along the Russian Black Sea coast,
after the country tried in vain to persuade Kiev to allow its navy
to use the port facilities at Sevastopol in Crimea in the
Ukrainian territory.

<HEADLINE> One Out of Five Mexicans Suffers From Poverty-linked Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 8 (Xinhua) -- About one out of five Mexicans
suffers from a disease linked to poverty, even though the general
health of the population has improved in the past few decades, the
Health Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The most common diseases are cholera, dengue fever,
tuberculosis, respiratory infections among children and
malaria. Poverty-induced undernourishment and death during
childbirth are also common, the ministry said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed high poverty-related mortality to the
lack of basic medical services, inadequate food, poor access to
drinking water and sewage systems and, above all else, the absence
of a culture which emphasizes disease-prevention.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also praised significant advances in the
past 35 years, noting that the infant mortality rate from
illnesses accompanied by diarrhea had halved, while the mortality
rate from childbirth had dropped 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, infectious intestinal diseases dropped from
first to 10th place among the causes of death.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, heart disease was the leading cause of death in
Mexico, followed by cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, pneumonia,
diarrhea and childbirth, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Marked Success in Air Seeding in Northwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Successful air seeding has turned
half a million hectares of arid wasteland into forest in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Loess Plateau with scarce vegetation and serious
soil erosion, Shaanxi was one of the earliest northwestern regions
to start air seeding. It established a special body in charge of
the program in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the province has been air seeding 80,000
ha. annually. It has so far air seeded 1.3 million hectares, with
over half surviving.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said successful air seeding has left the
province with eight new forests, each with an area of 6,000
hectares, and 168 wooded areas, each with an area of 600 ha..
</P>
<P>
The surviving forests now boast eight million square meters of
timber worth of 1.5 billion yuan, 20 times the money spent on air
seeding, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the half-desert north and the mountainous south part of
Shaanxi, air seeding has produced more than 500,000 ha. of
forests, and greatly improved the local ecological environment,
the sources noted.

<HEADLINE> New Port of Entry for Sino-Russian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A new port of entry is to be set up
along the Sino-Russian border in the Altay region of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to promote the trade
between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
A priority project, the Kanas port of entry is planned to open
in five years' time, and a border trade zone is planned in the
area where the borders of China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia
join.
</P>
<P>
The Altay region neighbors the Novosibirsk region, an emerging
economic powerhouse in Russia's Far East, and the Kanas Pass is
720 km from the city of Novosibirsk. To its east is Mongolia, and
to the west Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia share a 54-km clearly defined border along the
Kanas Pass, which provides the only passage linking Russia with
the vast areas of western China.
</P>
<P>
Far from Russia's seaport in the Far East and from the
developed areas in Europe, Novosibirsk, with considerable strength
in basic industries such as machine building and coal mining, is
ready to develop economic ties with China which has strength in
light industry.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the opening of a direct business passage, which
will save hundreds of km when transporting cargoes from the Altay
region to Russia, is the best way to promote Sino-Russian trade in
west China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 the regional government has organized surveys of the
Kanas Pass and submitted a report on feasibility studies to the
central government.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that the Kanas port of entry will handle
100,000 tons of cargoes and 30,000 passengers annually at the
beginning, and 60 percent of the cargo and passenger flows will
come from other regions in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a sample survey
every quarter on its unemployment situation, starting in the
fourth quarter of this year, an official from the State Statistics
Bureau announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weimin, deputy director of the bureau's population and
employment statistics department, said that China has conducted
two unemployment surveys since 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "With China shifting from a planned economy
to a market economy, the labor market is becoming complicated and
changing quickly, and the bureau has to conduct four surveys a
year so as to grasp the true picture of the labor market."
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said, China still lags behind the advanced
countries, which, "like the US, do unemployment surveys on a
monthly basis."
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year 5.2 million people in cities were
registered as jobless and the unemployment rate was 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
China plans to curb the unemployment rates for this year and
the year 2000 at 3.2 percent and around four percent,
respectively, Zhang revealed.

SAN JOSE, April 8 (Xinhua) - The dates for the elimination
matches corresponding to the Northern, Central American and
Caribbean Confederation of Football (CONCACAF) will be set this
coming June, CONCACAF President Trinitario Jack Warner said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Warner made a tour of the region to analyze the situtation of
football in the CONCACAF area.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is a very important country for the Concacaf, said
Warner. He proposed that support be continued for the country in
different matters such as the preparation of referreeing and in
other fields.
</P>
<P>
The national leaders of the sector are waiting anxiously for
the setting of dates for the elimination matches so they can
schedule the actitivities of the national team.
</P>
<P>
After a long debate, the Costa Rican Football Federation
designated Brazilian Valdeir Vieira as the trainer of the national
team.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian trainer would prefer that the elimination matches
be played between November and December which would give the
national team time to practice after the finals of the national
tournament around the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the Concacaf zone, Mexico is the traditional favorite to
qualify for the World Cup. The United States and Canadian soccer
teams have also improved their standards and, in Central America,
it is believed that Costa Rica and Honduras would be the countries
with the best chances of qualifying.

sAGREB, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian government issued a
statement today denying that the suicide of a Bibrovnik airport
employee last Saturday was related to the crash of a US plane near
the scenic Croatian city, killing US Commerce Secretary Ronald
Brown.
</P>

The statement by the Ministry of Interior was in response to
some foreign media speculation about possible links between the

technical maintenance service, and crash of the US plane.

The statement said that "Jerkic was found dead on the 6th of
April at about 18:30 hours. On the basis of circumstantial
evidence, it was assumed that Niko Jerkic had committed suicide".

Jerkic's "death bears no connection to the tragic crash of the
U.S. plane," the statement said, adding that Dubrovnik police
department will continue to investigate Jerkic's death.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic expressed satisfaction here today with the normalization of
relations between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Macedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomir
Frckoski, Kontic said he was convinced the agreement signed today
on the regulation of relations and the promotion of cooperation
between the two countries would significantly help stabilize
peace, confidence and cooperation in the Balkans, a federal
government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Frchoski and Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Milan Milutinovic, the two countries have established
full diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides agreed that all necessary
conditions have existed for a rapid, comprehensive and intensive
development and cooperation between the two countries, especially
in the economic field, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Kontic told Frckoski the two economies were highly
complementary and could have successful cooperation thanks, among
other things, to good transportation links between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia is the only ex-Yugoslav republic that had a peaceful
secession and the first to have diplomatic relations with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which comprises Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the value of Yugoslav-Macedonian
economic cooperation could quickly reach one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Frckoski said the agreement signed
today "has positively reverberated in Macedonia, where there have
been no anti-Serb sentiments since the outbreak of the crisis in
the former Yugoslavia." Frckoski left Belgrade for home later
today after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
By signing the agreement, the two sides agreed to open
top-level political dialogue with a view to strengthening and
furthering Yugoslav-Macedonian relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to have immediate negotiations on
the inter-state agreements on comprehensive cooperation, which
covers the guarantees for capital investments, strengthening trade
relations, cooperation in scientific and cultural fields, the
protection of human environment, and so on.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq Begins Third Round of Oil-for-Food Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and Iraq
started the third round of oil-for-food talks here today.
</P>
<P>
Just before beginning of the talks this afternoon, U.N.
Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell said that the Iraqi negotiator
had reported to Baghdad and had important message for him and for
further discussion.
</P>
<P>
Though he refused to predict that this was the last round of
talks, he said, "We will get down to work. This is, as you know, a
complicated matter, but I'm positive we will make progress," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While sharing remarks with Corell, Iraqi envoy Abdul Amir
al-Anbari said, "We will do our best to reach an agreement as soon
as possible, if that is possible."
</P>
<P>
Compared to that of the previous talks, the atmosphere seem
much more optimistic here. At the end of the first round of talks
on February 19, the negotiators said that they were assigned to
conduct technical talks and it was up to the political leadership
to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
When the second round of talks came to end without an agreement
on March 18, a U.N. spokesman said that the two sides had achieved
"great progress," though no one specified what they agreed and
where the difference remained.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The long time sanctions have
crippled Iraqi economy and its people have suffered a lot of
hardships -- some 500,000 children died of malnutrition, flu and
bronchitis because of lacking food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 986 last April,
which allows Iraq to sell oil worth two billion dollars for six
months to import food, medicine and other necessities. But, Iraqi
authorities considered the monitoring provisions in the resolution
violated its sovereignty and refused to implement it until last
January.

<HEADLINE> World Bank To Help Nigeria's Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is trying to help
Nigeria create an enabling environment which will attract local
and foreign capital to support the expansion of services in the
power sector, a bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Trevor Byer, the world bank's resident representative in
Nigeria, said in the capital of Abuja today that the World Bank
has been involved in power generation project in the country in
support of government parastatals, and has given seven loans to
the power industry in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The bank's last on-going operation in the power sector would
end by December this year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the suspension of new lending for quite sometime, he
said the World Bank and the federal government of Nigeria have
had long discussions over the last two years on increasing the
efficiency of parastatals, focusing on reinforcing and supporting
the transmission infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> 400 Americans To Be Evacuated From War-torn Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- 400 Americans and dozens of
other foreigners are to be evacuated from the war-torn Monrovia
as from Wednesday, diplomatic sources in neighboring Sierra Leone
disclosed this evening.
</P>
<P>
"We are going ahead with the evacuation as the situation is
rapidly declining," one diplomat said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Already some 24 U.S. personnel including eight members with
the UN peace mission in Liberia were evacuated by helicopters to
Freetown today, where two US military Hercules transport planes
are standing by to fly the evacuees to Dakar, Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government in a statement released this
evening said that it has "received with great concern and
apprehension" the news of the resumption of hostilities in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the "news is all disturbing especially
coming at a time when all hopes of restoring durable peace" to
Liberia "had been heightened by the formation of the Liberian
Council of State."
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is particularly disturbed that violence,
indiscriminate killings, looting and massive destruction of
property have again broken," the statement went on.
</P>
<P>
It called on "all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint
and strictly adhere to the Abuja agreement by displaying a spirit of
give and take."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are reports that some 15,000 Liberians are
stranded near the Sierra Leone border at Clay Junction, some 20
miles near the border.
</P>
<P>
"There are fears for both their safety and security," one
Sierra Leone border guard told Xinhua on the telephone.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs to Release Three Muslim Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik said today the Serb authorities had decided to
release three Muslim prisoners of war as there were no proved
evidence of committing war crimes against them.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Michael Steiner, deputy to the international
community's High Representative to Bosnia Carl Bildt, Krajisnik
said he had voiced dissatisfaction with Steiner's statement that
the Serb side had not fulfilled the Dayton peace accords on the
release of pows.
</P>
<P>
"That was not the case and only technical difficulties had been
involved," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Steiner has said the Muslim and Croat sides had complied with
the peace agreement by releasing all prisoners of war but the Serb
side had failed to do so as it still held 16 pows whom the Serbs
said were war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
High Representative Bildt has said a decision would be made on
Wednesday on whether to allow the Serb side to attend the donors'
conference on Bosnian reconstruction in Brussels at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the Serb side had also lodged a protest with
Steiner because Muslim authorities had not released Serb Colonel
Aleksa Krsmanovic, although he had not been indicted by the Hague
war crimes tribunal, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Krsmanovic, who was extradited to the Hague early February, was
sent back to Sarajevo last week from the Hague after a lack of
evidence against him. The Muslim government has said to handle the
case with legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Branko Panic, the president of the Association of
Families of Imprisoned Soldiers of Serb state Republika Srpska,
said today that all three sides in Bosnia should release their
prisoners because tears of all mothers for their children are
equal.
</P>
<P>
The association had registered 1,301 soldiers believed to be
held in Muslim-Croat federation or Croatian prisons or murdered
during the war, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The fate of 807 civilians for whom the association has gathered
complete evidence is also uncertain, Panic said.
