SPARKS WINNING, BUT FEW SEEM TO CARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks were on some kind of
a roll that night. They came into the Forum having won 12
consecutive games. They were emerging as the story of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   They drew 4,416.
</P>
<P>
   In their fourth season of existence, the Sparks are winning like
never before but watching home attendance slide.
</P>
<P>
   They have one of the best-known players in the world in Lisa
Leslie, a local product from USC. They have the best record in the
league. They are the sister team to the NBA champions. They play in
the second-largest market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern California has largely responded with indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the WNBA's 16 teams are averaging less than the
6,570 the Sparks have averaged heading into tonight's final
regular-season home game against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later and the Sparks can't seem to find their niche
in the Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's frustrating,'' said team president Johnny Buss.
``As a promoter, you want to sell out every night. But as I've
maintained since we first started the Sparks, if you said we would
be able to average over 4,500 a game, I would think (we) were doing
a great job. That's what we're doing. I think we're doing a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, attendance is down for the fourth consecutive year.
Sparks home attendance has dropped 26 percent since they averaged
almost 9,000 per game in their inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum holds 17,505 for basketball but has been reconfigured
to hold 9,540 for the Sparks. Black drapes conceal all but the
first seven rows above the concourse, and tarps and giant
basketballs cover all concourse seats behind the baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with all the would-be facade, the Forum can seem an odd
place when a basketball game is played before just over 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome place to play,'' Leslie said. ``I love the
atmosphere. I just think it's unfortunate we don't have 10,000-plus
at every game. At certain times in here, it doesn't feel like there
are many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Meyers-Drysdale, the former UCLA and Olympic star, is a
network and Sparks color commentator. A veteran of women's
basketball and the Los Angeles sports scene, she labors to put the
Sparks' struggles into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer,'' Meyers-Drysdale said. ``Believe me,
I would love to see more fans at the games. I don't think it's a
knock at the Sparks. The team is doing their job, they're going out
and winning. Who knows, if they're to win the championship, are
people going to jump on the bandwagon?''
</P>
<P>
   Buss, the eldest of Lakers owner Jerry Buss' four children, said
that is exactly what it might take for the team to finally make its
mark in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It's often repeated that if you want to draw in Los Angeles, you
have to win, but Buss said it's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's just winning, it's winning a
championship,'' he said. ``It's solidifying that you are winners.
We've been close, but we've never really cracked that barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win a championship this year, then I would love to talk
to you about this next year when we're averaging a more substantial
number. I'm sure of it. If not, I would be extremely frustrated to
the point where I would have to throw up my arms and wonder, `Why?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Many, of course, do already.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA very much wants the Sparks to succeed in Los Angeles.
It made them one of the original eight teams. All WNBA teams are
owned by the NBA's 29 teams, which for the most part, share equally
in costs and revenues. Individual WNBA teams actually have
operating agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is loath to criticize one of its operators. Val
Ackerman, WNBA president, would not comment for this story,
relaying through a spokesman that she had nothing to add to
comments made earlier this month while at the Forum, when she told
the San Bernardino Sun:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think L.A. has the potential to be a great market for
women's pro basketball. I still believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are challenges in big cities like L.A. There are other
distractions competing for people's dollars. We're not a necessity.
Pro sports are a luxury and we're competing for people's
discretionary income and time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the fans of L.A. be more supportive. I
think they have a team that they should be proud of and should be
embracing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss said the Sparks recently signed a new 10-year agreement
with the WNBA and are in it for the long haul. The agreement,
however, can be revoked at any time by the WNBA if a team fails to
meet required quotas in attendance and promotional efforts. Buss
would not reveal the quotas but said they are to fend off drops,
not demand increases.
</P>
<P>
   When a report emerged that the Sparks were in danger of losing
their operating agreement if attendance didn't rebound, Buss said
he was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some extreme irresponsible reporting and
rumors,'' he said. ``I highly doubt that somebody in the echelon of
my father, that anyone would try to yank a franchise away from
Jerry Buss in a league he helped established. It is so ridiculous
to even think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when the reports came out, of course, I laughed. He
laughed. Anything's possible, but it sure is funny to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss' success with the Lakers, however, might well be one
of the reasons the Sparks have languished. The Lakers were an
instant success from the time he purchased them in 1979, and he has
never had to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a secret that Dr. Buss doesn't spend any money
marketing or promoting the Lakers,'' Meyers-Drysdale said. ``He
never has. It's not a knock, it's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that changes, it makes it very difficult for management.
They don't have the funds to promote and market the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of number of promotions, Johnny Buss said the Sparks
are actually one of the best-promoted teams in the league. But
other WNBA teams share much of the staff with their NBA brothers.
The Lakers have always had one of the thinnest front offices in the
league and there is less to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we've had their support,'' Buss said. ``But the
Lakers are one of the smallest NBA staffs in the league. So to be
able to pull resources from the Laker organization, the people just
aren't there. It's been very frustrating as compared to other
cities in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the ingredients would appear there for the Sparks to
develop a larger following _ the Washington Mystics are averaging
15,049 this season _ many suggest the biggest obstacle facing the
Sparks in L.A. is L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Buss said if you look at the struggles with the Raiders, Rams
and Clippers, the Sparks are doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet new teams can find their place quickly in Los Angeles.
Witness the L.A. Avengers of the Arena Football League. Twice
previously the AFL had failed in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But in their first season this year _ despite a late start over
a collective-bargaining agreement and a dismal 3-11 record that saw
them lose their first seven games _ the Avengers were a success at
the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers averaged 11,032 in their inaugural season at
Staples Center, higher than the league average of 9,618.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Wasserman, the Avengers owner and president, promoted the
team with what he called the biggest billboard campaign in Los
Angeles history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly know how hard it is find your place in L.A.,''
Wasserman said. ``In L.A., you have to get the people interested
and create a buzz. If you don't do that, it's hard to get people
excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame more people don't know about the Sparks. The
crowd awareness is not what it should be for what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss is hopeful the Sparks will move into Staples Center next
year and get an immediate attendance boost. He is also wishful that
the league will do away with the 6 p.m. starts for national cable
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you're P.T. Barnum or (WWF's Vince) McMahon or
any great promoter in the world,'' Buss said. ``They would all say
the league is chopping your head off. Six o'clock on a Friday night
in L.A. is death.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Michael Cooper remains ever hopeful things will
turn around and that this year's success in the standings will pay
dividends in attendance next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to win in L.A. to get the crowd to come out,'' Cooper
said. ``It's early still. People are still trying to grasp the
Sparks as a professional team in L.A., even though it's been in
existence for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the expression? If you build it, they will come. Well,
if you win, they'll come.''

NO SURPRISE: SALMON LOVES HITTING IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ Tim Salmon has no explanation for it, nor does
he care to have one. But Salmon, whether he's in a slump or not,
kills the Rangers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No opposing player in the majors has a higher batting average
(.432) or more RBI (43) at The Ballpark in Arlington than the
Anaheim Angels' Salmon. He entered the series slumping but went 6
for 13 with three homers and seven RBI in the three games,
including a three-run homer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Texas for the series, Salmon said he was
looking for something . . . anything . . . to get him going. Was
this it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' said Salmon, who is now hitting .269 with 21 homers
and 57 RBI. ``I'm looking for anything to give me some confidence.
. . . I don't really have an answer for it (his success in Texas).
All I can think of is that this ballpark has one of the best
hitter's backgrounds. You see the ball well here. Also, the
matchups. Guys I face here, I see them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, though, doesn't like to talk much about his success in
Texas. He doesn't want to jinx himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's like, 'Why bring it up?' '' he said. ``It's like
when a guy has a no-hitter going. You don't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Record tied: Third baseman Troy Glaus homered in his first
at-bat Wednesday, his team-leading 30th of the season, which tied
Doug DeCinces' 1982 mark for single-season homers by an Angels
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the homer, Glaus has struggled this month. He is hitting
only .188 (15 for 80) in July, and just .095 (2 for 21) on the road
trip, his season average dipping to .278.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said some might have become spoiled by
Glaus' hot start and expected too much. Glaus himself might be one
who expected too much, as he often slams his helmet and bat after a
strikeout or missed opportunity. But Scioscia said he doesn't think
Glaus is putting any undue pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything inside of Troy other than the
natural disappointment of not coming through in situations,''
Scioscia said. ``I don't think he's reached a level of frustration
to become concerned about. He's able to turn the page. It's why I
have the utmost confidence he'll be a key part of our run in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia added that he doesn't think pitchers are pitching Glaus
much differently than early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think he's getting pitches to hit,'' he said. ``Some
he's missed. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel here.''

STEVENS READY FOR COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens said
Wednesday morning he hoped to announce ``in the next 24 hours''
that he is coming out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who limped away from his career seven months ago at
Santa Anita, citing the pain in his arthritic right knee, had
declined recently to discuss indications he is preparing for a
comeback. But a few hours before Del Mar opened its 61st summer
season, Stevens sat on a bench outside the backstretch racing
office and spoke as if the decision to return to the saddle is all
but final.
</P>
<P>
   Before making it official, he said, he wants to put the knee
through some final rigorous tests in morning workouts. He has been
working out horses for several top trainers for about two months,
and said he took a leave from his job as assistant to Thoroughbred
Corp. trainer Alex Hassinger last weekend to concentrate on riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly up to me,'' Stevens said. ``I want to make sure
_ 100 percent sure _ the knee is going to hold up to race riding.''
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't want to do is launch a comeback only to call it
off after a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are going to be skeptics,'' he said. ``I want the
fans to know they're going to get their money's worth when I go out
there. I want to be 110 percent (healthy).''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he is generally fit, weighing 115 or 116 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 37 years old, and with the exception of the knee, I'm in
perfectly good health,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to change my
routine a little bit (if he returns to riding). There's going to
have to be a break in the middle of the year. Everybody needs a
break anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell people I'm cured of arthritis. It's
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the availability of insurance is not a factor in
his decision, as has been speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Kentucky Derby winner, elected to the Racing Hall
of Fame in 1997, has made no secret of his struggle to cope with
the premature end of his 20-year riding career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably took three months to where I accepted the
situation that I had a new future,'' said Stevens, who announced
his retirement abruptly in the middle of Santa Anita's opening-day
card Dec. 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had accepted it was over with. But then I noticed that doing
little menial things around the house, it wasn't having the same
(painful) effect as the last couple years. My ears perked up and I
thought, 'There's something going on here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if I could return to riding even at the same level
I was at the last couple of years, it would be a waste for me to be
sitting around at age 37.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who visited specialists last winter in hopes of finding
a remedy for his pain, said he thinks the knee has simply improved
with rest. Sitting on the bench Wednesday, he demonstrated he can
flex the knee fully, placing his right foot on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He has had his name, and that of agent Harry Hacek, listed in
the first Del Mar condition book of the meet. He said he worked
five horses Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wouldn't say when he might appear in a race. He has a
personal commitment out of town this weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, in the next 24 hours I'll have something to say,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's 43-day season began under an increasingly overcast
coastal sky with Corey Nakatani riding three winners and Bob
Baffert saddling three in front of a bigger-than-expected crowd of
31,494. Baffert is shooting for his fourth consecutive Del Mar
training title.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the last three races, including the $86,400 second
division of the Oceanside Stakes ($14.60) for 3-year-olds with
California-bred Stormy Jack and jockey Victor Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Nakatani teamed up with Flame Thrower to win the
afternoon's closely watched 2-year-old maiden race over High Tech
Exec and Godolphin Racing-owned Matta.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the faster, $86,900 first division of the Oceanside, a
1- mile turf race, went to favored Duke of Green ($5) and Chris
McCarron. Ron McAnally saddled the winner for owners Bob and
Beverly Lewis, who have given five horses to the Hall of Fame
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Duke of Green ran like a 2-3 shot should. That _ 2-3 _ is how
his odds appeared on the Del Mar tote board that showed signs of
dyslexia all day.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the only problem with the tote board: Its new beige
background made the numbers hard to read, and the installation of a
video screen left fans near the finish line without a payoffs
display.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was the third-largest in the history of the San Diego
County track founded by Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien in 1937. It
trailed the 44,181 who watched Dare and Go end Cigar's winning
streak at 16 in 1996, and the 34,697 who responded to a hats
giveaway on opening day in 1994.

UTILICORP UNITED ONE STEP CLOSER TO ACQUIRING TWO UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ UtiliCorp United Inc. cleared a huge hurdle in its
bid to buy two regional utilities Wednesday when it got the green
light from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to move ahead
with the acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted unanimously to allow UtiliCorp to move
ahead on its bids to buy Empire District Electric Co. for about
$800 million in stock, cash and assumed debt, and St. Joseph Light
&AMP; Power Co. for about $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said UtiliCorp must submit a revised competitive
analysis six months before joint operations can begin.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp still must gain regulatory approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission
and Missouri utility regulators for both acquisitions. Also, the
Empire acquisition will require approval from utility regulators in
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Empire, based in Joplin, Mo., sells electric power to about
145,000 customers in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. St.
Joseph Light &AMP; Power, based in St. Joseph, sells electric service
to about 66,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Once UtiliCorp completes the mergers, it will have about 460,000
electric customers and gas customers.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp spokesman George Minter said the company hopes to
complete both acquisitions by the end of the year.

   Then, what's this? The next day at work your boss walks up and _
pick one:
</P>
<P>
   Hands you a check for $100.
</P>
<P>
   Tells you to take tomorrow off.
</P>
<P>
   Leads a kazoo chorus of co-workers humming ``For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow'' and leaves a balloon bouquet at your desk.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly slips you a handwritten thank-you note.
</P>
<P>
   Enters your name in the company's monthly drawing for a
Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Gives you a $100 gift certificate to spend at the regional
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaims over the loudspeaker that it's Your Day and gives you
a nice golf shirt with the company logo discreetly embroidered on
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Which would you prefer?
</P>
<P>
   Survey after workplace survey finds different preferences among
employees. Some, often because of cultural differences or just
plain shyness, would rather sink through the floor than be publicly
recognized. For others, moments of public recognition become the
highlights of their work lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers crave a freebie day off. Others moan that they'd
just go home and catch up on housework and lawn mowing _ and what
kind of a reward is that?
</P>
<P>
   Some would grab the $100 and enjoy a surprise shopping spree for
something special. Others say a cash prize is here today and gone
tomorrow in the bill-paying rush, and there's no lasting memory of
the job well done.
</P>
<P>
   Some wouldn't mind taking the chance for delayed gratification
on a company-sponsored cruise. Others think that it falls short if
the reward isn't here and now, especially if there's a chance
they'll never get it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some like company merchandise because of the camaraderie it
fosters. Others would rather pass on the logo stuff for a lot of
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One reward that doesn't always show up on incentive preference
surveys _ possibly because many of the surveys are sponsored by
companies that have some /{thing/} to sell _ is the handwritten
thank-you note. But rewards and recognition gurus say it's the best
thank-you tool there is.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saw on the management training and motivational
circuit that says employees join companies but leave managers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if workers don't feel appreciated by the people
they report to, they're unhappy and likely to leave (or, at the
very least, spend a lot of time grousing).
</P>
<P>
   A simple thank-you note from the boss (or bosses) is, time and
again, the most appreciated reward. Simple, yet in some ways the
hardest thing to get on the laundry list of possible rewards. A lot
of bosses can't and won't take the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that some workers couldn't care less about a
thank-you note from their managers. So how does anyone know what
the right, best reward is?
</P>
<P>
   There's another old saw on the management training and
motivational circuit that says if you want to know what your
employees want, all you have to do is ask.

DODGERS REACQUIRE VALDES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers can fire the team president
and rehire him two months later _ a la Bob Graziano last fall _
reacquiring a pitcher the organization spent a year bad-mouthing
for a playoff push is doable.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers answered Arizona's acquisition of Curt Schilling by
getting right-hander Ismael Valdes and cash Wednesday from the
Chicago Cubs for minor-leaguers Jamie Arnold and Jorge Piedra.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, 26, spent the first six seasons of his career with the
Dodgers before being traded with Eric Young to the Cubs for pitcher
Terry Adams and two minor-leaguers in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers questioned Valdes' toughness and heart last season,
and Cubs management quickly did the same. Valdes opened the season
on the disabled list with soreness in his a shoulder and has missed
starts with a hamstring injury and a recurring blister problem, but
he's been healthy for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in this environment, with the bullpen we've got now
and the offense we've got, he's in position to succeed,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I think last year it seemed
like he didn't get the run support. He should have won more than
nine games last year. We didn't trade him because he wasn't
effective. It was a financial move that enabled us to go out and
get some other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we felt like the acquisition didn't mortgage the future.
It kept the future intact and we got a guy to help us down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA in 12 starts for the Cubs, but
his reputation lowered the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope Valdes pitches more like the guy who went 61-54
with a 3.38 ERA in 176 games in Los Angeles _ but with a more
team-oriented approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than it was before because now the players
get involved,'' Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``I want
some Christmas money (from the playoffs). To have a guy that has
great stuff and the potential to be a 20-game winner is not a bad
deal. It's a matter of him going out and putting it on the line for
his teammates. You have to put it on the line for your teammates
and forget about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is owed approximately $2 million of the $5.8 million
contract he signed before the season, but the Cubs will pay
$500,000 of that. Valdes is a free agent after the season, and
though he said he would think about re-signing with the Dodgers,
it's not on his mind now. The Dodgers won't discuss a contract
extension now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be back home with my old teammates,'' Valdes
said. ``They have the power hitters, a good lineup, a good bullpen.
They have everything a championship team needs. It's a great team.
I'm very excited to be part of the pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers said otherwise publicly, they were concerned
about using rookie Eric Gagne during the pennant race. He'll be
sent to Triple-A Albuquerque after he starts today in Colorado, a
team source said. He's 1-6 with a 5.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cubs are in Philadelphia, Valdes will join the Dodgers
when they arrive there to open a three-game series Friday. Manager
Davey Johnson said he hasn't decided when Valdes will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a pennant race,'' Johnson said. ``To me, it's a lot
tougher to pitch when you're not in one than when you're in one. I
know how (Valdes) can turn it up a notch. I've seen it, and when he
does that, there aren't many better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to get involved in the Schilling sweepstakes
late Tuesday, but they couldn't compete with the package the
Diamondbacks put together (pitchers Omar Daal, Nelson Figueroa and
Vicente Padilla and first baseman/outfielder Travis Lee). Also,
Schilling didn't want to play in Los Angeles and could reject a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Team sources said Malone talked briefly to Cubs president and
general manager Andy MacPhail on Tuesday, but discussions didn't
heat up until Wednesday afternoon. The trade went quickly because
the Dodgers are familiar with Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a 26-year-old right-hander, was 4-7 with a 5.07 ERA in
13 starts for Triple-A Albuquerque and he appeared in two games for
the Dodgers with a 4.05 ERA. Piedra, 21, is an outfielder who was
batting .283 with six homers and 52 RBI in 92 games at Class A Vero
Beach.

 MICROSOFT: SUPREME COURT SHOULDN'T REVIEW CASE  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft asked the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday to step aside
and let an appellate court that once ruled in its favor hear its
appeal of a court-ordered breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed with the high court, the world's No. 1 software
maker said the ``morass'' of factual, legal and procedural issues
in the case necessitate a review by the Washington, D.C., Circuit
Court of Appeals, rather than the Supreme Court, which usually does
not like to delve into factual analysis of any given case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case in which the court should exercise its
discretion to hear a direct appeal, thereby undertaking the onerous
task of sifting through a large and complex record and forgoing the
many benefits of intermediate appellate review,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company's appeal of a federal judge's breakup order
normally would proceed to the appellate court, the Department of
Justice and 19 states that sued the company for violations of the
Sherman Antitrust Act are employing a rarely used 1974 law that
allows cases of national importance to skip that step.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the measure would expedite the process, but
most legal scholars believe the government is trying to leapfrog a
court potentially friendly to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a panel of three judges from the federal appellate
court in Washington overturned Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
order that had required Microsoft to give computer manufacturers
the option of installing a version of the company's Windows
operating system stripped of its Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said its response to Wednesday's brief
will be contained in its filing, which is not due until August 15.
The Supreme Court could decide whether or not to take the case as
early as September.
</P>
<P>
   The round of legal filings is the latest in a pitched, two-year
battle between Microsoft and the federal government, which accused
Microsoft of using its monopoly in the operating systems market to
crush its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, Jackson ordered the company carved in two.
</P>
<P>
   The order also called for curbs on the company's business
practices and required the company to reveal parts of the Windows
``source code.''
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Microsoft insists Jackson made numerous errors in
the case and said it would be proper for the appellate court to
hear it first.
</P>
<P>
   And the appeals court appears eager to comply. Less than an hour
after Microsoft filed its notice of appeal, the court said seven
jurists would immediately hear the case, rather than the
traditional three-member review panel.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies Microsoft's biggest advantage, said one lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court doesn't usually explore the nitty gritty
aspects of the cases it hears. Since the appellate court does, and
has experience with Microsoft, some believe the justices will defer
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing scares the Supreme Court more than factual analysis,''
said Chicago antitrust lawyer Hillard Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   One of the weaker arguments contained in Microsoft's brief,
according to another lawyer, centers on Jackson's behavior outside
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Several times within the 30-page filing, Microsoft cited
Jackson's interviews with the media as an example of one of the
many issues it would explore in its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In a Wall Street Journal article, Jackson explained why he
didn't allow for more than one day of hearings on the breakup plan:
``(I)t is procedurally unusual to do what Microsoft is proposing _
are you aware of very many cases in which the defendant can argue
with the jury about what an appropriate sanction should be? Were
the Japanese allowed to propose the terms of their surrender? The
government won the case.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft's brief, ``the district court's blunt
comments to the press raise serious questions about its
impartiality and betray a misguided belief that apellees were
entitled to the remedy of their choice, no matter how extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer Rich Gray said
attacking Jackson may backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court agrees with Microsoft (about Jackson's
behavior), they might want to take the case immediately,'' he said.

JUDGE RULES CALIFORNIA PRESS, PUBLIC ENTITLED TO WITNESS
ALL  STAGES OF LETHAL INJECTION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BILL WALLACE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a victory for the media, a federal judge has ruled that the
press and public in California are entitled to witness the entire
process of executing a condemned inmate by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling filed Friday and made public Wednesday, District
Court Judge Vaughn Walker issued an injunction that effectively
forces the state Department of Corrections to allow public
witnesses to watch from the time the injection equipment is
attached to the inmate until a doctor pronounces death.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said prison officials had exaggerated potential security
problems when they adopted regulations to keep curtains drawn while
an inmate is being prepared and the needle inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Terhune, director of the California Department of
Corrections, could not be reached last night for comment on
Walker's ruling, and the department issued no official statement
about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The California First Amendment Coalition, which, along with the
Society of Professional Journalists, sued the department over its
restrictive regulation, called the judge's decision ``gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very good news,'' said Terry Francke, general
counsel for the coalition, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that
monitors governmental incursions on freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that Judge Walker not only responded to the
arguments that our attorneys made, but even took them a step
further ... by finding that there is an affirmative constitutional
interest in having the media able to view an entire execution as
witnesses on behalf of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Schlosser, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union who argued against the prison department's rules during the
trial before Walker, also hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Walker not only found that the department had
exaggerated the potential security risks involved in allowing the
injection procedure to be witnessed, but that one of the
department's motivations was its concern that the public might have
an adverse reaction to the use of violent force to restrain an
inmate for injection,'' Schlosser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ruled, in essence, that part of the reason for the
regulation was nothing but censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed after prison
officials instituted their restrictive regulation before the
execution of ``Freeway Killer'' William Bonin in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The rule _ Regulation 770, as it is known _ allowed prison
staffers to strap Bonin to a gurney and begin the flow of lethal
drugs before they opened a curtain that allowed him to be seen by
the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials justified the restriction by saying that media
descriptions of the beginning of the executions would make it
possible for other prisoners to identify and retaliate against
prison staffers involved in the preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Professional Journalists sued, arguing that the
rule was unconstitutional, as it prevented the press, acting as a
surrogate for the general public, from witnessing the entirety of
the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Walker issued a summary judgment for the society in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His original ruling was overturned after the department appealed
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. In
reversing Walker, the appellate court found that prison officials'
security needs outweighed the First Amendment right of public
access.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment Coalition joined with the society in asking
the Ninth Circuit for a rehearing of the case. After reviewing its
earlier findings, the appellate panel sent the case back to Walker
for trial on the narrow issue of whether the Department of
Corrections had accurately portrayed the security risks.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, Walker concluded the department had clearly
overstated the risks in order to justify barring press access to
executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ensuring staff safety is a legitimate safety concern,'' Walker
wrote in his opinion, ``(but) execution team members' identities
have not in the past ever been revealed by the media, nor have
there been any acts of retaliation or threats against any execution
workers. ... The court concludes that defendants' practice of
limiting witness observation during lethal injection executions is
an exaggerated response to defendants' security concerns.''

 HOUSE OKS CONTINUED FUNDS FOR AIDS CARE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted unanimously Wednesday to renew the
Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act,
including a funding formula change that promises to reduce San
Francisco's share of the $1.6 billion now spent on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, calls for a gradual shift over five
years to focus on HIV infections rather than full-blown AIDS cases.
The bill also would change the funding formula in an attempt to
shift funds to areas where the disease is rising. The current AIDS
CARE act will expire on September 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also passed, by unanimous consent, legislation that
would increase spending to combat international AIDS and
tuberculosis epidemics. It was sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Ryan White formula, San Francisco receives
approximately twice as much money per AIDS case, roughly $5,000 a
year, as other cities, including Oakland, even as the path of the
epidemic has spread across the country and shifted to heterosexual
demographic groups, particularly women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS groups in San Francisco warned that the formula shift could
slash San Francisco's Ryan White funds by as much as 25 percent in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., voted for the overall bill, but
strongly objected to the formula change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As advocates for people living with the disease, we should be
emphasizing that the solution to the continuing AIDS crisis is to
increase overall funding rather than to redistribute existing
dollars,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn predicted that rapidly rising federal funding for the
Ryan White money that goes to cities _ which has increased by an
annual average rate of 24 percent since 1991 _ will continue, so
that San Francisco could wind up with no absolute cut in funds,
even as its share of the total falls.
</P>
<P>
   Local AIDS groups sharply disagreed, saying funding would have
to double over the next five years for San Francisco to stay even.
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS activists applauded some of the changes in the House
bill, particularly the focus on tracking HIV rather than AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Dison, spokesman for AIDS Action, said his group's policy
committee ``said some years ago that we want to see a shift to HIV
data rather than AIDS data.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Driscoll, national AIDS policy adviser for the Log Cabin
Republicans, a gay group, said the House measure would ``upgrade
prevention, improve accountability and attempts to make Ryan White
programs more responsive to minorities and women as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said that when the Ryan White law was enacted a decade
ago, San Francisco was the center of the AIDS epidemic, so the law
``was written in a way that was very favorable to San Francisco.
That becomes very difficult to maintain as a broader and broader
constituency nationally has to be served by the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill contains a smaller formula change
that would have less of an effect on San Francisco's funding.

 THRILL IS GONE, YET CONVENTIONS CARRY ON  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a time, not so many years ago, when
political nominating conventions could be thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Democrats meeting in Chicago went to a third ballot
before settling on Adlai Stevenson as their nominee. In 1968,
Hubert Humphrey captured the nomination in the same city without
having entered a primary. In 1988, Vice President George Bush
stunned delegates in New Orleans with his mid-convention selection
of Dan Quayle as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, as Republicans meet in Philadelphia, the biggest
uncertainty is whether Monday Night Football's 49ers-Patriots
exhibition game will end in time for retired Gen. Colin Powell's
opening night address.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned suspense that once made the conventions a
rewarding _ if not riveting _ summertime tradition is now gone. But
the stakes are no different for George W. Bush in Philadelphia, or
Al Gore in Los Angeles two weeks later, than they were for
Stevenson, Humphrey or Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   To have a shot at becoming president, the candidates still must
rally their party's faithful and capture the imagination of the
nation during a fleeting moment when it is paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, that means taking command of his father's party and
displaying the substance behind his rallying cry of ``compassionate
conservatism.'' For Gore, it means unifying the pro-trade and
pro-labor wings of his party and stepping out from the shadow of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, it is the single best time _ even if voters
only catch snatches of headlines or glimpses in between turning
channels _ to show off their candidates and define what they stand
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions provide a focal point for the campaign,'' said
Allan Lichtman, professor of political history at American
University in Washington, D.C. ``It awakens people to the fact that
there is a campaign going on _ and it may be the candidate's last
free shot to define himself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a task made more challenging by the lack of drama and the
growing apathy of the viewing public. Convention planners find
themselves in a Catch-22; the more they package their events for
television, the less spontaneous they become, and the less TV is
interested in covering them.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that a political version of ``Survivor,'' where
candidates are left on a rat-infested island and voted off one by
one, or a return to the old days of discord and uncertainty, would
draw higher ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does anyone dispute that the modern system of primaries and
caucuses _ which relegate the conventions to a ceremonial role of
rubber-stamping the voters' choices _ produce a more democratic
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated moment will come on the final nights, when
Bush and Gore deliver their acceptance speeches. Each of the major
networks, reluctant to give up more than an hour of prime time
during the previous three nights, is committed to showing the
speeches in their entirety, making them almost certainly the most
widely viewed addresses of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches are generally months in the making, and often leave
lasting impressions.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1992 that Clinton defined his modern populism,
concluding his speech by saying he ``still believes in a place
called Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bush's father gave a speech that most acknowledge as
the turning point in his crusade to be seen as more than President
Ronald Reagan's vice president, in which he declared that the
nation needed someone experienced and able in the Oval Office, then
thundered: ``I am that man.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1964 acceptance speech given by Barry Goldwater at the GOP
convention in the Cow Palace included his most memorable line:
``Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice. Moderation in the
pursuit of justice is no virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will do what they can to lure viewers for the first
three nights. In 1996, Democrats scheduled a prime time speech by
paralyzed actor Christopher Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   This Republicans are looking to accommodate shorter attention
spans, replacing many speeches with fast-paced video clips, live
bands and an array of nonpolitical speakers ranging from breast
cancer survivors to a blind mountain climber. Prime-time speaking
slots will go only to top names such as Arizona Sen. John McCain
and Powell.
</P>
<P>
   GOP convention planners have given each night a theme aimed at
promoting Bush. But the titles ``Opportunity with a Purpose: Leave
no Child Behind,'' and ``Strength and Security with a Purpose: Safe
in our Homes and in the World,'' among others, will probably do
little to interest viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, if you want the most exciting conventions, those
days have passed us by,'' said Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for
the GOP affair. ``The idea is to share our energy and enthusiasm,
and to try to energize the grassroots.''
</P>
<P>
   The aura of excitement that once surrounded conventions has
diminished every four years since 1972, when primaries and caucuses
replaced party bosses and backroom maneuvering as the way nominees
got elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age of action and drama, and there is precious little
action and drama,'' Lichtman said. ``TV stations are less
interested in crafted events.''
</P>
<P>
   From a high of 50 hours of coverage in the 1952 conventions _
the first covered by television _ networks are scaling back to
about an hour per night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my work cut out for me,'' said J.C. Watts, the
Republican representative from Oklahoma who once enjoyed millions
of followers during his career as a quarterback at Oklahoma
University and in Canada, but now will be lucky to be seen during
the halftime of Monday night's NFL exhibition opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in San Francisco and you want to see a `Seinfeld'
rerun or Andy Griffith, or J.C. Watts emceeing the opening night of
the GOP convention, it's probably not close,'' Watts said. ``Hey,
if I wasn't in Philadelphia, I'd probably be watching Andy
Griffith.''
</P>
<P>
   The army of journalists at next week's convention _ there will
be more than seven for each of the GOP's 2,066 delegates _ make it
inevitable that at least some of the party's message gets out.
</P>
<P>
   But what if they threw a convention and no one watched?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising answer is that the speeches would still be
delivered, the delegates would still hoot and holler, and the
balloons would still drop from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious attempts by both parties to brainwash the
public into supporting their candidate, the quadrennial affairs are
also intended to fire up their own loyalists. ``There is an
audience that you absolutely must reach, and those are the members
of the party,'' said California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who along with
Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been named co-chair of the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions rev up the grassroots,'' she said. ``They fire up
the people who are already paying attention and signal the
beginning of the campaign to everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most faithful cable-television devotees will only catch
a small glimpse of the politicking, caucusing, schmoozing and
partying that goes on in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Most state delegations will hold daily meetings to discuss party
business, debate disagreements and hear from rising party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions offer a way to solidify support behind the nominee
and hopefully emerge as a unified party,'' said Gerry Parsky, chair
of the California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solidifying our Republican base is important,'' Parsky said.
``One way to do it is to gather all supporters and the nominee
together. If we leave the convention energized, we return to
California with enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez Democrat Tim Farley, who has been a delegate to three
conventions, said the events ``may not be thrilling like they used
to be, but they energize the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley remembers no one seemed to be paying attention to the
1992 election before the Democrats met in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speeches were made, the balloons came down, and everyone
went home believing we have a purpose,'' Farley said. ``And
suddenly Clinton/Gore buttons started popping up on people in the
supermarket.''

THREE ATTEMPT BREAKOUT AT SAN QUENTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANGELICA PENCE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN _ Three Death Row inmates broke through a chain link
fence at San Quentin Prison last week and threatened several guards
before they were subdued, an incident that correctional officers
said poses serious safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
deteriorating security at San Quentin has put their lives in
danger, and they accused state corrections officials of doing
little about it.
</P>
<P>
   San Quentin officials briefly discussed the incident only after
being contacted by The Chronicle and, even then, played it down.
</P>
<P>
   At San Quentin, spokeswoman Patricia Blanson said the prison is
not classifying it as an escape attempt and said it was not deemed
worthy of publicizing after it happened.
</P>
<P>
   However, several San Quentin guards interviewed by The
Chronicle, along with a representative of the powerful California
Correctional Peace Officers Association, said the July 18 incident
was the most serious of its kind since so-called ``Soledad
Brother'' George Jackson's fatal attempt to flee the prison in
August 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, six inmates were eventually tried for killing
three guards. Last week's incident happened in the same part of the
prison as the 1971 escape attempt involving Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Even though last week's prisoners were eventually subdued, the
incident highlighted guards' growing complaints that the state
Department of Corrections is failing to give them the kind of
security they say they need in dealing with an increasingly violent
criminal population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one just came too close,'' one San Quentin guard said of
the midday incident. ``It's got us all shook up. We have serious
security problems here, and they're just not being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the time, our officers labor under a correctional
management oppression rather than support,'' said Jeffrey Thompson,
a lobbyist for the Peace Officers Association. ``If you ask
soldiers to volunteer for the war, you don't ignore their needs for
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Margot Bach
said she could not comment on the incident or on the union's
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Much of last week's escape attempt was detailed in a two-page
Department of Corrections incident report, a copy of which was
obtained by The Chronicle. Blanson confirmed the existence of the
report, but did not offer any more details than it contained.
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened shortly after noon on July 18, when a
group of condemned inmates, identified as gang members, unraveled a
four-foot section of a chain link fence along the so-called ``Crip
Yard,'' an exercise yard named for the prison gang. It is located
near the Adjustment Center, which houses more than 100 of the
prison's most dangerous and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   An officer named D. Cordona noticed the gash in the fence around
12:30 p.m., according to the prison report. The opening gave the
inmates access to a walkway guards use to escort handcuffed inmates
to and from the Adjustment Center, correctional sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Frank Cerecedes immediately ordered Cordona to sound the
portable alarm guards carry for just this purpose, summoning about
60 officers from throughout the prison. But those officers were far
away.
</P>
<P>
   A second guard, Sgt. Ken McLean, grabbed a 37mm gun that fires
wooden blocks, each one about 1.5 inches thick. He aimed it at the
inmates from a nearby building, Blanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lt. Cerecedes ran to the back door of the unit,'' the report
said, while McLean, his stun gun at the ready, ``took a defensive
stance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerecedes then ordered that part of the prison locked down,
trapping the inmates inside the walkway and away from most of the
prison staff. But it was still not over.
</P>
<P>
   To the guards' astonishment, the three inmates _ convicted
murderers Paul Tuilaepa, Tiequon Cox and Noel Jackson all cq &LR; _
rushed through the hole in the fence, several feet away from them
and lunged toward Officer Marcie Mann and Officer W. Whitlow.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuilaepa closed in on Mann, McLean fired a volley of
wooden bullets and hit him in the left shoulder blade. The
remaining inmates stumbled over Tuilaepa, who had collapsed
facedown on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lt. Cerecedes and Sgt. McLean shouted commands for the ...
inmates to remain on the ground,'' the report said, ``and for the
inmates to back up to the breach in the fence line and return back
onto Yard No. 3, where they could be secured and observed in a
controlled area.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one was killed in last week's near break,
correctional officers said in interviews that waning safety
standards, budget constraints and fear of lawsuits are endangering
the lives of the more than 1,500 correctional officers, support
staff and volunteers who work at the infamous Northern California
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of thing shouldn't be happening,'' said the officer.
The inmates ``came very, very close to holding one of us hostage.
They're condemned men. They have zero to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers said the incident probably could have been avoided if
the damaged fence had been replaced _ something San Quentin
corrections officers say they have repeatedly requested. Workers
were called out to San Quentin this week to measure for a new fence
only after the escape attempt, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanson said late Wednesday that San Quentin's warden was
notified of the staff's requests to fix the aging fence and had
just received funding approval from Sacramento to make the repairs
when the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
   And late Wednesday, Blanson confirmed that there had been a
recent escape attempt by two Russian prisoners who were caught by
guards. The inmates were carrying a map of the Bay Area.

HEALTHY SHAW WANTS JOB BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ There's been no declaration, but after his sixth
scoreless appearance since returning from the disabled list Jeff
Shaw said he should be the closer of the Los Angeles Dodgers again.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he's pitching as he did in his most successful years,
and the shoulder weakness and elbow tendinitis that plagued him
during his rocky spell are no longer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he's gained confidence after throwing 1 innings for a
save July 17 against Pittsburgh, recording the save in a 5-4 win
Friday against San Francisco and with the save in Tuesday's 6-4 win
against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's enough to say that I'm throwing the ball well
enough to earn my job back,'' said Shaw, who has 148 career saves.
``It's not like I've been a closer only for a couple of years. I've
been doing this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has gone with a
closer-by-committee system since late May, when Shaw was at the
height of his difficulties and the low point of his health. He went
on the disabled list June 28 and was activated after the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Shaw has three saves and Mike Fetters has two saves.
Shaw has allowed four hits in 5 innings and hasn't yielded a run.
Fetters has allowed three hits in five innings with yielding a run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't said either way if Shaw has his closer's role
back or if he'll go with a combination of Shaw and Fetters. But
he's maintained all along the Dodgers need Shaw to return to form
if they're going to remain in playoff contention. Shaw blew seven
of his first 19 saves chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of a weak shoulder, a bad elbow that time
was giving me a lack of command,'' Shaw said. ``It all goes back to
having arm strength, confidence and being out there on a regular
basis. I've told (Johnson) to just use me. (Reds manager) Jack
(McKeon) did the same thing. Jack would use me and use me and use
me until I told him, `That's enough, I can't do it any more.'
Davey's been very good about giving me time off. I told him I feel
better when I pitch more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Being Curt: The long-term ramifications of the Arizona
Diamondbacks trading for right-hander Curt Schilling could be
catastrophic to the Dodgers' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over yet,'' Johnson said. ``I know it's a good move
for them. Schilling is starting to throw the ball like he did
(before the surgery).''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers should benefit from the trade in the short term.
Schilling, regaining his form after missing the first few months of
the season because of shoulder surgery, was supposed to start when
the Dodgers opened a three-game series in Philadelphia. Instead, it
will be lefty Omar Daal, one of the four players the Phillies
acquired for Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Daal is 2-10 with a 7.22 ERA and was bumped out of the
Diamondbacks rotation. He hasn't started since July 2. Daal's last
three appearances were in relief.

GROWING MONEY DEALS CREATE MEMORABILIA MANIA

 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The first National Sports Collectors
Convention (NSCC) in 1980 was held in half of a banquet room at a
hotel near LAX. There weren't many card dealers back in 1980, so
basically it was a gathering of collectors selling and trading
their duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   When the NSCC was held in Anaheim in 1991, the hobby had become
a modern-day gold rush. The Anaheim Convention Center was swamped
by collectors seeking free promotional cards and giveaways from
dozens of card and memorabilia companies. Lines circling the
facility rivaled those at nearby Disneyland. By show's end, more
than 100,000 people had attended.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st annual NSCC returns to the Anaheim Convention Center
this week, and it once again has morphed into something entirely
different. Visitors to the show will find more diversity in
collectibles, discover new ways to collect, and see prices for
high-end material that rival player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Honus Wagner tobacco card once owned by Bruce
McNall and Wayne Gretzky recently sold to an Orange County man for
$1.1 million ($1.27 million after consignors fees). It will be on
display at the show as part of a display by Newport Beach-based Pro
Sports Authenticators (PSA), the largest card-grading company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market keeps changing, which is part of any business,''
said Mike Berkus, this year's show director and co-promoter of the
first NSCC. He's been a part of every locally based national. ``The
'91 show was the first where dealers actually sold packs of cards
and that was considered novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The grading of cards is one of the more notable topics in the
hobby, the others being the Internet, memorabilia and autographs:
</P>
<P>
   __ Grading: PSA is owned and operated by the same people who
introduced grading to coin collecting. While it remains a
controversial topic from the credibility of those doing the grading
to its impact on card values it has been grudgingly accepted by the
hobby. PSA officials expect to grade 20,000 cards this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Grading establishes a premium on cards that are in the best
possible shape. This premium has always existed, but grading
assigns it a number PSA grades on a 1-to-10 basis
</P>
<P>
   puts it in a plastic case and allows companies to keep track of
how many high-grade cards exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grading has given the hobby a shot in the arm,'' said longtime
collector/dealer Carson Ritchey, a regular dealer at a warehouse
show in Walnut Wednesday evenings and Saturdays. ``But it deletes
the kids who might want to collect. It's turned it into an adult
game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Internet: The Internet has been a boon to a majority of
dealers and collectors. Many dealers now have their own Web sites
to sell product, which has proven more cost-efficient than
periodical or direct-mail advertising. Many wholesalers now have a
place to presell new product and move extra inventory, and buyers
are no longer restricted to local shows or card shops in searching
for a particular card or set.
</P>
<P>
   The down side of Net auctions is a realization that the Beckett
price guide is inflated and the opportunity for wholesalers to
flush slow-moving product, which hurts singles, pack and box sales
for card-store owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since dealing on the Internet got hot, my sales of singles has
dropped 65 percent, and packs by 20 percent,'' said Bryon Walters,
who owns his own memorabilia shop, Squeeze Play, in Tustin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Autographs: A recent crackdown on forgeries, which included a
claim by investigators that up to 90 percent of all autographed
material is forged, seriously set this part of the hobby back.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbyists say that claim was inflated. Regardless, collectors
are now seeking greater authenticity of items and sending them to
autograph experts for confirmation. At the same time, it has fueled
an increase in sales of certified memorabilia by companies and
licensees who have exclusive deals with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Memorabilia: With the overproduction and grading of cards and
concerns about autographs, more attention is being given to other
unique memorabilia, like tickets from major events and game-used
jerseys and bats.

 JUDGE ORDERS NAPSTER TO STOP MUSIC TRADING  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Handing the recording industry a resounding
victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a
preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service
to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected all of
Napster's legal arguments and ruled that the program is primarily a
conduit for ``wholesale infringing'' of copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who
use the Internet program to trade free music with each other.
</P>
<P>
   And officials with the San Mateo startup claim the ruling could
be a death blow to its fledgling business because, it said, its
program cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs.
</P>
<P>
   Napster executives said they will appeal as early as Thursday to
keep Napster online. The company's high-powered defense attorney
David Boies said Napster will have to shut down the service if a
higher court does not grant a stay of the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised and disappointed,'' Napster's interim CEO
Hank Barry said moments after the verdict. ``We understand the
ruling and the basis for it, but we disagree with it. We do not
believe Napster users are acting illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   Patel issued her much-anticipated ruling at the end of a 21/2
hour hearing. The judge's small courtroom was packed, and more than
150 lawyers, journalists, online music company executives and
Napster fans had to watch the proceedings on closed circuit
television in an adjoining courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's ruling is historic because it sets the tone for how the
established entertainment industries deal with the increasing
problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster.
Already, other programs like Gnutella, Freenet and Scour have
extended the Napster ``peer-to-peer'' file-sharing concept to
digital pictures and first-run movies. The same idea could be used
to swap electronic books and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will pave the way for the future of online
music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording
Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the
top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The quick rise of the Napster program, originally written by a
19-year-old college student, Shawn Fanning, alarmed the $40 billion
U.S. recording industry. Napster estimates there are 20 million
users of the program, first released in August 1999. Once
considered a fad among teens and college students, Napster has now
also become popular with people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Napster user Hidehiro Beppu, 21, studying math at the University
of California at Berkeley, was also disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bogus. Napster doesn't do anything. It's like people
copying music on tapes and giving it to friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software links users to various servers run by
Napster Inc. People can easily search for any MP3-formated song
stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users. When
selected, the songs are copied from one computer to another.
</P>
<P>
   This vast ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing network has the ability
to find almost any recorded song in the world, from the latest
Britney Spears top-10 pop hit to an obscure 19th century folk song.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry complained that the ability to download
free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and
distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the
musical world. The Recording Industry Association of America
estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in
lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   A new study released Wednesday by online research firm Jupiter
Communications Inc. called Napster ``the definitive killer
application for the online music industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Russell Frackman, representing the
recording companies, said Napster would grow to 75 million users
downloading billions of songs by the end of the year if left
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement
that has ever existed,'' Frackman said. ``The longer this goes on,
the more impossible it will be for us and, we believe, for the
court, to do anything realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's defense team headed by Boies, who led the U.S.
government's recent successful antitrust prosecution of Microsoft,
relied on legal precedents set by previous court decisions that
allowed VCR owners to copy movies. Napster also said it is
protected by provisions of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act and
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Patel, however, flatly rejected those arguments, saying e-mail
messages by Napster's own founders admit the program was designed
to share ``pirated'' versions of copyright-protected songs.
</P>
<P>
   She also shot down Napster's contention that the program, even
if used for illegal purposes, could be spared because there were
some legal ``fair use'' applications such as a promotional vehicle
for unknown new artists.
</P>
<P>
   That argument appeared ``late, after the beginning of this
litigation,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's injunction, intended to prevent any more damage to the
recording industry until after the suit goes to trial, orders
Napster to prevent members from swapping songs controlled by the
record companies that filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Boies argued that the injunction is unfair to Napster because
technicians have not devised a way to separate which songs are
legal. Patel said the injunction will force them to come up with a
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created the monster; I guess that's the consequences they
face,'' Patel said.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock band Metallica, was especially
pleased by the ruling. Metallica drew the ire of its fans by filing
its own suit against Napster for allowing the band's songs to be
freely swapped.
</P>
<P>
   With Napster, ``the right of what happens to my music was taken
away from me,'' Ulrich said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the challenge ``is to make people in this country
understand that because technology make it available and because
the Internet gives you access to it, that doesn't mean you have a
right to it''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the ruling gives the recording industry a
clear copyright enforcement victory. But other file sharing
programs like Gnutella that are not controlled by any one company
are going to be harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liability issue against Napster was very clear,'' said
Brian Mudge, partner at Kenyon &AMP; Kenyon in Wash. DC, specializing
in intellectual property cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a whole different ballgame to enforce and
police. The record industry will have to embrace this technology
before it loses total control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of a court-ordered Napster shutdown
looming, Napster fans had already started moving to other
file-sharing programs such as Gnutella, iMesh and Scour, which is
also the subject of another copyright infringement suit by the
motion picture industry.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like  &UR; www.angrycoffee.com  &LR; offer more alternatives,
while  &UR; http://opennap.sourceforge.net  &LR; offers links through outside
servers in case Napster is forced to shut down its own servers.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ From the dugout, Frank Catalanotto watches
the game like a manager, anticipating his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Innings pass, pitchers come and go, the lineups turn over.
Catalanotto thinks ahead, two or three moves ahead, because to him,
there's no such thing as going to the plate without a plan _
especially when you're a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Called on again in that role last night, the Rangers' reserve
second baseman tripled with one out in the ninth inning and scored
on Rusty Greer's two-out single to left as Texas defeated Anaheim,
6-5, at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The victory didn't do much for the Rangers' position in the
American League West, as they remain 101/2 games out of first place
and don't play another AL West game until September. But it
bolstered Catalanotto's pinch-hit reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He's 9-for-20 as a pinch hitter this season and is hitting .380
overall. Rangers manager Johnny Oates said a strong mind and a
short swing help account for Catalanotto's pinch-hitting success,
but Catalanotto said that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've done my whole career is watch the game like I'm a
big part of it,'' he said. ``The veterans I've been around have
always told me to think about a game, figure out where you might
fit in, look ahead and just be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, with the Rangers trying to avoid extra innings
after the Angels' one-run rally in the top of the frame against
closer John Wetteland, Oates was prepared, too. He didn't hesitate
to send Catalanotto to the plate for Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Facing reliever Al Levine, Catalanotto followed his plan. He
swung at the first strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing about pinch hitting is being prepared and
studying the pitcher, knowing what pitch he may feature,''
Catalanotto said. ``What I like to do in those situations is swing
at the first strike. He threw a slider; it didn't break much, and I
was able to catch up to it and drive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's game-winning hit made a winner of Wetteland, who gave up
the tying run in the top of the ninth as Orlando Palmeiro singled,
stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on pinch
hitter Chris Spiezio's single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The blown save cost Matt Perisho his first victory as a starter
this season. The left-hander, who allowed four hits in six innings
and absorbed Tim Salmon's three-run homer in the sixth, hasn't won
since a June 4 relief appearance against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   His performance was clearly better than his last start, a
one-third-inning outing in which he gave up seven runs. But last
night's start and the one against Arizona each featured an inning
loaded with walks. Against Arizona, it was three in the first
inning. Last night, it was two to lead off the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much like what we've seen overall, but we're looking
for consistency,'' Oates said. ``Right now, he's walking too many
people. The other night against Arizona, he gave up three hits off
the end of the bat. That happens. What hurt him was that he gave up
three walks in the inning, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon followed the sixth-inning walks with a home run, bringing
the Angels within 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then Perisho reappeared. He struck out Garret Anderson and Troy
Glaus swinging, and retired Matt Walbeck on an easy grounder to
short.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored three times with no outs in the fourth inning
to take a 5-1 lead. The lineup immediately behind the cleanup spot
produced the inning.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 hitter Chad Curtis doubled, Gabe Kapler looped a single
over third, and Bill Haselman followed with a run-scoring double
that sent Kapler to third. With Mike Lamb at the plate, Scott
Schoeneweis threw a wild pitch that scored Kapler. Luis Alicea's
two-out single scored Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored first, taking a 1-0 lead on Troy Glaus'
420-foot solo home run in the second inning. But Perisho settled
in, retiring 11 of the next 14 batters before the troublesome
sixth. In that stretch from the second inning to the sixth, he
induced four fly balls, two pop-ups and a double play that stunted
a first-and-second, no-out opportunity in the fourth. nn

ANGELS FALL AT FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Anaheim Angels returned home late
Wednesday night, down but not out. Their 6-5 loss to the Texas
Rangers before 27,858 at The Ballpark in Arlington completed a road
trip that began in Oakland and ended with four losses in six games.
</P>
<P>
   They began the trip four games behind first-place Seattle and
returned five out. They are only two games behind Oakland in the
wild-card race. They lost Wednesday on Rusty Greer's two-out RBI
single in the ninth off Angels reliever Al Levine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we played good baseball, but you don't get points for
being in the game,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We've
played a lot of close ballgames and won more than our share all
year. But the ball didn't bounce our way in this series or in
Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got Troy Glaus' 30th home run of the season and a
three-run homer from Tim Salmon (No. 21). But the homers were all
but forgotten by the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the ninth featured the Angels using their five-man
infield for the sixth time this year. It has become more common
lately, as they've used it four times since the All-Star break,
including twice in the last three nights against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had tied the game at 5 in the ninth on Scott
Spiezio's pinch RBI single off Rangers closer John Wetteland but
found themselves on the brink of defeat after Rangers pinch-hitter
Frank Catalanotto tripled with one out in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Darin Erstad has been used as the fifth infielder
in the previous games, but Wednesday he was the DH. So Scioscia
brought in center fielder Garret Anderson and put him at first
base. Anderson played first in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn borrowed Scott Spiezio's infield glove
and moved to the second-base spot, and the Angels were set to pitch
to Luis Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told O (left fielder Orlando Palmeiro) to tell (Scioscia) he
played second base in the minor leagues,'' Salmon said. ``I
wouldn't go in (to play infield). I've lost too many teeth
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro found the ball anyway, as Alicea hit a blooper to
shallow left that Palmeiro caught charging toward the infield,
giving Catalanotto no chance to tag and score. With two outs,
Anderson returned to center, Vaughn to first and the Angels were
almost out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Greer spoiled the Angels' plans by slapping a 3-1 pitch from
Levine the other way to left to drive in Catalanotto for a Rangers
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six times the Angels have used the five-man infield,
they've recorded the important second out four times. But only once
did they get the third out. That was Monday, when they went on to
win the game in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the other games, they lost to the Dodgers on Jim Leyritz's
two-out RBI single, to the Padres on Eric Owens' two-out bunt that
Levine booted for an error, and on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your backs are against the wall,'' Scioscia said of getting
the second out. ``But it's third-down-and-goal, not
fourth-down-and-goal. You've got to get the last out. We did it
earlier in the series, but tonight we couldn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels might have felt fortunate to be in that position at
all, since they fell behind early for the second night in a row.
Scott Schoeneweis was making his first start for the Angels since
June 16, when he went to the disabled list with a strained rib-cage
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared a little rusty, but he managed to go seven innings,
allowing five runs and 10 hits. He gave up a two-run homer to Gabe
Kapler in the second inning but wasn't bothered by that.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered him were the bloops and bleeders in the fourth
inning that led to three Texas runs. Kapler had a blooper just over
the infield dirt behind third for a key hit in the inning, and
Alicea had a swinging bunt that rolled up the third-base line for
an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman doubled in a run in the inning and another run
scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I gave up five runs, it wasn't a loud five runs,''
Schoeneweis said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis is a ground-ball pitcher who relies on his defense.
But sometimes the balls find holes and Schoeneweis is left
scrambling to keep the team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like hit or miss for me,'' he said. ``Whether (the balls)
go to people or not, I look at the chart and see I got 18 ground
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Matt Perisho, a former Angel and a teammate of
Schoeneweis' at Double-A Midland a few years ago, held the Angels
to one run on three hits through the first five innings, but in the
sixth he lost the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Kevin Stocker and Vaughn to begin the inning. He was
behind in the count, 3-1, to Salmon when Salmon hit his three-run
homer to put the Angels back in it at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   It remained that way until the ninth when the Rangers brought in
closer Wetteland. It was the fourth consecutive game Wetteland
appeared in, marking the second time this season and the fifth time
in his career Wetteland has pitched in four straight games.

DODGERS REACQUIRE VALDES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers can fire the team president
and rehire him two months later _ a la Bob Graziano last fall _
reacquiring a pitcher the organization spent a year bad-mouthing
for a playoff push is doable.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers answered Arizona's acquisition of Curt Schilling by
getting right-hander Ismael Valdes and cash Wednesday from the
Chicago Cubs for minor-leaguers Jamie Arnold and Jorge Piedra.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, 26, spent the first six seasons of his career with the
Dodgers before being traded with Eric Young to the Cubs for pitcher
Terry Adams and two minor-leaguers in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers questioned Valdes' toughness and heart last season,
and Cubs management quickly did the same. Valdes opened the season
on the disabled list with soreness in his a shoulder and has missed
starts with a hamstring injury and a recurring blister problem, but
he's been healthy for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in this environment, with the bullpen we've got now
and the offense we've got, he's in position to succeed,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I think last year it seemed
like he didn't get the run support. He should have won more than
nine games last year. We didn't trade him because he wasn't
effective. It was a financial move that enabled us to go out and
get some other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we felt like the acquisition didn't mortgage the future.
It kept the future intact and we got a guy to help us down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA in 12 starts for the Cubs, but
his reputation lowered the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope Valdes pitches more like the guy who went 61-54
with a 3.38 ERA in 176 games in Los Angeles _ but with a more
team-oriented approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than it was before because now the players
get involved,'' Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``I want
some Christmas money (from the playoffs). To have a guy that has
great stuff and the potential to be a 20-game winner is not a bad
deal. It's a matter of him going out and putting it on the line for
his teammates. You have to put it on the line for your teammates
and forget about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is owed approximately $2 million of the $5.8 million
contract he signed before the season, but the Cubs will pay
$500,000 of that. Valdes is a free agent after the season, and
though he said he would think about re-signing with the Dodgers,
it's not on his mind now. The Dodgers won't discuss a contract
extension now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be back home with my old teammates,'' Valdes
said. ``They have the power hitters, a good lineup, a good bullpen.
They have everything a championship team needs. It's a great team.
I'm very excited to be part of the pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers said otherwise publicly, they were concerned
about using rookie Eric Gagne during the pennant race. He'll be
sent to Triple-A Albuquerque after he starts today in Colorado, a
team source said. He's 1-6 with a 5.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cubs are in Philadelphia, Valdes will join the Dodgers
when they arrive there to open a three-game series Friday. Manager
Davey Johnson said he hasn't decided when Valdes will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a pennant race,'' Johnson said. ``To me, it's a lot
tougher to pitch when you're not in one than when you're in one. I
know how (Valdes) can turn it up a notch. I've seen it, and when he
does that, there aren't many better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tried to get involved in the Schilling sweepstakes
late Tuesday, but they couldn't compete with the package the
Diamondbacks put together (pitchers Omar Daal, Nelson Figueroa and
Vicente Padilla and first baseman/outfielder Travis Lee). Also,
Schilling didn't want to play in Los Angeles and could reject a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Team sources said Malone talked briefly to Cubs president and
general manager Andy MacPhail on Tuesday, but discussions didn't
heat up until Wednesday afternoon. The trade went quickly because
the Dodgers are familiar with Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a 26-year-old right-hander, was 4-7 with a 5.07 ERA in
13 starts for Triple-A Albuquerque and he appeared in two games for
the Dodgers with a 4.05 ERA. Piedra, 21, is an outfielder who was
batting .283 with six homers and 52 RBI in 92 games at Class A Vero
Beach.

NO SURPRISE: SALMON LOVES HITTING IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ Tim Salmon has no explanation for it, nor does
he care to have one. But Salmon, whether he's in a slump or not,
kills the Rangers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No opposing player in the majors has a higher batting average
(.432) or more RBI (43) at The Ballpark in Arlington than the
Anaheim Angels' Salmon. He entered the series slumping but went 6
for 13 with three homers and seven RBI in the three games,
including a three-run homer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Texas for the series, Salmon said he was
looking for something . . . anything . . . to get him going. Was
this it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' said Salmon, who is now hitting .269 with 21 homers
and 57 RBI. ``I'm looking for anything to give me some confidence.
. . . I don't really have an answer for it (his success in Texas).
All I can think of is that this ballpark has one of the best
hitter's backgrounds. You see the ball well here. Also, the
matchups. Guys I face here, I see them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, though, doesn't like to talk much about his success in
Texas. He doesn't want to jinx himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's like, 'Why bring it up?' '' he said. ``It's like
when a guy has a no-hitter going. You don't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Record tied: Third baseman Troy Glaus homered in his first
at-bat Wednesday, his team-leading 30th of the season, which tied
Doug DeCinces' 1982 mark for single-season homers by an Angels
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the homer, Glaus has struggled this month. He is hitting
only .188 (15 for 80) in July, and just .095 (2 for 21) on the road
trip, his season average dipping to .278.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said some might have become spoiled by
Glaus' hot start and expected too much. Glaus himself might be one
who expected too much, as he often slams his helmet and bat after a
strikeout or missed opportunity. But Scioscia said he doesn't think
Glaus is putting any undue pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything inside of Troy other than the
natural disappointment of not coming through in situations,''
Scioscia said. ``I don't think he's reached a level of frustration
to become concerned about. He's able to turn the page. It's why I
have the utmost confidence he'll be a key part of our run in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia added that he doesn't think pitchers are pitching Glaus
much differently than early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think he's getting pitches to hit,'' he said. ``Some
he's missed. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel here.''

LEAD DOESN'T LAST AS PEREZ GETS ROCKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; DENVER _ On a day when the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired
right-hander Ismael Valdes from the Chicago Cubs to, in all
likelihood, replace rookie Eric Gagne in the rotation, they sure
could have used a substitute for lefty Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez matched career highs by allowing nine runs and eight
earned runs, which is quite remarkable considering the way Perez's
season went a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Dodgers gave Perez a three-run lead before
he took the mound, he was hammered as the team's winning streak was
snapped at three games with an 11-4 loss to Colorado at Coors Field
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain 2 games out first in the National League
West. Arizona and San Francisco are tied for first. The Dodgers can
win the four-game series with a victory this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got back from the break, we got together and said
let's stop making it so hard on ourselves and concentrate on
winning series,'' Dodgers shortstop Kevin Elster said. ``We've won
every one since, and that's what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez (4-5) hasn't won since May 20, but he had pitched well
most of the season. That was hardly the case as he, and the
Dodgers, suffered through his second shortest start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez lasted just 1 innings in May 14 at St. Louis when he
allowed seven runs. It's the fourth time Perez allowed eight earned
runs in a game, the latest being June 11, 1999 at Oakland. Perez
allowed nine runs Aug. 23, 1998, at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find my spot, and that's why I got hit,'' Perez said.
``Sometimes when you don't have much power in your arm, you pitch
great. Today, I had more velocity, and sometimes I tried to go with
a breaking ball, but it gave me a hard time. I'm not going to be
scared to throw my breaking ball. I'm going to keep using it, but
probably the next time I'm going to use my fastball more.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dodgers took a 3-0 lead on a two-run double by Eric
Karros and an RBI fielder's choice by Adrian Beltre in the top of
the first, the Rockies, who had lost 17 of 20, had a 5-3 lead
before Perez recorded an out.
</P>
<P>
   The final three of those came on Jeffrey Hammonds' homer to
left-center field, but Johnson argued that a fan reached over the
railing and caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got a good call yet on a guy leaning over the damn
fence,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who managed Baltimore
when youngster Jeff Maier reached over and caught Derek Jeter's
homer at Yankee Stadium in the 1996 playoffs. ``How come I'm the
only one who could see it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies built their lead to 6-3 when Colorado pitcher Brian
Bohanon, but that's not what did in Perez. The Dodgers cut the
deficit to 6-4 in the third on another Beltre ground out, but Perez
got himself in more trouble in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   And it began with a walk to Bohanon. Brian Hunter singled and
Neifi Perez sacrificed. But instead of letting Beltre field it at
third, Perez grabbed it, whirled and threw off target to Eric
Karros at first. Matt Herges relieved, but allowed all three
inherited runners to score and then gave up his own run-scoring
single to Butch Huskey as Colorado went ahead 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first one he hasn't kept us in the ballgame in
quite a while,'' Johnson said. ``He's really been very good, but it
didn't happen. He wasn't very sharp. He was just up and out, and
that was about it.''

GROWING MONEY DEALS CREATE MEMORABILIA MANIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The first National Sports Collectors
Convention (NSCC) in 1980 was held in half of a banquet room at a
hotel near LAX. There weren't many card dealers back in 1980, so
basically it was a gathering of collectors selling and trading
their duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   When the NSCC was held in Anaheim in 1991, the hobby had become
a modern-day gold rush. The Anaheim Convention Center was swamped
by collectors seeking free promotional cards and giveaways from
dozens of card and memorabilia companies. Lines circling the
facility rivaled those at nearby Disneyland. By show's end, more
than 100,000 people had attended.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st annual NSCC returns to the Anaheim Convention Center
this week, and it once again has morphed into something entirely
different. Visitors to the show will find more diversity in
collectibles, discover new ways to collect, and see prices for
high-end material that rival player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Honus Wagner tobacco card once owned by Bruce
McNall and Wayne Gretzky recently sold to an Orange County man for
$1.1 million ($1.27 million after consignors fees). It will be on
display at the show as part of a display by Newport Beach-based Pro
Sports Authenticators (PSA), the largest card-grading company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market keeps changing, which is part of any business,''
said Mike Berkus, this year's show director and co-promoter of the
first NSCC. He's been a part of every locally based national. ``The
'91 show was the first where dealers actually sold packs of cards
and that was considered novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The grading of cards is one of the more notable topics in the
hobby, the others being the Internet, memorabilia and autographs:
</P>
<P>
   __ Grading: PSA is owned and operated by the same people who
introduced grading to coin collecting. While it remains a
controversial topic from the credibility of those doing the grading
to its impact on card values it has been grudgingly accepted by the
hobby. PSA officials expect to grade 20,000 cards this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Grading establishes a premium on cards that are in the best
possible shape. This premium has always existed, but grading
assigns it a number PSA grades on a 1-to-10 basis
</P>
<P>
   puts it in a plastic case and allows companies to keep track of
how many high-grade cards exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grading has given the hobby a shot in the arm,'' said longtime
collector/dealer Carson Ritchey, a regular dealer at a warehouse
show in Walnut Wednesday evenings and Saturdays. ``But it deletes
the kids who might want to collect. It's turned it into an adult
game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Internet: The Internet has been a boon to a majority of
dealers and collectors. Many dealers now have their own Web sites
to sell product, which has proven more cost-efficient than
periodical or direct-mail advertising. Many wholesalers now have a
place to presell new product and move extra inventory, and buyers
are no longer restricted to local shows or card shops in searching
for a particular card or set.
</P>
<P>
   The down side of Net auctions is a realization that the Beckett
price guide is inflated and the opportunity for wholesalers to
flush slow-moving product, which hurts singles, pack and box sales
for card-store owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since dealing on the Internet got hot, my sales of singles has
dropped 65 percent, and packs by 20 percent,'' said Bryon Walters,
who owns his own memorabilia shop, Squeeze Play, in Tustin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Autographs: A recent crackdown on forgeries, which included a
claim by investigators that up to 90 percent of all autographed
material is forged, seriously set this part of the hobby back.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbyists say that claim was inflated. Regardless, collectors
are now seeking greater authenticity of items and sending them to
autograph experts for confirmation. At the same time, it has fueled
an increase in sales of certified memorabilia by companies and
licensees who have exclusive deals with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Memorabilia: With the overproduction and grading of cards and
concerns about autographs, more attention is being given to other
unique memorabilia, like tickets from major events and game-used
jerseys and bats.

M'S GO QUIETLY AS OAKLAND CUTS WEST DEFICIT TO THREE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You don't need the roar of the crowd to gauge a team's
success.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is ears. All you have to do is listen. The postgame
clubhouse will tell you all you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners clubhouse Wednesday was as quiet as a library at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The A's clubhouse was as loud as the engine testing room at
Boeing. There was enough music cranked up to simulate a battle of
the bands.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who won?
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson pitched the A's to a 6-1 victory over the Mariners,
moving Oakland to within three games of Seattle in the American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred games into the 2000 season, the Mariners have had
their share of raucous clubhouse moments as Seattle has zoomed to
the top of the charts in the West. Wednesday's no-noise zone was a
reminder of the fleeting nature of baseball, of how quickly things
can change in the 62 remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that they could come into our house and do
this,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said of the A's, who won two of
three games. ``But it may be good. Maybe this will serve as a
wakeup call for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also serve as a call to arms. Seattle general manager Pat
Gillick has until Monday to get a non-waiver deal put together, and
the loss served notice that the Mariners, while good, are not as
good as they could be.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle loaded the bases with one out in the first and scored
just one run. John Olerud smoked a line drive, a ball run down in
the gap by center fielder Terrence Long. Olerud's drive produced a
1-0 lead, but that was the end of Hudson's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners left two men on in the first, the second and the
fifth, and they had two on when the A's turned an inning-ending
double play in the fourth. Opportunity was there repeatedly, but
success was not. It's not a new story. The Mariners rank last in
the AL in hits and last in runners left on base.
</P>
<P>
   Normally that combination will leave a team dead in the water,
but the Mariners have been able to skirt the problem by pitching
well, playing steady defense and getting just enough offense to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Mariners may well depend on if Gillick is
able to bridge the hits/runners-left-on conundrum. A left-handed
bat would be ideal, and names like Jeromy Burnitz (Milwaukee), Al
Martin (San Diego) and Johnny Damon (Kansas City) are being thrown
around as potential additions to the Mariners arsenal. The
throwing-around part is easy. It's the catching part that's hard.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, the A's are looking at ways to catch Seattle
while the Mariners look at ways to improve their roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two months to go, and a lot of the guys who are here
have done the job before,'' losing pitcher Paul Abbott said. ``With
all the time still to go, we should get as strong as we can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's sent a loud, emphatic message, in winning two of three,
that the Mariners had better improve, because Oakland isn't about
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential that we beat these guys, and beat them on
their own turf,'' second baseman Randy Velarde said. ``This
definitely sends a message, not only for the postseason, but that
we're able to beat teams in our own division, because it's getting
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, in just his second year in the big leagues but already
pitching like an All-Star _ which he was, two weeks ago in Atlanta
_ ran his record to 11-3 by shaking off the rocky first inning. He
gave up a bullet to Olerud with the bases loaded, to be sure, but
Long ran it down, keeping the damage to a sacrifice fly. And after
Hudson struck out John Mabry, the worst was over _ for Hudson. For
the Mariners, the worst was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez got the first hit off Abbott in the third
inning, a two-run homer. Oakland scored two more runs in the fifth,
on a couple of bloop singles with men in scoring position. Then
Jason Giambi hit a two-run homer in the eighth off Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners out-hit the A's 8-5, but went 1-for-10 with men in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not all of their hits were pretty,'' outfielder Jay
Buhner said. ``But they got hits with men on base. We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner wasn't in the lineup Wednesday. Neither was Rickey
Henderson. As a general rule, neither veteran plays day games after
having played the night before. The Mariners had good role players
in place of both, but Raul Ibanez and John Mabry have just one
homer each. That's not enough for players hitting sixth and seventh
in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the push to add another bat to the lineup, a thought that
will be on the Mariners' minds as they prepare for four games
against Toronto beginning Thursday night, a game that will be
closely monitored by the A's, who host Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only hope we didn't tick off the Mariners so much that they
go out and kick Toronto's behinds,'' A's designated hitter Matt
Stairs said.
</P>
<P>
   The A's and the Jays will have the answer to that momentarily.

A-ROD MARKS 25TH BIRTHDAY BUT PARTY TIME REMAINS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alex Rodriguez turns 25 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that every day isn't like a birthday.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Mariners have showered gifts on the young
shortstop: John Olerud, Aaron Sele, Arthur Rhodes, Mark McLemore,
Stan Javier, Rickey Henderson ... and the trading deadline is just
around the corner. The yawning wood in the Mariners' batting order
during Wednesday's 6-1 loss to the A's only reinforced the need to
bring in some extra bash.
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, when the mating dance with Rodriguez began
in earnest, the Mariners have built a winning team that is also
supposed to double as proof to Rodriguez that they mean business.
</P>
<P>
   If he is gloating about his lofty station in life, Rodriguez
never shows it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if he is impressed by the Mariners' effort, it
has done nothing to change his mind about testing the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard Lincoln (Mariners part-owner and CEO) doesn't try and
score any points with me, which I appreciate. I really like him,
but he knows it would do more harm than good to bring up the
contract, especially now,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's glamour free-agent-to-be, Rodriguez has the world by
the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in demand,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 25, I was on top of my game, too. It made the game a lot
easier. But you learn it's not about how much money you can make.
It's about what he wants to get out of this game. You can go
somewhere and get what you deserve, and that's all gravy. The
important thing is to play the game, accomplish what you set out to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said that like Henderson, he has goals _ but he will
not reveal them. Rodriguez knows he's in the catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys kid me that I have a silver spoon since I was young,
especially since I signed (his first contract with a million-dollar
bonus) so early. But I think they're saying that facetiously. I
think they realize how hard I work. I try not to take things for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   As birthdays go, Rodriguez said his summertime gig has never
been anything special. There's always a game, business to take care
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best birthday, though, was when I turned 21, because I
signed a contract extension that day and hit a home run to win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has often said that the contract extension he signed
with the Mariners in 1996 was for his family. The $12 million deal
was the security he wanted to make sure his mother, sister and
brother were forever going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   The next one he signs will be for him. No matter how much fun he
is having, Rodriguez refuses to determine his future now.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lincoln stopped by the shortstop's locker and whisked
him off for a private meeting. Rodriguez said no offers were
tendered, no overtures made.
</P>
<P>
   This quashed any vague, flickering hope that Rodriguez would
celebrate his birthday by taking the $100-million-plus deal the
Mariners are prepared to give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't make an emotional decision because the team is
winning now and we're having fun. Look at Alex Fernandez,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marlins won the World Series, he signed a contract, and
the next year, they started tearing the team apart.''
</P>
<P>
   As much of interest to Rodriguez Wednesday was talk about what
the Mets might do, now that Reds shortstop Barry Larkin isn't
heading to Shea Stadium. Did the Mets call the Mariners? What deal
would the Mets make for Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   The promise was to not trade Rodriguez this season, but no one
said anything about listening to offers.
</P>
<P>
   As Rodriguez gets older, he gets more shrewd. If he rebuked
agent Scott Boras when he was 18 and signed with the Mariners, and
if he defied Boras again at 21 when he signed the extension,
Rodriguez is extremely cautious about sticking to his guns this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What direction are the (Mariners) going? That's what I'm
interested in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of a promising season has not swayed Rodriguez. Nothing
alters the bigger picture. Boras wants him in L.A. or New York,
maybe Chicago, for marketing reasons. Rodriguez says the decision
is ultimately his.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the 41-year-old Henderson has climbed past Hall
of Famers every time he steals another base, scores another run,
gets another hit or draws another walk.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, 36-year-old Jay Buhner hit home run No. 300, good
for No. 86 on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, enjoying his most productive year as one of the
game's best hitters, leads the league in RBI.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, the advancing age of the Mariners roster has got to be a
concern for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie Moyer, Aaron Sele, Ole (John Olerud), Edgar, (Tom)
Lampkin, (Joe) Oliver; a lot of guys here have a lot of questions
about what happens next. Not negative questions, just who's going
to be here, who's coming back?''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a demand. It's a question. But even if the Mariners
have an answer, it really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   As he turns 25, Rodriguez is not going to celebrate with the
richest contract in baseball history. His party comes later, time
and location still unknown.

 PM-CONCORDE-CRASH-0727-COX &HT;    PROBE IN CONCORDE CRASH TURNS TO 'BLACK BOXES'; EXPERT FINGERS
ILL-FATED FLIGHT'S TURBINE DISCS
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Investigators have fully extracted the data
from the ``black box'' recorders aboard the Air France Concorde
that crashed Tuesday, and have begun analyzing cockpit
conversations and engine readings made during the supersonic
aircraft's doomed two-minute flight, the French government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The government agency that investigates aviation accidents said
it was unclear how soon the
</P>
<P>
   information contained on the flight data and cockpit voice
records would yield clues about what caused the crash that killed
113 when the Concorde slammed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope to learn more about the readings from the No.
2 engine, which burst into flames as the aircraft was taxiing down
the runway. The same engine was repaired by mechanics just before
the Concorde departed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on TV news reporters to determine if for example, the color and
size of the flames can held determine the temperature and source of
the flames, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans,
two Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French
crewmembers. The American was identified as retired Air France
employee Christopher Behrens. Two Polish women were among those
killed on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service has been scheduled here in Gonesse for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts told La Croix newspaper that evidence and
observations suggest that a turbine disc in the jet engine may have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Auffray told the newspaper that investigators should
focus on turbine discs inside
</P>
<P>
   both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured turbine disc may have caused the engine to break up
inside. However, because it is so unlikely that a disc would have
spontaneously failed, he said it was also possible that the engine
was damaged by ``intruding objects.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot reported engine trouble seconds after take-off and was
apparently making a frantic attempt to fly the crippled aircraft to
a nearby airport, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Senot, a French jurist conducting a judicial enquiry
into the crash, said tower controllers at Charles de Gaulle
International Airport radioed the Concorde's crew that they could
see flames at the back of the aircraft 56 seconds after it took
off. Air France identified the pilot as Capt. Christian Marty,
known for skill and prudence as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain replied, 'fault in engine number two,''' Senot
said at a news conference Wednesday. ``After that, it seems the
flames became extremely large because (the fire) was once again
signaled by the control tower, and the crew replied that they were
no longer in a position to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew told the tower that they were heading for Le Bourget
Airport, four miles southwest of Charles de Gaulle. This would have
required a half-turn rather than a full-turn by the damaged
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during this turning maneuver that it crashed on the
hotel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic transport lost power and altitude as the flames
poured from engines under its left wing and crashed into a small
hotel. All 109 passengers and crewmembers aboard the Concorde were
killed, as well as four people at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The plane struck the hotel and earth near fields of wheat and
corn near the suburb of Gonesse, about nine miles from central
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France reported that Marty asked mechanics to make a repair
to the engine that began spewing flames moments before take-off.
Mechanics repaired a thrust-reverser in one of the two portside
engines before the Concorde took off.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the airline said engine No. 2 _ the interior
engine on the left wing _ was inspected and repaired at the pilot's
insistence even though the repair was not required for take-off.
The problem with the thrust-reverser, which is used to slow an
aircraft on landing, was detected after the plane arrived from New
York on Monday, Air France said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pilot was told that the repair wasn't required,
he asked mechanics to make it anyway, the airline said. ``The piece
w's survivors on the ground told reporters that she was spared only
because she had been assigned a room at the front of Hotelissimo,
which was engulfed in the blaze fed by the aircraft's 100 tons of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Brooking, 21, a Cambridge student, jumped out of a window
on the hotel's second floor to safety seconds after the accident.
She had been on the phone with her sister in England. She said that
flames and smoke moved quickly through the hotel. ``It was like
being in an oven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Gonesse, a town of 20,000 brought unhappily to the
world stage by the crash, expressed a mix of sadness and gratitude
about what had happened. Coming out of a Toys ``R'' Us at a nearby
mall, Marie Hetru said she could not get over the crash, and the
prospect that it could have crashed into the center of Gonesse a
half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would the number of dead be then _ maybe including me and
my children,'' she
</P>
<P>
   said. ``Of course it is terrible _ 113 people _ but if it wasn't
for the pilot, it may have been much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said the crash reflected the
miseries of the town's living near one of the world's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying for a long time that air traffic is
increasing too fast, that
</P>
<P>
   even with four runways, you can't safely manage this amount of
air traffic around Paris,'' Blazy said at a press conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived with planes for several decades and we don't
live in
</P>
<P>
   daily fear of a crash, but it's on our minds.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another chance for Mideast peace squandered
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following a consistent 52-year pattern, the Palestinians have
managed again to make the least of an opportunity. This time, at
President Clinton's Camp David negotiations, they dodged the
creation of a substantial, internationally recognized Palestinian
state with significant authority in the Muslim quarter of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   And consistent with this dismal history, too, Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestinian Authority, is being hailed as a hero by
his allies and even some of his enemies _ the extremist Hammas _
for resisting the best opportunity for a lasting peace since the
Palestinians and their backers in Arab capitals blew off Israel's
tenders after the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat now goes ahead with his threatened unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state September 13, he will likely
lose for his people more than just an opportunity. Such a reckless
move would all but require unilateral Israeli counters, probably
including full annexation of some Jewish-occupied sections of the
West Bank and hardened barriers to Palestinian interests in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That, and a likely turn in Israeli domestic politics to the
uncompromising right. After all, what point would there be, then,
in Israelis continuing with a peace-minded government?
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak had prepared Israelis for painful
compromise by all but formally ceding substantial concessions even
before the Camp David talks. By common account, he proved
additionally flexible in the negotiations, even in hard-nut
Jerusalem issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had not prepared his people for substantial compromise,
holding out even as he enplaned for Washington a fantasy of
Palestinian triumph. And by equally common account _ except, of
course, from Palestinian spin _ he was unbending in demanding that
Jerusalem be partitioned, which isn't going to happen and
shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that Arafat's stubbornness on Jerusalem is being
cheered in Palestinian and Arab precincts as a negotiating success.
</P>
<P>
   A long string of successes like this one has brought the
Palestinians to their current pass, on ever-shrinking patches of
land in an unfavorable status quo increasingly sanctioned by the
calcification of time and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has three choices. He can begin finally prepare his
people for the kinds of concessions that the Camp David talks, if
they did nothing else, made clear will be necessary for peace. That
might still allow for a final-status agreement before
mid-September, thought that's a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   He can settle for the current ad hoc, unstable and muddled
relationship with Israel and hope it does not come unstuck in any
but manageable ways,
</P>
<P>
   Or, as he foolishly has done in the past, he can stir up the
volatile Palestinian street in a reckless gamble that more gain
than loss will come of the turmoil, a model increasingly
discredited in practice but not in Palestinian theory.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with peace, Arafat ran. Right into a nasty bind of his own
making.

 &HT;    Texas does not have a budget deficit
 &HT;    By Carole Keeton Rylander
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no budget deficit in Texas. Period.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the hard-working women and men of this great state have
produced a budget surplus of $1 billion, $409 million. That
conservative estimate includes $1.1 billion in the bank today, and
another $300 million-plus will be in the bank by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, thanks to the leadership of Gov. George W. Bush and
the Legislature, the state's budget is sound, taxes will not be
raised and we have more than enough money to pay our bills.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would be news if it were not for Vice President Al
Gore's misleading and inaccurate statements about our fiscal
health. Last week, he insisted that Texas is in the midst of a
budget crisis. That simply is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Texas Legislature meets only once every two years,
lawmakers must project what bills will come in over a long period
of time. Every session of the Legislature, these budgetary
adjustments are made. In fact, lawmakers have made nine such budget
adjustments during the past six sessions.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much like any family budget _ only on a much larger
scale. One month, I may spend more on my electric bill, and the
next month I may spend money traveling to see my baby
granddaughters, and every month I adjust.
</P>
<P>
   When the session begins in January, lawmakers will make an
adjustment of about $610 million. This money will pay for
unexpected increases for such things as pharmaceutical costs for
medicine for the poor, keeping criminals in jail and preventing
forest fires in drought stricken areas _ all things I believe
Texans want and need.
</P>
<P>
   If lawmakers had to come to Austin today, and they do not, there
would be more than enough money to pay all the bills and we would
have millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars
left in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Where did this money come from? Well, a lot of places. This year
alone, sales taxes are up $655 million more than expected, motor
vehicle sales taxes up $204 million more than expected, oil and gas
severance taxes contributed another $226 million to the surplus and
other revenue sources kicked in another $324 million.
</P>
<P>
   And this surplus does not even count $48 million that will
automatically go into the state's rainy-day fund or $24 million
left in the state's account after the Legislature met last year.
</P>
<P>
   Every objective look at Texas shows that our economy is strong.
Personal income in Texas is $8 billion higher than our original
forecast, and the gross state product is $25 billion higher for
fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Texans need to know that the budget is sound, and Wall Street
needs to know that all is well and only getting better. I am going
to New York City next week to tell analysts who set the state's
bond ratings how good things are here at home. High bond ratings
mean lower interest rates for the short-term notes that we sell
every year at this time. That means we can save millions of dollars
for Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Misleading attacks are an insult and an outrage. I am
independently elected by the people of Texas with a constitutional
responsibility to tell legislators and all Texans the truth about
their state budget. There is no budget deficit in Texas. There is a
surplus. Period.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: How much is a billion?
 &HT;    For release July 30, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never claimed a lofty knowledge of numbers, simply
confident that since one and one made two that's about all I needed
to know.
</P>
<P>
   But if you keep adding up the ones and ones, you eventually get
to a hundred, then a thousand, then a million _ and it's after that
when things get complicated, really complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Such as when do enough ones and ones add up to a billion?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure of yourself on this one. The other day, while
reading a reader helpline column in the Miami Herald, I discovered
that while a billion has one meaning here, it doesn't necessarily
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The value of a billion, it turns out, is a floater.
</P>
<P>
   A reader wrote that he was told a billion means a thousand
million in the United States but that in the United Kingdom, it
means a million million.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the newspaper confirmed, there is a difference _ a
difference that totals 999 thousand million, which is a helluva
more ones and ones than ever I could count. Not only that but the
newspaper said the French, Spanish and Germans also regard a
billion as a million million. It further advised that in South and
Central America, one billion means a thousand million as it does in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a reader wrote to tell the newspaper that it is
wrong, that in South and Central America one billion means a
million million, as it does in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as there is a difference of opinion (and numbers) in
the newspaper columns, I was driven to my encyclopedia and several
dictionaries. I'm not so certain there can be a consensus however.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the references separate a U.S. billion from a
billion everywhere else, the Compact Edition of the Oxford English
Dictionary says that, despite the newspaper article, France also
considers a billion to be a thousand million. (Don't be fooled with
that ``Compact'' term; the dictionary is thousands of pages huge in
two volumes that have to be read with a magnifying glass. Nothing,
it seems, means what it really is.)
</P>
<P>
   This international billion issue is not going to impact my daily
doings or yours, but I am in a quandary as to Bill Gates' position
in life. In this country, he's called a billionaire. That means
he's got at least a thousand million dollars. But is he a
billionaire in England? He's got to have a million million dollars
to be eligible. Got it, Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more confusion. The World Book Encyclopedia, while
stating unequivocally that the British version of a billion is a
million million, then goes on to say, ``But many British use
billion to mean a thousand million.'' How many British? You mean
that within the United Kingdom, they don't agree on how much is a
billion? And to make matters worse, it also says that the British
billion used to be called a trillion. We use trillion, don't we? I
saw it in some federal budget story the other day. Then, how much
is a trillion?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you I am horribly confused. I also am gladdened that
nothing I do in life ever will reach a sum of a billion or a
trillion so I really don't have to know how much either really is.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I'm still having trouble between feet and meters,
pounds and kilos, Celsius and Fahrenheit; things like that. With
the Summer Olympics approaching, we are going to be confounded
again with 1500 meter runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is reason to be slightly amused about the
discrepancy on the value of a billion, especially if we read that
the Russians are spending a billion dollars to develop a missile
system so we will spend a like amount.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, it isn't a like amount. We'd be be spending 999
thousand million less; hah!
</P>
<P>
   This all is over my head. I cannot deal with it. Besides, my
little calculator can't reach a billion. Anyone's billion.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the dust settled Wednesday from the collapse of
the Mideast summit at Camp David, President Clinton made clear that
the curtain hasn't yet fallen on his long-running quest to broker a
peace accord for the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   The next act in the drama, he said, is for Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to move quickly
to build a consensus for compromise among the people they
represent.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides set to resume working-level talks as early as
next week, Clinton said he remained hopeful that Arafat and Barak
could reach a final peace accord before their self-imposed Sept. 13
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to do it,'' Clinton told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just when and how he might reinvigorate formal negotiations,
though, Clinton couldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't yet tell what would be most in aid of the process,''
Clinton said. ``I just can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, U.S. diplomats were already in motion,
contacting governments across the Arab and Muslim worlds, as well
as Europe, to try to build a united global front backing the
U.S.-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to dispatch a senior envoy to the region
over the next two or three weeks to consult with leaders there and
assess the prospects for renewed talks.
</P>
<P>
   The job of selling a potential peace accord _ and the painful
compromises that would entail _ to the region, however, is one the
White House is leaving to Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attempts to sway public opinion not only wouldn't work,
administration officials assert, they'd likely backfire, with
Palestinians and Israelis alike regarding such efforts as
heavy-handed superpower meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The message Clinton and his diplomats hope to get out, though,
is that the Camp David talks dramatically advanced the prospects
for a comprehensive peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians,
who, for the first time ever, sat down and seriously locked horns
over the sensitive issues at the core of their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way beyond where they have been on this issue,'' said
the State Department's Aaron Miller, deputy Middle East coordinator
for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is for them to determine what happened at
Camp David and, perhaps just as important, did not happen, and to
see how the political and public elite digest what happened,''
Miller told a small group of reporters. ``What is required is a
sustainable domestic base to support leaders' decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``You've got to get used to talking about
something for a little bit before you can then entertain how you
can create an edifice that you hadn't previously imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants U.S. partners abroad to discourage Arafat
from going through with his threat to declare a Palestinian state
Sept. 13 _ with or without a Palestinian-Israeli peace accord.
That, Clinton fears, could trigger violence.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants the Arab world to soften its opposition to
Palestinian concessions on the question of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David summit fell apart on Tuesday after two weeks of
talks centered on the thorny web of security and territorial issues
at the heart of 52 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both
sides were willing to deal on prickly matters like the fate of
Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees. Gains were made also in
the area of security.
</P>
<P>
   The straw that broke the summit's back, though, was the question
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians both claim the holy city as their
capital. Barak offered Arafat limited sovereignty over parts of
East Jerusalem, which Israeli troops seized during the 1967
Israeli-Arab war. Arafat, though, stuck by his long-held demand
that all of East Jerusalem be placed under Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat showed little flexibility on the issue during the summit,
and U.S. diplomats became convinced that he could move no further
without the support of the larger Arab and Muslim worlds _
including countries like Egypt, Jordan and even Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, though, was not Clinton's last card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think the embers are out of the fire,'' said noted
Arabist Michael Hudson, of Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson suggested that Clinton look to an outside mediator _ he
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter and former U.S. Senator
George Mitchell as possibilities _ to try to help gin up support
for continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to send Jimmy Carter, if he were to send George
Mitchell, an important political person with some diplomatic skill
back in, the summit might yet be salvaged,'' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who brokered the historic Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
at Camp David in 1978,
</P>
<P>
   has particularly broad cache within the Arab world. The Clinton
administration has yet to reach out _ at least publicly _ on this
issue to Carter, who was en route to Venezuela this week and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of offer hasn't been made, and I can't speculate on
what his reaction to it would be,'' said Carter spokeswoman Carrie
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has played important roles as citizen-statesman in trying
to broker a cease-fire between Bosnians and Serbs, in breaking a
dangerous U.S.-North Korea impasse over Pyongyang's suspected
nuclear weapons program and in averting a U.S. military invasion of
Haiti.

 &HT;    Some literary selections to keep your mind off the heat
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   SUMMERTIME, AND THE READING IS EASY
</P>
<P>
   At least it's easy to come up with an excuse for staying out of
the heat and under the air-conditioning, or curling up with a book
under a back-porch ceiling fan once that infernal sun has finally
sunk below the horizon. A night-time climate of 90 degrees with a
bit of shade and some air stirring seems fairly tolerable after a
full day of 103-degree weather in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on a reading tear since the solstice, so I picked an
armload of my favorite recent reads to offer for your
consideration. It's an eclectic mix of heavy and light, fiction and
fact, so maybe you'll discover something that tickles your fancy.
Here goes:'
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates of the Alamo,'' by Stephen Harrigan (Knopf, 581 pp. $25
list.). Just when you thought the last thing the world needed was
yet another book about the Alamo _ fact or fiction _ Texas Monthly
writer Stephen Harrigan publishes a fine historical novel of the
state's seminal event. Harrigan was meticulous in his research, and
the few completely fictionalized characters are entirely
believable. His portraits of the main players in the Texas
revolution: Sam Houston, Gen. Santa Anna, and the three
larger-than-life characters who died at the San Antonio mission _
Crockett, Bowie and Travis _ are well drawn and as faithful to
history as a novelist can get.
</P>
<P>
   The subplot involves a mother chasing after a son who runs off
to join the Texian forces at the Alamo. The son is sent out to get
reinforcements just before the battle, and the mother, pinned
inside, manages to survive. (Santa Anna allowed women and children
to live.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no line drawn in the sand, which might disappoint some
who are enamored of that historical chestnut, but as Harrigan
points out in the afterword, there's little or no proof that
actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates of the Alamo'' takes readers through the rest of the war
and Houston's eventual triumph at San Jacinto. Even non-Texans
should find it a fascinating read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fine Green Line,'' by John Paul Newport. (Broadway, 312
pp. $24 list). OK, you probably have to be golfer to enjoy this
account of a free-lance writer's attempt to raise his game to a
professional level , survive qualifying school and make it to the
PGA Tour. Newport was a better-than-average golfer who shot a
miraculous three-under-par 69 one day and decided to take a year
off to see just how good he could get.
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Not nearly good enough, but the tale is at times
hilarious and insightful _ especially for us hackers upon whom the
golf gods occasionally smile and bless us with a low round and
string of birdies. And Newport is a very good writer. Golf widows
(and widowers) might enjoy an articulate explanation of why their
spouses devote endless hours baking in the sun, hitting a little
white ball over and over. Golf nuts will love this book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midwives,'' by Chris Bohjalian. (Vintage paperbacks, 372 pp.
$13 list). Oprah picked this book, and that's reason enough for me
to give it a shot. It turned out to be one of the better novels
I've read in some time. The story centers around an experienced
midwife in rural Vermont who runs into trouble during a delivery in
which the mother apparently dies of a stroke. In desperation, she
performs a Caesarian section to save the baby. After, the father
and her assistant claim the woman actually was alive, and the
impromptu surgery is what killed her. Sibyl, the midwife, is
indicted for involuntary manslaughter, a charge pushed by the
medical establishment long critical of home births by non-doctors.
The trial is the centerpiece of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midwives'' is a page-turner from the beginning with a unique
plot and no real villains or heroes. Once gain, Oprah was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War,'' by Bob
Greene. (Morrow, 295 pp., $25 list). Chicago Tribune columnist Bob
Greene tells the story of his recently deceased father and his
World War II experiences, as well as those of a fellow hometown
veteran, Paul Tibbets, who piloted the Enola Gay and dropped the
atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   This is an amazing memoir of two ordinary men who served our
country gallantly, one in relative anonymity, the other whose name
is forever linked to one of the most momentous events of the 20th
century. Both remained self-effacing and modest to a fault. Tibbets
never granted an interview until Greene contacted him more than a
half-century after the event. Greene's dad had little to say about
the war until close to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duty'' is a fine piece of journalism, and few will be able to
finish it with dry eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy, and stay out of the sun.

 &HT;    How am I? I'm barely making it
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ If it walks like pneumonia and quacks like
pneumonia, there's a good chance it is. Even though my doctor never
used the ``p'' word in describing my illness, I know _ despite my
lack of any formal training in the medical field _ the walking
pneumonia had me.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact I went to the doctor is proof enough I had
symptoms that couldn't be sloughed off with Nyquil and Tylenol.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gets your attention quicker than a temperature of 102
followed by sheet-soaking sweats and topped off by teeth-chattering
chills. Then the roller coaster ride would start over. Oh, did I
mention the uncontrollable coughing fits that would nearly leave me
for dead?
</P>
<P>
   It's been a month now and I'm finishing up the last of five or
six rounds of antibiotics that have been working night and day to
rid my lungs of what looked like cumulus clouds on the X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   My brush with mortality has given me a chance to reflect on a
number of topics:
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't say I have been insensitive to others who might come
down with the sniffles, but when someone would start telling me
their medical problems, I would offer my best advice. ``The best
thing for what ails you,'' I would say, patting their shoulder as I
guided them back to the their desk,'' is hard work and lots of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   My doctor told me he was prescribing the ``best antibiotic known
to medical science.'' Seven pills cost $50. For that amount, I at
least expected it to be laced with Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   My illness was not nearly as interesting to others as it was to
me. Even my wife, who made some sort of vow dealing with sickness
and health, was growing weary of what she described as ``my
constant moaning.'' The combination of pills and cough syrup made
my tired and I will admit it may have made me slightly edgy. But
she had no call to crank the lawn mower and leave it running next
to the bedroom window when I was trying to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my condition, I kept up my duties as a fourth-grade
Sunday school teacher. Some might say I was placing young children
at risk of infection. I say their immune systems are much better
than mine at fighting disease. I remember one recent Sunday when I
was telling a Bible story, I had their undivided attention. They
sat there, eyes as big as saucers and mouths open, as I hacked and
wheezed through the story. I was amazed how _ even in my worsened
condition _ I still had their rapt attention. I mentioned this to
my daughter who's in the class, to which she replied, ``Daddy, we
all thought you were going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't like it when co-workers pat me on the shoulder and tell
me the best thing for what ails me is hard work and lots of it.

 &HT;    Untermeyer on why a Bush-Cheney ticket works
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Chase Untermeyer of Houston, a trusted ally of
both former President Bush and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, thinks
Dick Cheney will be a great running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was chief of staff for President Gerald Ford when Bush
headed the Central Intelligence Agency. Brent Scowcroft was
national security adviser, and Jim Baker, the undersecretary of
commerce, was Ford's campaign manager in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Their close relationship then made for great cooperation later
when President Bush had Scowcroft as national security adviser,
Baker as secretary of state and Cheney as secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer, director of White House personnel for President Bush
and appointed in 1999 by Gov. Bush to the politically sensitive
chairmanship of the Texas State Board of Education, recalled
bringing presidential historian Dr. Richard Neustadt, to visit the
president in 1989. The meeting ended when the national security
team came into the Oval Office, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer said Neustadt told him that previous defense and
foreign policy advisers usually had their sabers drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time the secretary of state and national security
adviser got along as well before was when Henry Kissinger held both
jobs,'' Untermeyer said. ``They could sublimate their rivalries or
jealousies or territorial turf battles because they started off
with a great degree of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got to believe that that is one of the traits of
Cheney Bush values,'' Untermeyer said. ``He is a strong man and
highly capable, but he gets along with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer thinks that's because Cheney ``was so young when he
was chief of staff to the president. There he was in this very
important job where he had to work with all these important people.
He had authority, but he worked quietly with everybody to get
cooperation, rather than to force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer recalled a story the normally staid Cheney once told
about campaigning for re-election in Wyoming. He was running late
for an interview at a radio station in a town he'd visited often,
but not recently. Cheney remembered the station was in a house
trailer at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney told the driver `turn left, turn right' _ and he burst
into the trailer to find a mother and two kids cooking supper, and
realized that this radio station had moved,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, Untermeyer recalled, turned to the woman as he was
leaving ``and said, `You have just been visited by your United
States senator _ Alan Simpson.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's 10 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, part of
them fairly high in the Republican leadership, will serve the
younger Bush well, Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Cheney would preside over the U.S. Senate.
That, coupled with his roots in the House, ``can be of immense
value on Capitol Hill, totally apart from his national security
considerations,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney choice would give Bush something that modern
presidents who are former governors (without congressional
experience) really need. And that is a vice president who can be
the administration's most senior ambassador to Capitol Hill, who
has roots in Capitol Hill, and who can speak to the members there
as a former colleague in a way that someone who doesn't have those
ties cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what Mondale did for Carter and Bush did for Reagan
and Gore has done for Clinton,'' Untermeyer said.

 &HT;    Oldies but goodies
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the cult action movie ``Escape From New
York,'' our hero, played by Kurt Russell, finds that every time he
meets up with someone new, the character's first line is: ``I
thought you were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it seems appropriate to compare one pop cultural form with
another, especially when considering musical acts you may have
thought were dead. Maybe not in the literal sense of having left
this mortal plane, but certainly in the notion that their time in
the spotlight has passed.
</P>
<P>
   The list of acts touring the country this summer is dominated by
groups whose biggest successes appear to be behind them _ way
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But to paraphrase a line from another movie, Monty Python's
``Holy Grail'': They're not dead yet. At least not to their fans,
who are happy to spend their dollars to hear songs they never
stopped loving.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week plus a day, several acts whose careers started
_ and might have seemed to have ended _ in the '70s and '80s will
be making their way through the Dayton area. Some groups, such as
KC and The Sunshine Band, are banking solely on past glories, while
other acts, such as Rick Springfield, and Michael McDonald, are
pushing forward with new material and recording projects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the old hits most people will go to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfans may think of an evening with one of these groups in
terms of yet another movie: ``Night of the Living Dead.'' But for
longtime fans, the music is eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Wayne Casey, better known as ``KC'' of KC and The Sunshine
Band, rose to the top of the music charts in the 1970s with such
dance hits as Shake Your Booty, Get Down Tonight and That's The Way
(I Like It).
</P>
<P>
   During the peak years of the band's career, the group's
brass-heavy disco feel garnered nine Grammy nominations and three
Grammy awards, two of which were for work on the Satuday Night
Fever soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Opening act War formed almost 30 years ago in South Central Los
Angeles to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony. Fusing
rock, jazz, Latin and rhythm and blues, the multi-ethnic ensemble
had major hits with Why Can't We Be Friends?, Low Rider and The
Cisco Kid.
</P>
<P>
   To fans of the smooth-voiced Paul Anka, he's a living legend.
With more than 40 years in show business behind him, Anka has
written hundreds of chart-topping favorites, including Put Your
Head on My Shoulder, My Way and You Are My Destiny. He also can
boast having a record on Billboard's Top-50 chart for five
consecutive decades.
</P>
<P>
   A wunderkind when he started out, Anka was only 16 when his
first hit, ``Diana,'' launched his career. Through the years, his
music has been recorded by such entertainers as Elvis Presley,
Barbra Streisand, Tom Jones, the Doobie Brothers and, of course,
Frank Sinatra, who made Anka's ``My Way `` his signature song.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, the subject of one of the most interesting VH-1
``Behind the Music'' programs, brought us such '80s hits as
``Jesse's Girl,'' ``Don't Talk to Strangers'' and ``Affair of the
Heart, `` while playing the heart-breaking Dr. Noah Drake on the
daytime soap opera ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade away from recording and touring,
Springfield released the introspective album ``Karma'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   The first rock band to give the flute a prominent role in its
instrumental mix, Jethro Tull has sold more than 60 million albums
since the group's formation in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Named for an 18th century English agricultural pioneer, Jethro
Tull has given the world such songs as ``Aqualung,'' ``Bungle in
the Jungle,'' ``Teacher `` and ``Living in the Past.'' And after
30-some years, flutist and vocalist Ian Anderson and guitarist
Martin Barre remain at the heart of the band.
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Michael McDonald _ creator of such hits as
``Takin' It to the Streets,'' ``What a Fool Believes'' and ``I Keep
Forgettin' `` _ followed well-known stints with Steely Dan and the
Doobie Brothers by launching an initially successful solo career in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But we hadn't heard much out of the blue-eyed-soul stylist in a
while, until his recently released ``Blue Obsession `` ended what
turned into a seven-year-long span since his last album of new
material.

 &HT;    Bush's choice frames distinctions between major parties
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Judging by the rhetoric of the times there are
three major political factions in our land: the Republicans, the
Democrats and the ``not a dime's worth of difference'' faction.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``not a dime's difference between the Ds and the Rs.
They're all the same.'' Red ketchup. Green ketchup. Same condiment.
</P>
<P>
   Some who pay attention will note that at times the prevailing
power structures indeed seem to merge _ as in trade and
globalization issues, military pork, or finding ways to avoid
dealing holistically with health-care issues.
</P>
<P>
   But put those aside, look at the record, and one wonders if the
``not a dime's difference'' crowd has sand in its eye from too many
nights on ``Survivor'' island.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Dick Cheney as George Bush's running mate is a
powerful reminder of the differences between the Ds and the Rs. If
Bush has been been able to fuzz matters of ideology while building
centrist poll numbers, his running-mate choice gives voters, at
least those who look, something definitive.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney: anti-gun control at every turn, even against the ban on
cop-killer bullets; hard-line anti-abortion, even in instances of
rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-Cheney: a ticket that may be more beholden to a single
industry than any ticket in history. Sure, everyone has his bread
buttered somewhere. But admit it: This is Big Oil's dream team.
</P>
<P>
   Were we talking dimes? We should be talking silver dollars, gold
doubloons.
</P>
<P>
   OF MATTERS GREEN
</P>
<P>
   On no subject is the difference between Rs and Ds more striking
than on the environment. Though the Clinton administration could be
accused of seeking half-a-loaf solutions, let the record show that
if an R had been in Clinton's seat the last eight years the loaf
would be reduced to post-ash hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important things Clinton did was blunt the Newt
Gingrich-led quest to gut summarily the Environmental Protection
Agency budget.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms of Bush as a callous despoiler of the environment
are hyperbole. But it's no overstatement that Rs in Congress like
Majority Whip Tom DeLay would dance a jig if Bush were in the White
House, license to surgically poke, prod and possibly lobotomize the
EPA.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Sierra Club last week endorsed Gore and not the
the Green Party's Ralph Nader. The club's Green-at-heart types know
the best thing for the environment at this stage is for Clinton to
hand the veto-pen baton to Gore to continue to counter
congressional mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Among that mischief is to block at every turn any federal
initiative that acknowledges man-caused global warming or acts on
the meticulously bargained Kyoto accords aimed at a world reduction
in the use of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Um, excuse me. Did someone say oil?
</P>
<P>
   YES, A DIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   More power to the Greens as a voice about globalization, the
environment and health care. Welcome to the argument, zany
Buchananites. Libertarians? At least you know where you want to go,
even if we don't dare accompany you.
</P>
<P>
   However, for those who insist ``not a dime's worth'' I am
holding up an optical chart three inches from your nose. Let me
help you. That's an E at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between R and D? On reproductive rights. On gun
control. On whether to empty the bank for a missile defense rather
than seek a limited version. On returning regressivity to tax laws
and putting tax cuts as the No. 1 fiscal priority, even with a
national debt to resolve. On vouchers that would undermine public
schools and subsidize religion. On government-imposed religion. On
the impulse to declare racial disparities suddenly all fair and
square.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on. How many dimes will do?

 &HT;    Driving in France always means a race to finish
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Test driving a station wagon is not normally something
that would make my heart skip a beat. But I was driving through the
scenic rolling mountains of southern France. The vehicle was
Volvo's V70 wagon. My drive partner was He Drove/She Drove's Paul
Lienert.
</P>
<P>
   Paul tossed me the keys and assumed the duties of navigator.
Volvo's new turbo wagon is an S80 luxury sedan with a knapsack.
Only the cargo space behind the rear seat distinguishes it from its
five-passenger counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Not far out of Nice, an avocado green ``box'' whizzed past. Paul
noted, ``A Honda Hr-V. It's an SUV that they don't bring into the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   I charged off in hot pursuit. I wanted to get a better look at
this unfamiliar Honda.
</P>
<P>
   I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was having no luck in my
pursuit of the Honda. Don't the French know that SUVs are not
supposed to be driven quickly on twisting, mountain roads? With the
right shoulder nothing more than a craggy mountainside, my
navigator's tense grip on the V-70 door handle was a welcome excuse
to ``let the Honda go.''
</P>
<P>
   On we traveled into rolling farmland. While Paul and I were
solving all the woes of the automotive world, I heard this annoying
little ``beep, beep'' from behind. A quick glance in my rearview
mirror revealed the presence of a Peugeot 106 GTI.
</P>
<P>
   Paul explained that the 106, which is not available in the
United States, is a small puddle jumper with a big 118-horsepower
motor. Then he roars with laughter, ``Doesn't the driver know who
he she is messing with?''
</P>
<P>
   I have a reputation as being a ``driver.'' Paul's comment had
thrown down the challenge. Now, I was not only duty bound, but
obligated to ``dust'' the Peugeot. I clamped down on the V70's
powerful turbocharged six-cylinder, and the Peugeot soon
disappeared. Keeping up my accelerated pace for about five minutes,
I smugly thought to myself, ``Well, I guess we showed them,'' which
also made me feel better about that Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, there again in the rearview mirror was that
aggravating Peugeot. Enough was enough; it was time to concede the
road. As the black 106 pulled alongside, its driver, a young French
girl, sat with both hands planted firmly on the wheel, eyes fixed
straight ahead. Paul and I both waved. There was no acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, we both blurted out, ``She must drive this road
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul politely added, ``Perhaps, she's late for work?'' ``Or
school?''
</P>
<P>
   It could be the reason that race car drivers like Nelson Piquet
or Alain Prost are national heroes. It seems that just about every
French man or woman fancies himself or herself as a future Formula
One racer. Or then again, it could just be that station wagon
thing; no one really wants to get blown away by one.

 &HT;    Red alert_ 2001 Corvette Z06 ready to zoooom
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you think the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 isn't one hot
item, consider this: Somewhere between its manufacture and initial
drives by magazine writers at the proving grounds in Michigan and
Atlanta, the brilliant red car lost the ``Z06'' emblem off its
right front fender _ and chip marks indicated it didn't just fall
off.
</P>
<P>
   But while some may view the insignia as collectible Corvette
memorabilia _ press kits for some models sell for hundreds of
dollars _ Chevrolet insists that the 2001 Z06 isn't going to be a
seldom-seen collector's car. General Motors plans to build 5,000 to
6,000 of the sophisticated beasts, meaning they should account for
about one-fifth of Corvette's projected sales this model year.
</P>
<P>
   Some, no doubt, will wind up on blocks while their owners wait
for them to appreciate from the $47,500 price, but the Z06 is such
fun to drive that it would take a truly mercenary person to just
let one sit.
</P>
<P>
   The Z06 loves to go _ and go it will. This being a time when
manufacturers no longer act coy about the performance potential of
their cars _ cases in point being the Dodge Viper and Ford Mustang
Cobra R _ Chevy blithely tosses out numbers that say, yes, the Z06
is a world-class sports car. It may lack the cachet of a Ferrari or
a Lamborghini, but take it to race or test track, and the Z06 will
hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   Zero to 60 mph happens in about four seconds. Top speed is
estimated at about 170 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its ultra-high performance predecessor, the ZR-1, known
as the ``King of the Hill,'' the Z06 is eminently tractable. The
clutch is a bit heavier than those of most cars, but anyone who can
work a manual shift will have little trouble driving the Z06. The
shifter has a fluidly mechanical feel, and it isn't necessary to do
much more than rest a foot on the brake pedal for the Z06 to say
``Whoa, Nelly'' and stop (60 mph to zero in about 125 feet with
little nose dive).
</P>
<P>
   The Z06 has some distinctive exterior features _ including
five-spoke wheels that show off red brake calipers, mesh-covered
air ducts and four round tail pipes jutting out from under the
center of the squared-off, muscular rear end. But the most
significant difference between the Z06 and ordinary Corvettes is
under the long, flared-fender front end.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the Z06's front-hinged hood and _ yee-ha _ there's a
red-trimmed V-8 that can't wait to rumble and grumble through its
weight-saving, half-titanium exhaust system. Regular Corvette
engines make 345 horsepower, but the Z06 powerplant cranks out 385
hp at 6,000 rpm (it redlines at 6,500 rpm) and 385 pounds-feet of
torque at 4,800 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   As its zero-to-60 mph time indicates, the Z06 launches like a
catapulted airplane with special-made 17-inch Goodyear F1 Supercar
tires up front and 18-inchers at the rear (no spare tire _ just a
pressurized can of sealant). Even with the traction control turned
off, the Z06 has such grip that inducing serious tire spin is
somewhat of an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off for the flat, high-traction ride isn't as severe
as might be expected. The Z06 ride is appropriately firm, but not
uncomfortable so. Perhaps more of an aggravation _ well,
conversation inhibitor _ is the road and engine noise permeating
the cabin (GM uses thinner window glass and less insulation to keep
curb weight down to about 3,100 pounds, 100 or so below that of
other 'Vettes).
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is not without its pleasures, though. The seats are
very accommodating, and the height-adjustable power driver's seat,
in tandem with the tilt steering wheel, enables virtually all
drivers to find a correct/comfortable driving position easily.
Visibility is fairly good with blind spots, as expected, at the
rear quadrants.
</P>
<P>
   Those seats are real eye-poppers, though, trimmed in
red-and-black leather with Z06 insignia at the headrests. The full
and very legible instrumentation is distinguished by italicized
numbers on the 200 mph speedometer and 7,500 rpm tachometer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive performance, which is what makes the Z06
so desirable, there is this to remember: There'll always be another
king of the hill, and anyone who thinks the Corvette engineers
can't wring more muscle out of the 5.7-liter V-8 isn't giving them
their due. To some, the Z06 may seem too good to be true, but it's
not too good to be topped.

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, ire
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 By PAMELA GRIM 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''
 &HT;

worked on two recent missions of Doctors of the World. Later this
month, Warner Books will publish ``Just Here Trying to Save a Few
Lives,'' her collection of stories about emergency-room medicine.)

to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''
 &HT;

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects

girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''

 &HT;    
 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There's a lonesome outpost in the Alaskan interior where
scientists work in wool slippers and all-nighters are standard
procedure, where sunlight is scorned and darkness cherished for the
promises it holds.
 &HT;    That outpost is the science center at the Poker Flat Research
Range, a rocket-launching facility in the hills 30 miles northeast
of Fairbanks. Poker Flat is one of the world's premier centers for
studies of the aurora borealis, the electromagnetic light show that
graces the subarctic firmament almost every night of the year.
 &HT;    Perched on top of a low rise with a uniform view of sky, snow
and spruce, the center sometimes teems with researchers. Tonight,
though, it's the regulars from the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks. They'll while away the wee hours
swapping stories, watching movies, trading computer tips and
waiting for a phantom stream of light.
 &HT;    At peak aurora season, fanatics such as Hans Nielsen, a
fiftysomething Dane, keep vigil in this place every night for weeks
on end.
 &HT;    ``When I get on this schedule, I can't remember one night from
the next,'' he confesses. ``It all becomes a blur.''
 &HT;    Not that he's complaining. Like most of his colleagues, Nielsen
has a special fondness for the northern lights.
 &HT;    In the 1950s, scientists began to understand that the aurora
borealis and its southern conjugate, the aurora australis, are
generated by the interaction of charged particles streaming from
the sun and the magnetic field that surrounds Earth.
 &HT;    The geomagnetic field deflects most of the deadly particle
stream, but in doing so it gets swept out into a comet-shaped
envelope, called the magnetosphere, in which some of the particles
are trapped. Electromagnetic forces energize the trapped particles
and draw them down into Earth's atmosphere at the polar regions,
where they collide with atoms and molecules of gas, producing
light.
 &HT;    No one knows what processes spawn the many guises of the
northern lights _ the rays and arcs, the folds and filaments, the
patches and spirals, the diffuse, pulsating veils. It's still not
clear what factors collude to produce auroral substorms, the
bright, dynamic global displays that create some of the aurora's
most spectacular visual effects.
 &HT;    Most important, experts still can't predict exactly when the
lights will appear. Despite decades of sophisticated studies and
hordes of high-tech gadgetry, auroral prediction remains a practice
that is part plasma physics, part atmospheric science and part
voodoo.
 &HT;    And that shortcoming has become a bit of a problem. Although the
vagaries of the northern lights may not at first glance seem a
matter of critical import, the aurora is a key indicator of
solar-terrestrial interactions, better known as space weather. And
space weather can pack walloping storms that threaten earthlings
and some of their favorite artifacts.
 &HT;    Space weather is conjured by the solar wind, the plasma stream
of charged particles and magnetism that flows continuously from the
sun. When disturbances such as flares erupt on the sun's surface,
the solar wind goes to gale force, prompting pandemonium in the
magnetosphere, particle showers in the upper atmosphere and surges
of current with effects that reach all the way down to the ground.
 &HT;    That sort of high-energy chaos makes for great auroras, but it
can also play havoc with the radio communications, radar systems,
power transmission lines, telephone cables and satellites on which
humanity grows more dependent every day.
 &HT;    An onslaught of charged particles in space can disable
satellites by damaging solar-cell panels and altering digital
signals. Currents induced by the solar wind's fluctuating magnetic
fields can provoke heating and expansion of Earth's upper
atmosphere, dragging down low-flying satellites.
 &HT;    One of the most stunning auroral substorms in recent history has
been blamed for a nine-hour-long power outage that darkened all of
Quebec.
 &HT;    Auroral displays can also disrupt the propagation of radio waves
by changing the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere.
Currents of electricity in auroras 60 miles overhead are believed
to have caused corrosion in oil pipelines, such as the
Trans-Alaska.
 &HT;    With hundreds of telecommunications satellites in orbit and a
way of life sustained by electrical power and oil, the developed
world is more vulnerable than ever before to the hiccups of our
neighboring star.
 &HT;    Small wonder, then, that space-weather prediction has become a
top priority on the nation's research agenda. And with the sun so
close to another solar maximum _ the peak of its 11-year cycle of
activity _ fans of the aurora and of high technology alike are
anticipating some fireworks.
 &HT;    On the second floor of the science center, banks of monitors,
keyboards and computer screens provide links to satellites and
ground sensors near and far.
 &HT;    One screen displays the feed from the Advanced Composition
Explorer, a satellite parked 930,000 miles sunward that detects
perturbations in the solar wind an hour before it gets to our
magnetosphere.
 &HT;    On another screen, graphs generated by the Earth-orbiting GOES
satellite chart the energy stored in the magnetosphere as a result
of interactions with the solar wind. Readings from ground-based
magnetometers relay information about electromagnetic currents in
the upper atmosphere. Should the aurora make an appearance, another
ground-based device called a photometer will record the brightness
of different colors of light in one slice of sky.
 &HT;    And on the science-center rooftop, under a Plexiglas dome, sits
a low-light-level video camera with a fish-eye lens that takes in
the entire sky. Images from this all-sky camera are transmitted
live to every room in the science center, where they show up on
monitors as a black-and-white disk, with black being sky and white
being stars, clouds or aurora.
 &HT;    As Nielsen and his colleague Dirk Lummerzheim arrive at Poker
Flat during a clear Tuesday twilight recently, the first thing they
look for is the all-sky monitor in the kitchen. The monitor shows a
narrow white band at the bottom of the disk _ which, confusingly,
corresponds to the northern horizon.
 &HT;    ``When it's really good, the whole thing gets white,'' says
Lummerzheim, nodding in the direction of the monitor.
 &HT;    Also keeping an eye on the kitchen all-sky is Bob Eather, a
former atmospheric physicist turned filmmaker who lives in
Brookline, Mass. He's hoping to score some footage for an IMAX
movie on the solar maximum.
 &HT;    Poker Flat lies under the auroral zone, a doughnut-shaped
expanse of sky around Earth's geomagnetic pole near Thule,
Greenland. The zone occurs where Earth's magnetic field lines
converge upon the atmosphere as they loop around the planet from
the southern geomagnetic pole to the northern one (there's a
southern auroral zone too).
 &HT;    The field lines act as channels for charged particles, mostly
electrons with some protons mixed in, moving from the magnetosphere
into the ionosphere, the near-vacuumlike layer of charged particles
that reflects radio waves and is one of the outermost blankets of
atmospheric gases. Because the same electromagnetic processes drive
the flow of particles to the northern and southern poles, auroras
tend to happen simultaneously in both hemispheres.
 &HT;    But auroras are not created equal. Magnetic field lines can get
warped, Lummerzheim explains, by interactions with the solar wind.
That's why the aurora borealis hugs the northern horizon when it's
quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 By PAMELA GRIM 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''
 &HT;

worked on two recent missions of Doctors of the World. Later this
month, Warner Books will publish ``Just Here Trying to Save a Few
Lives,'' her collection of stories about emergency-room medicine.)

quiescent; when it becomes more active, the aurora expands to lower
latitudes, sometimes spreading as far south as Mexico. As it moves
over greater areas, it becomes brighter, more restless and more
colorful.
 &HT;    At Poker Flat, the situation has been ``building'' for hours,
with little to show for it. Yet all the portents and omens persist.
So the equipment stays on standby, while Nielsen works out a
software glitch and Lummerzheim catches up on some reading.
 &HT;    Then suddenly, just before midnight, the aurora takes off.
Without preamble the all-sky lights up, and the experts, after
checking their instruments, hasten to the observation room like
eager schoolchildren.
 &HT;    The sparkling firmament writhes with seven gray-green bands that
snake from east to west and stack up north to south. On the ground,
Eather forges out into the cold to man his IMAX camera.
 &HT;    The aurora drops hints of red along its lower edges, then gently
pulses as its bands begin to diffuse. It doesn't last more than a
few minutes, and Lummerzheim maintains that it rates only a five on
a scale from one to 10.
 &HT;    But the display is enough to energize its not-so-tireless
devotees for the next few hours. At this time of year, even the
unadorned darkness seems precious, for in April Alaskan skies begin
to blaze with round-the-clock sunlight, and auroral physicists are
out of business.
 &HT;    Ultimately, and inexplicably, tonight's aurora will disappoint,
retreating to the north and glowing dimly there despite the hopeful
vigilance of the Poker Flat crew. And so finally, at 3:30 a.m.,
there's a general agreement to pack it in.
 &HT;    ``Well, tomorrow is another night,'' Nielsen says.

 By PAMELA GRIM 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The intern had already signed off on the chart when I got to the
room. He stood proudly over his work: seven stitches.
 &HT;    ``How'd she do that?'' I asked him.
 &HT;    The 16-year-old patient answered: ``I cut it on the edge of a
garbage can. I was putting the trash out.''
 &HT;    ``No, you didn't,'' I said.
 &HT;    The intern looked up, startled. The girl turned her face away.
 &HT;    ``Look at that cut,'' I said, folding my arms in front of me.
 &HT;    The bewildered intern peered at it again. An inch and a half
long, the cut traced a short course along the underside of the
girl's right forearm. Another, well-healed scar nearby, almost
twice as long, ended just before her palm crease. The girl turned
her hand over to hide the cut and revealed her fingernails, green
with polish, bitten down to the quick.
 &HT;    ``What am I worried about?'' I quizzed the intern.
 &HT;    ``Infection?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``She needs to be seen by a specialist,'' I said. ``Tell me
which specialist.''
 &HT;    He doubtfully guessed: ``Orthopedics?''
 &HT;    I turned to the girl. ``Honey, who's your psychiatrist?''
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong.''
 &HT;    Now it was my turn to be at a loss. Dr. Pong had died recently.
He had been a wonderful psychiatrist, but three weeks earlier, he
had checked himself into a motel on the south side of town and then
taken a massive overdose of pain relievers. They found him two days
later. It was a tragedy. What were we to tell his patients? His
death even shook the hardened emergency-room staff.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' I said, ``the specialist we need to call is a
psychiatrist. Now, what's the other important question to ask?''
 &HT;    The intern shook his head.
 &HT;    ``Are you right- or left-handed?'' I asked the girl. She
shrugged. ``You're right-handed, aren't you?'' She shrugged again.
 &HT;    I turned back to the intern. ``Why is that important?'' I
reached down and slowly pulled the sleeve up on the girl's left
forearm. The intern stared, his mouth ajar.
 &HT;    Her arm was a maze of scars. Lines crisscrossed every way.
Short, thick scars and great long gashes lined with suture marks
ran her forearm's entire length.
 &HT;    ``You did that?'' whispered the intern.
 &HT;    The girl looked away, embarrassed and proud. Now it was the
intern's turn to ask the pertinent questions. ``Why?''
 &HT;    ``I dunno,'' said the girl.
 &HT;    We needed to call for her chart, but I knew what it would
contain. She would have been diagnosed as borderline, as in
borderline personality disorder. Self-inflicted injuries are a
common feature of this psychiatric syndrome.
 &HT;    Borderlines live in a no-man's-land where features of cognitive
disorders _ disorders of thinking, such as schizophrenia _ overlap
with features of mood disorders, such as depression.
 &HT;    Many health-care workers who deal with borderlines feel their
disorder combines the worst features of cognitive and affective
disorders. The patients are extremely problematic to treat _
unpredictable, manipulative and exasperating. Treatment usually
combines both therapy and a medication such as Prozac or Zoloft.
 &HT;    Not all patients who cut themselves are borderlines. Some
otherwise well-functioning people use the pain of a cut and the
sight of blood as a way to cope with an emotional problem. Somehow
it seems to provide a temporary relief from the inner turmoil they
feel.
 &HT;    And many borderline patients ``dissociate,'' removing
themselves, body and soul, from the world. They are very difficult
to treat. After all, how do you talk with someone about something
he did when he wasn't there?
 &HT;    I squatted down so that I could look at my patient from a
nonthreatening position.
 &HT;    ``Tell us what happened today,'' I said, as gently as I could.
She shrugged. ``Problems lately?'' She shook her head. ``What's
going on at home?'' I asked her. Her shoulders started to shake.
She looked away, trying not to cry. ``Who's at home with you?''
``My brother and my mother.'' ``How are they doing?'' She shrugged.
``They're OK.'' No spark there. ``You go to high school?'' She
looked at me. ``It's summer vacation,'' she said. I tried again.
``You have a boyfriend?'' She looked away, somehow managing to look
both tearful and bored.
 &HT;    The intern had asked ``why?'' I thought about what I usually
tell residents about borderlines. I thought about self-mutilation,
dissociation, cutting. I had to ask myself: In all honesty, how
could that be a comfort?
 &HT;    Then a thought occurred to me. It was so obvious I felt like an
idiot.
 &HT;    ``Dr. Pong,'' I said. She stopped looking bored and started to
cry in earnest. ``He left me,'' she said. There was that same
question: Why?
 &HT;    Dr. Pong was married to an anesthesiologist, a lovely woman;
they had three kids. He had a good practice, and his patients
adored him. What dark place had he sheltered within, invisible to
us? How could all of us who lived right beside him, talked to him a
half dozen times a day, admitted patients to him _ how could we all
be so oblivious?
 &HT;    He had been on call that weekend. We had tried to reach him all
day Saturday and then again on Sunday. We ended up calling another
staff psychiatrist to admit the patients. Monday afternoon, while
she was working in surgery, his wife got the news. Eventually it
filtered down to us in everyday life's matter-of-fact indifference
to tragedy. Dr. Pong, we were told, would not be taking calls this
week. We were to call another psychiatrist.
 &HT;    I thought of his children, his patients, this patient. Once upon
a time, this girl probably couldn't see an inch beyond her own pain
and suffering. Dr. Pong had given her, perhaps, a tenuous
connection to other people, to the rest of the world, and with that
he brought all the joys of such connections _ and all the pain.
 &HT;    I stood up, trying to find comforting words. I thought again of
the explanations I always give the residents about cutting and its
paradoxical relief of tension. Then the causes: sexual abuse, poor
parenting. But can we ever explain anything? Do we really have
reasons or just rationales?
 &HT;    To be honest with myself, I would have to confess that no matter
how much I might try, I could never really pick out the path that
leads a patient from childhood to this place. If I were honest, I
would have to confess that other than knowing a few buzzwords, I
was as clueless as the intern.
 &HT;    He was standing to the side, shaking his head at his own
stupidity. I knew that feeling. I had been there many times myself.
 &HT;    I left the patient to the intern. He gathered himself up and
stepped closer to her bedside. He was the kind of person who felt
terrible when he made mistakes that might hurt a patient. It was a
feeling that would make him a first-class physician someday.
 &HT;    The two of us crossed paths on the way to the door.
 &HT;    ``By the way,'' I whispered to him. ``Great job on the
sutures.''
 &HT;

Lives,'' her collection of stories about emergency-room medicine.)

SIX YEARS AFTER MURDERS, O.J. SIMPSON STILL EVOKES STRONG

<P>
   O.J. Say two little letters, get a big response -- everything
from anger that O.J. Simpson remains in the public eye, to pride
that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J. Simpson's
acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible
for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral
emotions?
</P>
<P>
   Is it Simpson himself? Just this week he's sparked controversy
by appearing on the ``Today'' show to promote his latest venture
(www.askoj.com) -- and by not being a guest on ``The View,'' after
fans of that talk show protested his scheduled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum? Do the news and
entertainment media cover O.J. because the public remains
fascinated, or is the public fascinated because the news and
entertainment media cover him?
</P>
<P>
   Even experts differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored with the subject, and my students are. They yawn
when I bring it up,'' said Frankie Bailey, a University of Albany
specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture. ``I
know the media are still interested. People may just be dragged
along behind the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell M. Hunt disagrees. ``I don't think the case will ever be
NOT interesting,'' said Hunt, director of African-American studies
and an associate sociology professor at University of Southern
California. ``People will always be somewhat titillated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Joshua Meyrowitz, professor of communication at the
University of New Hampshire, it's ``shortcut journalism. That's the
reason why O.J. and others like JonBenet Ramsey and Elian Gonzalez
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's not so much (that) the public is interested,
it's that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured
out how simple it is to report these cases. It doesn't require
research, or understanding of complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the World Wide Web, the 645 members of one O.J.
newsgroup (alt.fan.oj-simpson) still debate, every day, the
minutiae of his guilt or innocence. They even have labels for their
split, the ``No-J's'' and the ``Pro-J's.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,272 topics include everything from the gruesome (``Nicole,
whose trachea was severed, did not even aspirate a single drop of
blood...'') to the mundane (``Kato saw the golf bag about 10:55
p.m. outside the front door, when Simpson was still in the
house...'')
</P>
<P>
   One member is Betty Parker, 60, a General Motors retiree in
Trenton, N.J. She's pondered, or researched, or written on, or read
about the case ``from Day One,'' she said, and continues to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, ``I didn't even like O.J.,'' Parker said. ``But I
started watching, and I found myself thinking, `That's strange,'''
about so many details.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody glove, for instance. ``Why would a killer leave that
behind at the scene?'' Or Simpson's injured finger. ``If he was in
a life-and-death struggle he would have practically sliced it off,
but it was just a tiny cut.''
</P>
<P>
   For Parker, such nagging questions never have been answered, and
in their wake is a different America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African American, I feel my people are being punished
for taking this (innocent) position,'' she said. ``There are people
in board rooms making decisions, who are still embittered over the
O.J. Simpson verdict. And those decisions are their retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's Hunt, author of ``O.J. Simpson Facts and Fictions: News
Rituals in the Construction of Reality,'' agreed that race is a
prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point. ``I think the case
might be seen as a giant Rorschach test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trials forced America to consider three hot-button topics
simultaneously, Hunt said:
</P>
<P>
   -- Race, as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gender, with the allegations of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   -- And class, with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a ``dream
team'' of attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are issues we continue to wrestle with,'' Hunt
added.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, there's disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I encounter, the subject of O.J. just never comes
up,'' said Bailey from the University of Albany. ``I think by this
time, most people have reached their own conclusions about the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing isn't in dispute: that O.J. Simpson is a permanent
fixture in American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outspoken, he continues to talk about it,'' Bailey said.
``As an academic, I'll be interested to see how many hits he gets
on his new Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Simpson ever be able to stroll down a street and not evoke
a response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely not,'' Hunt said. ``I just can't see it. Until
he dies, he'll be a symbol of where we are as a society.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HISTORY'S MOBILE MOMENTS

 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 30.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a summer day 32 years ago, the late Jacob Javits,
seeking to catch a shuttle to Washington for a key Senate vote, got
a ride to New York's LaGuardia Airport in his law partner's plush
limo.
</P>
<P>
   The car came with a radio telephone which accessed the 30
channels then available throughout New York City for public use. On
Javits' behest, I waited until one of 30 red lights finally turned
green and then asked the mobile operator to connect us with an
airline dispatcher. They held the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Those overburdened 30 channels came to mind the other day while
I stood in front of the Yale Club of New York, around the corner
from the old Hotel Roosevelt, where I had served as Javits'
campaign press secretary in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Before pulling up, I called a Manhattan garage from the Lincoln
Tunnel on my car's mobile phone. In waiting some five minutes for
the valet attendant to show up, 45 people had walked by on that
busy sidewalk talking on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's become common at congressional hearings to ask
folks to turn off their pagers before paging the first witness.
Some trendy Manhattan eateries have taken to asking patrons for
their cell phone preference _ on or off. No longer does the maitre
d' come by to plug in celebrity diners.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile phone scene has changed since 1984, when an attorney
friend told me that he would be getting a car phone in return for
having done legal work for a pioneering telecom provider. In time,
he passed up that swap. But I bought a phone, to the surprise of
dinner hosts who directed us into their unmarked cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or so, thade group reported, isn't expected to
stop, or even slow down, anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 percent of the U.S. population already gone wireless,
usage continues to grow at the rate of 67,082 new subscribers each
day, which works out to a new subscriber every 1.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It took 16 years to get to 100 million mobile users. By
contrast, it took 54 years for TV sets to reach 100 million
households; it took cars 68 years to reach 100 million parking
spaces, and it took 91 years for telephone land lines to reach 100
million customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to where cell phones even provide column fodder for
such renowned pundits as William Safire of The New York Times.
Safire recently keyboarded a column on behalf of beleaguered folks
who do not ``wish to hear any of their tidbits or their stock
trading results that they discuss over their little wireless
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Safire rarely employs e-mail and never uses his cell phone while
crossing the street. But I rather suspect that Jacob Javits,
Safire's onetime friend and my former boss, whose centennial falls
due soon, might have been known to his admirers as the Mobile
Senator.

due soon, might have been known to his admirers as the Mobile
Senator.

   PHILADELPHIA _ The thought of Republicans convening in the City
of Brotherly Love doesn't exactly inspire boogie-down images of
``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   But convention planners swear it's gonna be a grand old party.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there will be scads of parties for the 5,000 or so
delegates and alternates, 15,000 journalists and media technicians,
and uncounted legions of lobbyists, campaign contributors and
assorted political groupies already assembling for the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not counting Sunday's parade featuring Corpzilla, a
giant paper-mache multi-national financial monster, an anti-death
penalty Executioners Ball, and other activities planned by the
20,000 protesters who aim to crash the scene.
</P>
<P>
   W.C. Fields wasn't praising his home town's party-hearty
attitude when he suggested that his epitaph say: ``On the whole,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.'' But this historic city founded by
Quakers is likely to be a lively place starting Saturday and
continuing through Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   From the protesters pounding on plastic buckets in the streets
to delegate gatherings featuring musicians ranging from Blues
Traveler to Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Philly will throb with beats you can
dance to.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Clark is returning to the birthplace of ``American
Bandstand'' to emcee two GOP shindigs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., recruited Clark _
along with Bobby Vee, the Shirelles and the Four Tops _ for a
Sunday night oldies show at the Pennsylvania National Guard Armory.
</P>
<P>
   The following night, Clark will be watching dancers bop and
twist at a ``Bandstand'' reunion of sorts at the Enterprise Center,
which was the TV studio when the show was produced in Philadelphia.
The singers this time will be aging home boys Chubby Checker, Bobby
Rydell and Frankie Avalon. This affair was arranged by Rep. Michael
Oxley, R-Ohio, whose wife, Pat, grew up in Philadelphia and danced
on ``Bandstand'' as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley, who would like to become chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, is in a let-the-good-times-roll competition with Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La., who has similar ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin is wooing committee colleagues with crawfish rather than
cheese steaks. On Tuesday night, he's hosting a huge Mardi
Gras-flavored party at the Naval Business Center's cruise ship
terminal. This time, the dancing will be to Bayou fiddles and
guests will feast on jambalaya and other Cajun fare prepared by
chef Jimmy Gravois, the congressman's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the salsa beat, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., predicts
the ``premiere party'' will be the Wednesday night fiesta featuring
Latin music at the Shampoo Night Club. Jon Secada, a Cuban-born
singer from Miami, will perform at the event honoring the House
Entertainment Industry Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these events have corporate backing. For instance,
sponsors of the Latin music party include the Recording Industry
Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America,
Time Warner, the Walt Disney Corp., Viacom and Seagram/Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for the sake of equal political opportunism, many of
the same corporations and trade associations will be sponsoring
parties for the Democrats when they convene in Los Angeles in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other political parties of note: the Temptations will sing at
tribute for Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., on Sunday at the Reading
Terminal train shed. Michael J. Fox and Heather Locklear will
mingle at George Magazine's benefit for Parkinson's Disease
research on Wednesday at a Kenneth Cole store. Blues Traveler will
perform at a Monday night concert hosted by House Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas. Boxers Joe Frazier, Michael Spinks, Larry Holmes and Roy
Jones Jr. will mix it up _ socially that is _ with guests of the
National Republican Senatorial Committee's ``Fight Night'' party at
the cruise ship terminal.
</P>
<P>
   And it'll all climax with Brooks &AMP; Dunn starring at a
boot-scootin' boogie for George W. and Laura Bush after Thursday
night's acceptance speech by the Texas governor and Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, though, Philadelphia will have thrown a few parties
itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, the city will welcome delegates with a parade
of lighted boats and fireworks on the Delaware River and a
``Stately Dessert'' at the Camden Waterfront. The desserts include
Philadelphia water ice, Pennsylvania shoofly pie, New York
cheesecake, Florida key lime pie and ``Texas Brown Sugar Cookies''
made from Laura Bush's recipe.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a summer Mummer's Parade and Wawa Hoagie Day will
give the delegates a taste of two Philadelphia traditions. The
costumed Mummers will give a rendition of the parade they have
performed every New Year's Day since 1901. Wawa _ a local chain of
convenience stores _ will break its own hoagie record by
constructing a 6,700 foot sandwich. Willard Scott will get to eat
the first slice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sandwiches, on Wednesday, delegates will be bused to
South Philly's open-air Italian Market for a ``Carnevale'' with
cheese steaks, sausage-and-pepper subs and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mega-events, there will be scores of cocktail
parties, brunches, lunches (including a huge one for Laura Bush
hosted by the National Federation of Republican Women on Wednesday)
and assorted other activities. For instance, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., is taking some campaign contributors fly-fishing,
and there will be golf outings and a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said DeLay has made elaborate efforts as a ``thank you''
to Republican House members. A train has been parked near the First
Union Center stocked with food and drink and computers and news
wires and TVs. Members of Congress can ride over on golf carts if
they need a break from the convention _ or its parties.

 &HT;    Moving in the commentary (k) and national (a) categories.
 &HT;    Resending to fix transmission garbles.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a summer day 32 years ago, the late Jacob Javits,
seeking to catch a shuttle to Washington for a key Senate vote, got
a ride to New York's LaGuardia Airport in his law partner's plush
limo.
</P>
<P>
   The car came with a radio telephone which accessed the 30
channels then available throughout New York City for public use. On
Javits' behest, I waited until one of 30 red lights finally turned
green and then asked the mobile operator to connect us with an
airline dispatcher. They held the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Those overburdened 30 channels came to mind the other day while
I stood in front of the Yale Club of New York, around the corner
from the old Hotel Roosevelt, where I had served as Javits'
campaign press secretary in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Before pulling up, I called a Manhattan garage from the Lincoln
Tunnel on my car's mobile phone. In waiting some five minutes for
the valet attendant to show up, 45 people had walked by on that
busy sidewalk talking on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's become common at congressional hearings to ask
folks to turn off their pagers before paging the first witness.
Some trendy Manhattan eateries have taken to asking patrons for
their cell phone preference _ on or off. No longer does the maitre
d' come by to plug in celebrity diners.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile phone scene has changed since 1984, when an attorney
friend told me that he would be getting a car phone in return for
having done legal work for a pioneering telecom provider. In time,
he passed up that swap. But I bought a phone, to the surprise of
dinner hosts who directed us into their unmarked cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or so, that single-antenna firm had gone belly up
because, as it turned out, cell phones were the way to go. So I
switched to a $950 Motorola model, becoming one of the first
200,000 subscribers in the country to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association announced the anonymous arrival of the nation's 100
millionth wireless subscriber. This rapid mobile growth, the
industry trade group reported, isn't expected to stop, or even slow
down, anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 percent of the U.S. population already gone wireless,
usage continues to grow at the rate of 67,082 new subscribers each
day, which works out to a new subscriber every 1.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It took 16 years to get to 100 million mobile users. By
contrast, it took 54 years for TV sets to reach 100 million
households; it took cars 68 years to reach 100 million parking
spaces, and it took 91 years for telephone land lines to reach 100
million customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to where cell phones even provide column fodder for
such renowned pundits as William Safire of The New York Times.
Safire recently keyboarded a column on behalf of beleaguered folks
who do not ``wish to hear any of their tidbits or their stock
trading results that they discuss over their little wireless
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Safire rarely employs e-mail and never uses his cell phone while
crossing the street. But I rather suspect that Jacob Javits,
Safire's onetime friend and my former boss, whose centennial falls
due soon, might have been known to his admirers as the Mobile
Senator.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least once a week I'm hit with the question: ``How long does
it take you to write one of those columns of yours?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I would give a long, self-indulgent,
it's-not-as-easy-as-it-looks kind of answer, something along the
lines of:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well of course, it all depends on the subject matter. It can
take a few hours, or it can take days or even weeks to put together
a single column, which is why I work on several of them
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I might have to make phone calls, interview people,
attend events or press conferences, do library and Internet
research _ all sorts of things like that. And then sometimes I do
all that legwork, only to come to the hard conclusion that what I
have isn't a column at all, so I have to start from scratch and
come up with something before my deadline ...''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I'd start to see the glazed look in their eyes.
Nobody cares that much, unless it's another columnist who wants to
be reassured that it's not any easier for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   So now when people ask me how long it takes to write a column, I
affect a slightly British accent and say, ``Exactly three hours and
16 minutes, every time. Quite odd, actually, but I don't question
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems to satisfy folks.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you do for a living, there seems to be that one
question you'll hear again and again _ and the inquisitor is
inevitably under the mistaken impression that you've never heard
such an insightful and marvelously curious piece of interrogation
in your lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the theory that was advanced in a recent
conversation among colleagues, and the more I thought about it, the
more I believed this theory. Every job has its built-in question.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a cop, people want to know if you've ever had to fire
your gun.
</P>
<P>
   If you fought in a war, the question, of course, is, ``Did you
kill anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   If you work with someone famous, everyone wants to know:
``What's the celebrity really like?''
</P>
<P>
   (The answer to this question is usually, ``Oh, he's so nice!''
But let's be honest, it's much more interesting to hear, ``Oh, he's
an incredible jackass!'' For instance, when I was working in radio
... ah, just kidding.)
</P>
<P>
   Pizza parlor employees, I'll wager, are always asked if they're
sick of America's favorite food, what with making it and smelling
it and delivering it for eight hours at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Bartenders are asked if they water down the drinks. Or maybe
it's: ``Do you get to drink for free?''
</P>
<P>
   Toll booth workers? We want to know when and where they go to
the bathroom!
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a gynecologist, the boor who's had three martinis
at the party probably gives you a nudge and asks ...
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at a party, I never tell people I work for a
prestigious Wall Street investment company,'' says a friend of
mine. ``If I do, I'm swarmed with questions about stocks. So I just
say I sell insurance; nobody corners you to ask a million questions
about insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but there's probably some query that insurance brokers are
sick of hearing. Probably something along the lines of, ``Why do my
rates keep going up if I haven't been in an accident in 14 years?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me how much of a discount I get on
clothes,'' says a friend who works at an upscale store. ``Isn't
that kind of rude when you think about it? I mean, I don't ask
about the perks or benefits of their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure is rude. So anyway, how much of a discount do you get?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty percent. Sweet deal, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   What's the one question about work that you always hear? And
what's your response? I'd like to test my theory, with your help.
Drop me a line at 401 N. Wabash, Chicago, 60611; or e-mail me at
rroeper &LR; suntimes.com with a brief description of your job, the
question you're sick of and your response.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you've got a job that doesn't lend itself to any kind
of one-question curiosity. I'd like to hear about that too.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, hardly anybody ever asks the real question that pops
into mind, no matter what the profession _ the question that would
fly out of all of our mouths if we were injected with truth serum:
</P>
<P>
   ``So how much do you make doing that?''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The bull market has not just been on the stock exchange but in
exchanges themselves. The frenzy to find business-to-business uses
of the Internet is prompting people to create online exchanges
where companies will be able to trade everything from sheet steel
to hotel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric K. Clemons, a professor in the Information Strategy,
Systems and Economics group at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says that many of them are doomed
to repeat the mistakes of their financial predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the lessons from the financial markets in a recent
series of e-mail messages. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Electronic-trading exchanges first began opening in financial
markets 15 years ago, amid great skepticism by traditional traders
that they would work. Why did some work and others not?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: I guess the biggest difference between success and
failure continues to be liquidity. When there are enough buyers and
sellers to determine an effective price, then online trading can
occur.
</P>
<P>
   If buyers and sellers are widely separated in time, and if there
is little information on ``comparables'' to help buyers or sellers
determine fair prices, then intermediaries will continue to serve
an essential function. Thus, I would not expect to see real-estate
agents disappear anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, exchanges didn't help instruments that no one
understands or no one wants to trade, such as contracts tied to
hurricanes in Florida, the cost of cellular air time in August in
midtown Manhattan or other forms of catastrophic risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But online exchanges also failed in the United States in some
very liquid markets, such as futures.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: It's hard to get market participants to leave a
structure that's liquid and working well, even if it is not working
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, online trading has captured markets abroad where there had
been no previous exchange or where the existing stock market had
been less efficient and more expensive than its U.S. equivalents.
Online trading in the U.S. continues principally to provide
lower-cost access to existing exchanges, rather than replacing
these existing exchanges, in general because they have been doing
such a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sort of industrial markets will be most suited to
online exchanges?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: The invisible hand of the marketplace does the best job
when buyers and sellers are fragmented and thousands of small
orders interact simultaneously. This is true whether I want to buy
1,000 shares of IBM at the current price on a stock exchange or if
I want to buy 1,000 standard memory chips in one of the emerging
industrial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding principle here is that the random flow of small
orders is sufficient to assure that the market finds the right
price.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what about the proposed exchanges in industries like auto
parts, where there are a handful of buyers and not all that many
sellers of each type of item?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: If the order flow is heavily concentrated in a small
number of buyers or a small number of sellers, or if delivery must
be carefully coordinated and scheduled between buyer and seller,
then an exchange is likely to be less effective.
</P>
<P>
   If I need several million fuel injectors or pistons, an
exchange-based market will not be my best alternative. If my
pistons arrive too late, my production line will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In business environments such as these, I will want to carefully
negotiate order quantities and delivery schedules, quality levels
and purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people say the real value of the exchanges in the
long run won't be the lower transaction costs or even the lower
prices, but the efficiencies throughout the production stream that
would flow from the instant, universal, transparent demand
information being shared. I take it you don't completely agree.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: That's right. For some industries full transparency
will indeed produce allocative efficiency _ by setting the right
prices, based on aggregating supply and demand, the product will
end up in the hands of the customers who value it most highly. In
industries with rapidly evolving products _ personal computers _
this might indeed be a new and optimal design.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases the key issue is not determining the right price,
but scheduling delivery of the right quantity at the right time.
Ford or GM might be more concerned with assuring that spark plugs
and fuel injectors arrive in the right-sized batches at precisely
the right times to avoid disrupting their assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right quantity of products at the right time is
closer to traditional supply-chain optimization than it is to the
design of trading mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people argue that one benefit of these new exchanges is
that they open up world markets, allowing a small steelmaker in
Thailand to find a buyer in Peru. Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: Globalization of markets and exchanges, likewise, will
be important only if buyers and sellers have a real need for global
access. But when they do, geographical separation appears to be no
longer relevant as a barrier to trading, as long as the item's
description is clear enough to be described online without too much
ambiguity, and its value is sufficient to justify shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit that the online trading of Beanie Babies through
eBay caught me pretty much by surprise.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The bull market has not just been on the stock exchange but in
exchanges themselves. The frenzy to find business-to-business uses
of the Internet is prompting people to create online exchanges
where companies will be able to trade everything from sheet steel
to hotel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Eric K. Clemons, a professor in the Information Strategy,
Systems and Economics group at the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says that many of them are doomed
to repeat the mistakes of their financial predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the lessons from the financial markets in a recent
series of e-mail messages. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Electronic-trading exchanges first began opening in financial
markets 15 years ago, amid great skepticism by traditional traders
that they would work. Why did some work and others not?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: I guess the biggest difference between success and
failure continues to be liquidity. When there are enough buyers and
sellers to determine an effective price, then online trading can
occur.
</P>
<P>
   If buyers and sellers are widely separated in time, and if there
is little information on ``comparables'' to help buyers or sellers
determine fair prices, then intermediaries will continue to serve
an essential function. Thus, I would not expect to see real-estate
agents disappear anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, exchanges didn't help instruments that no one
understands or no one wants to trade, such as contracts tied to
hurricanes in Florida, the cost of cellular air time in August in
midtown Manhattan or other forms of catastrophic risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But online exchanges also failed in the United States in some
very liquid markets, such as futures.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: It's hard to get market participants to leave a
structure that's liquid and working well, even if it is not working
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, online trading has captured markets abroad where there had
been no previous exchange or where the existing stock market had
been less efficient and more expensive than its U.S. equivalents.
Online trading in the U.S. continues principally to provide
lower-cost access to existing exchanges, rather than replacing
these existing exchanges, in general because they have been doing
such a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what sort of industrial markets will be most suited to
online exchanges?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: The invisible hand of the marketplace does the best job
when buyers and sellers are fragmented and thousands of small
orders interact simultaneously. This is true whether I want to buy
1,000 shares of IBM at the current price on a stock exchange or if
I want to buy 1,000 standard memory chips in one of the emerging
industrial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding principle here is that the random flow of small
orders is sufficient to assure that the market finds the right
price.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what about the proposed exchanges in industries like auto
parts, where there are a handful of buyers and not all that many
sellers of each type of item?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: If the order flow is heavily concentrated in a small
number of buyers or a small number of sellers, or if delivery must
be carefully coordinated and scheduled between buyer and seller,
then an exchange is likely to be less effective.
</P>
<P>
   If I need several million fuel injectors or pistons, an
exchange-based market will not be my best alternative. If my
pistons arrive too late, my production line will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In business environments such as these, I will want to carefully
negotiate order quantities and delivery schedules, quality levels
and purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lot of people say the real value of the exchanges in the
long run won't be the lower transaction costs or even the lower
prices, but the efficiencies throughout the production stream that
would flow from the instant, universal, transparent demand
information being shared. I take it you don't completely agree.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: That's right. For some industries full transparency
will indeed produce allocative efficiency _ by setting the right
prices, based on aggregating supply and demand, the product will
end up in the hands of the customers who value it most highly. In
industries with rapidly evolving products _ personal computers _
this might indeed be a new and optimal design.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases the key issue is not determining the right price,
but scheduling delivery of the right quantity at the right time.
Ford or GM might be more concerned with assuring that spark plugs
and fuel injectors arrive in the right-sized batches at precisely
the right times to avoid disrupting their assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right quantity of products at the right time is
closer to traditional supply-chain optimization than it is to the
design of trading mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people argue that one benefit of these new exchanges is
that they open up world markets, allowing a small steelmaker in
Thailand to find a buyer in Peru. Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   CLEMONS: Globalization of markets and exchanges, likewise, will
be important only if buyers and sellers have a real need for global
access. But when they do, geographical separation appears to be no
longer relevant as a barrier to trading, as long as the item's
description is clear enough to be described online without too much
ambiguity, and its value is sufficient to justify shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit that the online trading of Beanie Babies through
eBay caught me pretty much by surprise.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the early rounds of the online banking competition, the
surprising outcome is that the big commercial banks have not been
beaten to the punch by nimbler young challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the brokerage titans of Wall Street that steadfastly
refused to recognize the threat posed by Internet-based stock
trading competitors, commercial banks have been wrestling with the
Web for years. But the results of those efforts have ranged from
modest success to spectacular failure.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that, unlike online stock trading, online banking
has not, so far, been a killer app. Consumers have been just as
slow as the banks to accept the Internet as a medium for managing
everyday money matters.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of American consumers bank online. Last
year, about 8.3 million people shopped the Internet for mortgages
and other loans, but only one in eight even started the
loan-application process online, said Robert Sterling, an analyst
with Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The real challenge to established banks may just be arriving, in
the form of companies that combine banking with other services
online. Control of consumers' financial information is so critical
to establishing bonds with them that it has attracted a host of
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ETrade Group, the electronic brokerage firm, is
making a big push for its ETrade Bank, which was known as Telebank
before ETrade bought it earlier this year. ETrade also bought a
network of more than 8,800 automated teller machines. The company
eventually hopes to link those ATMs with its Web sites so that
customers can withdraw cash from bank or brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional banks take some comfort in ETrade's moves because
they reinforce the belief that Internet-only banks have limited
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of Net-only banks seems so exciting,'' said Bruce
Zimmerman, a senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank. ``The
reality is, there aren't many customers who want to do everything
only over the Net. That's why you've seen that Net-only models
haven't been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   To build business quickly, most Internet banks have taken
advantage of their slim cost structures by paying higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, paying above-market rates to attract deposits
has never been a path to profits. Indeed, that tactic contributed
to the failure of many savings and loans in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The people most likely to shop for the best rates are retirees,
Sterling said, and they are unlikely to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet banks, the most visible disappointment has been
WingspanBank.com, the electronic bank created by the Bank One Corp.
After spending about $35 million on advertising for Wingspan, Bank
One put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's Citibank has also struggled with its Internet
strategy. Even with its latest electronic offering, called Citi
f/i, Citibank, the nation's largest bank, trails Wells Fargo and
Bank of America in the number of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the slower migration online for
bank customers compared with investors, according to analysts and
industry executives. One of the most important is that electronic
discount brokerages opened up a simple, affordable route for
investors. Another is that investors were not accustomed to
visiting brokerage offices with any regularity, while many bank
customers still stop at their neighborhood branch regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks are following a trail that was blazed in the brokerage
business by Charles Schwab: They are working toward making their
services available online, over the phone and in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe people will want a choice of how they access the
bank,'' Zimmerman said. ``And we believe customers will value a
seamless financial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are not so smooth just yet. Traditional banks are ahead
of the game if they have made all account information accessible to
customers online, said Matt Cone, senior vice president of
marketing for the Corillian Corp., a provider of Internet banking
software in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of financial institutions that still have
yet to get to first base,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said that making account information available
electronically was a step toward offering what customers really
want: a single, online source of up-to-date information about their
finances, including savings and checking accounts, credit cards,
mutual funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, banks are facing new challengers: upstarts that
want to give people one place on the Web where they can check on
accounts scattered among several companies, from savings at a bank
to brokerage accounts to frequent-flier mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, such as Yodlee.com and X.com, are offering to
gather account information from disparate sources and compile it
for a quick survey. The technology that these companies use is
known as ``screen scraping'' because it requires them to use
customers' account numbers and passwords to collect confidential
data posted by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are hoping that most consumers will not trust other
companies, especially new dot-com ventures, with access to such
important personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The faith that most consumers place in traditional banks is a
powerful competitive advantage, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem banks have had historically is that they rely on
that and so they could take their sweet time to get there.''

&HT;     IS IT REAL OR IS IT VIRTUAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After the Air France Concorde fell in flames
from the sky, an American musician who witnessed the crash told
reporters, ``It looked just like virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know what he meant. It's not that the crash was any less
horrific to this young man, or that his mind is controlled by an
unholy alliance of Sega and Industrial Light and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of us, he simply sees the world as if through a
cathode ray tube. That's the way we're used to seeing things, and
the way we talk is with the language of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is almost as realistic as computerized special effects.
A hurricane is imperfectly horrendous, unlike George Clooney's
perfect storm. Kids shoot down their classmates as if they were
playing a video game, or so some witnesses said at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   After a plane crash, a hurricane or a mass shooting, the scene
is invariably described by someone who never went to war but
watched a lot of war movies as looking ``like a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The trenches of the First World War were described as looking
like slaughterhouses, but that term has lost literal meaning. Most
Americans have never seen an animal slaughtered, except for that
rat on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a little too realistic and caused an uproar, even
among those who hire mercenaries from Orkin to slaughter rodents en
masse.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality, big deal, big cliche. Virtual unreality is the
order of the day, and ``Survivor'' is the summer's leading example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' is a bomb because the idea of locking a dozen
boring people in a house together is too close to a certain
reality. It's like college, all talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' in contrast, offers fake jungle escapism for
viewers trapped in the virtual real life of cell phones, beepers,
Palm Pilots and personal computers. Lords of the computer files get
to watch people just like them playing Lord of the Flies.
</P>
<P>
   And now all kinds of things once considered reality are
described in ``Survivor'' terms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because politicians are so close to virtual unreality to
begin with, every political commentator in America has used
``Survivor'' metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit, the idea of stranding George W. Bush and Al
Gore on an island not named Martha's Vineyard is a very appealing
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Political conventions are a prime example of virtual unreality.
But unlike ``Survivor,'' this summer no one will be watching
because the conventions are rigged, rehearsed and we know who the
winners will be.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists are talking about the ``story line'' each
convention will present on behalf of the candidates, but we're too
media-wise to buy that kind of stuff. We want real virtual
unreality. Yuppies showing off tattoos and jungle rot with skimpy
bathing suits is as virtually unreal as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   We won't be watching those conventions. Besides, the only bare
flesh and tattoos will be outside the convention halls among the
anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The more I think about it, the more it makes sense that an
airhead nonentity named George W. Bush stands a very good chance of
being elected president of the United States. After 50 years of
television, vacuity makes us feel comfortable.

   Who cares if Bush has a brain? He has the best of advisers, and
a very serious running mate, to take its place.
</P>
<P>
   The proof that the nation has become virtually unreal is the
polling that says voters agree with Gore's position on the major
issues, but prefer to elect Bush as president.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't even a matter of style over substance, since Bush
doesn't have any more style than Gore. It's the comfort of his
nothingness. He's as unreal as America feels.

&HT;     NO ROOM AT THE ER

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Emergency room nurse Mary Comber was succinct
and direct in her open letter to the mayor of San Francisco and
Board of Supervisors:
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is bad and getting worse . . . Will the city
step up and do the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is that an unholy number of drunk or drugged-out
indigent San Franciscans are adding a dangerous load to the city's
already-burdened emergency medical services network.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it?
</P>
<P>
   Comber's letter was signed by 345 nurses, doctors, paramedics
and other employees of every emergency room in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As the size of the city's drunk and drug-addicted population has
increased over the past few years, a 1997 change in police
department policy has added to the problem of dealing with and
caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of automatically arresting a drunk or out-of-it addict
and letting him or her ``sleep it off'' in jail, cops are required
to take all but the most pulled-together to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, if a person is found lying or sitting in a public
place, with altered mental status and unable to walk, he/she is
taken to a city ER for evaluation,'' wrote Comber.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . The result is that the city emergency rooms have to
devote much-needed beds to patients who are inebriated and
generally have no other medical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At Davies Medical Center, where Comber is a nurse, that can mean
almost half the ER's 11 beds are filled with people whose only
physical problem is being loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Comber and her colleagues say many of the city's strung-out may
be unable to stay clean and sober, but they have grown very
sophisticated about the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``People apprehended in the commission of a crime, or for public
intoxication, know they need only state that they have chest pain
or are unable to walk or are going to have a seizure, and an
ambulance will be called,'' Comber wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these patients refuse to leave the hospital after
being medically screened, and become verbally or physically
abusive, requiring hospital security to become involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, ``It is not unusual to see the same inebriated
individuals more than once in the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one upside to habitual ER patients _ or ``frequent
flyers,'' as they are nicknamed by paramedics: ER staffs have a
clue about their medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The city's ERs are at or over capacity and thus spend more time
than ever on divert. Ambulance drivers spend more time roving the
streets and working the radio, trying to find an ER with an open
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the medical records of a drunk or drugged-out
patient may be in one of several hospitals; more time and energy
must be expended locating them.
</P>
<P>
   Once the patient has sobered up or come down, a companion ordeal
begins for ER staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the shelters fill up by early evening and the Central
Referral line is no longer available to hospital personnel,''
Comber wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The only option is for a nurse or other employee to call ``every
shelter in town hoping for a bed or a chair. If none can be found
and the patient is discharged to the street, they very often come
right back again or end up at another ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Comber and her colleagues say that the hole created by closure
of the 500-bed Mission Rock Emergency Shelter _ to make way for a
parking lot at the new baseball park _ has never been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ER staffers at Davies have even taken to donating clean clothes
for sobered-up patients who need them. But they ``simply cannot
keep up with the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Comber's letter begs city officials to understand the severity
of the problem and to do something concrete to help alleviate it _
like create a dry-out facility where the drug and alcohol-impaired
can be taken by cops and watched by medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to do nothing until ``the situation'' gets so
bad that someone in need of real emergency medical care dies for
want of attention or bed space.
</P>
<P>
   As Comber warned in her letter:
</P>
<P>
   ``On a recent day in June, with no earthquake, no major trauma
incident and cool temperatures, six of the 10 ERs in San Francisco
were closed to ambulance traffic by 7 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   To repeat her question: Will the city step up and do the right
thing?
</P>

   NY-OUTDOOR-SCULPTURE (New York) _ When it comes to outdoor
sculpture in New York City this summer, the animal kingdom seems to
have walked off with the main prizes. For quality and sheer size
there is Jeff Koons' ``Puppy,'' a 43-foot-tall flower-covered
sculpture in the shape of a West Highland terrier. For quantity,
ubiquity, relentless aw-shucks hokeyness and stupidity at toxic
levels, the prize goes hoofs down to ``Cow Parade,'' a herd of
nearly 500 life-size fiberglass heifers. Even without these two
unusual occurrences, the summer's outdoor sculpture offerings cover
a great range, especially if you stretch your definition of public
sculpture. By Roberta Smith.

&HT;     A RAIL JOURNEY THAT'S PURE MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you 8 years old or younger? Are you fond of trains? Do you
harbor a keen interest in the serpentine career path of Alec
Baldwin? Then have we got a film for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Engine'' has to be the gentlest, most
unassuming and most quietly charming children's film to be released
this summer. Grown-ups won't like it as much as kids, older kids
won't like it as much as younger kids, and some kids, it's safe to
say, won't like it at all. Too many people smiling.
</P>
<P>
   But this harmless, brightly made movie is bound to delight small
children with its sweet mix of magic and minor (very minor)
derring-do from one of the heroes of public television: Thomas the
Tank Engine, the small, blue, ``really useful'' locomotive who
began life in Wilbert Vere Audrey's whimsical children's books. The
Thomas in Britt Alcott's film is recognizable to anyone who's read
the books or ingested the PBS series, although a few new elements
are tossed in to snap things up. Preschool purists won't object.
</P>
<P>
   Blending live action and modest animation, ``Thomas and the
Magic Railroad'' stars a winningly peppy Alec Baldwin as Mr.
Conductor, the minute, magical railroad man who commutes via
``sparkle'' between Shining Time Station, where big people reside,
and the Isle of Sodor, where little folk co-habit with talking
trains. Sodor has its malcontents _ there's a long-running rivalry
between blue engines and red ones, large engines and small ones _
but by and large, they all bustle about the train yard in cozy
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bad Things start to happen. Mr. Conductor begins to lose
his sparkle. A Big Bully Diesel starts to say threatening things
about a lost engine and the annihilation of Mr. Conductor's
universe. The lost engine, a dormant beauty named Lady, holds the
key to both Mr. C's waning sparkle and the future of Sodor, but
Lady's been hiding out in Shining Time (Muffle Mountain, to be
exact) and hasn't been up and running for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lady is looked after by a sad wan man named Burnett Stone (Peter
Fonda, remarkably well cast), who used to run Lady along the Magic
Railroad but has since retreated into near-hermitic existence.
Fortunately for everyone, his granddaughter (Mara Wilson) comes to
visit, instantly befriending both a kind-hearted boy on a horse
(Cody McMains) and a Lilliputian surfer-cousin of Mr. C's, the
loudly-shirted Junior (Michael Rodgers).
</P>
<P>
   The plot chugs along amiably and at just the right speed for
little ones _ not too breakneck, not too slow. Unlike most kids'
movies these days, this one makes no effort (barring a couple of
jokes about ``shell phones'') to woo adults; everything is aimed
directly at their offspring. Most of the dialogue is of the ``I'm
feeling a little blue, which isn't so hot when you're red''
variety, although there's no small joy in watching Baldwin mug with
such happy abandon. ``Oh, thank you, Moby Dick!'' he emotes,
chipper-dee-dipper, before a goldfish. ``I like my sparkle, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers accustomed to computerized legerdemain may be
surprised, at first, that the talking engines don't actually move
their lips, but anyone who's watched the TV show (or attendant
videos) won't be bothered. My kids, 4 and 6, certainly didn't care,
and are already bugging me to see the film again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the BEST movie,'' gushed the 6-year-old. Better than
``Chicken Run?'' I asked, secretly hoping she'd respond in the
negative. ``Oh, YES,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is: two thumbs up from the small set. And with
``Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' the littlest thumbs are all that
matters.

   ``UNCAGED LYONNE.'' From W magazine. Although she's starred in a
couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of Beverly Hills''
and ``American Pie''), actress Natasha Lyonne is much more likely
to be found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy
comedy ``But I'm a Cheerleader.'' In it, Lyonne plays a girl who's
sent away to a conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and
would-be boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while
doing splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). An interview.

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If hair is destiny, then Natasha Lyonne's future is going to be
huge. Not to mention wild and out of control.
 &HT;    Of course, hair isn't really destiny (unless you're Kirsty
Hume). But Lyonne, who grew up in Manhattan and went to an
exclusive private school with a bunch of what she calls ``total,
like, icy snobs,'' has her own idiosyncratic notions about the
world _ and one of them is that her mammoth strawberry-blond mane
has sealed her fate. And not necessarily in a good way.
 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for
Women,'' says men act on hot tips while women do more homework, and
a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men
trade more frequently than women _ and often earn lower returns as
a result.
 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of
style more than substance.
 &HT;    ``Women like communicating with other women,'' says Jennifer
Openshaw, who founded wfn.com (Women's Financial Network). ``They
face different issues. They live longer than men, so they need to
save more in their lifetimes.''
 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of
women is the Internet, where female-oriented Web sites such as
msmoney.com offer a no-nonsense approach, dispensing with feel-good
psychobabble and providing investment strategies for different
stages in a woman's life.
 &HT;    ``One of the big pluses for women is that there's never an issue
of being patronized or ignored on the Internet,'' says Briles, who
is also a spokeswoman for wingspanbank.com.
 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites
need bells and whistles in order to be compelling to women.
 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for
Women,'' says men act on hot tips while women do more homework, and
a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men
trade more frequently than women _ and often earn lower returns as
a result.
 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of
style more than substance.
 &HT;    ``Women like communicating with other women,'' says Jennifer
Openshaw, who founded wfn.com (Women's Financial Network). ``They
face different issues. They live longer than men, so they need to
save more in their lifetimes.''
 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of
women is the Internet, where female-oriented Web sites such as
msmoney.com offer a no-nonsense approach, dispensing with feel-good
psychobabble and providing investment strategies for different
stages in a woman's life.
 &HT;    ``One of the big pluses for women is that there's never an issue
of being patronized or ignored on the Internet,'' says Briles, who
is also a spokeswoman for wingspanbank.com.
 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites
need bells and whistles in order to be compelling to women.
 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

UNDER NEW RULES, EMMY VOTERS CAN VIEW AND CHOOSE WINNERS FROM THEIR
HOMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Every year or so someone has a problem with
the Emmy Awards, whether it's an overabundance of nominations,
apples-and-oranges categories, astonishing lapses in logic, or the
telecast itself, which moves along with all the grace of a garbage
barge.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, chairman and CEO of the Academy of Television
Arts &AMP; Sciences (ATAS), has heard the complaints and logged them
accordingly. She admits that, in a 200-channel universe, trying to
locate the gems of TV programming scattered over networks, cable
and syndication can be a tiresome, thankless task, certainly one
that invites second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, Marshall appears to be holding firm on
the latest tweaking of how shows are selected for Emmy
consideration. It's a change that could drastically alter which
stars, producers and writers we see trot out to the podium at the
Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium, and because of Emmy's power to lift
a series out of the ratings gutter, it may even alter what kind of
shows we see in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now in existence for 52 years, the Emmys has long relied on an
arcane procedure in which final winners are chosen by ``judging
panels'' _ actors, directors, producers and the like herded into
hotel rooms and ballrooms over a selected weekend to spend hours
screening one Emmy candidate after another.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the academy decided to amend that process,
partly because only between 1,000 to 1,500 of the 9,000 ATAS
members would show up, participate on panels and vote. That means a
category like, say, best drama series could have fewer than 100
people determining who wins. For technical areas it could be as
many as 70 _ or as few as seven.
</P>
<P>
   Now cassettes of every contending show are mailed directly to
voters, allowing panelists to watch tapes at home at their leisure.
The goal is to include more voters in the judging and therefore
produce a broader sampling of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets those most active and busy in the TV industry
participate, because the criticism has been that most of the judges
are retirees more than happy to escape to the Beverly Hilton Hotel
_ but a group less likely to embrace risk-taking fare on cable, or
even younger-skewing network series such as ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' an often-praised drama that has never even been nominated
during its four seasons on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   ATAS claims this new process has already tripled the number of
people agreeing to participate as judges from last year _ about
4,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Although an adjustment in how tapes are seen had long been
discussed (members have always considered it a pain to be holed up
at a hotel watching TV practically all day long, except for lunch
and potty breaks), it finally happened after what's known here as
``The Sopranos'' Effect. When the HBO series, thought by critics to
be the best thing they'd seen in years, was denied last year's Emmy
for best drama (it went to ``The Practice''), critics mercilessly
scolded the academy for its oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall says the change had little to do with the ``Sopranos''
defeat per se. Instead, Marshall says, most significant was the
sense of the room (at the Emmys) last year. ``I looked around the
room and realized that there were a number of extremely qualified
people who were active members in the academy who had not
participated in the judging. And the sense was that we had to
figure out why and we had to make sure that they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the way to go about doing it, says Tom O'Neil,
a journalist who has made a career out of tracking awards shows. He
has authored beefy, everything-you-wanted-to-know books on the
Emmys and the Grammys and is currently working on a project that
combines all award shows.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil is convinced that ATAS members won't watch without
supervision and that the Emmys will be awarded based on the
opinions of their families, friends _ even waiters at their
favorite bistros.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when people don't watch a show is that they tend
to ask those around them what ``they'' think about such and such,''
says O'Neil. ``There are persistent allegations that shows in some
categories aren't watched in their entirety due to the absence of
supervisors at a particular panel session. So imagine if they're at
home with their everyday distractions. If voters don't watch the
tapes, they'll probably just vote for what's hip. That means not
only are underdog shows at risk, but underdog networks, too.''
</P>
<P>
   By underdogs O'Neil means shows liked by TV critics but
invisible to viewers and therefore susceptible to cancellation.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey,'' a one-hour drama considered unconventional
because it centered on two female detectives, was canceled during
the 1982-83 season after failing to get a sizable enough audience
to earn a renewal. Loyal viewers inundated CBS with letters, but
the network refused to change its stand. It wasn't until the series
won an Emmy that September as best drama that the network relented,
bringing the cop drama back in the spring of 1984 for what would
turn out to be a five-year run and, now, a legacy as a
groundbreaking series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hill Street Blues,'' the cop drama considered by some the best
hour-long series ever, and ``Cheers,'' certainly one of the
medium's best sitcoms, were also low-rated programs that parlayed
their Emmy wins into higher viewership at a time when their
survival was far from a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil has a point that the new method could suffer from an
age-old problem _ namely, people voting based on reputation instead
of watching and deciding who's most deserving. He cites Chris
Rock's 1997 expletive-laden comedy special on HBO as an example,
saying unsupervised voters likely would have bailed on the viewing
early on. Instead, they were compelled to sit down, give it a
chance and find humor and poignancy through the four-letter words.
That Emmy virtually changed the direction of Rock's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're working on an honor system here _ we give voters
the tape and expect them to watch it,'' says James B. Chabin, ATAS
president. ``Are we worried they won't? You know, the reason people
volunteer to do this is because they care about the shows and they
care about the Emmy and they want to make sure that the right
program succeeds in receiving it. For that alone, we think they'll
take the time to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Emmys' perception problem is endemic to television,
where series continue year after year, with only the occasional
intriguing newcomers _ such as ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the
City'' last year or ``The West Wing'' this time around, shaking
things up.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison's sake, the Oscars are presented an entirely new
round of candidates every year, but even there the tendency is to
return to familiar faces. How many people still shake their heads
over the nomination last year of Meryl Streep?
</P>
<P>
   As for the Golden Globes, perceived to be more ``with it'' (it
named ``Sex and the City'' as top comedy), the 80 or so members of
the Hollywood Press Association seem to select their nominees based
on who they think are kinda cool, which isn't much different from
the way MTV does its back-patting shows.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil considers the Emmys the most accurate and fair prize
because it not only guarantees all nominees that their work will be
seen by voters, but in addition, unlike the Oscars or Grammys,
politics and sympathy voting rarely play a part in the selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman, who was fatally shot by his wife, didn't get an
Emmy after his death, and even though the Golden Globes named
three-time Emmy winner (for ``Family Ties'') Michael J. Fox best
comedic actor for his work in ``Spin City,'' O'Neil doesn't expect
the same from the Emmy voters despite his current battle with
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If sentiment figured into voting, Angela Lansbury, who starred
in ``Murder, She Wrote,'' would not be the biggest Emmy loser, with
16 losses, and Jackie Gleason wouldn't have ended his career
Emmyless.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil may think that the Emmy Awards is the last ``pure''
bastion of awards shows, but aren't awards ceremonies by their very
nature political? I can't pick up a trade magazine here like
Variety or The Hollywood Reporter without seeing page after page of
``For your consideration'' ads, even for series and performers who
shouldn't even be on the air, let alone given television's top
prize. (Even O'Neil talks about nominations being ``bought.'')
</P>
<P>
   But studios now spend a combined $15 million placing print ads
to get the attention of voters (like for ``Biography'' on A&AMP;E,
which took out a full-page advertisement in Variety in hopes it
could land a nomination in the Outstanding Nonfiction Series
category).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they realize they're not winning Emmys, they'll do
exactly what ABC and CBS did in 1965 when winners were still
determined by popular vote,'' O'Neil predicts. ``They'll quit the
Emmy race altogether. What saved the Emmys then was the
introduction of the judging panels. Now they want to kill the
panels, which, again, shows that television will forever be a
medium that simply can't learn from its past mistakes.''

&HT;     NAPSTER ON HOLD AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Attention Napster users: You have until midnight
Friday to download all the free, copyrighted music your hard drive
can handle.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the controversial, music-swapping Web site will most
likely be out of business.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Napster lawyers said after a federal judge
enjoined the Internet company from enabling the ``duplication of
all copyrighted songs, musical compositions of which the plaintiffs
hold rights,'' effective midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed against
Napster by the Recording Industry Association of America alleging
the Web site's file-sharing software is costing the music business
millions, if not billions of dollars, in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Napster users can log onto the company's Web site
(www.napster.com) and then swap digital music files with one
another, including copyrighted tunes ranging from Johnny Cash to
Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   Music industry professionals hope Wednesday's ruling will set a
precedent, helping to shut myriad other sites that allow similar
downloading, including the popular Gnutella and FreeNet sites.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel handed down the
injunction after a spirited, three-hour court hearing that
highlighted the intellectual property debate that has raged on the
Internet for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has countered the charges by saying it has nothing to do
with the swapping of copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   It simply created software that enables the swapping of digital
music, or MP3, files over the Internet. According to Napster's
all-star legal team, any illegal swapping going on is not the
company's problem.
</P>
<P>
   Patel did not buy Napster's song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and
upload copyrighted material,'' the judge said. ``This should be no
surprise to Napster. The defendant had actual or constructive
knowledge that third parties engaged in direct copyright
infringement by downloading files using the Napster service.''
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Patel repeatedly said the RIAA, on behalf of its
member record companies, had proved ``a strong likelihood of
success on the merits'' of their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo,
Calif., said the company would appeal the ruling.

RED SOX FACE TEST IN CROSS-CONTINENTAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off they went, 24 players (and a suspendee) in search of their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, rained out of Wednesday's game against Minnesota at
Fenway, sloshed westward on an 18-day, 16-game transcontinental
odyssey that could determine how their first season of the century
shakes out.
</P>
<P>
   With their star slugger, Carl Everett, watching from the
sideline, the Sox begin their bicoastal challenge with four games
against Oakland, which leads the American League wild-card race by
2 games over Anaheim and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Sox play three in Seattle against the top team in the
AL West before they red-eye home for three more against Kansas
City, only to dart away after that for six games in Anaheim and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the test we're going to have to pass if we're
going to make it,'' said Pedro Martinez, who is scheduled to pitch
Friday against the Athletics. ``This might be the trip that
dictates where we end up.''
</P>
<P>
   On a similar journey last year _ a 12-game, 14-day swing through
Seattle, Oakland, New York, and Cleveland _ the Red Sox surged to a
9-3 record, effectively blazing their wild-card path to the
playoffs. Martinez won his 20th and 21st games during the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go through hard times if you're going to make the
playoffs,'' said All-Star closer Derek Lowe. ``Last year, we played
extremely well on that September road trip. Hopefully, this one
will be a character-builder, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If not character building, the Sox are grasping for something to
solve their schizophrenia. This year, they burst into first place
in May, only to squander the top spot with a disastrous June. They
appeared on track to rebound in July, starting 13-7, but then they
lost two straight to Minnesota, the worst team in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something to be said for continuity, and we just don't
seem to have it right now,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg. ``It's
tough to mesh together when things are as volatile as they have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Most volatile has been Everett, whose head-butt of umpire Ronald
Kulpa July 15 brought a 10-day suspension, which he began serving
Monday. Though Everett is hitting only .194 since the All-Star
Game, the Red Sox face the prospect of trying to break out of a
run-scoring drought (five runs in their last three games) without
him. He is not eligible to play until Aug. 4, the opener of the
Kansas City series.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Boston is about to play two teams (Oakland and Seattle)
that have produced far more runs than the Sox (502 runs). Oakland,
led by Jason Giambi (.334, 26 home runs, 91 RBIs), has scored 599
runs, and Seattle, faring just fine without Ken Griffey, has scored
572.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland, they're a nightmare because they are so free-swinging
and score so many runs,'' Hatteberg said. ``We really have to go in
and shut them down because they have good pitching, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, whose staff's ERA of 4.35 is second in the American
League to Boston's 4.19, also has the league's best home record
(33-16). The Sox are 24-23 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're going out there to beat up on some
mediocre teams,'' said Sox reliever Bryce Florie, who won a key
game in Seattle last year during the September trip. ``We have our
work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After all their fits and starts, the Sox are hoping the
resurgence of Troy O'Leary (.400, 4 home runs, and 22 RBIs since
returning from the disabled list July 3) and the return of several
other key players will help them gain some stability.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the recent returnees are right fielder Trot Nixon,
who missed a month with a strained hamstring, and reliever Rod
Beck, who had been plagued most of the season with a pinched nerve
in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bret Saberhagen, the two-time Cy Young Award winner
who is inching back from surgery for a torn rotator cuff.
Saberhagen, 36, could be back in the rotation in August, a
remarkable 13 years after he was first named the AL Comeback Player
of the Year (he repeated the feat in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Beck said the team's prospects on the West Coast _ and the rest
of the season _ may hinge on the players' health.
</P>
<P>
   ``These West Coast teams we're playing, they're not exactly a
walk in the park,'' Beck said. ``But if everyone can stay out of
the training room, we can be good enough the rest of way.''

IN MEDIA COVERAGE, THE PERSONAL IS POLITICAL

PEEP SHOW 
Media and Politics in an Age of Scandal 
By Larry J. Sabato, Mark Stencel, and S. Robert Lichter 
Rowman &AMP; Littlefield, 177 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did The Boston Globe err in writing about former mayor Raymond
Flynn's drinking habits? Did the media give Newt Gingrich a pass on
his less-than-conservative lifestyle? Is coverage of George W.
Bush's ``young and irresponsible'' past excessive?
</P>
<P>
   These are the ethical quandaries that Larry Sabato and two
colleagues bravely tackle in the aptly named ``Peep Show: Media and
Politics In The Age Of Scandal.'' In doing so, they try to answer
the question that has bedeviled the nation's news industry ever
since presidential hopeful Gary Hart was caught trysting the night
away with Donna Rice in 1987. What is fair game when it comes to
the private lives of public figures?
</P>
<P>
   In Sabato's 1991 book, ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism
Has Transformed American Politics,'' the University of Virginia
professor of government tried to promulgate ground rules, most of
them sensible, for determining when reporters ought to rattle pols'
closets for skeletons. Though ``Feeding Frenzy'' turned Sabato into
an oft-quoted pundit on media malfeasance, its actual impact on
journalism is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might say that in trying to codify a set of media
ethics, Sabato is trying to regulate the ungovernable. Indeed, the
effort is messy but still worthwhile. Perhaps feeling more needed
than ever, he is back in the post-Monica era with ``Peep Show,''
coauthored by Washingtonpost.com politics editor Mark Stencel and
S. Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line political reporters draw between private and public
life is perhaps more blurry than ever before. With increasing
regularity, that blurry line is the smudged chalk outline of an
ambitious politician,'' quip the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Point well taken. In an election season during which vaporous
tales of Bush's supposed partying habits and Al Gore's alleged
cannabis cravings have brought more disrepute to journalism than to
the candidates, the news industry is again thrashing clumsily
around the ``character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peep Show'' is an earnest attempt to diagnose the problem,
restate Sabato's guidelines, and offer a scorecard on how various
media outlets have handled a variety of ``scandals.'' The diagnosis
is the book's least interesting aspect because many of the maladies
_ poor sourcing, lowest-common-denominator journalism (in which
less reputable media outlets drive the news), and the vagaries of
Internet reporting _ are tired staples of media criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The authors do come up with the intriguing notion that the
influx of women into the newsroom has spurred more reporting on
politicians' personal foibles, arguing that it ``demolished old-boy
networks that allowed reporters to wink and ignore certain behavior
among politicians, as they did among their colleagues.'' And they
make an intelligent argument that pols who ``humanize'' themselves
by yukking it up on the couch next to Jay Leno ``turn themselves
into human-interest stories'' who invite tabloid-style treatment.
(Although Bill Clinton's 1992 shades-n'-saxophone appearance on
Arsenio Hall's show may go down as one of the great PR coups in
campaign history.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Peep Show'' wisely encourages news executives, in their own
enlightened self-interest, to do a better job of explaining their
decisions to the public because ``readers and viewers rarely
appreciate just how much most journalists anguish over decisions to
publish damaging or embarassing details about a politician's
personal behavior.'' Translation: Unless journalists provide an
alternative theory, the public tends to ascribe to them the worst
possible motives.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides exemplary examples by reprinting Washington
Post executive editor Leonard Downie's 1992 explanation of why the
paper chose to publish allegations of sexual misconduct by Senator
Robert Packwood and Idaho Statesman editor Karen Baker's 1998
editorial detailing why her paper exposed a relationship between a
Congresswomen and a married man.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the eagerly awaited scoreboard. The authors give the
Globe a B for its coverage of Flynn's drinking by arguing that it
was ``ongoing private behavior . . . that was potentially
debilitating'' in the public arena. They give the press an F ``for
showing too much discretion'' in not aggressively pursuing the Newt
Gingrich infidelity story, arguing that the former House speaker's
personal conduct at the time when the president was enmeshed in a
sex scandal ``is potentially reckless behavior.'' (The authors
aren't prudes. They believe there are a number of circumstances
that justify media scrutiny of a misbehaving pol.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the media get a middling C for their attention to
Bush's partying. On one hand, Bush's ``admitted alcohol abuse
extended well into his adult years,'' which makes it significant.
On the other, journalists recklessly aired ``unproven rumors''
about his alleged drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The C might be a passing grade, but as ``Peep Show'' takes pains
to insist, it's sure no Gentlemen's C.

THE FBI'S PRIVACY PREDATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ever see an old movie called ``The FBI Story''?
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a masterpiece. Jimmy Stewart, tapering off from his
daring 1950s work with Hitchcock and Preminger, here plays a dull
and stolid G-guy, solemnly hunting down Ku Kluxers, gangsters, and
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   So why do I like this movie so much? Because I'd like to believe
that the nation's cops are all like Jimmy Stewart _ brave, decent
folk who defend the rights of the law-abiding, rather than run
around violating them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this movie was made in 1959, and as the cameras were
rolling, so were the FBI's tape recorders. Head G-man J. Edgar
Hoover cheerfully used wiretaps, burglaries, and other police-state
tactics against thousands of law-abiding citizens whose political
views didn't suit him. Nowadays, Hollywood's idea of an FBI agent
is David Duchovny of ``The X Files,'' a good man swimming upstream
in a sewer.
</P>
<P>
   So you can understand why this Carnivore business has me
squirming. The FBI has admitted using a system that scans millions
of e-mails in search of messages from criminal suspects. Some
public-relations mastermind named the system Carnivore. I hope he
enjoys his new job as special agent in charge of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore is software that runs on a computer using the Windows
NT operating system. When the FBI needs to see what a suspect is
pumping out over the Net, the agency gets a court order to install
a Carnivore computer at the suspect's Internet service provider.
Carnivore sits on the line, constantly scanning for data packets
with the suspect's e-mail address. All such packets are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech wiretap? Almost, but not quite. With a traditional
telephone wiretap, the cops can only listen in to traffic on one
particular phone line. You can't do that with the Internet, because
data is chopped up in packets that can travel to their destination
any old way. The solution is to intercept all of the packets, and
then figure out which ones you actually need. So when Carnivore is
installed at an Internet provider, it's rummaging through the
messages of every customer in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is predictably appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no precedent for this in domestic surveillance,''
says its associate director, Barry Steinhardt. ``They're collecting
a lot of information about third parties, and no third party is
ever going to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Carnivore sweeps right across the political
spectrum. During a congressional hearing on Monday, Republicans and
Democrats took turns teeing off on FBI officials.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows I sympathize with the libertarians. But what should
the cops do while criminals plan their nastiness online? Take up
needlepoint?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are pedophiles and hackers and terrorists, we
need to talk about them, too,'' says Amitai Etzioni, author of
``The Limits of Privacy'' and professor at George Washington
University in Washington, D.C. Etzioni is a rarity among
intellectuals _ a guy who frankly supports a certain amount of
government snooping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because Etzioni trusts the FBI. Bureau officials
say Carnivore only captures data when an e-mail address matches
that of the suspect. The Carnivore computer screens out all other
data; no human eye ever sees it. For innocent bystanders, Carnivore
would be no more intrusive than any Internet router _ they scan
addresses too, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Denning, professor of computer science at Georgetown
University, has nothing but contempt for those who think the FBI
will use Carnivore to spy on people willy-nilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's totally stupid,'' says Denning. ``They can't do
that. It's against the law.'' Specifically, says Denning, it would
violate existing wiretap statutes.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman told me the agency plans next week to turn over
the source code of Carnivore to an independent agency. This unnamed
agency will have to promise not to reveal the details of how it
works, but will be allowed to describe in general terms what the
program can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has also requested a copy of the Carnivore code under
the Freedom of Information Act, and Steinhardt told me that he's
willing to keep the code secret if the FBI hands it over for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   An independent report showing that Carnivore isn't a privacy
predator would make me feel a lot better about it. So would a new
law strictly limiting how it could be used. I'd want all Carnivore
cases assigned to Jimmy Stewart _ or at least David Duchovny.

PLAGIARISM'S MANY SHADES OF GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like an infectious disease, a plagiarism-related virus rampaged
through newsrooms this month. The most notable case was The Boston
Globe's four-month suspension of columnist Jeff Jacoby for
``serious journalistic misconduct'' in borrowing elements of a
column on the signers of the Declaration of Independence. And
suddenly, the floodgates opened.
</P>
<P>
   In an editor's note, The New York Times admitted that parts of
an obituary ``closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The
Times of London.'' The sports editor of the San Antonio
Express-News apologized to readers for lifting several paragraphs
from another paper in a story he wrote. The reader advocate at the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch detailed how a columnist there failed to
attribute material from an Associated Press story. There was a
brief dust-up when a Salon.com staffer felt that a Colorado Springs
Gazette story was too reliant on a piece he had written.
</P>
<P>
   Was it coincidence that all this occurred around the time of the
Jacoby situation, which sparked debate over whether he was guilty
of plagiarism or just laziness? Or is heightened scrutiny of the
media leading to stricter enforcement amid surprisingly routine
violations? Does the news industry even have an agreed-upon set of
standards for recognizing the problem?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the p-word, a number of observers echo Supreme
Court Justice Potter Stewart's musings on pornography. It may be
hard to define, but ``I know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a piece he wrote back in 1983, Roy Peter Clark, a journalism
instructor at the Poynter Center for Media Studies, called
plagiarism ``the skeleton in journalism's closet,'' adding that
`most newspapers have no rules'' and ``editors seem loath to define
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, changing technology has greatly compounded the
problem. Citing pressure for ``globalized reporting,''
computer-assisted journalism, and the Internet, Express-News editor
Robert Rivard says ``everybody is thrashing around'' to ``make sure
our management policies catch up to the technologies.'' Often,
today's plagiarism is ``not malice aforethought,'' he says. ``It's
the merging of data.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a common understanding of what
plagiarism is,'' adds Jerry Ceppos, president of the Associated
Press Managing Editors organization. ``It's like everything else in
life. There's a lot of grays there.''
</P>
<P>
   In examining ethical codes at 33 newspapers, Poynter Center
ethics program director Bob Steele found that only 13 of them
addressed plagiarism. And those that do may not offer much
guidance. The Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics
deals with the subject in two terse words: ``Never Plagiarize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we wanted to simplify things,'' says SPJ ethics
chairman Fred Brown. ``I think we wanted to be very blunt . . . I
think it's impossible to quantify (plagiarism). Ultimately, it
rests with the editor, and the editor has to trust the writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe general policy guidelines, which acknowledge those shades
of gray, say that ``whenever a writer intentionally uses the
creative phrasing or ideas of another without crediting that
person, the result is plagiarism . . . If the words or ideas are
not original, but rather those of another person, we must, in an
appropriate place, give credit to him or her.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many media ethicists, Clark sees plagiarism as varying in
degrees and intensity. ``Pure plagiarism, I think, always has
intent as its sort of dark soul,'' he says, but ``plagiarism is not
like pregnancy. You can be a little bit plagiaristic . . . I've
never talked to an editor who didn't have a case he could cite.''
(During his 18 years at the San Jose Mercury News, Ceppos recalls
only one case, but then adds: ``I want to believe there was only
one case, but definitions vary.'')
</P>
<P>
   Take the divergent views of the Jacoby case, in which he relied
on several source materials for the signers' story and did
additional research. Globe editorial page editor Renee Loth calls
it a violation of Globe attribution policy, saying that Jacoby
``didn't just borrow a few phrases, but the whole concept of this
column has been borrowed.'' Globe ombudsman Jack Thomas called it
``plagiarism.'' Jacoby, who could not be reached for comment
Wednesday, called it ``an oversight'' in an earlier interview.
</P>
<P>
   In dueling columns in The Wall Street Journal, one writer argued
that Jacoby was guilty only of ``an error of judgment'' while
another skewered him for ``taking anonymous crud from the Internet
and throwing it into the paper'' with his name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Punishment for the unacceptable borrowing of others' work varies
dramatically as well. Express-News editor Rivard, who fired a
writer for ``wholesale plagiarism'' in 1997, says wayward sports
editor Mitchell Krugel was given a reprimand and the task of
apologizing to readers, calling that punishment ``appropriate to
the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Times managing editor Bill Keller declined to discuss
the matter of punishment for obit writer Douglas Martin, but ``he
knows very well what he did was wrong . . . I won't pussyfoot
around the word. I'd call it plagiarism . . . our basic policy is
there are degrees'' of plagiarism and ``there's certainly a
difference in how you treat them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Clark detailed a wide range of punishment for
various forms of plagiarism. In one 1982 case, a writer who had
lifted pieces for a story that ultimately won an American Society
of Newspaper Editors prize was allowed to keep both the prize and
his job. Two years ago, when Globe editors learned that columnist
Mike Barnicle had borrowed jokes from George Carlin _ and Barnicle
argued that he was unaware of their origin _ the original decision
was to suspend him for a month without pay. But after a videotape
of Barnicle recommending the book surfaced, he was asked to resign.
When he produced evidence that the material had been in wide use on
the Internet, the penalty was reduced to a two-month suspension.
Later, Barnicle was forced to resign, but over other issues
regarding a 1995 column.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts are wary of any attempt to codify the definitions
and penalties for plagiarism. ``We're pretty good at
self-policing,'' says Rivard. But ``we're not like the welders
where we're going to sign off on a new set of engineered
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark says that the challenge is for journalism to rethink the
question of ``what does it mean to be in the public domain.'' Media
outlets, he adds, should ``revisit all the important standards
cyclically (and) be willing to adjust them in the light . . . of
the complex and overwhelming development of new media
technologies.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JACOBY VS. HARVEY: A COMPARISON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing Jacoby's July 3 column on the fate of the signers
of the Declaration of Independence, Globe managers found
similarities between numerous unattributed passages in the column
and other sources, most notably a 1975 copyrighted book by Paul
Harvey called ``Our Lives, Our Fortunes, Our Sacred Honor.'' What
follows are some examples cited by Globe managers.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``They had learned that liberty is so much more
important than security that they pledged their lives . . . their
fortunes . . . and their sacred honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``They were men of means and social standing, but for
the sake of liberty, they pledged it all _ their lives, their
fortunes, and their sacred honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``His fields and gristmill were laid waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``His fields and mill laid waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``Fifty-six men knew _ when they signed _ that they were
risking everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``They were risking everything and they knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``And Thomas Nelson Jr., of Virginia, raised two million
dollars on his own signature to provision our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``Thomas Nelson Jr. of Virginia raised $2 million for
the patriots' cause on his own personal credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``He died bankrupt and was buried in an unmarked
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``He died bankrupt and was buried in an unmarked
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey: ``For more than a year, he lived in forests and caves
and returned home after the war to find his wife dead, his children
gone, his property gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby: ``While he hid in forests and caves, his home was
demolished. . . . When it was finally safe for him to return, he
found his wife dead, his children missing, and his property
decimated.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to friends written by Jacoby, he said that
``since all of the sources I relied on had in turn relied on even
earlier recitations, I assumed that all the material in my column
was in the public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial page editor Renee Loth says that regardless of the
history or distribution of material, ``readers have the right to
believe that material appearing under a reporter's byline
(including columnists) is original.''

MUBU WORKS ONLINE MAGIC IN YOUR MUSICAL EAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you describe the sound of music?
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no, not ``The Sound of Music,'' as in the one with nuns
and Nazis and kids dressed in curtains. We are talking here about
the actual sound of music, that intangible essence that can stir
the emotions and caress the eardrums. How do you define that in
quantifiable terms? How do you write a mathematical equation for
something as elusive as taste?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are some folks in San Francisco who think they've
figured it all out, and _ guess what? _ they've started an Internet
company. These folks are convinced they can quickly surmise your
musical taste and instantly select a handful of albums you are
certain to adore. How do they do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the MuBu magic,'' says John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? MuBu who?
</P>
<P>
   MuBu, it turns out, is short for Music Buddha, Inc., the company
Adams founded to create a sound-based music recommendation service.
Admittedly, the name doesn't exactly roll off your tongue, but
let's forget about that for now. The concept itself is actually
pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and his scientists have identified hundreds of
characteristics for thousands of songs, defining things like
instrumentation, tempo, feel, and mood for each track. They apply
these defining criteria (or data points) to each song, creating a
sort of musical DNA for the music. Users then listen to a handful
of sample songs and express their preferences; the system then
makes recommendations based on the individual's musical
``fingerprint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a friend who knows what kind of music you
like,'' says Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Right. A friend who makes tapes and burns CDs for you and
doesn't make you do something in return. And a computer does this?
We tried it (at www.mubu.com). The bad news: It requires you to
download a media player, which is always a pain, and the user
interface is clunky and slow. The good news: It actually makes
great recommendations _ most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. You choose from a variety of narrow music
categories such as Anarchy or Ambient, Gospel or Evil, Tattoos and
Pool Cues or Lite Rock and EZ Pop. You then rate a series of song
clips, click on a Buddha that says ``Enlighten Me,'' and the system
recommends albums. In our unscientific study, three out of three
resident music experts here at the Globe approved of the
selections.
</P>
<P>
   It works much better than other Internet collaborative filtering
systems. For instance, if you ever order a book from Amazon about,
say, antique radios, they insist on trying to sell you books about
furniture for the rest of your life. The MuBu system offers things
you might consider buying _ but that's all it does. It doesn't
offer playlists or ways to store music. It simply links you to
places where you can buy CDs online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the consumer's best friend,'' says Adams.
``We're not going to push Metallica at a jazz fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if they could only do something about that silly name. Oh,
they won't mind the advice: That's what friends are for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems like everyone wants to be our best friend these days _
at least when it comes to buying stuff online. First, there are the
experts at Contentville.com, the new site for voracious readers
launched by publisher Steven Brill. Apart from the fact that it
classifies all forms of the printed word with that annoying term
``content,'' the site is intriguing. Owners of small bookstores
offer recommendations about the latest novel or biography, and
authors share their reading lists. From afar, you can compare notes
with Wendy Wasserstein or Wendy Kaminer.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can purchase the dissertation written by your favorite
academic or celebrity. For instance, you can pick up Dr. Ruth
Westheimer's tome, ``An Investigation of the Effectiveness of
Paraprofessionals in Increasing the Use of Postpartum and Family
Planning Services By Women from Lower Socio-Economic Backgrounds in
an Urban Setting.'' It was obviously penned before she took on such
topics as ``The Art of Arousal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site, www.moodlogic.com wants to be your best friend,
regardless of your mood. The site, which launched last month,
purports to categorize songs for every special moment, from upbeat
and happy to brooding and aggressive. We asked it to find some
brooding, raspy jazz by a female vocalist: Alas, it came up blank.
The system, it seems, was having a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group named Artists Against Piracy placed full-page
ads in several newspapers on the day that folks from the music
industry were testifying about digital music distribution in
Congress. The ad, signed by artists ranging from Aimee Mann to
Vince Gill, supported Metallica in its lawsuit against Napster.
</P>
<P>
   So who is funding this new organization? Think hard. Did you say
the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group that
represents the major record labels? Two points! The ads didn't note
that point, but the group's founder, singer-songwriter Noah Stone,
says that his group received ``a little chunk of change'' from the
industry, as well as from a few technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of independent artists launched a lobbying
group called the Coalition for the Future of Music, which aims to
speak up for the rights of artists without aligning itself with big
business interests. Its cofounder, activist and musician Jenny
Toomey, says she supports the other group's high-profile advocacy
campaign. Stone, however, says he hopes the two groups can join
forces. ``The more groups we have, the more confused this gets,''
he notes. But Toomey is adamant. She won't take money from the
industry. Period.

FORD SMASHES TAURUS EGGS, BUILDS A RIG THAT WON'T CRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in the rooms where they cook up the design recipes for
Fords, somebody must have decided to make an omelet. Smash the
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Ford Taurus is almost totally lacking (except for the
Ford badge itself) those oval/egg-shaped patterns that ran through
windows, door panels, pillars, body panels, even the dashboard
control panel. In its last incarnation, it was easy to spot a
Taurus on the street. But it's also easy to spot a squeegee man.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, we can say the new Taurus is devoid of the ovoid.
</P>
<P>
   It is more square _ yet somehow sleeker _ and almost Focus-like
with its gently wedged hood, squinted-eye headlights, smooth rise
through the roof, and chopped back-end.
</P>
<P>
   But looks, vastly improved that they are, do not comprise the
essence of the new Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk safety.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only car sold in America with a base price under
$20,000 (you'll pay more for top-end versions) to win the
government's five-star crash rating for both the driver and
front-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The Advanced Restraints System is the answer. In a crash,
most people don't know what is happening to them and many don't
remember much after it is over. ARS knows. It is made up of a batch
of sensors that can tell if the front seat belts are being used;
how close to the dash the driver is sitting; how hard the crash is.
It uses this information to decide whether or not to tighten the
seat belts _ in a lower-speed crash _ or to relax them just a bit,
and thus avoid belt-caused injuries, in a harsher crash.
</P>
<P>
   Air bag deployment is softer in a lesser crash, more forceful in
a harder crash.
</P>
<P>
   Even before leaving the driveway, with the optional ($120)
adjustable pedals, shorter drivers can position themselves farther
back from the wheel and air bag by moving the pedal back as much as
three inches.
</P>
<P>
   Add optional side air bags and you are swathed in safety. Toss
in the glow-in-the-dark interior trunk handle meant to keep kids
from locking themselves in that cavern and you've got one very
safety-oriented automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Downside? Even with the redesign, it suffers from the plague of
so many midsize sedans _ Nissan Maxima, Honda Accord, Buick
Century, and Toyota Camry among them: This is America's nondescript
rental fleet. You won't turn a head driving any of them. But since
the Accord and Camry are the top sellers in this segment, there
must be a lot of folks who don't care.
</P>
<P>
   New for the front-wheel-drive Taurus this year is a 3.0-liter,
24-valve, V6 engine that puts out 200 horses. I would not buy this
3,000-pound-plus car without this option. Buy the SE model as
tested, at a base price of just under $21,000 and you get the
engine standard. Toss in traction control _ which should become
standard on every car _ a leather package, and upgraded sound, and
you're up to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission is one of the better I've
seen in a while. Better in that it understands what you, the
driver, are attempting. It senses your driving style and comes to
learn that when you stomp the pedal, you are probably passing
someone, so it lets the RPMs roam instead of shifting up
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The steering is solid, interior noise is minimal, and the thing
seems darn near European in its handling. Maybe Ford's ownership of
Volvo is slopping over here. It's not tight like a Volvo and still
has a sense of that distinct American tendency to float at the
front, but Ford is getting this ride down.
</P>
<P>
   The only real fault I find with this car is its brakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heavy midsize sedan and Ford should have moved past the
days of mixed brakes _ discs up front, drums in the rear _ by now.
With traction control and ABS (other features that ought to be
mandated as combined and standard), this car handles the way
today's cars should handle.
</P>
<P>
   Taking away from that handling, and to me, braking is an
essential element of handling, by clinging to an old system, does
not make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The giant taillights with their big turn signals. They really
let that jerk who is tailgating you know what you are up to.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Skinny outside mirrors. I found myself crouching in my seat at
times to aid rear vision. Hey, we're not trying to shave hundreds
of a second off our quarter-mile times with this rig. Give us
bigger mirrors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Women with tear-stained faces passed their
babies forward, entrusting them to the hands of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark gazed at each and waved his hand in blessing. Palm by
palm, Internet start-up ideas were brought to the outstretched arms
of the holy man.
</P>
<P>
   As celebratory M80s were fired off outside the high-tech
cathedral, the sweat-soaked, tightly packed start-up pilgrims
surged toward the stage. They were here to see the man who
communicates directly with the alternately cruel and benevolent god
of Internet success.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire didn't disappoint the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The brains behind Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon/WebMD,
MyCFO and now the divine chairman of Shutterfly, Clark enraptured a
throng of technology faithful Monday night in Silicon Valley at a
Q&AMP;A session hosted by Santa Clara's Churchill Club.
</P>
<P>
   More salt-of-the-earth than not-of-this-world, Clark showed the
several hundred gathered that it doesn't take a thick layer of
polish to attain capitalist enlightenment. His jokes weren't
canned. His image wasn't tailored. His rough edges had only been
slightly smoothed by life in the pagan festival of the media
bacchanal and as the subject of ``The New New Thing: A Silicon
Valley Story,'' a biography by Michael Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark is as close to the pure Internet entrepreneurial
religion as you're going to get these days.
</P>
<P>
   He offers no apology for acts that seem devoid of the airbrushed
faith we expect from our Internet moguls. In truth, no amount of
escorting the elderly through the crosswalks of four-lane
thoroughfares will change the fact that capitalism is cutthroat.
Clark didn't offer up false hope _ rather, his fearless,
straightforward opinions on startups and the Internet boom set
stomachs churning all evening.
</P>
<P>
   First, the mile-long queue of pilgrims waiting in line for the
Q&AMP;A session microphones was quickly damned. Clark explained that he
only invests in ventures shown to him by friends he's worked with,
``and maybe not even then do I invest.'' Madre de dios! His good
sense of comedic timing softened the pain for those who'd crawled
on their knees from San Jose with an extra-thick stack of business
cards in their slacks.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, if you want to know, he did sell a sinful amount of
his AOL stock, which he received after it bought Netscape. Does he
care?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad I didn't sell it when it was at $90,'' Clark laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has gone from being AOL's largest single shareholder to
claiming ownership of only 1 million shares. Why did he liquidate
millions upon millions of shares when he could've had some sort of
greater relationship with the leading new media power? ``I think
AOL is at some substantial risk still from Microsoft as a site. And
I don't fundamentally believe in the way AOL works, and I
especially don't like it combined with Time Warner. ... I prefer
the opposite model: Don't own the content,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A ringing endorsement from a million-share man.
</P>
<P>
   What did he do with that money? For starters, he bought a little
of the aforementioned threat Microsoft ``once the judge issued the
decree and the stock went down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the love of god, doesn't the founder of Netscape have one
iota of malicious competitive hatred? ``Microsoft has enormous
power. I'm sure they'll learn how to use it,'' he wisecracked.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the bliss of apolitical investment. You stab my back,
I'll scratch yours _ if it makes me a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   Clark didn't hesitate when moderator and New Yorker scribe John
Heileman asked him to offer a buy, sell or hold rating on some
popular stocks. Yahoo!? Hold, Clark fired off. Microsoft? Buy,
obviously. Amazon.com? A buy, ``at this price,'' Clark quipped.
Excite(at)Home? Clark smiled and lowered his gaze. ``I think
everyone should buy (at)Home. No ... I own that, and I'm currently
underwater.'' Ah, the guilty conscience got the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a little dirt was kicked on the divine one: ``What
about SGI, which now trades for all of 4 1/2?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh god,'' Clark groaned as the crowd whooped its amusement. He
paused for a moment with a cautious smile. ``I think its patent
portfolio is worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems and Cisco? ``Overpriced,'' Clark said. Not that
he doesn't own them, mind you. ``I like to own round numbers, one
million shares,'' Clark joked with the wealth-ogling crowd.
Finally, Intel got a Clark buy rating.
</P>
<P>
   To finish off the evening, Clark sent his followers out with a
heartwarming message of Silicon Valley compassion. When asked
whether he plans to give away his money, Clark offered in his same
no-nonsense yet thoughtful tone, ``I grew up poor. I didn't have
any money. You could say I had a negative net worth,'' he
emphasized. He detailed how he has set aside chunks of his net
worth for his children and grandchildren. Clark also gave Stanford
University $150 million to fund a new biotech department.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Women with tear-stained faces passed their
babies forward, entrusting them to the hands of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark gazed at each and waved his hand in blessing. Palm by
palm, Internet start-up ideas were brought to the outstretched arms
of the holy man.
</P>
<P>
   As celebratory M80s were fired off outside the high-tech
cathedral, the sweat-soaked, tightly packed start-up pilgrims
surged toward the stage. They were here to see the man who
communicates directly with the alternately cruel and benevolent god
of Internet success.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire didn't disappoint the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The brains behind Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon/WebMD,
MyCFO and now the divine chairman of Shutterfly, Clark enraptured a
throng of technology faithful Monday night in Silicon Valley at a
Q&AMP;A session hosted by Santa Clara's Churchill Club.
</P>
<P>
   More salt-of-the-earth than not-of-this-world, Clark showed the
several hundred gathered that it doesn't take a thick layer of
polish to attain capitalist enlightenment. His jokes weren't
canned. His image wasn't tailored. His rough edges had only been
slightly smoothed by life in the pagan festival of the media
bacchanal and as the subject of ``The New New Thing: A Silicon
Valley Story,'' a biography by Michael Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark is as close to the pure Internet entrepreneurial
religion as you're going to get these days.
</P>
<P>
   He offers no apology for acts that seem devoid of the airbrushed
faith we expect from our Internet moguls. In truth, no amount of
escorting the elderly through the crosswalks of four-lane
thoroughfares will change the fact that capitalism is cutthroat.
Clark didn't offer up false hope _ rather, his fearless,
straightforward opinions on startups and the Internet boom set
stomachs churning all evening.
</P>
<P>
   First, the mile-long queue of pilgrims waiting in line for the
Q&AMP;A session microphones was quickly damned. Clark explained that he
only invests in ventures shown to him by friends he's worked with,
``and maybe not even then do I invest.'' Madre de dios! His good
sense of comedic timing softened the pain for those who'd crawled
on their knees from San Jose with an extra-thick stack of business
cards in their slacks.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, if you want to know, he did sell a sinful amount of
his AOL stock, which he received after it bought Netscape. Does he
care?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad I didn't sell it when it was at $90,'' Clark laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has gone from being AOL's largest single shareholder to
claiming ownership of only 1 million shares. Why did he liquidate
millions upon millions of shares when he could've had some sort of
greater relationship with the leading new media power? ``I think
AOL is at some substantial risk still from Microsoft as a site. And
I don't fundamentally believe in the way AOL works, and I
especially don't like it combined with Time Warner. ... I prefer
the opposite model: Don't own the content,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A ringing endorsement from a million-share man.
</P>
<P>
   What did he do with that money? For starters, he bought a little
of the aforementioned threat Microsoft ``once the judge issued the
decree and the stock went down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the love of god, doesn't the founder of Netscape have one
iota of malicious competitive hatred? ``Microsoft has enormous
power. I'm sure they'll learn how to use it,'' he wisecracked.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the bliss of apolitical investment. You stab my back,
I'll scratch yours _ if it makes me a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   Clark didn't hesitate when moderator and New Yorker scribe John
Heileman asked him to offer a buy, sell or hold rating on some
popular stocks. Yahoo!? Hold, Clark fired off. Microsoft? Buy,
obviously. Amazon.com? A buy, ``at this price,'' Clark quipped.
Excite(at)Home? Clark smiled and lowered his gaze. ``I think
everyone should buy (at)Home. No ... I own that, and I'm currently
underwater.'' Ah, the guilty conscience got the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a little dirt was kicked on the divine one: ``What
about SGI, which now trades for all of 4 1/2?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh god,'' Clark groaned as the crowd whooped its amusement. He
paused for a moment with a cautious smile. ``I think its patent
portfolio is worth something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems and Cisco? ``Overpriced,'' Clark said. Not that
he doesn't own them, mind you. ``I like to own round numbers, one
million shares,'' Clark joked with the wealth-ogling crowd.
Finally, Intel got a Clark buy rating.
</P>
<P>
   To finish off the evening, Clark sent his followers out with a
heartwarming message of Silicon Valley compassion. When asked
whether he plans to give away his money, Clark offered in his same
no-nonsense yet thoughtful tone, ``I grew up poor. I didn't have
any money. You could say I had a negative net worth,'' he
emphasized. He detailed how he has set aside chunks of his net
worth for his children and grandchildren. Clark also gave Stanford
University $150 million to fund a new biotech department.
</P>
<P>
   As for a Bill Gates-like approach to giving, don't hold your
breath. ``I'll give away what I don't spend. And I don't really
think I can spend it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Say it with him, congregation, ``Amen.''

WEST NILE VIRUS DISCOVERED IN DEAD CROW IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes a Nile Virus q and a; 1300 words.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A dead crow that had been infected with West Nile virus
was found in the city, health authorities said Wednesday,
confirming that the exotic encephalitis virus has migrated here and
prompting officals to calmly warn the public to protect themselves
against mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is spread by mosquito bites and scientists
said Wednesday they are unsure how widespread it is among Boston's
mosquito population. Birds cannot spread it to humans.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the infected crow Saturday, public health
officials began testing mosquitoes to see if any were carrying the
virus. Those results are due Thursday and will determine if
mosquito spraying outside the immediate Willow Pond area of Jamaica
Plain, where the dead crow was discovered, is necessary. They will
also consider aerial spraying, though only if signs emerge that
large numbers of mosquitoes here carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, officals said residents will be notified if
areas around their homes are to be targeted. They advised people to
wear long clothing when outdoors and to use insect repellent
liberally.
</P>
<P>
   There have not been a human cases of West Nile reported in the
state. Last year the virus sickened 55 people and killed 7 in
Queens, N.Y., all of them elderly. On Monday, New York officals
closed that city's massive Central Park after infected mosquitoes
were found there, though no humans have tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Believed to have originated in Africa and Asia, West Nile is
most likely to be fatal in the elderly, and state officials said
all cautions apply doubly to them. Infants are also at higher risk.
In most younger, healthy people the virus is typically benign.
</P>
<P>
   State officals said they will aggressively test all dead animals
found in the area for signs of the virus. Hospitals will also be on
the lookout for patients with West Nile-like symptoms. Horses
throughout the state will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were urged to protect themselves and pets against
mosquitoes, and empty any outdoor containers filled with water
because mosquitoes breed around stagnant water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how intense the force of transmission is
locally. It may be that we will see another Queens 1999 in Boston
or that (Wednesday's findings) are the end of things,'' said Andrew
Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at Harvard School
of Public Health. ``We'll soon have some handle on how intense the
outbreak is likely to be, or if there will be an outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   State officals have been testing dead crows regularly since the
virus first appeared in New York last year. Though it was expected
more likely to turn up in southern cities, where birds migrate,
officials said they weren't caught off guard by Wednesday's
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not surprised at all at the findings,'' said Ralph
Timpari, assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Laboratory
Sciences. ``It's a single bird. It's not a time of being overly
concerned. It's an indication of how rare it is in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause
encephalitis or inflammation of the brain. It is transmitted
through mosquitoes which become infected from birds that carry the
virus. It cannot be spread by person-to-person contact, such as
touching, kissing or caring for someone who is infected.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile tends to produce flu-like symptoms, such as slight
fevers, headaches and body aches, five to 15 days after the initial
bite. The most severe infections can cause headache, high fever,
neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions,
paralysis and sometimes death. In most of the people who get the
virus, it passes unnoticed. Only a small percentage require
hospitalization. Of those, only 7 percent die.
</P>
<P>
   There is no treatment and no vaccine.

 &QL; 
A WEST NILE VIRUS Q AND A &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. West Nile encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by
West Nile virus, which is commonly found in Africa, West Asia, and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long has West Nile virus been in the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not known how long it has been in the U.S., but
scientists believe the virus has probably been in the eastern U.S.
since the early summer of 1999, possibly longer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do people get West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. By the bite of a mosquito that is infected with West Nile
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the basic transmission cycle?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds.
After an incubation period of 10 days to 2 weeks, infected
mosquitoes can then transmit West Nile virus to humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you get West Nile encephalitis from another person?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. West Nile encephalitis is NOT transmitted from
person-to-person.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from birds?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no evidence that a person can get the virus from
handling live or dead infected birds.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from other insects or
ticks?
</P>
<P>
   A. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for West Nile
virus. Ticks infected with West Nile virus have been found in Asia
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the symptoms of West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most infections are mild and symptoms include fever,
headache, and body aches, often with skin rash and swollen lymph
glands. More severe infection may be marked by headache, high
fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors,
convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis and, rarely, death.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is West Nile encephalitis treated?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no specific therapy. In more severe cases, intensive
supportive therapy is indicated, i.e., hospitalization, intravenous
fluids, airway management, respiratory support and good nursing
care.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a vaccine against West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the incubation period in humans (time from infection
to onset of disease symptoms) for West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually 3 to 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who is at risk for getting West Nile encephalitis?
</P>
<P>
   A. All residents of areas where virus activity has been
identified; persons greater than 50 years of age have the highest
risk of severe disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What proportion of people die when infected with West Nile
virus?
</P>
<P>
   A. Case-fatality rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent and
are highest in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many cases of West Nile encephalitis occurred in the U.S.
in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before August 1999, West Nile virus had never been reported
in the U.S. In 1999, 62 cases of severe disease, including 7
deaths, occurred in the New York area. No reliable estimates are
available for the number of cases of West Nile encephalitis that
occur worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can infected dogs or cats be carriers and transmit West Nile
virus to humans?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no documented evidence of person-to-person,
animal-to-animal, or animal-to-person transmission of West Nile
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can I do to reduce my risk of becoming infected with
West Nile virus?
</P>
<P>
   A. Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early  &UR; evening &LR; . Wear
long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are outdoors. Apply
insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin. An effective repellent
will contain 35 percent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). DEET in
high concentrations (greater than 35 percent) provides no
additional protection.

 &HT;    CAN'T SETTLE JERUSALEM? LEAVE IN GOD'S HANDS

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When low-level negotiators can't settle a dispute,
they usually ``bump it upstairs'' for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not turn to The Man Upstairs(CQ) to settle the dispute
over the holy city of Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli academics suggest Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators break their deadlock over the city by giving God
sovereignty over the most sacred _ and disputed _ areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that Jordan's late King Hussein repeatedly
advocated. The intent is to break the stalemate on a largely
symbolic issue with a symbolic solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Ruth Lapidoth, one of several
scholars who advise Israeli negotiators. ``Sovereignty is an
abstract notion that makes people's feelings very strong. It's a
symbolic notion that makes it very difficult to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the issue of sovereignty, which means ``supreme
power,'' in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, should be set
aside for 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, either you say sovereignty belongs to God or you
say each side shares sovereignty,'' said Lapidoth, who is a law
professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and a researcher at the
Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem was the biggest snag in the recently failed, 15-day,
Camp David summit. Negotiators announced Thursday that they would
start low-level meetings in the region on Sunday and the talks are
sure to turn to the city once again.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has controlled the entire city since capturing its
eastern areas in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that sovereignty has little impact on daily life.
Israeli negotiators, in broad terms, already appear willing to give
Palestinians near-total control their own neighborhoods. There are
a number of ideas, including joint police forces or a city borough
system, that could lead to practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis refuse to cede sovereignty, and Palestinians won't
take a deal without it.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports from the summit that the negotiators
discussed placing sovereignty with God. But, the suggestion was
noted Thursday in Israel's Ha'aretz daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Lapidoth said she does not know what kind of reception
Palestinian and Israeli leaders might give it.

<P>
   Frankly, friends, it's a miracle I'm able to sit up and write
this, but thanks to the inventiveness of modern pharmacology and
the support of my grief therapy group I have managed to make it
half way through Kathie Lee's Farewell Week with only one or two
minor breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   I confess I lost it Tuesday morning when Kathie Lee's buddy
Diane Sawyer presented the discount diva with a set of human-size
butterfly wings and fondly urged, ``Soar!'' Kathie Lee donned the
wings and capered about the stage. Really, I said to myself, there
won't be many moments like this on TV from now on, say what you
will about the possibilities of ``reality'' programming. What will
we do without her?
</P>
<P>
   During this period of national mourning I have tried to tell
myself that Kathie Lee isn't really going away permanently, she's
just changing her career path and exploring hitherto unplumbed
depths of her talent. Stretching, as they say in show business.
Still, it's difficult to live with the knowledge that Kathie Lee
will no longer be sitting there with Regis every weekday morning
doing what she does so well, whatever it is. Let others speculate
about who will get her job. Who cares. No one can replace her.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee occupies a unique place in our culture. She's our
bipolar celebrity. We either love her or loathe her. She's a
wholesome, all-American girl, a down-to-earth mother of two
adorable children who is struggling to save her marriage. Or she's
a self-obsessed no-talent who's built a career on making a public
spectacle of herself, her husband, her children.
</P>
<P>
   This stark divide in public opinion is cleverly exploited by the
current issues of two supermarket tabloids, the Star and the
National Enquirer. Both publications are owned by the same company,
American Media Inc., and both have a history of covering Kathie
Lee's every move as it really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   What will Kathie Lee do when she leaves ``Live!''? Take your
pick of stories. The Enquirer has her on the cover, with the
headline, ``Kathie Lee Gets Even'' and the line, ``Regis is
history, Frank's next.'' According to anonymous ``friends,'' she's
quitting the show to minimize bad publicity when she dumps aging
philanderer Frank Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the Star's version, the Enquirer's is more
upbeat, quoting another anonymous ``friend'' who has the
not-so-happy couple repairing to some secret destination to work on
saving their marriage. ``The talk show queen is determined to lay
the groundwork for a long and happy future with Frank,'' the
Enquirer states.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that seems absolutely certain is that Kathie Lee
is determined to lay the groundwork for a very happy future for
Kathie Lee. She's said to have a sitcom in development, she's been
angling for a starring role in a Broadway musical, and she's
determined to become a successful singer-songwriter. On ``Live!''
earlier this week she announced that she's been busily creating new
songs with producers Ernie Lake and Bobby Guy. She insisted on
playing a sample. I don't recall the exact words, but it was
something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing): I've had it up to
here with you, you bum, and I've found somebody better.
</P>
<P>
   I got the feeling that Regis was not the inspiration for this
song, although he was sitting there with an expression that seemed
to say, ``Only three more days! Give me strength!''
</P>
<P>
   It may be Kathie Lee's Farewell Week on ``Live!,'' but not in
any larger sense. I have the feeling that this is just the first of
many farewells, and that like Barbra Streisand, the Judds, and so
many others, Kathie Lee will be saying goodbye to us again and
again, for years to come.

CAREGIVER'S DEPARTURE AN EARLY LESSON IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When a favorite teacher left the Ben &AMP; Jerry's Children's
Center in Waterbury, Vt., Amy Brandt, one of the remaining
teachers, braced herself for the children's sadness.
</P>
<P>
   She particularly worried about 2 1/2-year-old Christopher.
Katie, the teacher who left, had been his primary caregiver. Every
day, she would wait for him as he woke up from his nap, and he
would sit in her lap until he felt ready to play. She didn't talk
to him or read to him or even sing to him. She just held him.
</P>
<P>
   The first day after Katie left, Brandt waited for Christopher
and offered him her lap. Christopher refused. Instead, he stood 2
feet away from her, sniffling and crying.
</P>
<P>
   The second day, a fellow teacher suggested Brandt gently pull
him to her lap. Another wondered why she bothered at all; he
clearly didn't want her. Brandt had a different interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his way of telling me, `You aren't the same person as
Katie. I miss her,' '' she says. ``I wanted him to know it was OK
to be disappointed and sad. I was telling him, `I will respect your
feelings. I'll sit here 2 feet away from you as long as you need me
to, so you won't be alone.'' Each day, Christopher inched closer.
By week's end, he sat in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   With annual national turnover for day-care teachers hovering at
40 percent, a child may see caregivers leave at least once a year,
sometimes more. Unfortunately, teachers aren't always as
developmentally savvy as Brandt, and neither are we as parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get jealous at how close a child is to a caregiver and
upset at the depth of their loss. It gets in the way of helping,''
says psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, a researcher at Judge Baker
Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a child's deepest attachments are to parents, and
nothing comes close to that, Waldinger reassures. Moreover, most
children are flexible and adaptable and take change in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a young child benefits from feeling close to one or two
adults in addition to parents, because he constructs a sense of
himself through others: If people who care for him value him, he
learns he is valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That enables him to see the world as a safe place,'' Waldinger
says, which, in turn, helps him feel free to explore his world.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, says child developmentalist Claire Lerner, is that
when a caregiver leaves, a child's sense of security can be
undermined. Lerner is on the staff of Zero to Three, a national
nonproft group that advocates for healthy children's development.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Creatures of habit
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How children cope depends on their stage of development:
</P>
<P>
   The 3- to 12-month-old. What's going on developmentally:
Predictability and routine are what make babies feel safe, for
instance that a caregiver smells the same each day or sings the
same song as she changes the diaper. A baby also sees a caregiver
as an extension of herself, not as a separate person.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may feel she's lost her own sense of power when a
caregiver leaves, even if someone else comes in and does exactly
what the previous caregiver did,'' says Brandt, who now consults to
day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Behaviors you may see: Fierce clinginess. ``It's a baby's way of
saying, `If I let you out of my sight, you may disappear, too,' ''
says Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   What do to: ``Parents figure, they're babies, they don't need to
do much for them,'' says Brandt. ``In fact, a baby may be most
sensitive to loss because the interactions she and a caregiver had
were so intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The more a parent and new caregiver tolerate clinginess, the
sooner it disappears; indeed, Brandt advises new caregivers to use
a backpack or stomach sling for heightened body contact. She also
recommends using the same soap, shampoo, and fragrances as the
former caregiver and learning each baby's quirks, for instance, how
each likes to be held or put down for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your baby is only six months, acknowledge the loss, says
Waldinger: ``I bet you miss Ann; I do.'' A baby understands your
tone if not your words. Besides, he adds, ``It's good to get in the
habit of verbalizing what's happening for them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toddler insecurities
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12 to 24 months. What's going on: A young toddler is just
beginning to understand that an object or person stays the same
even when she can't see it, enabling her to use us as a home base.
``They feel safe enough to leave you to explore, but they're always
looking over their shoulder to make sure you're there,'' says
Brandt. If a caregiver actually does leave, it could make a toddler
insecure and also cause her to lose the skills she learned from
that person.
</P>
<P>
   Behaviors you may see: Regression.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``The worst thing is to insist, `But I know you know
how to do this,' '' Brandt tells parents. Toddlers regress in order
to establish with the new person the trust and skills they gained
with the previous one. ``You have to go with the backslide knowing
it will be short-lived,'' she says. It may speed up the process if
you talk freely and positively about the departed teacher: ``Oh,
look! Here's a picture of you and Katie. I bet you miss her.'' This
grants her permission to love the new teacher without feeling
disloyal to the old one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young child's identity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   24 to 36 months. What's going on: He's beginning to identify
himself by what he has: ``I am who I am because I wear red shoes
and my caregiver is Toby.'' When Toby leaves, that identity is
threatened. Because a young child is a concrete thinker, he also
may blame himself for her departure: ``I was bad; that's why she
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Behaviors you may see: Temper tantrums, clinginess, conflicts
with peers, difficulty with transitions, requests for diapers.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: As stumped as you may be about the diapers, don't
fight them. ``She doesn't really want diapers,'' says Lerner.
``What she wants is to be a baby again, because that's when the
caregiver she misses was there to take care of her.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wants power. ``Her world changed and no one asked
her,'' says Lerner. ``So she's going to extremes to regain some
sense of control.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's advice is to grant her the control she wants but in a
way that doesn't undermine her progress: ``You know, you are the
master of your body. Here's the drawer with pull-ups and big-girl
underwear. You decide what to wear.'' When the pull-up needs
changing, don't lay her down as you would for a diaper, but
encourage her to help take it off and put the new one on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers' fears
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3-to-5 years. What's going on: Loss of a caregiver can
exacerbate fears and make preschoolers more vulnerable to them,
especially the fear of losing someone you love.
</P>
<P>
   Behaviors you may see: Bad dreams, fearfulness, pretend play
that uses loss as a theme.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Stock your dress-up trunk at home with the kind of
clothes the nanny or teacher wore; at Brandt's center, they got a
pair of hiking boots like Katie's. Share with them the sense of
loss: ``See that truck? It's like the truck Toby drove. I miss
Toby, don't you?'' Help them manage fear by connecting it to their
feelings: ``It was so hard and scary when Toby left that you're
worried other people might leave, too, huh?'' Then offer
reassurance: ``You know what? Mom and I are both here; we aren't
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Children of all ages benefit from some small goodbye ritual,
such as singing a teacher's favorite song together one last time.
``You want a caregiver to say goodbye, even to a baby,'' says Gwen
Morgan, an early childhood educator at Wheelock College and one of
the nation's leading day-care researchers. At home, help your child
draw a picture to give to the teacher. ``It gives them a sense of
control,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Departure spawns book
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brandt was so struck by how big a deal Katie's departure was
that she wrote a book for the school that has since been published,
``When Katie Was Our Teacher'' (Redleaf Press).
</P>
<P>
   Brandt was amazed at how powerful and helpful the book was:
Children carried it around with them, hid it under the blocks, read
it to dolls, read it to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teachers know we miss Katie, so they made a special
missing place for us,'' the book reads. ``They tucked it down low
in a quiet place . . . next to a smiling picture of Katie. . . . I
think Katie misses us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW PARENTS CAN HELP &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --With turnover on the rise, some centers minimize the impact of
loss by having teachers stay with groups of children from infancy
through preschool. Only about 5 percent of centers currently do
this, but day-care advocate Gwen Morgan hopes the idea will catch
on.
</P>
<P>
   --Initially, a child may seem unfazed when a caregiver leaves:
It can take up to three weeks for her to realize he isn't
returning.
</P>
<P>
   --A child under 3 needs about one-week's notice that a caregiver
is leaving, a 3- to 5-year-old slightly more.
</P>
<P>
   --When you're looking at a day-care center, ask about teacher
turnover rate. Thirty percent or less is acceptable, anything more
isn't. When you're hiring an in-home caregiver, expect at least a
year's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   --Transitions will go more smoothly if you keep other changes in
a child's life to a minimum. Even small changes count, like mom
getting a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   --If a child's behaviors don't get back to normal within three
weeks or so, consult your pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT: The one human being most capable of curing
antisocial aggression in a boy is his biological father, according
to studies cited in ``Father Facts, 3d Edition,'' published by the
National Fatherhood Initiative.

CONTRACTOR WILL SAVE RENOVATION HEADACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Our bathroom needs to be brought into the 21st century. When
I had a half-bath installed not long ago, a plumber and carpenter
did the work. For the redo of the big bathroom, should I hire
individuals to do each step or hire a contractor who would
coordinate all the workers?
</P>
<P>
   FRANCES McKAY, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Coordinating all the workers _ and there will be more than
just a plumber and a carpenter _ is the key to the success of the
project. I think hiring a contractor to do it all is your best bet.
It will save you lots of headaches. If you plan on doing some of
the work yourself, you can hire each individual and have him or her
work around your part of the project.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am painting inside my house. The living room and dining
room have popcorn ceilings. What is the best way to remove that
popcorn when there is asbestos underneath? Can the popcorn be
removed without disturbing the asbestos? If asbestos needs to be
removed, how is it done?
</P>
<P>
   MANUEL SILVA, San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. If there is asbestos on your ceiling, you should not remove
any finish that is on top of it, including the popcorn ceiling. You
can buy popcorn patching material that you can apply to the
ceiling, but don't try to remove the old popcorn before
establishing whether it contains asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Besides popcorn, the only other type of asbestos ceiling used in
a home is made of mineral-fiber tile. To find out if your ceiling
contains asbestos, break off a small piece of the tile, or whatever
is under the popcorn ceiling, and a piece of the popcorn; put them
in sealed plastic envelopes and take them to an asbestos abatement
company.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are listed in the Yellow Pages under ``Asbestos
abatement.'' They can also remove the asbestos safely, though not
inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no asbestos, you can scrape, sand, and wash off the
popcorn and paint what's under it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is insulated with foam, installed back in the 1970s.
Would I have trouble if I were to put the house up for sale?
</P>
<P>
   P. N., Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That foam in your walls is probably urea formaldehyde foam
insulation, popular in the 1970s. It is an excellent insulator, and
properly installed, is safe.
</P>
<P>
   However, some installations were defective because the
formaldehyde did not foam up properly, resulting in illnesses among
people allergic to formaldedyde. So it was banned in Massachusetts
and later the whole country. It was removed from some houses, but
not all.
</P>
<P>
   Your insulation sounds as if it was properly installed and is
causing no harm. If you put the house up for sale, you must declare
that the house is treated this way. Some buyers may not be
concerned, others might. If you find a buyer who would like to buy
the house but objects to the foam, and you accept his offer, then
it must be removed by the seller. That's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My sink overflowed and very hot water dissolved the finish on
my new linoleum. The luster or shine is all gone. What can I apply
to it to help seal the finish and restore the shine?
</P>
<P>
   FLORENCE HELLAND, Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Call the manufacturer of the linoleum, which is sheet vinyl,
to see what he recommends. He might have something to restore the
shine. The dealer might know, too, but I think you are better off
going directly to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   If no success there, you could treat the dull spot with Future,
an acrylic finish. I have done this on sheet vinyl with pretty good
results. But nevertheless, caveat emptor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am redoing my bathroom, and putting in an exhaust fan. I
also would like to paint the walls and ceiling with a mildew-proof
paint. Is there such a thing, and does it work?
</P>
<P>
   M. A. F., Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, there is such a thing. The Zinsser company calls its
Perma-White a mildew-proof interior paint, and guarantees it for
five years. It is sold in paint stores that carry the Zinsser
brand.
</P>
<P>
   Since you are putting in an exhaust fan, make sure it vents
outdoors. The fan will help keep an ordinary painted wall and
ceiling free of mildew for longer than five years, so you may not
need the mildew-proof paint. Turn the fan on during showers and
keep it on for half an hour afterward to exhaust any remaining
water vapor. That should do it.

CHENEY'S ROLE IN GULF WAR IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Dick Cheney arrives next week at the
Philadelphia convention, the Republican Party plans to celebrate
the former Defense Secretary's role in winning the Gulf War. But
the celebration may be dampened by one inconvenient fact: nearly 10
years to day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is still in power.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's survival is a bitter memory for Cheney, whose term at
the Pentagon during the Bush Administration from 1989 to 1992
generally is viewed quite favorably even by some of the usual
critics of defense secretaries. The Gulf War victory symbolized
Cheney's power in the Pentagon, and he played a larger role in war
strategy than is widely known. But for all the smart bombs and
successes, the victory is often considered incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cheney's tenure at the Pentagon was marked by a blend of
clear achievement and seeming contradiction. He greatly increased
defense spending in his early tenure, but then oversaw a 25 percent
reduction in the Pentagon budget. He urged construction of a costly
missile defense system known as ``Star Wars'' but also sought to
kill a variety of military programs that were popular in Congress.
He mostly left battlefield decisions to the generals, but also
helped devise the stratagem that sped the war to its conclusion. He
oversaw the armed forces, but never served himself, using a series
of deferments that enabled him to avoid military duty when he was
young.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, according to Brent Scowcroft, the former director of the
White House National Security Council during the Bush
administration, Cheney ran the Pentagon in a ``hands-off'' manner.
``But he was decisive when he wanted to intervene. He fired the
chief of staff of air force for stepping out of line. He killed
programs he didn't think were worthwhile. He had a lot to say about
individual targeting'' during the Gulf War.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was actually former President Bush's second choice as
defense secretary. Bush's first pick, former Senator John Tower,
was rejected by the Senate after charges surfaced about Tower's
drinking and womanizing. Cheney then won unanimous approval.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney swiftly took the Pentagon's reins. Just one week after
taking office, he publicly upbraided the Air Force Chief of Staff,
General Larry Welch, for talking to congressmen about new
nuclear-missile programs without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in January 1991, shortly before Operation Desert Storm
got underway, Cheney fired General Michael Dugan, who had replaced
Welch as Air Force Chief of Staff. Dugan's offense was telling
reporters that air power alone would defeat Saddam Hussein. First,
Cheney disagreed with this position _ he believed US ground forces
would ultimately be needed to push Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. But
more than that, Dugan was speaking out of turn, presenting as US
policy a view that clearly was not.
</P>
<P>
   But in general Cheney was not a boat-rocker. He was seen at the
time, and is still remembered, as a highly competent manager who
knew how to deal with Congress and the public, and who also emerged
as an able diplomat, serving as Bush's emissary with Saudi and
other Middle Eastern officials in holding together the allied
coalition after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are normally critical of defense secretaries have
good things to say about Cheney. ``He did an excellent job on the
Gulf War,'' says Franklin Spinney, who has been a systems analyst
and a well-known gadfly inside the Pentagon for over 20 years. ``He
stayed out of the military's hair, gave them the support they
needed. He did what secretaries of defense are supposed to do, and
did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early stages of planning for the Gulf War, the
commander, General Norman Schwarzkopf, presented a combat-plan that
called for sending US troops right at the center of the Iraqi line
to drive the enemy forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney thought this a bad idea and he rejected it. Scowcroft
confirmed that a frontal assault was the recommendation from the
field and also opposed it. He and Cheney believed it might be more
effective, and cause fewer American casualties, to send troops
around to the left of the battlefront and attack the Iraqis from
the rear _ the famous ``left hook'' that Schwarzkopf eventually
adopted with such success.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney says his best decision was to suggest Colin Powell become
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Cheney wasn't afraid to
rebuke his friend. Powell, in his autobiography, ``My American
Journey,'' recalls that Cheney was upset with him for questioning
the idea of liberating Kuwait. Powell thought it made more sense to
defend Saudi Arabia's oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin, you're chairman of the Joint Chiefs,'' Powell quoted
Cheney as saying. ``You're not secretary of state. You're not the
national security adviser anymore. And you're not secretary of
defense. So stick to military matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney himself had to stick to military matters when it came to
ending the Gulf War without capturing Hussein. When the war ended,
the United States and its allies did not try to go to Baghdad and
oust Hussein. But Scowcroft said that was not Cheney's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has nothing to do with Cheney,'' Scowcroft said. ``He
wasn't the decision maker. The president was the decision maker and
the NSC agreed when we stopped the war. Cheney was no more
responsible for it than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Scowcroft acknowledged, ``We assumed (Hussein's)
own military would take him out because he had suffered such a
disastrous defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Bernard Trainor, who
co-authored a book about the Gulf War called ``The Generals' War,''
said in an e-mail interview Wednesday that Cheney attended a White
House meeting where Bush and his advisers discussed an early end to
the war ``but Cheney was not a major player in the discussion.''
Still, around that time, Cheney was so convinced that Hussein would
soon be out of power that he bet a Trainor colleague a dinner that
Hussein would be gone in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney lost the bet.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War was only one aspect of Cheney's tenure. He had to
deal with no less than the restructuring of world power with the
end of the Cold War. The Soviet empire was collapsing, the Berlin
Wall was crumbling, Mikhail Gorbachev _ a new type of Soviet leader
_ was talking peace. The whole rationale for the US armed forces
over the previous 40 years _ the Soviet threat _ was coming
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials advocated cutting the budget, devising radical
arms control proposals. Cheney resisted these notions, fighting
rearguard battles within the Bush administration. Cheney presented
defense budgets that cut spending, but cautiously. He distrusted
Gorbachev, thought he would not last long and that his successor
might be even more hostile to the West than those before him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was coming to pay more attention to his budget director
than to his defense secretary. His secretary of state, James Baker,
and his national security adviser, Scowcroft, were advocating more
daring arms-control proposals, over Cheney's objections _ and Bush,
more often than not, went with their counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney is not a fan of negotiated arms control,'' Scowcroft
said. ``He said, `We ought to make our own decisions.' He was not
out in front on arms control. He said, `Hey, we are winning now, we
have the Soviets on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the conservatives on the congressional armed services
committees were willing to cut the budget more deeply. In mid-1990,
the widespread word was that Cheney was out of touch with the
changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by 1991, Cheney was starting to adapt. Cheney eventually
agreed to the arms control proposal being pushed by Scowcroft and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also killed a number of major weapons systems, most
notably the Navy's A-12 Stealth fighter _ which, at $30 billion to
$60 billion, was the biggest program ever terminated by a defense
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to kill the V22 vertical take-off aircraft, the
F14D fighter jet, and the Seawolf submarine, though, ironically,
Democratic congressmen, fearful of the resulting job-losses in
their districts, restored them to the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also moved to cut the armed forces by a half-million men,
and to shut down over 40 military bases that, as a result, would no
longer be needed. He also held the B-2 Stealth bomber program to 20
planes, when the Air Force wanted at least four times that number.
</P>
<P>
   These moves marked quite an evolution for Cheney, who, while he
was a congressman in the early-to-mid 1980s, behaved as a
straight-line hawk. He supported every major weapons program, and
voted to scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   John Isaacs, head of the Council for a Livable World, a pro-arms
control group in Washington, said Wednesday that Cheney's record as
defense secretary, especially after 1990, ``showed an individual
capable of breaking the mold... He showed a nimbleness in adapting
to a post Cold War national security environment and proved willing
to make tough decisions against politically popular weapons
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Cheney became a dove all of a sudden. He cautioned
against deep cuts in the military budget. In Nov. 1990, when
Scowcroft and Baker were hailing the post-Soviet ``new world
order,'' Cheney saw ``potential power vacuums'' arising from these
global shifts _ ``the kindling, if you will, for potential
conflagrations across the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that by the year 2000, over two dozen nations would
have ballistic missiles, 30 would have chemical weapons, 10 would
be able to deploy biological weapons. None of these predictions
have nearly come true, though Cheney's pessimism about the risks of
proliferation is more fashionable now than it was then.

&HT;     AMERICAN WORKERS CAN LEARN A LESSON FROM THE FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are a worker, one of the greatest places
in the world to be right now is Paris. It's always wonderful, of
course, but what makes Paris particularly special at this time of
the year has nothing to do with the Eiffel Tower, the
Champs-Elysees or the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could be seeing all those wonderful sites and gorging
on wonderful food, but late July also offers the anticipation of
what comes in August: An entire month of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time you're staring at the back of a
bumper during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not every Parisian takes August off, but French law
requires employers to give workers more than four weeks of vacation
a year, according to a study by Hewitt Associates. So a lot of
Paris simply shuts down in August.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt reports that similar laws mandate at least four weeks of
vacation for workers in such countries as Australia and Brazil and
almost all of Western Europe. These are not rewards for years of
service; they are legally required for employees who have been with
a company at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hewitt says, typical workers get about two
weeks of vacation after their first year. You may eventually get up
to four weeks, but often that comes after 15 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? The Eiffel Tower is missing, and
so is a lot of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is going through one of the greatest economic
booms in its history, yet a lot of workers from the middle class on
down are progressing like a hamster on a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   If you're frustrated because your portion of the boom has been
more of a fizzle, there are a lot of people you can blame, like
politicians, for favoring the rich and not having better labor
laws, or your employer, for being greedy and insensitive. But if
you want to meet face to face with the person who deserves most of
the blame, find a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a good worker and you haven't managed to squeeze more
than a cost of living raise out of your employer in the last three
years, what exactly are you waiting for? Being an unrewarded worker
these days is sort of like keeping your virginity during the Summer
of Love; you are passing up an opportunity you may never see again.
</P>
<P>
   It's not news anymore when an industry is struggling for
workers. High-tech companies want to relax immigration laws so they
can get more engineers, police departments are advertising like
crazy for officers, restaurateurs are begging for good waiters.
</P>
<P>
   You have a lot more leverage than you think you do. Employers
are finally realizing how hard it is for them to replace a good
employee, especially in this market.
</P>
<P>
   And getting an extra week or three of vacation is one of the
easiest concessions you can get. Yes, companies have to scramble
when workers are on vacation, but it allows the businesses to get
by without the out-of-pocket costs they face with pay raises or
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask for more vacation and get turned down, it can mean
one of several things:
</P>
<P>
   You're not as good as you think you are.
</P>
<P>
   You're in a weak company or industry.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't make a good case for the extra vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't believe it will lose you.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss is an unappreciative dolt.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you negotiate anything, point out how it makes sense
from a business standpoint. Explain how the extra vacation will
allow you to be more creative or less distracted by family events
or whatever else you can come up with from a business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of negotiating, mention anything you can about
competing companies' pay and benefits if it helps your case. That
gives a subtle message that you are thinking about leaving, or at
least considering your options.
</P>
<P>
   Stop short of threatening to leave. Once those words have left
your mouth, there will be an extra layer of tension between you and
your boss. Any smart boss with a smart worker will realize that
you're perfectly capable of leaving. Keep the threat unspoken.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not overestimating your own value and you still get
turned down, that means either that your boss is an unappreciative
dolt or you're in a weak company or industry. (Certainly successful
small businesses might have a legitimate argument against long
vacations, but make sure your other benefits make up for that.) Do
you have any reason to believe the circumstances will be better a
year from now?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, if your boss is new and simply needs to get to know you
better. Or your industry is in a typical down cycle. Or your
company suffered a setback, but you have a good reason _ other than
blind faith _ to believe the situation will turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, though, you should take the rejection as a warning
signal. Something is seriously wrong _ with your performance, with
your relationship with your boss, with your company or with your
industry. And if things are sour at this point, what makes you
think they will get any better when the economy inevitably hits a
downturn?
</P>
<P>
   Unless you come up with a good answer, you next long vacation
may be one you never asked for.

AMITYVILLE KILLER STILL SERVING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is the Amityville Horror killer still in prison?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.M., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ronald DeFeo Jr. is serving six consecutive 25-year prison
terms at the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, 1974, DeFeo was 23 when he shot and killed his
parents and four younger siblings with a rifle at their Amityville,
N.Y., home. He made an unsuccessful bid for a new trial in 1993,
claiming his sister Dawn murdered the family before he killed her
in a fit of rage.
</P>
<P>
   The next owners of the home, George and Kathy Lutz, claimed it
was haunted by demons, floating pig heads and meat-eating flies,
inspiring a bestselling 1977 book, 1979 movie and eight subsequent
films and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutzes' claims encouraged ``ghost-busters'' and others from
around the world to visit the house, Newsday columnist Ed Lowe
wrote in 1998. ``Amityville saw the entire country, and later
emissaries from the world, through a prism of mass hysteria and
unfathomable stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the bugle call Taps?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.W., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Taps was written by Union Gen. Daniel Adams Butterfield and
first performed in July 1862 in memory of the men who died in the
Seven Days battles.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional bugle call at day's end was Light's Out, but
Adams thought it was too formal, according to the White House's
National Moment of Remembrance Web site at
www.whitehouse.gov//remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music was beautiful on that still summer night and was
heard far beyond the limits of our brigade,'' the first Taps
bugler, Oliver Wilcox Norton, is quoted as saying. ``The next day,
I was visited by several buglers from neighboring brigades, asking
for copies of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Taps is played during the National Moment of Remembrance, which
occurs for one minute at 3 p.m. local time each Memorial Day. The
ceremony honors Americans who died serving their country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the mailing address of Coretta Scott King?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.J., Bakersfield, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to her in care of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Social Change, 449 Auburn Ave., N.E., Atlanta, GA 30312.
</P>
<P>
   King, 73, helped persuade the Justice Department to conduct a
new inquiry into the April 4, 1968, murder of her husband. James
Earl Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to shooting King as the civil
rights leader stood on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Justice Department concluded after an 18-month
investigation that there was no credible evidence to indicate a
conspiracy in King's murder.

POOR NATIONS NEED SOME RELIEF IF THEY'RE TO TRY TO LEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Developments at the recently concluded G-8 summit summon to mind
thoughts of Jim Smiley and his frog, Daniel Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Such an association may seem like a bit of stretch to some. But
others may find the comparison not overly farfetched, because the
richer nations of the world pledged at the summit to help the
poorest make a great leap forward.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Smiley helped Daniel Webster do. Those who still
fancy Mark Twain's way of telling tall tales remember Smiley as the
leading human character of Twain's short story ``The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.'' Smiley trained Daniel Webster
to be the best broad-jumper of his species in that neck of the
woods. For his troubles, he won significant sums of money by
betting that his frog could outjump anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost a $40 bet to a stranger who stuffed Daniel Webster
full of quail shot while Smiley was off in the marsh capturing
another frog for the stranger to pit against his amphibian athlete.
</P>
<P>
   When the two nudged their frogs to start the contest, the
stranger's sprang an impressive distance, but old Daniel Webster
couldn't move. The stranger got away before Smiley realized that he
had been had.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest countries in the world face predicaments similar to
Daniel Webster's. They are weighed down by problems that prevent
them from rising out of poverty and fecklessness to compete
effectively in the new global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the figurative birdshot that holds them down is the
legacy of European colonial domination. That is particularly true
in Africa, where the European colonists established national
boundaries without regard to tribal territorial claims and set the
stage for recurring strife in the continent after those colonies
achieved independence.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial powers also handicapped those countries
economically in many instances by transforming them into producers
of one or two exportable commodities, undermining their subsistence
farming and making many of them into net importers of food and
other basic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that weigh them down include inadequate health
care, lack of educational opportunities, poor transportation
infrastructure, and venal politicians and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Add to those loads the heavy indebtedness of many poor nations
to the governments and lending institutions of the G-8 countries,
and it becomes as impossible for them to rise as it was for Daniel
Webster to levitate with a belly full of BBs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary criticisms of the G-8 summit is that the rich
nations did not go far enough in promising debt relief. Such
criticism is justified because some the poorer nations must make
such heavy payments on their debts to other governments and private
banks that they have nothing left with which to address crying
fundamental needs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the richer nations need to offer more debt relief if
the poorer nations are to evolve into significant markets for their
goods and services. Such debt relief, however, must be provided
only on conditions that the resources freed up will go to
education, health care and other fundamental needs instead of
lining the pockets of politicians and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism has been leveled at the G-8 nations for their
emphasis on closing the ``digital divide.'' The richer countries
promised to launch a public-private sector program to help the poor
get more access to computers and the benefits of the rapidly
evolving technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of that promise made at the Okinawa summit labeled
it a ``let-them-eat-chips'' response to the plight of the world's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is true, as one critic pointed out, that ``You can't
eat laptops,'' it is a serious mistake to underestimate the
importance of expanding access to computer technology to poorer
inhabitants of the poorest countries. It is just as crucial as debt
relief to getting them to where they need to be to compete in the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poorer nations need help in addressing fundamental
needs, that alone will not enable them to catch up. The poorer
nations really don't have time to build the infrastructure that has
been developed over generations in the rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the kind of digital help that was pledged at the G-8 summit
could be just the nudge to get the birdshot out of them and allow
them to leap-frog over several of the stages of economic, social
and political advancement through which the more affluent nations
had to pass.

GARTH GAINES FEW FANS WITH PART 2 OF HIS ROCK/POP ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was during Garth Brooks' marathon two-hours-plus taping for
``Austin City Limits'' one night last fall that word came down that
a few people had ``actually walked out'' as Brooks did a short set
from his new rock/pop CD, ``Garth Brooks In ... The Life of Chris
Gaines.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand, this was Brooks, stadium-filling superstar, playing
before fewer than 500 devoted fans; someone in the last row could
have tossed a tennis ball underhanded and hit the stage. And still
there were those that were so put off by his foray into pop/R&AMP;B/rap
that they turned their backs on their hero.
</P>
<P>
   There were 12 songs spread over an hour in the second edition of
the Brooks taping. Most of the show _ and most of the event _
centered on the country hits, and all were capably performed by
Brooks and his band; sandwiched between all those favorites, he and
a second band (younger, multiracial) did only four songs from the
Gaines CD.
</P>
<P>
   Two, ``Main Street'' and ``Way of the Girl'' are here, and
months later it's pretty easy to see why the Gaines project was a
colossal boondoggle. Coming just after Brooks does two solo
acoustic numbers, ``Unanswered Prayers'' and Bob Dylan's ``To Make
You Feel My Love,'' ``Main'' and ``Way'' arrive like a stink bomb
at a Saturday-night beer bash.
</P>
<P>
   These two songs _ the first a slice of faux-Midwest rock, the
latter unappetizing pop/funk _ show exactly why the Gaines project
was a relative failure and why the Brooks camp has been very quiet
about it and the scheduled Gaines-themed movie ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaines project _ and this show _ underscore that Brooks has
always been a singer with one foot solidly in the pop-rock camp.
Check how much ``Rodeo'' or ``Ain't Going Down (Til the Sun Comes
Up'' are informed by solid, meat-and-potatoes rock, the nods to the
Eagles that lurk just under the surfaces of several tunes, and the
obvious Jimmy Buffett rip-off that is ``Two Pina Coladas.''

<P>
   It's this mixture of rock and country that allowed Brooks to
capture a larger audience than any country artist _ although he was
familiar and easy on the ears to mainstream country fans, he also
roped a whole bunch of aging rock fans into his camp, people who at
the dawn of the '90s felt left behind by grunge and rap.
</P>
<P>
   His mainstream inclinations _ and slice-of-life stories _ have
always been his greatest strengths. They certainly were that
November night in Austin, and they will be again, now that Brooks
is putting this whole Chris Gaines thing behind him.

REAL-LIFE LESSONS ON MAKING ASSUMPTIONS

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   That's a hard lesson to teach and an even harder lesson to
learn. I thought I had mastered the concept, and then last weekend
I realized that I haven't.
</P>
<P>
   We were at my mom's family reunion, and all 13 of my mother's
siblings along with about a hundred of my cousins were there. We
were doing the little drawing thing for the person who had come the
farthest and the person with the fattest baby when my Aunt Lola
announced that someone named Robert had recently gotten married.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we were all quite puzzled because we've had several
relatives tie the knot this summer but none of them is named
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the back of the room, my cousin Snooky slowly stood up
with this big cheese-eating grin on his face. I'm Robert, he said.
A collective gasp rose like a cloud of dust. We've called this man
Snooky since he was born. Everyone thought his real name was
Snooky. His mother even looked a bit surprised. I think she had
forgotten his real name, too.
</P>
<P>
   We have a cousin named Sweetmeat, so Snooky seemed almost tame
in comparison. I suppose Sweetmeat's real name is Arthur or Kyle.
But never in a million years would you guess that Snooky is really
a Robert. He looks nothing like a Robert.
</P>
<P>
   All the Roberts look alike, you know. No hair on their necks.
Good posture. Long fingers. So anyway, as I said, looks can be
deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to make this point to my boys a few days ago. We were
sitting in the car waiting for my husband to return from the store.
It was a little after nine and the air in the car was as hot as a
sauna. My husband always takes the keys, as if we are going to
leave him or something.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, most of the stores in this little strip center were
closed, and only a few cars were in the parking lot. A noise
attracted our attention, and that's when we noticed a gentleman
slowly walking along the sidewalk in front of the stores. He was
checking the locks on the doors, causing the rattling sound we'd
heard. He shuffled along as if each step was more painful than the
last. The few, isolated strands of white hair on his head were
plastered to his scalp. The gun at his side was almost bigger than
he was.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to my two sons and said, ``What do you think about that
security guard? What do you think his background is?''
</P>
<P>
   My youngest son suggested, ``I don't think he likes his job, but
maybe he doesn't know how to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior shook his head and said: ``Well, he probably didn't save
up for his retirement, because he doesn't need to be doing this
job. He can hardly walk and it's way too hot out here.''
</P>
<P>
   You're both wrong, I said. ``His name is Bill and he's been a
millionaire since he was 20 years old. He has a master's degree in
sociology and a law degree, although he never practiced law because
he started his own company right out of law school. He's a
second-degree black belt in karate. He usually runs six miles every
morning, but right now he's recovering from knee surgery. He's
doing this job because walking is part of his physical therapy and
one of his employees is out sick. The security company is one of
four companies that he owns.''
</P>
<P>
   My children looked at Bill with heightened respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he really a second-degree black belt?'' my oldest son
asked.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled and said, ``I don't know. Actually, I made the whole
thing up. But what I guessed could be correct, just like what you
guessed might be right. On the other hand, we could both be wrong.
All we know for sure is that that fellow is an adult male with a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, why do you do stuff like that?,'' my baby boy whined.
``Why would you make all of that up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' I replied, ``what I did was make an assumption, and
it's the same thing that a lot of people will do when they look at
you and see a young, African-American male. They may think good
things or bad things, but they are going to form an opinion about
you before you even open your mouth. But that doesn't change what
you truly are, does it? We can guess about that guard all day but
it doesn't change a thing about who he really is and what he can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   They still looked puzzled so I added, ``All I'm saying is, don't
let other people determine your value.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, we just sat in silence waiting for my husband _ or a
breeze _ to emerge from the darkness.

   CONCORDE-CRASH _ GONESSE, France _ Investigators have fully
extracted the data from the ``black box'' recorders aboard the Air
France Concorde that crashed
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, and have begun analyzing cockpit conversations and
engine readings made during the supersonic aircraft's doomed
two-minute flight, the French government said Thursday. The
government agency that investigates aviation accidents said
</P>
<P>
   it was unclear how soon the information contained on the flight
data and cockpit voice records would yield clues about what caused
the crash that killed 113 when
</P>
<P>
   the Concorde slammed into a small hotel near Paris. A memorial
service has been scheduled here in Gonesse for Thursday. Meanwhile,
a French aviation engineer
</P>
<P>
   who serves as an official adviser to French courts told La Croix
newspaper that evidence and observations suggest that a turbine
disc in the jet engine may have

   ISRAEL-JERUSALEM _ JERUSALEM _ When low-level negotiators can't

When it comes to the
</P>
<P>
   Holy City of Jerusalem, maybe The Man upstairs should settle the
dispute. An Israeli academic, who consults with negotiators in the
peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, suggests they
break their deadlock by giving God sovereignty over the holiest
parts of the city. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-MURDER-0728 _ MEXICO CITY _ When Juan Jesus Posadas
Ocampo, the Cardinal of Guadalajara, was machine-gunned to death in
his car outside the city's airport seven years ago, distraught
Mexicans wondered if their country was headed for hellish
Colombia-style violence. On Thursday, authorities here reveal the
conclusions of a years-long investigation into the shocking murder
of the Cardinal, who was riddled with bullets while wearing his
vestments and crucifix. An initial theory was that the Cardinal was
a mistaken target caught in the crossfire of two vicious
international drug-trafficking gangs, one of which is
</P>
<P>
   still on the FBI's most wanted list. The current Cardinal of
Guadalajara, a sharp critic of Mexican authorities' efforts to
investigate the crime, has said he fears the cardinal was murdered
in a conspiracy. (Ferriss).

_ the walking pneumonia had me. (Ernest Murray is managing editor

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ At least it's easy to come up with an excuse

climate of 90 degrees with a bit of shade and some air stirring
seems fairly tolerable after a full day of 103-degree weather in
the sun. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Chase Untermeyer of Houston, a
trusted ally of both former President Bush and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, thinks Dick Cheney will be a great running mate. Cheney was
chief of staff for President Gerald Ford when Bush headed the
Central Intelligence Agency. Brent Scowcroft was national security

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Judging by the rhetoric of the

   NAPSTER SAN DIEGO _ Napster has been enjoined from helping
people share music files after mindight Friday, but will the move

fans going to get their downloads? What alternatives exist and how
busy are they today _ and how busy is Napster for that matter? What
are fans saying, doing as the court deadline looms? (Fernandez,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)STEVENS _ As expected, WestPoint
Stevens said earnings were hurt by a large restructuring charge.
The West Point sheet and towel maker reported a second-quarter loss
of $89.8 million, or $1.81 a share, compared with a profit of $19.6
million, or 34 cents a share, in the prior period. The results
included a one-time pretax charge of $168.2 million. (Bond, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   MARKETS _ The outlook for profits has suddenly dimmed, thanks to
the Federal Reserve's year-long series of interest rate hikes. Most
economists now think the usual second-half rebound will not occur
this year, and analysts are worried that 3rd and 4th quarter profit
growth will slow. This casts a cloud over the outlook for the stock
market. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EARTHLINK _ EarthLink Inc. on Thursday reported booming
revenues, a shrinking loss and strong customer growth as it
continued its pursuit of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting its second quarter earnings, the company also
acknowledged some service problems during the earlier part of the

Drove/She Drove's Paul Lienert. Paul tossed me the keys and assumed

   REVIEW-CHEER _ Bubbly, bouncy Megan is a red-blooded,

a husky voice. You don't suppose she's a ... Megan's perplexed

<P>
   CHEER-PETERSON _ Long before his first script ever went before
the cameras, Brian Wayne Peterson's career was heating up. Based
solely on his spoof of gay rehabilitation camps But I'm A
Cheerleader, Variety named him one of ``10 Screenwriters to Watch''
in 1999. Now after a rocky road of production delays, a distributor
pullout and a temporary NC-17 rating, the 28-year-old gay writer
from Montana is waiting to see whether moviegoers are ready to
watch. In South Florida last month to attend a Pride FilmFest
screening, Peterson's spirits were buoyed by the reaction of the
predominantly gay audience. Still, he knows his satirical film must
attract a wider audience to succeed. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post)

Eddie Murphy returns in all his many Klump guises in a boon for
lovers of flatulence jokes. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW-PROFESSOR _ The key to a successful movie sequel is
figuring out what made the original such a hit and repeating it.
Leave it to anthropologists to explain why bodily function jokes,
crude humor, plus some clever makeup and two handfuls of
performances by Eddie Murphy sucked $270 million out of the global
economy in 1996 with The Nutty Professor. Just be content _ or
shake your head in distress _ knowing that Murphy and company have
gone and made another one. (Palm Beach Post)

   OLDIES _ DAYTON, Ohio _ In the cult action movie ``Escape From
New York,'' our hero, played by Kurt Russell, finds that every time
he meets up with someone new, the character's first line is: ``I
thought you were dead.'' Well, it seems appropriate to compare one
pop cultural form with another, especially when considering musical
acts you may have thought were dead. Maybe not in the literal sense
of having left this mortal plane, but certainly in the notion that
their time in the spotlight has passed. (Simmons, Dayton Daily

   E-BOOKS _ Here we go again with another concept that 15 years
ago wasn't even in the subconscious of mainstream society. The
assumption was that books as we've known them have always been and
would always just be...books. Not. Technology has wrapped it's
cold, sinewy fingers around the whole genre of bookreading.
Hardcover is taking on a whole other meaning that we will introduce
in this story. We'll make no vast, arguable statements about the
future success or failure of the technology; rather we will discuss
the evolution of books with a local bookclub and flip through the
advantages, disadvantages, pros, cons, eases and hassles of this
new literary tool. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   STALKING _Nearly 15 percent of American women say they have been
stallked at least once, in their lives, according to a new CDC
survey out Thursday. The results, which Atlantw women's rights
advocates say are startling, show that 2 percent were being stalked
at the time they were interviewed, one-third were injured as a
result of being stalked and more than half were so stressed that
their lives were disrupted for more than a month afterward. More
than four-fifths knew the person stalking them. Because two-thirds
of women were not injured, and one-third never reported the
stalking to police, traditional means of figuring out whether
violence against women is occurring (police reports, ER charts)
haven't found numbers like this, CDC says. The numbers come from a
survey of the female population of Louisisana but are broadly
applicable, CDC says. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

that there wasn't much difference between the two presidential

dropped his cloak of moderation to identify with the right wing.
Vice President Al Gore is now considering whether to pick a running
mate from his party's left wing. This is what elections are all
about _ choosing between different philosophies of governing. By

&HT;     PROTESTERS GEAR UP FOR PARTY CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to converge on the
conventions at which Republican Gov. George W. Bush and Democratic
Vice President Al Gore formally will accept their parties'
presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators hope to capitalize on the showy political
events to bring attention to their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Connected by Web sites, mass e-mailings, organizing meetings and
civil disobedience training, the activists are building on the
World Trade Organization protests in Seattle last fall and the
World Bank demonstrations in Washington in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, and the
demonstrators, are bracing for the same types of confrontations at
the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated convention protests have more targets than the
turbulent anti-Vietnam War demonstrations during the 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, activists hope to move beyond largely white
participation. They have been organizing in inner cities around
such issues as wages, police relations, high housing costs and
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't issues that will be raised on the floors of
either the Democratic or Republican conventions,'' said Van Jones,
31, executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in
San Francisco. ``If we don't go and raise these issues _ these
survival issues, that affect people every day in very real ways _
then they won't be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists are not pitching their message at politicians and
delegates at the conventions. ``I think the audience is the people
at home channel surfing,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jones, Leticia Arellano does not expect to sway the
delegates or ``change their consciences. But I hope we can push
them, to at least look at the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Arellano wants to build a long-term, anti-death penalty
movement. A goal is to convince California lawmakers to impose a
moratorium on executions, as did the governor of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Arellano, saying that the majority of prisoners are behind bars
for drug-related offenses, said the government should focus on
treatment and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people can change,'' she said. ``Their lives can be
reformed. Everybody has an opportunity to pursue a satisfying
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention begins Monday in Philadelphia. The
Democratic event starts two weeks later in Los Angeles.

   AIRFRANCE-CRASH (Paris) _ Developments in the investigation of
the Air France Concorde crash. After deciphering information from
the airliner's black boxes, crash experts hoped to form an initial
verdict Thursday of the causes of the crash. But they now say that
it may be several days before they complete their analysis. The

unrelenting combativeness of the army paratrooper he used to be. By

   PRISONERS-INTERNET (Chicago) _ Around the nation, thousands of
prisoners now advertise themselves on the Internet, sometimes
pleading that they were wrongfully convicted, sometimes looking for
money, sometimes looking for pen pals. While no American prison
allows inmates to have access to the Internet behind bars, these
prisoners use third-party services, usually for a fee, to reach out
to a potentially huge audience. Victims' rights groups have
expressed outrage over prisoners' popping up on Web sites, saying
that it inflicts more pain on the families of people who have been
harmed, and often distorts the truth. By Dirk Johnson.

   CALIF-DNA-TESTS (Los Angeles) _ Prosecutors in southern
California plan to offer free DNA tests to some inmates, which may
overturn their convictions. San Diego County prosecutors have been
reviewing the cases of about 560 inmates to determine whether DNA
tests developed since their convictions can link biological
evidence from a crime scene to someone other than the person
convicted. By James Sterngold.

   NY-POLICE (New York) _ Statistics released by the New York City
Police Department show a marked increase in disciplinary actions

   ILL-VOTE-VOICES (Evanston, Ill.) _ Interviews with voters in
this diverse, middle-class suburb in a swing state show that people

HYBRID AUTOS BRING FUTURE TO YOUR DRIVEWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 HYBRIDCAR KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so gas prices have dropped. You no longer have to hock the
good silver just to drive to work. Still, a buck fifty a gallon is
no bargain, considering you were paying a scant 80 cents just over
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an alternative to car pooling, canceling family
vacations and weeping silently behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   It's the new gasoline-electric hybrid cars, which despite some
consumer misconceptions _ no, they won't electrocute you if you
drive through a puddle _ might be in your driveway sooner than you
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we know what you're thinking. Electric cars are gimmicky
little eco-pods that get dented in a stiff breeze and have to be
plugged in every night, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not when it comes to the first two high-tech hybrids to hit
American shores. Thanks to groundbreaking technology that blends
gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors, both Honda
Insight and the Toyota Prius (Latin for ``to go before'') are more
capable and less needy than you might imagine. They drive easily in
traffic, can reach speeds greater than 100 mph and don't need to be
plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the best part. In addition to extremely low
emissions, a competitive price tag of $20,000 and the comforts
Americans have come to expect, the cars still get 50 to 70 miles
per gallon _ two to three times that of most regular cars.
</P>
<P>
   Both cars are available locally now. The Insight has been out
for several months. The Prius came out late last week.
</P>
<P>
   So what are they like?
</P>
<P>
   We drove the cars, interviewed retailers and owners and
consulted the director of the auto testing facility for Consumer
Reports. Here's what we learned.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius, almost a mid-size sedan, is larger and more powerful
than the Insight. It's designed to hold five adults. It has a
trunk, traditional gauges and a soft-riding suspension. The
Insight, a futuristic looking two-seater with a sweep of sheet
metal covering the back wheel wells, looks sportier and achieves
higher mileage.
</P>
<P>
   John Lewis of Leavenworth recently bought an Insight for his
daily commute to work at the Sprint campus. He used to drive a
large Ford pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gas bill has gone from $50 per week to $7.50 a week,'' said
Lewis, who got his car several months ago from O'Neill Honda in
Overland Park. ``That feels pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   It should. The savings add up to $217 per month, or more than
$2,500 per year. After his down payment, the savings easily make
his monthly payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of my criteria in determining whether it was
worth the investment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis expected some quirks from the new engineering but didn't
find any.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of things written that it is slow to
accelerate,'' he said. ``But how fast are you trying to drive? It
will easily cruise at 70 to 75 mph. The thing that will surprise
you is how responsive it really is. It has far exceeded my
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   To Lewis, the Insight is part car, part video game. While
driving, he constantly monitors a bar graph that displays the car's
current and lifetime miles per gallon (the Prius also has this
feature). Then he tailors his driving habits to maximize his
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said on a recent drive. ``I'm going 62 and getting
over 100 miles per gallon!''
</P>
<P>
   To date he's getting 72 miles per gallon on the highway and
close to 60 in the city. With practice, he thinks he can do even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to go on a long trip with it,'' Lewis said. ``I
should be able to get to Florida for about $15 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   David Champion, director of the Consumer Reports auto test
facility, has driven both the Insight and the Prius. And while he
appreciates the ingenious technology in the Insight, on balance he
prefers the Prius.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prius seems to be a much more usable car,'' he said. ``We
were impressed by how flawless it worked. It was just like driving
any other car. Unless you're a single person, or a couple who don't
need the rear seat and are quite satisfied with a stick shift (the
only transmission available in the Insight), the Prius is going to
be a better bet. Much more in keeping with what most people in the
U.S. want.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the Insight?
</P>
<P>
   The aerodynamics are outstanding, Champion said, and so is the
technology and, of course, the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnificent mileage, he said, his Insight suffered
from a stiff ride, road noise and a five-speed transmission that
could be fatiguing to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work to drive around,'' he said. ``You're always
changing gears.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners say that discomfort quickly fades. Many owners report
learning to shift quickly from second to fifth gear. Lewis, of
Leavenworth, reports his car is quiet, easy to drive and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Champion predicts the Insight's long-term popularity will
be limited. ``I think this car will mostly appeal to the die-hard
environmentalists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are similarities, though, too. The electric motor in both
cars turns into a generator that charges the car's batteries when
coasting or braking. The batteries do not need routine replacement.
And both cars come with alloy wheels, anti-lock brakes, dual air
bags, power windows, mirrors and door locks, remote entry,
theft-deterrent systems and more.
</P>
<P>
   .MDBO/.MDNM/One note: If you break down in a hybrid vehicle,
don't expect Joe's garage to be able to fix it. Because the
Insight's small gasoline engine runs all the time, even if the
electric boost fails, you will still be able to drive, albeit not
nearly as well. If you break down in a Prius, it's more
complicated, because the car uses its electric motor to get going.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure buyers, Toyota provides an eight-year, 100,000-mile
warranty on all hybrid components and a three-year, 36,000-mile
bumper-to-bumper warranty that includes all your routine
maintenance for free, such as oil and filter changes. The Prius
also comes with free 24-hour roadside assistance and free towing
anywhere in the country, plus a free loaner car brought to your
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any customer to be afraid of the technology,''
said Michael Davenport, a Toyota field training specialist.
</P>
<P>
   So even as technology marches forward, questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Will hybrids capture our imagination and in the coming decade
spread to virtually every make and model, like cruise control and
air bags? Or will it be a fad and fizzle out, like eight-tracks and
the rotary engine?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the answer to that, I'd be a rich woman,'' said
Samantha Patton, a sociological historian in New York. ``If I had
to venture a guess, I'd say as long as these are viable products,
people will accept the change but do it slowly. Of course, there
are a lot of factors that can change that. Let's say the price of
gas goes to $3 or $4 a gallon by next year, and a lot more
companies come out with similar (high-mileage) cars. The pace might
quicken considerably. On the other hand, if gas prices go back
under a dollar, you may not have many people willing to make a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically it's been difficult to get people to leave the
status quo and embrace new technology, said Don Smith, director of
the economic development center at Carnegie Mellon University.
Especially when they perceive a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain segment of the population who will buy the
new things no matter what. But most people are risk-averse.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole we have seen new technology embraced much more
quickly than in the past. It took almost two decades for a million
black-and-white televisions to be sold. And yet DVD players sold a
million units in the first year. So the pace of new technology
acceptance, or technology diffusion, has picked up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity endorsement could speed up the pace of acceptance,
Smith said. So are car commercials featuring Sting and Robert
Redford endorsing the more environmentally friendly electric
hybrids in our future?
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule it out.

<P>
   The verse that was stuck in his head for a few days recently
comes from a sad Richard Buckner tune called ``4am'', and Adam
Duritz, songwriter and lead singer for Counting Crows, couldn't get
enough of the ache in Buckner's shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part where he's completely abandoned the rhyme
scheme,'' Duritz said last week, ``and he sings, `Oh, my one, my
one, you've broken me ...,' and there's this catch in his voice.
It's a moment of complete honesty. I kept rewinding to that part,
for the devastation in his voice ... I look for those kinds of
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting Crows have been around since late 1993, and from the
start, Duritz has been willing to share his sad, desperate moments
with anyone who wanted a whiff of the gunk in his heart and the
stuff ``crawling around inside my brain,'' to borrow a line from
one of his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Crows' first record, ``August and Everything
After,'' became a commercial hit, the music landscape was changing
underneath them: Nirvana was kaput, Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish were
huge, and other shiny pop-rock acts like matchbox twenty, Third Eye
Blind and the Wallflowers were throwing hard in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Duritz, though, never stopped dining with his demons and ghosts.
Nearly eight years and two albums later, he and his band are
setting his baroque, melancholy poems to some infectious folk-rock
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray is my favorite color,'' Duritz sang on ``Mr. Jones,'' his
band's first big hit, an ironic declaration for a guy whose music
is so autumnal and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's sorrow in our music, but there's hope, too,''
Duritz said. ``But our songs are about people who still have hope,
and I think people miss that. That's where the yearning comes from:
They're in pain, but they still believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorrow that Duritz writes about isn't the heavy,
pathological kind that tormented, say, John Lennon, who never got
over the departure and loss of his mother; nor the physical and
mental anguish that drove Kurt Cobain to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Duritz's comes more from the bad weather that rolls in and out
of our lives and sometimes stays for too long: those long
Decembers, and the rain, which has been a redundant device in every
Crows' album.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Amy Hit the Atmosphere,'' a song about a lady who ``feels a
lot better'' when it rains, he sings: There has to be a change, I'm
sure//Today was just another day fading into another//And that
can't be what life is for ... In some ways, Duritz is Morrissey
after a few Tony Robbins seminars: a recovering melancholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of being an adult,'' said Duritz, who turns 36 on
Tuesday, ``is appreciating the flaws in your work and life and
getting through them. Even if you end up doing what you always
dreamed of doing, you have problems. Nothing can be pure and easy,
except being a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Duritz writes about love, too, but rarely about the one he's in
love with. Instead he remembers those he's lost or left, and even
then he explores and relives the consequences of the departure _
the solitary spaces, the unfilled time, those stark 4 a.m. moments
_ and not the women who created them. And he apparently forgets no
one.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mrs. Potter's Lullaby'' from the Crows' latest record, he
sings without a catch in his voice: ``There's a piece of Maria in
every song that I sing.'' And then, in trademark fashion, he
overwrites: ``And the price of the memory is the memory of the
sorrow it brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria is one of several women who have reappeared in Duritz's
songs during the course of three records. (She also shows up in the
first song on ``August.'') But his most famous heroine may be
Elisabeth//Elizabeth, who is the star of the melodrama ``Goodnight,
Elisabeth'' and who gets a postcard from Adam in the new song ``I
Wish I Was a Girl'': ``Hey, Elizabeth, you know I'm doing all right
these days ...''
</P>
<P>
   A guy who talks about his feelings and who doesn't fear
commitment _ even if it's only to the memories of his many
ex-girlfriends _ will never have trouble drawing women into his
life.
</P>
<P>
   So in chatrooms all over the Internet, Duritz has stirred up
plenty of interest in his exes and his love life (which reportedly
included a ``Friends'' actress), something that shouldn't surprise
a guy who writes ambiguously daring lines like : ``I'll wait for
you while she slips in something comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started,'' Duritz said, ``I thought we were a
great band. But I thought the songs were so personal that not many
people would relate to them. Obviously, people are relating. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is personal, but it isn't necessarily cathartic for
me. I don't think it simply makes everything better. If I'm having
a bad day, usually I'll write. Does it resolve what was wrong? No.
But if I write something, at least the mood hasn't been wasted. A
lot of getting older is about trying to fix things. Songwriting
fits into that somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that some of the issues crawling around in his
brain are trivial, he admits his latest project: ``I'm trying to
learn to like pumpernickel bread. I love food, so it bothers me
that I don't like this bread. So I bought some pastrami, and I'm
gonna sit down and try this.''

FORD SMASHES TAURUS EGGS, BUILDS A RIG THAT WON'T CRACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in the rooms where they cook up the design recipes for
Fords, somebody must have decided to make an omelet. Smash the
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Ford Taurus is almost totally lacking (except for the
Ford badge itself) those oval/egg-shaped patterns that ran through
windows, door panels, pillars, body panels, even the dashboard
control panel. In its last incarnation, it was easy to spot a
Taurus on the street. But it's also easy to spot a squeegee man.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, we can say the new Taurus is devoid of the ovoid.
</P>
<P>
   It is more square _ yet somehow sleeker _ and almost Focus-like
with its gently wedged hood, squinted-eye headlights, smooth rise
through the roof, and chopped back-end.
</P>
<P>
   But looks, vastly improved that they are, do not comprise the
essence of the new Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk safety.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only car sold in America with a base price under
$20,000 (you'll pay more for top-end versions) to win the
government's five-star crash rating for both the driver and
front-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The Advanced Restraints System is the answer. In a crash,
most people don't know what is happening to them and many don't
remember much after it is over. ARS knows. It is made up of a batch
of sensors that can tell if the front seat belts are being used;
how close to the dash the driver is sitting; how hard the crash is.
It uses this information to decide whether or not to tighten the
seat belts _ in a lower-speed crash _ or to relax them just a bit,
and thus avoid belt-caused injuries, in a harsher crash.
</P>
<P>
   Air bag deployment is softer in a lesser crash, more forceful in
a harder crash.
</P>
<P>
   Even before leaving the driveway, with the optional ($120)
adjustable pedals, shorter drivers can position themselves farther
back from the wheel and air bag by moving the pedal back as much as
three inches.
</P>
<P>
   Add optional side air bags and you are swathed in safety. Toss
in the glow-in-the-dark interior trunk handle meant to keep kids
from locking themselves in that cavern and you've got one very
safety-oriented automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Downside? Even with the redesign, it suffers from the plague of
so many midsize sedans _ Nissan Maxima, Honda Accord, Buick
Century, and Toyota Camry among them: This is America's nondescript
rental fleet. You won't turn a head driving any of them. But since
the Accord and Camry are the top sellers in this segment, there
must be a lot of folks who don't care.
</P>
<P>
   New for the front-wheel-drive Taurus this year is a 3.0-liter,
24-valve, V6 engine that puts out 200 horses. I would not buy this
3,000-pound-plus car without this option. Buy the SE model as
tested, at a base price of just under $21,000 and you get the
engine standard. Toss in traction control _ which should become
standard on every car _ a leather package, and upgraded sound, and
you're up to $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   The four-speed automatic transmission is one of the better I've
seen in a while. Better in that it understands what you, the
driver, are attempting. It senses your driving style and comes to
learn that when you stomp the pedal, you are probably passing
someone, so it lets the RPMs roam instead of shifting up
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The steering is solid, interior noise is minimal, and the thing
seems darn near European in its handling. Maybe Ford's ownership of
Volvo is slopping over here. It's not tight like a Volvo and still
has a sense of that distinct American tendency to float at the
front, but Ford is getting this ride down.
</P>
<P>
   The only real fault I find with this car is its brakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heavy midsize sedan and Ford should have moved past the
days of mixed brakes _ discs up front, drums in the rear _ by now.
With traction control and ABS (other features that ought to be
mandated as combined and standard), this car handles the way
today's cars should handle.
</P>
<P>
   Taking away from that handling, and to me, braking is an
essential element of handling, by clinging to an old system, does
not make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The giant taillights with their big turn signals. They really
let that jerk who is tailgating you know what you are up to.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Skinny outside mirrors. I found myself crouching in my seat at
times to aid rear vision. Hey, we're not trying to shave hundreds
of a second off our quarter-mile times with this rig. Give us
bigger mirrors.

 &HT;    CAN'T SETTLE JERUSALEM? LEAVE IN GOD'S HANDS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When low-level negotiators can't settle a dispute,
they usually ``bump it upstairs'' for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not turn to The Man Upstairs(CQ) to settle the dispute
over the holy city of Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli academics suggest Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators break their deadlock over the city by giving God
sovereignty over the most sacred _ and disputed _ areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that Jordan's late King Hussein repeatedly
advocated. The intent is to break the stalemate on a largely
symbolic issue with a symbolic solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Ruth Lapidoth, one of several
scholars who advise Israeli negotiators. ``Sovereignty is an
abstract notion that makes people's feelings very strong. It's a
symbolic notion that makes it very difficult to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the issue of sovereignty, which means ``supreme
power,'' in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, should be set
aside for 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, either you say sovereignty belongs to God or you
say each side shares sovereignty,'' said Lapidoth, who is a law
professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and a researcher at the
Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem was the biggest snag in the recently failed, 15-day,
Camp David summit. Negotiators announced Thursday that they would
start low-level meetings in the region on Sunday and the talks are
sure to turn to the city once again.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has controlled the entire city since capturing its
eastern areas in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that sovereignty has little impact on daily life.
Israeli negotiators, in broad terms, already appear willing to give
Palestinians near-total control their own neighborhoods. There are
a number of ideas, including joint police forces or a city borough
system, that could lead to practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis refuse to cede sovereignty, and Palestinians won't
take a deal without it.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports from the summit that the negotiators
discussed placing sovereignty with God. But, the suggestion was
noted Thursday in Israel's Ha'aretz daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Lapidoth said she does not know what kind of reception
Palestinian and Israeli leaders might give it.

   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Compare the feeling to Ed McMahon
unexpectedly ringing your doorbell with a million-dollar greeting
or Halliburton Co. suddenly calling about an opening to replace
Dick Cheney as its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For Tim Seder, such a moment came one afternoon this past spring
when he arrived home from his high school coaching job to find a
message on his answering machine from Dallas Cowboys kicking coach
Steve Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, you always see yourself as a little kid being
successful as a professional athlete, but at the end of college I
had moved on to being a teacher,'' Seder said. ``I didn't think I'd
have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder, three years removed from tiny Ashland (Ohio) University,
is fighting fellow rookie Rian Lindell of Washington State for just
such an opportunity _ to kick field goals for the Cowboys. And,
Seder is slightly ahead in the competition heading into the second
week of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Both likely will get opportunities to kick when the Cowboys face
the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday at 7 p.m. in the teams' preseason
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's made a few more field goals than Rian,'' Hoffman said,
``but it's certainly not cut and dried with one guy jumping ahead
of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, everyone can't help but smile at Seder's sudden
Cinderella showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's a unique individual,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said.
``He was out there teaching and coaching, and now he's got the
opportunity to kick in the NFL. There's no question he could be a
tremendous success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, former Ashland offensive line coach Dave
Jaumotte, an assistant with the Detroit Lions, mentioned to Hoffman
at the Indianapolis scouting combine that he knew of a good kicker
out of the school, located in central Ohio. As a result, Hoffman
asked for Seder to send a tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just in this high school gym without much light and
just a net hanging down,'' Hoffman said, grinning, of the resulting
video shot indoors because of a harsh Ohio winter. ``But he still
looked pretty good. I just kept the tape in my desk, because we
weren't looking for a kicker at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But 12 games into last season, the Cowboys replaced a struggling
Richie Cunningham with veteran Eddie Murray, who remains a
possibility this season should the rookies falter. Following the
season, the Cowboys started searching for a young kicker, one who
might save them money under the salary cap, instead of re-signing
Murray or the likes of Chris Boniol or Jeff Jaeger, who are still
available free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the hunt was on, all of these tapes were coming in, from
All-Americans to guys in Germany,'' Hoffman said. ``And every time
I looked at one, I kept going back and looking at Tim's tape.''
</P>
<P>
   So in early April, Hoffman called Seder, who was helping coach
basketball while getting ready for the baseball season at Lucas
High in Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call came as such a surprise,'' said Tim's mother, Soni
Seder. ``We just felt like the good Lord must have worked this out
somehow, and he was determined to give it everything he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Seder quickly agreed to a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he came down to Texas Stadium and he was just kicking in
this old pair of indoor soccer sneakers, but he kicked it great,''
Hoffman said. ``Once you find a guy who has that athletic ability,
you've got to look deeper into it and find the guy who can handle
the pressures of the NFL. You want a guy who's mature, steady and
humble, and one who keeps his mouth shut and just does his job.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Hoffman had found the perfect candidate in Seder,
who's married and signs autographs with a scripture (Proverbs
3:5-6) attached. The player has attended the same church, Grace
Brethren in Ashland, his whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky to be here and I thank the Lord every day for the
chance,'' Seder said. ``There's a lot of people who love to just go
in the back yard and kick, let alone come out here and play with
the Dallas Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Seder, 25, had stayed strong and active by
training with the boys he was coaching at Lucas High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working out with the kids was important,'' he said. ``Because
how could I tell them to do something if I couldn't? So if we got
up at 6:30 a.m. to lift weights, I would go and lift, and they
would also see me run and do those kinds of things.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seder's numbers weren't spectacular at Ashland, where he made 27
of 39 field goals and 37 of 40 extra points over his junior and
senior seasons in 1996 and '97. But Hoffman said he looks at a
kicker's form, not his statistics, when evaluating the player
because of all the intangibles that come with kicking in college,
including playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Seder, who is 5-feet-9-inches and 180 pounds, has a
classic delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the ball straight, gets the ball up and pushes it
through the goalposts,'' Campo said. ``But the kicking situation
(will be determined) by what happens in games and critical
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Seder also knows guys like Murray and Jaeger can show up on a
day's notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the NFL is,'' he said. ``They want the best people
out there, and that's what pushes you every day. I've said this
myself as a coach: If you don't have somebody to compete against,
then you're not going to get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his high school kids, imagine their reaction to learning
Coach Seder had earned a tryout with the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were happy for me,'' Seder said, smiling. ``I like to
think that I had pushed them in the weight room and all of those
things, but they were pushing me as well.''

THE TRUTH ABOUT STOCKARD CHANNING

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Stockard
Channing in scenes from ``The West Wing'' and ``The Truth About
Jane.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Third time's the charm, or so it seems.
 &HT;    At any rate, it's a pretty remarkable achievement for Stockard
Channing to have been nominated for an Emmy Award as best
supporting actress in a dramatic series _ despite the fact that her
performance has included only three episodes.
 &HT;    Perhaps it isn't so surprising, however _ as far back as her
performance as the wisecracking Rizzo in ``Grease'' (1978), it's
been hard to look at anyone else when Channing is on stage or
screen. No wonder that she can steal scenes even from so seasoned a
veteran as Martin Sheen, who plays President Josiah Bartlet to
Channing's First Lady Abby Bartlet in the hit NBC series.
 &HT;    If Channing cops the Emmy it will be her second, to go with a
Tony Award and an Oscar nomination for ``Six Degrees of
Separation'' (1993).
 &HT;    At 56, Channing is as busy as she's ever been. She's recently
wrapped not one but two independent films: the Canadian production
``Piano Man's Daughter'' and ``Business of Strangers,'' filmed in
New York. She has the first two episodes of the new season of
``West Wing'' in the can, as well as ``It's a Girl Thing,'' a
four-hour Showtime miniseries in which she plays a psychiatrist
whose patients include Kate Capshaw, Elle Macpherson, Rebecca
DeMornay, Mia Farrow, Linda Hamilton, Glenne Hedley, Lynn
Whitfield, Camryn Manheim and Channing's ``West Wing'' colleague
Allison Janney.
 &HT;    Then there's ``The Truth About Jane,'' a controversial
television movie airing Aug. 7 on Lifetime. Set in a quiet,
middle-class suburb, it's about a family shaken to its core when
the 15-year-old daughter reveals to her parents that she's gay.
 &HT;    Producer Orly Adelson says that Channing was essential to the
cast, since as the mother, Janice, she has a role that's in many
ways more difficult than the title character. The part demands an
actress who can be hostile and without understanding for most of
the story without completely losing the audience _ who can be
realistic while at the same time retaining some connection even
when the character is at her most unsympathetic.
 &HT;    ``You're willing to invest your emotion with an actress like
her,'' Adelson says. ``It works because she represents most mothers
in America who have a dream of what their kid should be, vs. who
they really are. She represents all of us.''
 &HT;    Struggling with a nasty cold, Channing admits that Janice wasn't
an easy role to get a handle on. The character thinks of herself as
liberal in thought, word and deed _ why, her best friend is an
openly gay man (RuPaul Charles) _ but she can't handle it when her
baby falls in love with the new girl in town.
 &HT;    ``She's in violent denial,'' Channing says. ``I wanted to make
her as human as possible. I didn't totally agree with the way she
was behaving, but one of the points of the piece is we all behave
this way all the time, especially when the mother/teen-age daughter
conflict is all tied up with it.''
 &HT;    Jane's father (James Naughton) is more understanding and
accepting. He is appalled at his wife's completely out-of-character
reaction _ but, Channing says, that doesn't make him automatically
the good guy.
 &HT;    ``Let's face it,'' the actress says, ``children are usually
raised by their mothers. What happens to this family is not just a
bolt of lightning _ there's an attrition involved, as there is in
any kind of conflict. The husband becomes good cop to her bad cop.
There's an isolation of this woman, and I found that very moving.''
 &HT;    Although the story is in part taken from the life of Lee Rose,
its writer/director, Channing says she too can identify with Jane's
situation.
 &HT;    ``I didn't make the best life choices when I was 15,'' she says,
``and when at 19 I told my mother I wanted to be an actress, I
thought she was going to shoot me.''
 &HT;    Jane accuses her mother of being concerned only with what her
friends will think. Janice insists that she's only thinking of her
daughter _ ``You don't understand how cruel the world can be,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Channing sees some truth in Janice's protestations.
 &HT;    ``She's not wrong,'' she says. ``Even today there are too many
stories still out there of persecution of kids in school who choose
alternative lifestyles in any way. High school is hell.''
 &HT;    As part of her research for the film, Channing _ a child of
affluent parents who studied at the Madeira School in McLean, Va.,
and then Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass. _ attended a meeting
of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, one of several
national organizations which offered support for the movie.
 &HT;    ``I walked into a huge ballroom in Washington, D.C., and
listened to these people testifying,'' the actress recalls. ``It
was incredibly moving. These were not particularly sophisticated
people, and they had no idea how to cope when this happened to
them. What they all had in common was figuring out how to keep
their family relationships together.''
 &HT;    Given the amount of preparation she likes to bring to a role,
it's astonishing that Channing can survive so busy a schedule.
 &HT;    ``I'm a little tired,'' she admits, ``but I like all the
juggling. I like a lot of variety in my life _ it enables me to
refresh myself.''
 &HT;    Still, she adds that she wouldn't mind cutting back on her
schedule to free up more time for ``The West Wing,'' if
writer/creator Aaron Sorkin were to expand her character.
 &HT;    Channing was taken with the show from its very first episode,
which she happened to see while unpacking her suitcase in yet
another hotel room.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `What a great show,''' she recalls. ``And a week
later I had a call from Aaron Sorkin to tell me they wanted me for
first lady. I really responded to the great actors, the writing and
the direction. I took three days off from the film I was shooting
and went to L.A. to talk to them.''
 &HT;    So far, however, the first lady has made only intermittent
appearances on the show, partly in deference to Channing's
jampacked schedule and partly because of the basic concept of the
series, which after all focuses on the West Wing, where the
president works, rather than on the East Wing, where he lives.
 &HT;    ``It's tricky to give her much to do,'' Channing says, ``because
she's really tangential to the West Wing action. Also, there are
seven or eight fabulous characters to be fleshed out.
 &HT;    ``But she's got a great, non-dysfunctional relationship with her
husband, and that's unusual in this era, particularly for a first
lady,'' she adds with a laugh. ``If Aaron wants to integrate me
more into the action, he'll figure out a way to do it. I'd just
love it _ but it's up to him.''
 &HT;    Offscreen, the actress has a non-dysfunctional relationship of
her own with cinematographer Daniel Gillham, with whom the
four-times-married Channing has lived for 14 years.
 &HT;    ``Maybe,'' she says, laughing, ``it's the not getting married
that is the charm!''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARAH LYALL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most
regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still
delightfully long, but it is also the month for the Edinburgh
International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and
theater.
 &HT;    Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as
international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm,
take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor
thoroughly spoiled for choice.
 &HT;    It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic
experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost
300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to
things such as education and health.
 &HT;    The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made
building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old
City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the
legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new
political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV
Bridge.
 &HT;    One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become
unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can
be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the
horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the
best.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly
eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival.
For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at
(44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800)
223-6108 in the United States.
 &HT;    Tickets can also be purchased at the Hub, the festival's
handsome new headquarters _ a prime spot for eating and shopping,
too _ on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:
 &HT;    On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing
Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ``Das Lied von der Erde,'' a
lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at
Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50
(calculated at $1.50 to the pound).
 &HT;    The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of
Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27
at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.
 &HT;    Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign
language. This year's possibilities include a German ``Hamlet'' and
a Spanish play called ``One thousand five hundred meters above the
level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of
madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets
from $9 to $33.75.
 &HT;    The Netherlands Dance Theater _ really three companies in one,
with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers _
is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights,
from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1,
the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting.
Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to
$55.50.
 &HT;    There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits,
dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets.
Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com.
Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.
 &HT;    From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of
pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath
kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds
to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows
are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.
 &HT;    Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists such as Ernst, Magritte and
Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully
organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in
north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will
feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is
free; the Dali exhibition is $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes),
celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful
gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous
borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and
shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.
 &HT;    The former royal yacht Britannia is docked on Ocean Drive in
Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages
5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.
 &HT;    It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium
Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the
royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This
minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its
diversity.
 &HT;    Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain
forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special
effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at
4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90
ages 5 to 15.
 &HT;    The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind
tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic
18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects
_ from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen
song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' _ that ordinary Scots have identified as
essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also
gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for
students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on
Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try

a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central
Edinburgh.
 &HT;    The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool
earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms
include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place,
Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.

 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street,
offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes.
Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a
port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose
parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal,
honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs
about $90. Reservations are essential _ there are only nine tables;
(44-131) 557-5732.
 &HT;    The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers
Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers
include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted
brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come
in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine,
generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for
$18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.
 &HT;    Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes
with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean
Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery
and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon
with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich
on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from
the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot
specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost
from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.
 &HT;    Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle
of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food.
At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried
vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil
dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of
 &HT;    layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and
an all-vegetable haggis _ no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for
two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
(44-131) 226-1112.
 &HT;    In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the
increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice
shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is
the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a
mortuary, then a bank.
 &HT;    At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather
permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill
Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at
dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with
red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14
George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''

 SIDEBAR: ALONG THE WAY TO 500-MILLION-YEAR-OLD FOSSILS  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    The gateway to the Canadian Rockies is Calgary, 130 miles east

timber and fieldstone was built in 1902 by the Canadian Pacific
Railway and restored in 1986 by Canadian Rocky Mountain Resorts.
Open year round, the lodge has 85 guest rooms, all with
wood-burning fireplaces, in 24 chalet-style buildings. There is a

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)
WYNDHAM.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VETERANS GET VIP TREATMENT IN BRANSON, MO.  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.
 &HT;    For more information about Branson _ including road information
_ call (800) 214-3661, or visit www.branson.tripusa.com on the Web.
You can also visit the city's Web site at www.bransonchamber.com.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANN CRITTENDEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Canadian Rockies are the only place I know where the
postcards don't lie. The snowcapped mountains and raging torrents
of water really are as spectacular as the glossy photographs make
them seem.
 &HT;    And among its charms, the area is blessed with one of the best
systems of hiking trails to be found anywhere. This is not a
secret; one of the first people to explore the region and to
recognize its hiking potential was Edward Whymper, the conqueror of
the Matterhorn.
 &HT;    On a trip last summer, my husband and I met more Germans, Swiss
and other Europeans on the trails than Americans, drawn to the kind
of civilized wilderness characteristic of Europe in the 19th
century.
 &HT;    At times we felt that we were in the era of Goethe and
Wordsworth, or at least of Frederick Church and Asher Durand and
other American landscape painters. Scenes: on a quiet road,
suddenly surrounded by a herd of male elk, their six- and
seven-point racks bobbing gently as they slowly grazed past us; on
a mountain ledge high above an emerald lake, chatting with
collectors of still unidentified Cambrian fossils; in a forest of
spruce and subalpine fir, motionless as a female moose and her calf
warily cross the path ahead; on a highline trail looking across a
valley at an explosive waterfall 1,000 feet high, with not another
soul in sight. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
 &HT;    Our first priority in planning this two-week trip was to find
good day hiking, allowing us to experience the mountains without
carrying 40-pound packs for days or having to endure the crowds and
the bus terminal madness that now surround the grand old hotels in
Banff and Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Of the five national parks that encompass the prime wilderness
of the Canadian Rockies, we discovered that the best one for our
purposes would be Yoho.
 &HT;    Banff, the first national park in Canada, including the crown
jewel of Lake Louise, is known as the hiking capital of the
country, with a huge network of well-maintained trails. But the
park also has more than five million visitors, most of them in July
and August _ too many to get away from without spending all one's
time above the tree line, sleeping on rocks.
 &HT;    Jasper, a few hours north up the magnificent Icefields Parkway,
has celebrated longer trails, but not too many get-away-from-it-all
day hikes.
 &HT;    Yoho, just west of Lake Louise on the western side of the
Continental Divide, has far fewer visitors (an estimated 1.8
million in 1999)and 185 miles of trails that can take you to the
top of the world and down again in time for a dinner and a book in
front of the fire.
 &HT;    Before we arrived in Yoho we spent a few days in Jasper and the
Lake Louise area. We liked the informal funkiness of the little
town of Jasper and our log cabin (and hot tub) in the woods nearby,
but we had to drive an hour or more each day to find good day
hikes.
 &HT;    We skirted the crowds at Lake Louise by staying eight miles away
at Lake Moraine Lodge, luxuriously rustic in the style of Ralph
Lauren. There a couple of world-class day hikes began right on the
grounds, but the lake itself, an emerald gem, was surrounded by day
trippers.
 &HT;    But on our first day in Yoho we had it all: a vigorous hike with
dazzling views; a glimpse into the geological forces that formed
this region; and seven kinds of weather, including drizzle, sun,
cloudiness and a brief hail storm. For outdoor activities in the
Canadian Rockies, the key word is layers _ rainproof layers.
 &HT;    We had joined a group put together by the Yoho-Burgess Shale
Foundation for a hike up to one of the most important fossil sites
in the world, now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
 &HT;    In 1989, Stephen Jay Gould, in his book ``Wonderful Life,''
described the ``weird wonders'' found here: strange,
500-million-year-old sea creatures displaying a greater disparity
than exists in the animal kingdom today.
 &HT;    The hike is no joke _ 12.5 miles round trip and an elevation
gain of about 2,500 feet, up to an altitude of 6,700 feet _ not
high by Colorado or High Sierra standards, but high enough to be
aware of thin air and aging muscles.
 &HT;    It was utterly worth it. The guide, a geologist named Carole
Augereau, gave us the rundown as we trudged up: how half a billion
years ago this area was the north shore of a vast supercontinent
surrounded by shallow warm seas, teeming with the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life.
 &HT;    Eons later, between 175 million and 45 million years ago, two
separate collisions of continental plates (moving at their fastest
at the speed of a growing fingernail) slowly pushed up the ancient
ocean floors, forming the mountain spines running north-south
through Canada and the United States.
 &HT;    Thus it was that in 1886 railway workers found ``stone bugs''
buried in alpine rocks, and from 1909 to 1917 Charles D. Walcott,
then head of the Smithsonian Institution and the foremost Cambrian
paleontologist of his day, found such marvelous marine
invertebrates as Opabinia, with its five eyes, Aysheaia, with its
mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles, and the strangest of all,
Hallucigenia, an animal so bizarre that for decades no one knew
which of its sides was up.
 &HT;    To our delight, Dr. Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum, who
has been excavating the quarry for 25 years, was at the site when
we arrived. He told us that thanks to discoveries in two new
quarries, in China and Greenland, as well as his own finds, there
is now evidence of even more unclassified Cambrian organisms than a
decade ago.
 &HT;    ``The Cambrian world,'' he said, ``is getting stranger-looking
than ever.''
 &HT;    Dr. Collins passed around a few of that week's finds, some of
which, to a lay person's eye, looked like faint scratchings on dark
grey pieces of shale. A few steps away, half a dozen graduate
students and volunteers were busy chipping away on stacks of muddy
rocks with hammers and chisels.
 &HT;    When I peered into the quarry to have a closer look, a handsome
French scientist looked up at me and said, with deep and
unmistakable pride, ``I just found a worm.''
 &HT;    The view from Burgess Ridge was unparalleled. On our left were
the massive limestone cliffs of Burgess Mountain and on our right
was Mount Wapta. In the distance loomed Michael Peak, the President
and the Vice President, all three covered in snow.
 &HT;    Far below lay Emerald Lake, the largest body of water in Yoho
National Park. (The explorer who gave Emerald Lake its perfect name
had to rename a lake already called Emerald. Its new name: Lake
Louise.)
 &HT;    I have found that one of the principal joys of a hike is
contemplating the pleasures that await its end. Daydreams of the
hot shower, the cool drink, the good meal and the soft bed tend to
crowd out more immediate realities, like the flora and fauna of the
last few knee-crushing kilometers downhill.
 &HT;    Toward the end of this particular 10-hour day the fantasies were
vivid, for we were headed for the Emerald Lake Lodge, another
sybaritic outpost. A few hours later, we were unwinding in a hot
tub overlooking the mountain-ringed lake, perusing a tempting menu
and building a fire in our bedroom. Ah, wilderness!
 &HT;    The next day we took a less strenuous stroll around the lake and
up into the basin behind it. We arranged for a naturalist to
accompany us. A cold, snowy winter and nonexistent spring meant
that the flowering alpine meadows we had hoped to see had still not
appeared, even by mid- to late July, but myriad earlier flowers
were scattered around the lakeside, including the ubiquitous white
globe flowers and bunchberry, wild roses, yellow columbines, bright
orange western wood lilies, purple asters, tiny white and green bog
orchids, and equally delicate twinflower (Linnaea borealis), a
Linnaeus favorite.
 &HT;    We also learned the secret of the mountain lakes' brilliant
turquoise color: a substance called rock flour. As the glaciers
that feed these lakes move down the mountains, the rocks embedded
in their base scrape against other rocks, grinding them into a fine
grayish powder that washes into the lakes as the glaciers melt.
This powder reflects the blue-green part of the light spectrum,
giving the water a hue that would be garish if any painter tried to
capture it.
 &HT;    The next day we were eagerly anticipating another major trek,
this time in the Lake O'Hara area, a uniquely beautiful place of
cirque and rock basin lakes, alpine heath and larch stands, framed
by the same two peaks _ Lefroy and Victoria _ that overlook Lake
Louise on the other side of the great divide. So beautiful is Lake
O'Hara that private vehicles are banned from the road leading into
it and a quota system limits the number of daily visitors to 150 to
200.
 &HT;    A day hiker from the town of Field, for example, has to make a
reservation for one of the six available seats on the daily bus
going in. You have to be at the tourist office at dawn on the
morning before you want to go. Unless you are one of the first six
people there, forget it.
 &HT;    Not being savvy, we arrived at 7 a.m. one morning and lost out.
The next day, seriously determined, we arrived at the still-locked
office by 6 o'clock, and there were only two people ahead of us.
Ten minutes later a young man from Quebec arrived, and there went
the last two spaces.
 &HT;    Literally one minute after that, an older man and his son came
up, only to be told, at 6:15, that they were too late. The
gentleman commented that the sight of the sun coming up over the
mountains had been so magnificent that he had stopped on the
highway several times to take pictures; otherwise, he said
ruefully, he might have made it.
 &HT;    ``That was you?'' the man from Quebec exclaimed. ``I was right
behind you.''
 &HT;    We picked one of the most popular hikes, from Lake O'Hara up to
Lake Oesa, then across a ledge around Yukness Mountain, down to the
Opabin Plateau, and back in time for the 6:30 p.m. bus.
 &HT;    Oesa (the Stoney Indian word for ice, so called because the lake
is frozen nearly year round) was, as predicted, gorgeous. But on
Yukness, big patches of snow still covered the trail, including one
long stretch that curved up and around the mountain with a
precipitous drop on one side.
 &HT;    At this point I remembered that I really am terribly afraid of
heights. I inched my way along the slippery track, digging now my
toes, then my heels, into the footsteps of the fools who had
preceded me. When we were finally back on solid, if not flat,
ground, I literally sobbed, relieved to be alive.
 &HT;    We began to saunter down toward the plateau. Just as I was
beginning to get back into the blissful rhythm of trekking, a voice
cried up at us from far below: ``A mother bear with two cubs!''
 &HT;    The most dangerous kind of bear.
 &HT;    We froze. ``Black or grizzly?'' my husband shouted back. We
didn't hear an answer. He scanned the valley below, and sure
enough, way down there, right where we were heading, were a large
tawny bear and two smaller ones, moving faster than race horses on
a diagonal away from the trail. They didn't look like black bears.
 &HT;    I thought of the ordeal behind me and decided I'd rather face a
grizzly than go back the way we'd come. We took a whistle out of
our pack and started tooting as we came down, making noise,
scanning both sides of the trail constantly, and marching briskly
back to Lake O'Hara. When I looked at the hiking guide later, I
realized that we'd seen nothing of one of the prettiest parts of
that hike.
 &HT;    We did get to be interviewed by the park rangers; a grizzly
sighting is big news, particularly in one of the most popular
hiking areas in the Canadian Rockies. It turned out they knew these
bears well _ they were even tagged. But they weren't supposed to be
hanging around trails those of us who are lower on the food chain
like to frequent.
 &HT;    Our final hike was more satisfying. The trail to take in Yoho is
called the Iceline, and true to its name, it was still partly under
snow even at the end of July. We had put it off until our last day,
which turned out to be a Rocky Mountain high, clear and sunny.
 &HT;    The first mile and a half was steadily uphill, sweetened by an
almost constant view of magnificent Takakkaw Falls, which burst out
of a rock cliff like a giant's broken water main. The trail climbed
high on the open avalanche slopes of the President Range and onto
the moraines of several glaciers, past two half-frozen glacier-fed
tarns.
 &HT;    We were dazzled by the utter stillness and vastness of the bleak
alpine landscape, so close to the glaciers and snowy peaks, and so
far above the Yoho Valley that we felt as if we were in the clouds
looking down.
 &HT;    There were no bears on the way down. Just crunching through
tracks in the snow in shorts and T-shirt, swinging hiking poles
like a cross-country skier, sliding down a snow bank to avoid any
more slippery traverses, down into the forest around another
pristine lake, past a raging river and more plunging falls. Yoho,
by the way, is a Cree word loosely translated as ``awesome.''

 &HT;    Rates are based on double occupancy and are given in U.S.
currency.
 &HT;    Emerald Lake Lodge, (250) 343-6321. The main lodge of hand-hewn
timber and fieldstone was built in 1902 by the Canadian Pacific
Railway and restored in 1986 by Canadian Rocky Mountain Resorts.
Open year round, the lodge has 85 guest rooms, all with
wood-burning fireplaces, in 24 chalet-style buildings. There is a

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY AURELIA C. SCOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva
in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my
husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and
roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with
newly acquired expertise.
 &HT;    The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the
Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound
Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped
by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look
bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering
lace fans and trays of castanets.
 &HT;    As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled
to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with
three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and
rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish
dinner time at 8:30 p.m. _ 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to
tourists.
 &HT;    And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought,
what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have
plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron
and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our
departure.
 &HT;    I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's,
Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including
Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CDs. We had combed newspaper travel
sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines.
 &HT;    I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to
another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and
relatives of friends for memories of their own trips.
 &HT;    Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a
two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called
to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.
 &HT;    Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ``Homage to
Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the
small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the
Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the
Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish
pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for
its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La
Mancha; and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.
 &HT;    I typed it all up _ flight numbers, hotel names, telephone
numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to
our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who
would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in
my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and
directions.
 &HT;    Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the
cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak. We
think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached
the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along
foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy.
 &HT;    And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark
corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not
sink to the floor.
 &HT;    Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I
reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically
perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us
giddy with pleasure.
 &HT;    Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and
down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined
boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous
wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like
wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ``I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila
specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.
 &HT;    Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily
along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing
BMWs.
 &HT;    Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my
imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's
terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as
Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares
and by its blissfully comfortable beds.
 &HT;    Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by
waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted
black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps
on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic.
 &HT;    ``Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian
pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.
 &HT;    On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the
southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised _ a tumble of low,
white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue
Mediterranean. The trip down the mountain took longer than planned;
plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the
slow-going curves of mountain roads into account.
 &HT;    We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to
the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there
(it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored
us.
 &HT;    Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada
sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The
structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were
tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is
signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time
when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real
Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.
 &HT;    Walking slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ``I wish
we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ``I cannot
remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at
each other.
 &HT;    Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante
Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered.
 &HT;    ``We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ``Immediately,
right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were
already too late.
 &HT;    ``The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ``Where would we
stop along the way?'' ``We can't make it back in one day.'' ``The
rental-car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''
 &HT;    This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans
because Avis might punish us?
 &HT;    A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam,
playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We
toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.
 &HT;    In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in
our cancellations. We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ``si, por
favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''
 &HT;    That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for
the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at
Bob. ``We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce,
as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our
shared adventure.
 &HT;    Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel
reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour.
Amazing.
 &HT;    The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered
enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and
succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner.
 &HT;    On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver
Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona.
 &HT;    And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What
about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove
in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our
hearts, not a schedule.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a trip to Tuscany, Italy, this fall and would
like to stay at a very special place. Can you find one for me?
 &HT;     A:  Palazzo Terranova is in Umbria, a 90-minute drive from
Florence. Perched at 1,800 feet overlooking the Tiber Valley, this
eight-room aerie is quite possibly the best and most beautiful
country-house hideaway in all of Italy.
 &HT;    Palazzo Terranova, which was built in the 18th century, has been
restored by Sarah and Johnny Townsend, a dazzling English couple
who have filled the rooms with family heirlooms, rare antiques, the
work of local artisans and laughter.
 &HT;    The Townsends' passion for Umbria and their wish to share their
experiences is apparent from the moment guests check in. Rooms are
spacious and each is named after an opera. There are no minibars
here, no televisions, no gadgetry. Instead, guests find four-poster
beds, great shuttered windows, 18th-century paintings, beamed
ceilings, trompe l'oeil, soft linens and total peace.
 &HT;    The Townsends have created a sweet retreat here _ each salon is
a work of art done in Old Master colors, and the library is crammed
with books affectionately inscribed by grateful guests.
 &HT;    Each day, the Terranova staff prepares delightful breakfasts to
be enjoyed on the fragrant terrace. Dinners celebrate the fresh
bounty of the Umbrian countryside. The wine cellar holds remarkable
Italian and French wines. A pool, three kitchens for culinary
instruction, a vineyard, an orchard and gardens await visitors.
 &HT;    Umbria's ancient treasures _ its churches, villages, trattorias,
wine country and friendly people _ are just minutes away as are
golf, horses, bikes, painting classes and hot-air balloons.
 &HT;    For all this quality, rates start at an astonishingly low $300 a
night, including breakfast. For more information, call
011-39-075-857-0083, e-mail sarah(AT)palazzoterranova.com or visit
www.palazzoterranova.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are planning to take our school-age children
to North Carolina's Outer Banks this summer. We keep hearing about
an outdoor drama that tells the story of Roanoke. Do you have any
information?
 &HT;     A:  ``The Lost Colony,'' America's longest-running outdoor
drama, was written in 1937 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Paul Green. It was originally intended to run for one season, but
success has propelled it into its 63rd.
 &HT;    ``The Lost Colony'' uses song, dance, drama and special effects
to tell the story of America's first English settlement (1584-1587)
and its eerie and mysterious disappearance. Impressive costumes and
the voices of the prestigious Westminster Choir College add special
touches to the performance.
 &HT;    The drama is staged at the Waterside Theatre, inside historic
Fort Raleigh. Ancient oak trees, laced with Spanish moss, frame the
theatre, and balmy ocean breezes help set the scene.
 &HT;    The production runs Monday through Saturday every summer from
June through August. Tickets range from $8 to $18, and children are
admitted for half-price on Monday nights. For reservations or more
information, call (800) 488-5012.
 &HT;    Another option is to purchase the Roanoke Island Queen's Pass,
(252) 475-1500. The pass, which costs $27 for adults and $14 for
children, includes admission to ``The Lost Colony,'' as well as the
North Carolina Aquarium, the Elizabethan Gardens and the Roanoke
Island Festival Park.
 &HT;    A great place to stay is the Tranquil House Inn on Manteo's
waterfront. Summer rates range from $149 to $189, and reservations
can be made by calling (800) 458-7069. Don't miss dinner at 1587,
located in the inn.
 &HT;     Q:  I am going to be in the Bahamas with a friend later this
year. While she loves nothing more than lying in the sun, I need a
little more stimulation. What else can one do there?
 &HT;     A:  While the Bahamas are typically known for their
sun-drenched beaches, bronzing bodies and exotic beverages, there
are also a number of other activities to keep you busy. For
example, between Sept. 22 to 24, try your luck at the Fall Black
Jack Tournament held at the Princess Casino on Grand Bahama Island.
 &HT;    The North Eleuthera Sailing Regatta will be held Oct. 12 to 15.
Spectators can watch as locally built sloops sail between Harbour
Island and Three-Island Bay, North Eleuthera.
 &HT;    During the second week of November, both visitors and locals can
take part in the 14th Annual Grand Bahama Conchman Triathlon _ a
.5-mile swim, a 20-mile bike ride and a 3.5- mile run.
 &HT;    And if you're still standing after that, why not get a head
start on your Christmas shopping at Nassau/Paradise Island's
Christmas Jollification Festival. Or try out your fishing skills at
the Annual Bahamas Wahoo Championships. Both events will be held in
early November.
 &HT;    For more information on these and other activities in the
Bahamas, visit www.bahamas.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  I have heard rumors about a series of art exhibits
featuring Los Angeles artists at the Bel Age Hotel and was
wondering if you could give me more information.
 &HT;     A:  Throughout the summer, the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel in West
Hollywood is presenting several eclectic art shows under the banner
``Art &AMP; Soul.'' The shows showcase the latest works from three L.A.
artists combined with live acoustic and jazz music.
 &HT;    The works of two artists can still be viewed this summer season
_ Michael Spalt, until Aug. 15, and J.C. Jaress, from Aug. 16 to
Sept. 12.
 &HT;    Each month the Wyndham Bel Age hosts a ``Meet the Artist''
reception in their La Brasserie Restaurant &AMP; Club, which has been
hailed as ``the best jazz room with a view'' by the Los Angeles
Times. These monthly receptions will also feature tantalizing
appetizers, fine wines and champagne.
 &HT;    For more information, please call La Brasserie at (310)
358-7776. For reservations at the Wyndham Bel Age Hotel, call (800)
WYNDHAM.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The days of the great ocean liners may be long gone, but there
are dozens of other ships making trans-Atlantic crossings that
don't reach the headlines. They're on repositioning cruises, and
major cruise lines such as Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line
and Seabourn Cruise Line offer them every year.
 &HT;    Cruises lines that sell Mediterranean cruises in summer
typically offer Caribbean cruises in winter. To get their ships
from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, they take them across the
Atlantic in September or October. In spring, come March and April,
they take them back. The ships are literally repositioned twice a
year, hence the name.
 &HT;    From the Mediterranean, these voyages tend to begin in Greece,
Italy or Spain, sometimes stopping in the Canary Islands before
ending up in the Caribbean. But these itineraries change as well.
Some ships may include stops in Morocco or the Cape Verde Islands
and may end in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or even New York.
 &HT;    Because each cruise typically has a few ports of call at the
beginning and end of each voyage, the length of a trip is usually
10 to 14 days. Within the business, they're known as ``blue water''
cruises, because the ships may spend a week or more on the open
ocean.
 &HT;    ``They attract well-traveled people who've already been to many
ports,'' Anne Scully explains. Scully, a certified travel counselor
and a vice president at McCabe Bremer Travel (1491 Chain Bridge
Road, Mclean, VA 22101; 800-747-84011; www.mccabebremer.com), adds,
``They get the ship at its best and get to play on it for five or
nine days. It's really a crossing, not a cruise. You get to read a
book from beginning to end.''
 &HT;    Scully sells many such cruises and says the major difference is
that ``on a traditional cruise, you're trying to keep up with the
shore excursions and ports. On a repositioning cruise, you keep up
with your own schedule.''
 &HT;    Traditionally, these cruises offer some of the best values in
the business. They're harder to fill because they're longer and
they occur in shoulder season. That means empty cabins that are
routinely discounted.
 &HT;    Scully speculates that ``people are afraid of them because of
open ocean. But these are big ships with stabilizers. Rogue waves
and rough water do occur, but the QE2, for example, regularly sails
trans-Atlantic from April to December.''
 &HT;    Repositioning cruises have traditionally afforded a prime
opportunity to sample luxury ships at middle-of-the-road prices.
Scully maintains that by shopping carefully, the seagoing public
can get a six-star ship for the price of a three- or four-star
vessel.
 &HT;    ``My rule of thumb is to go for the least expensive cabin on the
best ship,'' Sculley says.
 &HT;    Here's a sample of repositioning cruises this fall. Unless
noted, these are list prices, per person, based on double
occupancy, without airfare. A travel agent or cruise-only agent
should be able to find a good discount on these fares.
 &HT;    Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, FL 33132;
800-437-3111; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has a 12-night sailing on
the 1,950-passenger Millennium that departs Genoa, Italy, on Nov. 3
and then calls at Livorno, Italy; Villefranche, France; Barcelona
and Cadiz, Spain; and finishes in New York City. Prices start at
$3,209.
 &HT;    Holland America Line (300 Elliott Avenue West, Seattle, WA
98119; 800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) offers a nine-night
cruise on the 1,214-passenger Noordam that departs from Lisbon,
Portugal, on Nov. 28 and calls at Ponta Delgada and Horta in the
Azores, Half Moon Cay, Bahamas, and ends in Fort Lauderdale.
Holland America's ``Early Savings Fares'' start at $1,099.
 &HT;    Seabourn Cruise Line (6100 Blue Lagoon Drive, Suite 400, Miami,
FL 33126; 800-929-9391; www.seabourn.com) has a number of ships
that make trans-Atlantic crossings. Among them is the 116-passenger
Seabourn Goddess II, which departs Oct. 30 from Santa Cruz de
Tenerife, Canary Islands, and calls at Porto Grande, Cape Verde
Islands, before ending at Bridgetown, Barbados. Prices start at
$4,840 for the 10-night cruise.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: VETERANS GET VIP TREATMENT IN BRANSON, MO.  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Osmond Brothers ask all the veterans of war who attend
their showcase in Branson, Mo., to stand up, nearly one-third of
the crowd rises while the rest of the audience gives a thunderous
round of applause.
 &HT;    This show of respect is a common occurrence at the Osmond
production, one of many in Branson that run daily from breakfast to
bedtime to satisfy the more than 7 million visitors who come to
town each year.
 &HT;    Of those visitors, 2.3 million are veterans who, along with
their families, are treated like VIPs in this heartland town in
south-central Missouri. Some 250 military reunions are held there
annually, and there is even a hotline to help people organize
gatherings of all sorts, including military events. (For more
information, call 21st Century Tours at 877-349-3378.)
 &HT;    Branson's 5,000 residents and performers work hard to welcome
veterans with special treats. One that shouldn't be missed is the
six-day Veterans Homecoming, which takes place each November to
celebrate Veteran's Day. This year's celebration will include an 8K
race in which participants will walk or run _ even roll in
wheelchairs _ and special tributes to those who were bestowed the
Congressional Medal of Honor. In addition, several of the area
shows will be free to the public _ or heavily discounted _ to honor
our country's veterans.
 &HT;    For a schedule of events, write to the Branson Veterans Task
Force, P.O. Box 1726, Branson, MO 65615; or call (417) 337-8387.
 &HT;    
 THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL  
 &HT;    The book ``Shepherd of the Hills,'' a tale about the lives,
loves and deceptions of the Ozark mountain people in the early
1900s, sold more than 1 million copies when it was first published
back in 1907. Its overwhelming popularity played a large part in
putting Branson on the map. Suddenly, people from across the
country wanted to see for themselves some of the ``hillbillies''
described on its pages. Eventually, the book was adapted for the
stage, and today that show is still performed nightly from April
through October.
 &HT;    As part of festivities, audience members who pay an additional
board an open-air train that takes them on an historical tour of
the area. Highlights include passing by the home of Old Matt, one
of the show's primary characters, and the 230-foot Inspiration
Tower, a landmark on the pageant grounds. The tour also includes
special events, such as a bluegrass festival.
 &HT;    The production is great fun, and during intermission the actors
welcome spectators to make their way down to the stage, take part
in a square dance and chat with the cast.
 &HT;    A combination adult ticket for the tour and play costs $27;
admission to the play alone is $21. For more information, call
(800) 653-6288 or visit www.old-matt.com. Please note: Those with
mobility problems should discuss their needs when purchasing
tickets.
 &HT;    Another way to see Branson is to buy a ticket for the Branson
Scenic Railway, (800) 287-2462, a 40-mile round-trip tour onboard a
vintage-car train. Knowledgeable guides give riders a taste of the
local history. Except for mid-December to mid-March, the train runs
daily, including a dinner run Saturday nights from May to December.
The train leaves from the Main Street depot in downtown Branson. An
adult ticket costs $19.35 plus tax.
 &HT;    
 CRAFTSMAN COLLEGE  
 &HT;    Any trip to Branson wouldn't be complete without a stop in
Silver Dollar City _ (800) 952-6626 or www.silverdollarcity.com _
an historically recreated town that takes visitors back in time to
the turn of the century in Ozark country. Here, employees dressed
in period costumes man the rides, restaurants and shops, and many
of the booths show how common goods were once created.
 &HT;    Last fall, Dr. Jack Gillispie of Kimberling City, Mo., spent a
day in Silver Dollar City _ a day that would ultimately lead him to
discover a new hobby. Because of his fascination with metalwork, it
wasn't long before the family practitioner found himself hanging
around the blacksmith's shop. By watching the smithy work and
speaking with the ``locals,'' he learned that he could enroll in a
``Craftsman for a Day'' seminar, which would teach him the basic
skills of forging. Other craft seminars offer instruction in the
finer points of dipping candles and weaving baskets, much like the
locals did years ago, before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
 &HT;    On his second visit to Silver Dollar this past April, Gillispie
once again visited the blacksmith shop, but this time he was
immediately handed a costume that helped him blend in with the
other villagers. Then, after a lesson in safety procedures, the
doctor was put to work to the delight of the watching crowd.
 &HT;    Being more adept with a stethoscope than a hammer and anvil,
Gillispie started with a small task _ making a little nail. He then
moved on to crafting a metal hook to hang a flower pot from and,
eventually, a rose that was constructed step by step. ``Mine looked
more like a dandelion,'' he confesses, ``but I really got into it.
It was a blast.''
 &HT;    In fact, Gillispie was so inspired by the class that herecently
ordered his own coal forge and anvil for his home, where he plans
to start tinkering with metalwork and reading a few books on the
subject before returning to Silver Dollar City for more lessons.
 &HT;    The day-long programs range in price from $30 to $125, depending
on the craft. For more information, call (800) 695-1353.
 &HT;    
 MORE TRAINING  
 &HT;    In addition to day-long craft seminars, Silver Dollar City also
offers three- to five-day seminars in specific craft skills. For
example, a pottery seminar with Master Craftsman Todd Nelson is
slated for Sept. 8 to 10, and five woodcarving seminars will be
held March 5 to 9. The longer seminars vary in price from $75 to
$275, depending on the instructor.
 &HT;    For more information about Branson _ including road information
_ call (800) 214-3661, or visit www.branson.tripusa.com on the Web.
You can also visit the city's Web site at www.bransonchamber.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankly, friends, it's a miracle I'm able to sit up and write
this, but thanks to the inventiveness of modern pharmacology and
the support of my grief therapy group I have managed to make it
half way through Kathie Lee's Farewell Week with only one or two
minor breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   I confess I lost it Tuesday morning when Kathie Lee's buddy
Diane Sawyer presented the discount diva with a set of human-size
butterfly wings and fondly urged, ``Soar!'' Kathie Lee donned the
wings and capered about the stage. Really, I said to myself, there
won't be many moments like this on TV from now on, say what you
will about the possibilities of ``reality'' programming. What will
we do without her?
</P>
<P>
   During this period of national mourning I have tried to tell
myself that Kathie Lee isn't really going away permanently, she's
just changing her career path and exploring hitherto unplumbed
depths of her talent. Stretching, as they say in show business.
Still, it's difficult to live with the knowledge that Kathie Lee
will no longer be sitting there with Regis every weekday morning
doing what she does so well, whatever it is. Let others speculate
about who will get her job. Who cares. No one can replace her.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee occupies a unique place in our culture. She's our
bipolar celebrity. We either love her or loathe her. She's a
wholesome, all-American girl, a down-to-earth mother of two
adorable children who is struggling to save her marriage. Or she's
a self-obsessed no-talent who's built a career on making a public
spectacle of herself, her husband, her children.
</P>
<P>
   This stark divide in public opinion is cleverly exploited by the
current issues of two supermarket tabloids, the Star and the
National Enquirer. Both publications are owned by the same company,
American Media Inc., and both have a history of covering Kathie
Lee's every move as it really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   What will Kathie Lee do when she leaves ``Live!''? Take your
pick of stories. The Star has her on the cover, with the headline,
``Kathie Lee Gets Even'' and the line, ``Regis is history, Frank's
next.'' According to anonymous ``friends,'' she's quitting the show
to minimize bad publicity when she dumps aging philanderer Frank
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the Star's version, the Enquirer's is more
upbeat, quoting another anonymous ``friend'' who has the
not-so-happy couple repairing to some secret destination to work on
saving their marriage. ``The talk show queen is determined to lay
the groundwork for a long and happy future with Frank,'' the
Enquirer states.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that seems absolutely certain is that Kathie Lee
is determined to lay the groundwork for a very happy future for
Kathie Lee. She's said to have a sitcom in development, she's been
angling for a starring role in a Broadway musical, and she's
determined to become a successful singer-songwriter. On ``Live!''
earlier this week she announced that she's been busily creating new
songs with producers Ernie Lake and Bobby Guy. She insisted on
playing a sample. I don't recall the exact words, but it was
something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing): I've had it up to
here with you, you bum, and I've found somebody better.
</P>
<P>
   I got the feeling that Regis was not the inspiration for this
song, although he was sitting there with an expression that seemed
to say, ``Only three more days! Give me strength!''
</P>
<P>
   It may be Kathie Lee's Farewell Week on ``Live!,'' but not in
any larger sense. I have the feeling that this is just the first of
many farewells, and that like Barbra Streisand, the Judds, and so
many others, Kathie Lee will be saying goodbye to us again and
again, for years to come.

   APPLES-NASHVILLE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ I wouldn't know a Gibson
from a Stratocaster. My favorite guitarists are Django Reinhardt,
Eddie Lang and Andres Segovia, and none of them, as far as I know,
ever played a single note at the Grand Ole Opry. That could cast a
rather long shadow, I suppose, over my qualifications as a guide to
Music City, USA, except that there is a lot more than picking and
fiddling, a lot more than ballads of love and loss, in Nashville's
past, present and future _ especially its future. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   NY-OUTDOOR-SCULPTURE (New York) _ When it comes to outdoor
sculpture in New York City this summer, the animal kingdom seems to
have walked off with the main prizes. For quality and sheer size
there is Jeff Koons' ``Puppy,'' a 43-foot-tall flower-covered
sculpture in the shape of a West Highland terrier. For quantity,
ubiquity, relentless aw-shucks hokeyness and stupidity at toxic
levels, the prize goes hoofs-down to ``Cow Parade,'' a herd of
nearly 500 life-size Fiberglas heifers. Even without these two
unusual occurrences, the summer's outdoor sculpture offerings cover
a great range, especially if you stretch your definition of public
sculpture. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MONGOLIA-RELIGIOUS-ART (New York) _ Mongolia, the land of
Genghis Khan, windswept steppes and tough ponies, is seldom
associated with religious art. Yet such art always thrived there,
in the expressive ritual forms of a native shamanism and in gilded
icons produced in Buddhist monasteries. ``Dancing Demons:
Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia,'' at the Asia Society, presents masks

   The Integral Years: Poems 1966-1994 (Vol. III of The Crooked
Lines of God: A Life Trilogy) by William Everson (372 pages; Black
Sparrow Press; $30 hardcover, $17.50 paperback) America: A History
in Verse, Vol. I, 1900-1939 by Edward Sanders (391 pages; Black
Sparrow Press; $27.50 hardcover, $16 paperback)
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kerouac On the Road, William Burroughs as a Junkie, Allen
Ginsberg making his poetry Howl: They and other Beat writers
challenged literary traditions and life's conventions by
questioning America's cultural ethos and exploring their own
tortured psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Beats were the 20th century's Romantics, the artists who tried
everything, who championed freedom of spirit and expression even if
it meant paying what William Blake called ``the price of
experience.'' They have always been valued for their visceral
impact but at times underappreciated for their intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg's Howl, for example, reads more like a wail than an
epic poem, and yet it is both, a keening lament for the destruction
of the ``best minds'' of a generation but also a keenly wrought
observation of how American life in the 1950s could cease to make
sense even to the sanest of spirits.
</P>
<P>
   So now come two books to remind us again that the Beats go on,
and that the substance of their thoughts remains as important as
the style in which they render them.
</P>
<P>
   One poet here delves into the universal soul of a nation while
the other finds Wordsworthian inspiration in the personal _ but
both of them arrive, strangely, at the same place: a place of
peace.  &LR; brk:America the bountiful
</P>
<P>
   Edward Sanders was born in Kansas City in 1939. Now the man who
founded the Fugs (a satiric poetry rock group) and wrote a 1971
book on Charles Manson and his followers called The Family is
living in Woodstock, N.Y. (where else?) and still writes fine
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   America: A History in Verse is the first in a projected
multivolume work, and Sanders is off to a marvelous start: This may
be history, but it is also poetic exuberance, a remarkable blend of
information dissemination and the sheer joy of word-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way my nation seethes,'' Sanders writes in his
Introduction, and continues:
</P>
<P>
   I love its creativity
</P>
<P>
   &AMP; the flow of its wild needs
</P>
<P>
   to build itself
</P>
<P>
   on a tiny place
</P>
<P>
   in a spiral galaxy
</P>
<P>
   called the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   As for his credentials to write such a thing (a history in
verse?), Sanders quickly answers his own rhetorical question:
</P>
<P>
   And who am I, someone could ask, to write
</P>
<P>
   a history of America?
</P>
<P>
   I am a bard
</P>
<P>
   trained with my every breath
</P>
<P>
   for 41 years
</P>
<P>
   to chant &AMP; sing, whisper, shout, keen, dance with joy
</P>
<P>
   &AMP; try to trace with grace
</P>
<P>
   what the Fates &AMP; Human Mammals have wrought
</P>
<P>
   in the Time-Track of America
</P>
<P>
   ``To chant &AMP; sing,'' indeed: Sanders' work is so surprisingly
mirthful that it fairly dances on the page. We are not used to
history rendered as poetry, and yet in centuries past, it was more
common. Perhaps it is silly to imagine the historians of 2000
tossing out their tomes and producing verse instead, but Sanders'
effort is gloriously refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with his country is impossible to resist, from
Sanders' bouncy accounts of the arrival of Halley's comet and
departure of Mark Twain in 1910 to the bluster of Teddy Roosevelt,
president from 1901 to 1909, to the strife of workers' movement
groups such as the Wobblies.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the events turn grim, such as the recounting of the
Lindbergh baby kidnapping in 1932, Sanders' lines keep their
buoyancy and vitality. Life may not always be pleasant, but the
poet never descends into the maudlin or lurid:
</P>
<P>
   In the night
</P>
<P>
   Anne Morrow &AMP; Charles Lindbergh's 19-month-old son
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jr.
</P>
<P>
   was snatched from their just-completed
</P>
<P>
   grand style house near Princeton, New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   The perp left a homemade ladder under the bedroom
</P>
<P>
   window and a ransom note in ``broken English''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' depictions of harrowing events always retain a dignity
while managing a poetic resonance. This is journalism with a beat.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1939 was not an easy one for America, with war looming
and the Depression lingering, and yet at the end of this volume,
the poet delivers a near-song of good people and good things: Bela
Bartok's music, Grandma Moses' paintings and a roll-call of
literary greats ranging from John Steinbeck to James Thurber to
Henry Miller to Raymond Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, in short, smiles throughout these verses, even when
America doesn't seem to have something to smile about. For him, the
rhythm of life is enough. ``Seething Nation!'' he exults at the
end. ``Vast &AMP; Flowing! Day &AMP; Night &AMP; Dawn!''
</P>
<P>
   Bring on Vol. II.  &LR; brk:Prelude to a poet
</P>
<P>
   Black Sparrow, a small press in Santa Rosa, Calif., also has
released a fine new volume, this one by William Everson.
</P>
<P>
   Everson, who once was known as Brother Antoninus of the
Dominican Order, made no secret of the model for his epic
autobiography in verse, Dust Shall Be the Serpent's Food. His
prototype was no less than William Wordsworth's The Prelude or
Growth of a Poet's Mind, as Everson told his friend Allen Campo as
early as 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Everson never finished his epic. And yet the five of Everson's
10 planned cantos are extraordinary on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Wordsworth's greatest moments involved solitude or
near-solitude _ rowing on a still lake, crossing a mountain pass,
communing with whatever rock he had befriended for a day _
Everson's epiphanies involve people.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the death of his mother only five years before, he
explodes in anger and grief at his father's funeral, as told in
Canto One, ``In Medias Res'':
</P>
<P>
   I had stood dry-eyed, but when the lid was closed
</P>
<P>
   Something snapped in my skull. In a choking
</P>
<P>
   Rage, twisted by unreckonable guilt,
</P>
<P>
   I pounded my fists on the coffin,
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing: ``Why! Why!'' and slumped to my knees,
</P>
<P>
   Jarring the bier.
</P>
<P>
   Everson may wear his feelings on his sleeve, but these are
feelings of universal loss. And in the tradition of Wordsworth and
other great Romantics, those feelings are held under tight artistic
control in the poem. Critics sometimes forget that the rage and
pain of Romanticism was reflected through a prism of rewriting and
hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Dust Shall Be the Serpent's Food, which also owes much to the
Book of Isaiah, is only one pleasure of this volume, the last
installment of Everson's collected poems. Shorter works, from
``Dark Waters'' to ``Steelhead,'' show a poet at ease with both the
natural world and human mind.
</P>
<P>
   But the images in Dust, from adulterous wives to traveling by
rail to visions of spiritual redemption, are perhaps the most
arresting of all the works here. In the final Canto, Everson
reaches a soulful crescendo that every poet must yearn for:
</P>
<P>
   But the ills of the world,
</P>
<P>
   By God's clear injunction, are to be reckoned
</P>
<P>
   Implicitly benign. His vivid signature, dazzlingly
</P>
<P>
   Calligraphed on trees, rivers, rocks, buttes and benchlands,
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal of life is the measure of its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Perdurably opportune, the hostages of pain
</P>
<P>
   Never fail to evince the quantification of value
</P>
<P>
   In the substance of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Everson, a native of Sacramento, Calif., died in 1994 at age 81
in Kingfisher Flat, Calif. This volume proves that, almost to the
very end, he continued to write _ and to write well.

ARKANSAS TOWN RENOWNED FOR ITS `CURATIVE WATERS' BECKONS ANEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ My mental image of Hot Springs is based
largely on secondhand memories, stemming from my childhood way back
in the '60s, when my grandmother would travel down to Arkansas from
her home in Missouri to ``take the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   She was old and weak and afflicted by arthritis; my aunt, who
was a nurse, thought the natural hot springs piped into the town's
many bathhouses might work some kind of miracle. I was only 4 or 5,
too young to go on these trips, but I formed a strong picture of
the resort town as some kind of magical hospital in the mountains,
a series of quiet, vast institutions where old people went to get
well.
</P>
<P>
   And so, even after a couple of brief visits within the past
decade, I am, on this July visit, having a hard time reconciling my
recollections with reality.
</P>
<P>
   We have already driven along the town's main drag _ past the
lovely horse track that was my other main childhood impression of
the place, past the row of majestic bathhouses that sit maintained
but empty, no longer used by bathers and not yet converted to new
uses, and down to the 75-year-old Arlington Hotel, across from the
tree-shaded trails of Hot Springs National Park.
</P>
<P>
   And now we are sitting in a shabby-chic, Mediterranean-flavored
restaurant called Pompeii, enjoying wine with our prosciutto-topped
pizza and rich Greek salads. As we try to decide where to head next
_ one of the galleries showcasing regional artists? the high school
attended by President Clinton, being turned into an artists'
colony? the row of charming boutiques and home-decor shops we'd
spotted down the street? _ an ebullient restaurateur is making
plans for us to visit his friend's trendy restaurant-slash-cigar
lounge down the street for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Hot Springs of 15 years ago, or even five
years ago,'' Mark Johnston, executive director of the soon-to-open
Clinton Cultural Campus, would tell me later. ``We have a thriving
arts community, which we did not have, and a very active and
restored downtown area, and incredible growth in the lakes area.
The number of tourists has just increased incredibly over the last
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The bathhouses, most of which are out of business, are no longer
the city's main draw; more visitors probably associate Hot Springs
first and foremost with the spring racing season at Oaklawn, the
stately track where thoroughbreds have run for nearly a century.
Today's Hot Springs is also more a family resort than a health
sanitarium, with attractions including a child-friendly science
museum, watersports at the nearby lakes, a new amusement and water
park, and an excursion train.
</P>
<P>
   But separating Hot Springs from its past as a healing center is
like trying to imagine Fort Worth without cattle. Bathhouse Row may
no longer be Hot Springs' reason for being, but people do realize
there would be no Hot Springs without it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   An uncomplicated five-hour drive from Dallas-Fort Worth _
basically, it's a straight shot east on Interstate 30 _ Hot Springs
is nestled in the low-lying Zig Zag Mountains, on the edge of the
Ouachita Range, between Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine. The city,
home to about 32,000, is built around the national park, which
includes both the historic bathhouses and the trails and
campgrounds carved into the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surviving eight major bathhouses, lined up next to
one another on Central Avenue in the heart of downtown, date from
around 1920, but the legend of the hot springs is rooted far
earlier than that.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans may have seen the springs as early as 1541, when
Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto and his troops are rumored to
have stumbled across them. But American Indians had known about the
natural hot springs for at least 10,000 years, calling it Manataka,
the place of peace.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, Indian tribes used the valley as a neutral
gathering place for prayer, rituals and peace councils, says Lee
Standing Bear Moore, secretary of the Manataka American Indian
Council in Hot Springs. They were attracted not only by the hot
springs that flowed from the mountain, but also by the area's
beauty. The Indians believed the valleys, covered in lush forests
and draped in mist from the springs, had a special power, and not
just as a source of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it; if you have a bad leg, are you going to walk
1,000 miles just to soak it in a spring?'' says Moore, who also
works at the Cherokee Longhouse, which sells American Indian gifts,
books, music, food and herbs in addition to housing a spa offering
baths and body treatments.''No, they came here for some other
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   But European settlers came in larger numbers to the springs
after French trappers used it in the late 1700s. In 1832, the U.S.
government set aside the land around the springs as the first U.S.
reservation, a precursor to the national park system, and formal
bathhouses began springing up.
</P>
<P>
   The first ones were crude wooden-and-canvas structures, little
more than tents, prone to fire, collapse and even rot from the
steam of the springs. As the area prospered, bigger and more
elaborate bathhouses were built, with marble floors, stained-glass
skylights, bubbling fountains, and the latest in exercise equipment
and treatment rooms. By 1921, the area had been named our 18th
national park, and Hot Springs considered itself the pre-eminent
health spa in the nation.

   A fatal tropical disease has infected large numbers of foxhounds
in the United States. Public health officials fear that humans may
contract the disease if the dogs come into contact with sandflies,
which transmit the parasite that causes leishmaniasis.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the Millbrook Hunt Club in New York State
realized that many of its foxhounds were sick and dying. The dogs
were losing their hair, they had skin lesions, swollen limbs and
joints and were wasting away. When vets analyzed fluid from the
joints of one dog they found the leishmaniasis parasite.
</P>
<P>
   This disease, which in humans can cause fever, anorexia,
diarrhea and darkening of the hands and feet, is commonly found in
the Mediterranean and the tropics. It can kill humans. Usually,
North Americans _ and their dogs _ only get the disease if they
travel to the tropics. So Peter Schantz and his colleagues at the
Center for Disease Control were mystified when they learned that
half the foxhounds at Millbrook tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   They tested other dogs living in the area, as well as horses and
wild rodents. All the tests were negative, as were those on the
kennel's personnel. But hunting clubs often travel, so they advised
the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, based in Leesburg,
Va., to suspend all traveling for this year's season while they
tried to work out what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   By the second week of July, they'd tested 6,845 of 12,000
foxhounds registered with the MFHA. At least 12 percent of the dogs
have some antibodies, suggesting that they have been exposed to the
parasite. Around 2 percent of the dogs have a strong response on
the antibody test, indicating the need for more testing to see if
they are actively infected, says Dennis Foster, executive director
of the MFHA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found infection now in 29 states and the Ontario
province of Canada,'' Schantz says.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials recommend putting down infected dogs or
placing them in quarantine. They hope that these measures will be
enough to contain the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   So far, tests on more than 450 domestic dogs from 40 states have
all proved negative. And there have been no human cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have it in control,'' Foster says. ``Those hunts
that are completely negative will be able to resume as normal this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrie Brown of the University of Georgia in Athens, an expert
on diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, says
that leishmaniasis is having a ``very scary introduction into the
United States. We're probably going to see more leishmaniasis in
humans as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists are unsure how the parasite entered the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did it get in? Nobody really knows,'' Brown says. &QL;

   A false eye that swivels in synchrony with its natural partner
is being developed by engineers in Canada. They aim to make the
false eye follow the real eye's motion so faithfully that it will
look completely natural.
</P>
<P>
   The implant is intended mainly for people who have had a
malignant facial tumor. This condition can cause catastrophic
damage that requires large portions of the face, sometimes
including an entire eye socket, to be surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   After the operation, patients wear specially made plastic
moldings, in which a false eye may be set, held in place by
surgically implanted magnets or attached to spectacles. Though
these make the face look complete, people can immediately see that
something is wrong because the false eye doesn't move, says Gary
Faulkner, a mechanical engineer on the team at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian team's system, an array of infrared detectors
built into a pair of spectacles tracks the movement of the real eye
by looking for changes in the wavelength of reflected light
hundreds of times a second. This data is translated into a signal
that controls motors in the fake eye.
</P>
<P>
   The team has managed to follow the lateral movement of the good
eye with an accuracy better than half a degree. This is what
counts, Faulkner says, because if the tracking is further out than
this, people notice. The next goal is to follow the eye's vertical
movement as well.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the team hopes to replace the motors with actuators
made of shape memory alloys, which use small temperature changes to
induce motion. This should make the eye almost silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having motors whirring around in your head is something people
would not like,'' Faulkner says.
</P>
<P>
   By making the actuators very thin, Faulkner believes he'll be
able to make them cycle on and off rapidly without generating
sufficient heat to damage surrounding components and tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any animation you can put into a prosthetic will be a big
help,'' says Geoff Wilcsek of Manchester Royal Eye Infirmary. &QL;

   Watching a solar eclipse may be so stressful that it is bad for
your health, British researchers report. So there might be a grain
of truth in myths surrounding eclipses after all.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Mian at Manchester University and Rubina Mian and Doug
Thake at Coventry University were mocking tales of eclipses making
people sick, or even causing deformities in unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I pointed out there was no evidence either way,'' Rubina
Mian says.
</P>
<P>
   Mian took her graduate students to a field in Briey, France, to
watch the 1999 summer eclipse. By analyzing their blood samples
with a luminometer, the researchers found that leukocyte activity
increased by 8.7 percent during the eclipse. These white blood
cells usually help our immune system, but if overstimulated they
can damage DNA by releasing free radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments after the eclipse showed that darkness, silence and
temperature had no effect on leukocyte activity. But in other
studies being prepared for publication Mian has found that stress
can have a big effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was stressed,'' Mian says about the eclipse. ``It was
really quite overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's stressful for her, Mian says it must be worse for
those who don't understand what an eclipse is, or who believe
legends about the phenomenon. &QL;

   Plans to vaccinate all U.S. military personnel against anthrax
are in fresh trouble. Research notes from a crucial test of the
vaccine in monkeys suggest that, while jabs may keep soldiers alive
after an anthrax attack, they will become too sick to fight. This
follows a damning report earlier this year, in which Congress
called the plan a ``medical Maginot Line.'' For most U.S. troops,
the problem is academic anyway, as the army has run out of vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson of BioReliance in Rockport, Md., a former
vaccine researcher, has obtained lab records from monkey tests
carried out in 1991 at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md. In the study, rhesus
monkeys were given a vaccine similar to the one used for the U.S.
troops, and then inhaled large doses of anthrax spores. Anthrax is
too dangerous for this test to be carried out in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The notes record that although the monkeys survived, they became
sick for up to two weeks afterwards. Sick soldiers could be more of
a burden on defending forces than dead ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be vaccinated if I was facing anthrax attack,''
says anthrax expert Martin Hugh-Jones of Louisiana State University
at Baton Rouge. ``But if you inhale enough spores nothing can save
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers may not get the choice. BioPort of Lansing, Michigan,
the sole producer of the anthrax vaccine in the United States,
stopped making it after failing safety tests last December, and
stocks have dwindled. Only 57,000 troops have so far got all four
initial injections. &QL;

HOT SPRINGS, Ark.: spa in the nation. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, you can get a glimpse of this history at the Fordyce
Bathhouse, opened in 1989 as the park's visitor center, restored to
its glory days of the 1920s. The majority of the city's bathhouses
closed in the '60s and '70s, as the area declined. Today, only the
Buckstaff still operates along the row, though several hotels have
their own full bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Fordyce, you can walk through the same rooms used by
the ill people who came to Hot Springs seeking a cure 50 or 80
years ago; they are outfitted with the same porcelain tubs, white
metal cots and steam cabinets used then.
</P>
<P>
   Here you can also learn the fascinating history of the city's
entirely separate set of bathhouses for African-Americans, who were
prohibited until the early 1960s from using white-only spas, though
they formed the bulk of their work force.
</P>
<P>
   The only one of these African-American bathhouses to remain
standing is the old National Baptist Hotel, and it is not included
on the maps of the other bathhouses. I found it, finally, a few
blocks away from the main row. Especially compared with the
manicured lawns and well-kept facades on Bathhouse Row, the
once-prominent resort looks sad and abandoned, its windows boarded
over with plywood and weeds creeping through cracks in the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, vague rumors have circulated that a company
intends to renovate the building, adding a new wing for a hotel and
turning the existing building into a museum. But nothing has come
of it, though residents still hope the building will someday be
used again.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, little has come of long-rumored plans to convert the
six empty bathhouses on Bathhouse Row into galleries or other
businesses. Though the entire row is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, and restoration has been ongoing, no
businesses have been attracted to the space. Insiders say that's
partly because of the stringent regulations attached to the use of
historic buildings; a lack of parking has also hurt development,
though a planned parking garage may alleviate that.
</P>
<P>
   Another boost may come from the soon-to-open Clinton Cultural
Campus, the town's celebration of native son Bill Clinton, who was
born in the famously monikered Hope just down the road, but who
went to school in Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   A display in the Hot Springs National Park visitor center
chronicles his youth, but the town has grander plans. In October,
it will open the first phase of the Clinton Cultural Campus, a
complex of 38 loft-style apartments that will be leased at
affordable rates to artists, musicians, writers and actors from all
over the nation. The apartments were carved out of classrooms and
the gymnasium of the former 76-year-old junior high, adjacent to
the 1915-era high school that Clinton attended.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of years, the gothic-style high school will be
converted into an administration building, housing art galleries, a
Clinton museum and meeting rooms, director Johnston says. He also
hopes city arts groups, like the city's respected documentary film
festival, will move their offices there.
</P>
<P>
   The city's reinvention as an arts colony is still far from
complete. The area is still full of the typical mass-market
attractions endemic to any town dependent on tourist trade _ an
alligator farm, T-shirt shops, miniature golf courses, fast-food
stands, and something called Tiny Town, filled with moving
miniature scenes that reportedly took one family 50 years to
create. And I stood a long while outside the somewhat
alarming-looking Josephine Tussaud Wax Museum on the main strip,
listening to a couple argue about whether a wax bust was supposed
to be Barbara Bush. (It was actually a likeness of the museum's
namesake, though it bore a passing resemblance to the former first
lady.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are also surprises. Like an after-hours,
industrial-looking nightspot called Diva, where revelers dance
until dawn. And a cluster of hip restaurants, such as the one where
our attentive servers, including a former Miss Gay Arkansas, served
up eyebrow-grooming tips along with our glasses of cabernet and
pancetta-wrapped shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of it all is still the springs.
</P>
<P>
   My first afternoon in town, I sat in the park with a bottle of
cold spring water, watching local residents pull up to city
fountains dispensing free spring water. (Unlike that of many other
natural springs, the water here has no odd odor or strange taste.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a bath and be sure to drink a lot of the water,'' one
older man told me as he filled four plastic gallon jugs from the
spigot, his drinking water for the week. ``Yes, it's good for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   I took his advice. Indeed, it may no longer be the legendary
curing spa, but there's still something magical about water that
bubbles from the ground at 143 degrees, so hot that it must be
cooled down before you can bathe in it.
</P>
<P>
   On my way up to the hiking trails on Hot Springs Mountain early
one morning, I leaned over a grate, catching the rising steam and
getting an instant facial. Later, I went to the only remaining true
bathhouse, the Buckstaff, for a relaxing, old-fashioned spring
bath. It was a leisurely 90 minutes of soaking in an oversized
porcelain tub, lying on a metal cot wrapped in steaming hot towels,
then taking a shower of spring water afterward to cool down before
resting again in a quiet, institutionlike cooling room.
</P>
<P>
   It was, I imagined, the same routine my grandmother had followed
all those years ago, one that had been in place since long before I
was born. And if we're lucky, it will never completely die out.

`WONDERLAND': THREE SISTERS IN LONDON, WITH LIVES WORTH MOURNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Winterbottom's uneven ``Wonderland'' could be
called ``The Three Sisters'': a modern-day London turn on Chekhov,
it deals with the anguish of three women whose existences are in
varying stages of disintegration. The director is out to catch life
on the fly, and the movie feels real and unrehearsed, especially in
the relationships between the sisters, who could be the same woman
at different stages of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia (Gina McKee), a waitress, wants an attachment of some sort
_ any sort, actually _ and slinks from one bad entanglement to the
next. In one of the most riveting scenes in a movie this year, she
rides alone on a double-decker bus filled with loud, happy
revelers, and her face, normally a mask of dispassion, slowly
crumples into a teary mess.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie (Shirley Henderson), a hairdresser and single mother,
runs out to grab a pint and a few more moments of irresponsible fun
while her 11-year-old son raises himself. She is angry with the
boy's father (Ian Hart, who has come a long way from the
quick-witted cruelty of the John Lennon he played in ``Backbeat'').
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant Molly (Molly Parker) wants domestic simplicity,
though there are clear rumblings that her partner, Eddie (John
Simm), isn't ready for the family responsibilities that are days
away from changing his life forever.
</P>
<P>
   In following these characters through five days, Winterbottom
doesn't make the expectant mother the source of optimism. The one
person in the family whose life is happy is the women's brother,
Darren (Enzo Cilenti), the only son. He left home years before to
get away from the incessant grousing of his bitter mother (Kika
Markham), who sits in her row house and makes as much noise as the
neighbor's constantly barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   In the way Winterbottom deals with working-class life,
``Wonderland'' bears a stylistic similarity to the work of the
British social realist directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. There is
nothing pretty about the way the sisters get through a day. The sun
never breaks through, even at the end, when there is a small gleam
of hope in one of the women's futures.
</P>
<P>
   Winterbottom doesn't rest on making social observations. Rather,
he moves in with this family and catches its members in the moments
of existential dread when they collectively seem to have no place
to go. Even the wiser and more calloused Debbie, who has found a
way to detach herself from the chill of her life, has a harrowing
moment or two.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is flush with color and sometimes jerks into
accelerated motion, leaving viewers with whiplash while it briefly
tracks one of the characters. Michael Nyman's score is like a
tonier version of the music Stewart Copeland composed for
``Rumblefish''; the rhythms are like a clock ticking, bringing to
mind lost lives and wasted time.
</P>
<P>
   McKee, who played Hugh Grant's wise, wheelchair-bound friend in
``Notting Hill,'' doesn't fall back on her dimples and charm. Done
up in the accouterments of a techno-music lover, she is shy, with a
backpack and her hair in girlish twists, but all her style is on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   You could come to the same conclusion about ``Wonderland,''
which flits from one life to the next. Essentially an anthology
movie, it needs the actors to bring it to life _ ``Coronation
Street'' with a hand-held camera.
</P>
<P>
   McKee and David Fahm are intriguing performers who do much with
what they have. Fahm's Franklin, an oversensitive guy who has
turned his bedroom into a bunker and listens to music that Nadia
might be a fan of, seems to have music videos of a much more
glamorous life playing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   Some sections are gripping. Yet as well done as it is,
``Wonderland'' feels predictable. There is no sad turn in these
characters' lives that you cannot see coming about an hour before.
It's an odd fix for the man who directed the ace British television
mystery series ``Cracker'' to find himself in. Relying on a more
realistic setting than he used in his films ``Welcome to Sarajevo''
and ``Jude'' doesn't alleviate the movie's grim inevitability.
</P>

CORNING SAYS TALKS BREAK DOWN WITH NORTEL ON MERGER OF OPTICAL
UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock
figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corning(GLW:NYSE) confirmed Thursday that talks have broken down
with Nortel Networks(NT:NYSE) over a potential merger between the
companies' optical components businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, the world's largest maker of optical fiber and cable,
had been rumored to be in talks with Nortel earlier this week.
Corning's announcement Thursday confirmed the rumors, but said the
talks had been terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have and will continue to have a close working relationship
with Nortel. We are committed to working together to create
value-added solutions for our customers,'' said Roger G. Ackerman,
chairman and chief executive at Corning, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, New York-based Corning added that it expects sales
in some of its optical technologies to grow 100 percent this year
and that it has been investing heavily in expansions to meet
growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with Nortel had centered around a stock swap that
would give Ontario-based Nortel more than 50 percent of Corning,
with Corning maintaining its independence and owning the optical
parts unit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have been the second major deal in the
fiber-optic arena. Recently, competitor JDS Uniphase(JDSU:Nasdaq),
the world's largest maker of fiber optics components, agreed to buy
SDL(SDLI:Nasdaq) in a deal valued at the time at close to $41
billion. Corning had reportedly lost out in the bidding for SDL.
</P>
<P>
   Corning traded up 9 1/8, or 3.5 percent, to 267 1/4 in late
morning trading. Meanwhile, Nortel is down 4 5/8, or 5.5 percent,
at 79 5/16.

TEXACO, SUNOCO AND PHILLIPS PETROLEUM MORE THAN DOUBLE EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service.) (Eds:
Stock figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surging oil and natural gas prices and consistently strong
consumer demand helped boost second-quarter earnings at three of
the country's major oil companies, with Texaco (TX:NYSE) more than
doubling its quarterly income.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported income
before special items of $641 million, or $1.17 a share, up from
$286 million, or 52 cents, in the same period a year ago. Despite
the sharp increase, however, Texaco's earnings per-share fell a
penny short of the consensus estimate among analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco's net income, including special charges, was $625 million
in the second quarter, or $1.14 per share. Revenue at the White
Plains, NY-based company rose to $12.1 billion from $8.3 billion in
the same year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Thursday's trading session, shares of Texaco moved up
2.7 percent, to 49 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sunoco (SUN:NYSE), the third-largest independent oil refiner and
marketer, easily beat Wall Street estimates, reporting
second-quarter earnings of $132 million or $1.50 per share,
excluding special items. The figures are significantly higher than
the $10 million, or 11 cents per share, earned in the same period a
year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
forecast earnings per share of $1.37.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue at the Philadelphia-based oil company grew to $3.6
billion from $2.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Sunoco's
stock was trading up 1/2, or 2.1 percent, to 24 7/8 Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum (P:NYSE) also surpassed analysts' estimates,
with second-quarter net income of $442 million, or $1.73 per
diluted share. That's 17 cents higher than the consensus estimate
among Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial. The Bartlesville, Okla.-based company earned $68
million, or 27 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total second-quarter revenue at Phillips Petroleum were $5.4
billion, up sharply from $3.2 billion a year ago. Phillips is one
of the country's largest integrated oil companies, with oil and
natural gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, shares of Phillips were trading up 1 5/16, or
2.8 percent, to 48 11/16.

FOLK ART COLLECTOR IS `SELLING IT ALL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., N.H., Conn.)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's an old saying on Wall Street: ``Never fall in
love with your assets.'' What this really means is that you should
be willing to trade everything you own _ for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Most collectors are too sentimental about their antiques to part
with them readily, but a few collectors do. When they do, it is
often for an unexpected reason.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be the case with Virginia Ramsey-Pope Cave, an
American folk art collector and former dealer from Dorset, Vt. On
Aug. 5, Cave is selling her personal folk art collection _ the
contents of her house and barn _ at Northeast Auctions in
Manchester, N.H. She has promised 10 percent of the proceeds to the
Museum of American Folk Art, whose new building is under
construction in Manhattan. This is part of her effort, as head of a
committee drawn from the folk-art trade, to raise $1 million for
the museum's new library.
</P>
<P>
   Cave is retiring to Manhattan after spending 25 years in the
business and rearing five children. ``This sale is the culmination
of my years as a student, dealer and collector in this field,'' she
said. ``These things have been part of my life in Vermont. Putting
them back on the market was the best thing to do with them. You
cannot skim the top. I'm selling it all. It isn't that I've lost my
affinity for American folk art; it's just that that part of my life
is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph O. Esmerian, chairman of the museum's board, explained,
``The museum is an important part of her focus.'' He pointed out
that it had raised only $24 million of $34 million needed for the
entire project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've raised enough to build the building,'' he said. ``As for
the library, the trade loved the idea of being related to the
scholarship side of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The 400 items for sale range widely in content and quality.
``Virginia loves things that are artful and serious as well as
things that make her smile,'' said Allan Katz, a folk art dealer in
Woodbridge, Conn., who sold her some of the toys in the sale. ``She
has an impeccable eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes antique card tables, Shaker chests of drawers,
whirligigs, appliqued coverlets, hooked rugs, weather vanes,
blanket chests and game boards. ``I used to buy things wherever I
went,'' Cave recalled. ``When I had a house in Georgia, I would
just get in the car and go, for fun. I even bought folk art in
London, at the Olympia Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog prepared for Cave by Northeast Auctions has few
estimates. Most lots will be sold without a reserve, the secret
minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the auction house.
``That makes it nice, honest and clean,'' Katz said. ``I think the
sale will do exceedingly well. There is an absolute shortage of
material, and she hasn't held anything back. It's extremely unusual
to have no reserves when a seller is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave has also been careful to list the provenances on most
items. Ronald Bourgeault, the auctioneer who owns Northeast
Auctions and a longtime friend of Cave's, said, ``Virginia wanted
to have everyone's name in the catalog, including all the dealers
and people in the trade, because they are the ones who will use the
new library at the folk art museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeault added that he planned to donate part of his
commission to the museum as well. ``The more the excitement about
the sale grows, the more I think I'm going to give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best lots, acquired from the Manhattan gallery
America Hurrah, is a pair of miniature painted whirligigs in the
form of a man and woman. Each wears a green and brown outfit and
has green paddle arms. The figures, which had belonged to the
collector Ben Mildwoff, were auctioned at Sotheby's to a private
collector, Barry Cohen, who then gave them to America Hurrah, which
sold them to Cave. In good condition and with great charm, they are
expected to sell for $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   A carved and painted Noah's ark, with an army of 200 animals and
figures, was originally acquired from Katz. ``These were primarily
religious toys,'' he said. ``They were the only toys that could be
used on Sundays because they were biblical. This one is either
German or Pennsylvania German and is in wonderful shape.'' The
estimate is $4,000 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Folk art paintings include an oil by Franklin Howard Bullis
(1861-1937) depicting the passenger steamer Vermont approaching the
Port Kent dock on Lake Champlain. A Vermont pennant and an American
flag snap sharply in the wind beneath a blue sky dotted with
scudding white clouds. A large ketch sails by the dock, which has
kegs on it. A train chugs toward Burlington, barely visible in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare to find Vermont depicted in folk art,'' Cave said.
``Vermont was not as sophisticated as Massachusetts or New York.''
She acquired the painting from Timothy J. Stevenson, a former
dealer, and his partner, Phyllis Carlson, in Vermont. The estimate
is $6,000 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most spectacular quilts in the sale is a
77-by-92-inch pieced and appliqued floral and feather coverlet
signed Annie Sanford in ink. Its center has six large blocks, each
depicting red roses and teal blue leaves and stems on a white
ground. The border has a meandering motif of stylized flowers and
feathers. ``I'm a gardener, so I'm attracted to floral quilts,''
Cave said, ``but one with this French blue is very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction house offers neither a date nor an estimate, but
since the quilt appears to be in good condition and is signed, it
may be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest estimates in the sale, $40,000 to $60,000,
has been placed on a copper Goddess of Liberty weather vane with
the label of J.W. Fiske Iron Works of New York, from about 1880 to
1893. This 17-inch-tall gilded goddess wears a Liberty cap
decorated with a laurel wreath and holds an American flag with
pierced stars and stripes. According to the catalog, it was found
near Contoocook, N.H., and acquired by Cave from David A. Schorsch,
a dealer in Woodbury, Conn. Fiske produced cast-iron garden
ornaments, benches and copper weather vanes for decades, which
makes one wonder if such a mass-produced piece is truly a work of
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these things were thought of as art when they were
made,'' Esmerian said. ``They were functional and part of the daily
lives of the people who built this country. We call it folk art,
but they made these things for domestic use and practical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiske weather vanes were made to tell the direction of the
wind. The makers took the time to make them special. It doesn't
matter if there were 20 made. It's not only the unique object that
we call folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast Auctions viewing continues through Monday at
Treadwell House, 93 Pleasant St., Portsmouth, NH (603) 627-6200. It
continues at the Armory at the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn
in Manchester, next Friday and Saturday, where the sale will be
held on Saturday afternoon.

   WASHINGTON _ With an eye on the potentially crucial Hispanic
vote in this fall's elections, Democratic leaders Thursday called
for passage of a bill to ease immigration restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol news conference, the Democrats said they expect the
legislation to be a partisan issue, criticizing Republican
lawmakers and presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
for opposing the measure they say is a top priority in the Latino
community.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make three key changes to the 1997 immigration
law by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Changing the cutoff date for undocumented immigrants to
qualify for permanent residency status. The current cutoff is for
those who arrived prior to 1972; the bill would change that to
1986.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing refugees from Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras the same rights as Cuban and Nicaraguan refugees to apply
for permanent residency status.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restoring a provision to allow immigrants living with their
families in the United States to remain in the country while
awaiting a decision on their residency status.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he would try to attach his
proposal to a variety of bills moving through the Senate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged passage of the bill as part of pending
legislation to expand the H-1B temporary worker program. Vice
President Al Gore also sent a letter supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have been living for many years in the United
States and have developed strong ties to their communities deserve
the opportunity to normalize their immigration status,'' Clinton
said. ``Congress should not pass H1-B or any other immigration
legislation this year without ensuring that these injustices are
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has criticized efforts to expand the
immigration law. In a statement issued by his office, Smith called
the bill an amnesty measure that would allow 2 million illegal
immigrants to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amnesty sends a cruel message: Get to the U.S. at any cost and
sooner or later your actions will be rewarded _ a slap in the face
to all those who waited their turn to enter legally,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Bush has tried to appeal to Hispanic voters, even
speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, but Republican
congressional leaders have blocked efforts to bring the bill to a
floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., tried to cool the partisan rhetoric,
commenting that he was confident the bill would receive bipartisan
support because ``it's a simple matter or economic and social
justice.''

 &HT;    REPORT CALLED 'DISTURBING' BUT ACTION UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of major new findings that
understaffing in nursing homes leads to bedsores, malnutrition and
avoidable infections, lawmakers and the Clinton administration
Thursday took turns prodding each other to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study is disturbing,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said
as his Special Committee on Aging examined a U.S. Health and Human
Services Department report, which concludes that 54 percent of
nursing homes fall below the minimum staffing level for safe care.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he wants to require that the facilities hire more
staff when Congress considers increasing their Medicaid and
Medicare reimbursements this fall. However, the senator expressed
doubts that Congress would enact federal staffing standards any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do it more quickly,'' Grassley told Nancy-Ann
DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing Administration at HHS.
``Would you have that authority?''
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said she would have to check with her legal counsel on
how far her agency can go in enforcing current laws.
</P>
<P>
   Existing statutes have only a vague requirement for ``sufficient
nursing staff'' that includes requiring one full-time registered
nurse a day and round-the-clock coverage by a licensed practical
nurse at each facility.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said her department would need more money from Congress
to begin policing the staffing levels of the nation's 16,500
nursing homes. Moreover, she said that her department was not
prepared to set minimum standards without further research
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The latest staffing study, which was first ordered by Congress
in 1990 to be completed in 1992, focused on 1,800 nursing homes in
Texas, Ohio and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report documents the effects of low staffing and is ``the
largest and most rigorous study of the relationship between
staffing and quality of care conducted to date,'' said Andrew
Kramer, a geriatric medicine professor at the University of
Colorado, who helped conduct the research.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer told the committee that among facilities where each
resident received at least two hours of nurse's aide attention a
day, only 2 percent had a high rate of ``avoidable''
hospitalizations for ailments such as pneumonia, urinary tract
infections and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Among homes that offer less than two hours of nursing, 22
percent had a high rate of hospitalizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kramer said a single national standard would not be
practical because nursing homes with sicker residents need more
staff than those where the population is relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   That finding was applauded by Charles H. Roadman II, head of the
American Health Care Association, the largest nursing home trade
group, who opposes any attempt to mandate what he called a ``magic
ratio'' for patients and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly none of us are happy with pressure ulcers or falls or
dehydration or malnutrition,'' Roadman said, but he said the ``core
cause'' is the labor shortage and inadequate government
reimbursements through Medicare and Medicaid, which together
finance most nursing home costs.
</P>
<P>
   (trim line)
</P>
<P>
   Certified nursing assistants, who do most of the work of nursing
home care, receive low pay, have a high rate of turnover and often
suffer from on-the-job injuries as they move and lift patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these workers described to federal researchers the
conditions in nursing homes when they are short-staffed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Showers are the first things to go,'' one worker said.
``Eating is also affected. Food is put in front of sleeping
residents and taken away before it's eaten. Residents are also left
in urine and feces for a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worker said that residents who are supposed to get
showers two times a week ``might get one once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``There is a lot of weight loss because of not
feeding residents. Dehydration. Some residents just don't eat. Some
aides take the tray in and don't even try to feed, even if it says
'feeder.' It makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that nationwide, staffing levels at nursing
homes have remained about steady from 1997-1999, at about 3.25
nursing staff members to each resident. Non-profit and government
facilities had higher staff percentages than for-profit nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the report showed that Alaska, with 4.92 staff members
per resident, ranked highest. Oklahoma was lowest at 2.61.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing ratios for other states include: 3.41 for Ohio, 3.11
for Texas, 3.10 for Georgia, 3.70 for North Carolina, 3.59 for
Florida and 3.30 for Colorado.

THINK TWICE BEFORE WASHING THOSE HANDS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This just in from the Department of Contradictory Health News:
Americans, who are doing less housework than ever before, are
putting themselves at risk by being obsessively clean.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Tufts University geneticist said American's
excessive use of anti-bacterial cleaning products has the potential
to weaken our immune systems and make us susceptible to infections
and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, USA Today reported that the average time
married couples spend doing housework has dropped from 36 hours a
week in 1965 to 29 hours a week now.
</P>
<P>
   I think I can explain.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy, the geneticist, is operating under the mistaken
assumption that the people who buy these anti-bacterial soaps and
cleaning products are actually using them.
</P>
<P>
   My 14-year-old son, for example, has had the same bottle of
anti-bacterial hand soap in his bathroom for the past five years.
Like most Americans, I think he believes that germs will be
frightened away by the mere presence of the soap dispenser. To
actually apply the soap to his hands would be overkill.
</P>
<P>
   If Stuart Levy wants to do some truly useful research, he should
determine whether germs can read. When they see the word
``anti-bacterial'' on the side of an unused bottle of liquid soap,
do they scuttle away in fear or do they roll around on the counter
of the sink, slapping their little microscopic bacterial sides and
laughing till they get the hiccups?
</P>
<P>
   A quick visual examination of my son's bathroom suggests the
latter, but I could be wrong. It is possible, I suppose, that the
fossilized chunks of Crest adhering to the basin of the sink and
the black fuzzy stuff in his shower are not filth, but rather wads
of dead bacteria, brought down by invisible cleansing rays
emanating from an unopened 5-year-old bottle of soap.
</P>
<P>
   If Levy is right _ and I sincerely hope that he is _ then the
fact that we are doing less housework than ever before is both
understandable and justifiable. Indeed, it may be necessary for us
to stop doing housework altogether or, if our homes are overstocked
with anti-bacterial soaps and cleansers, actually pay someone to
haul in more dirt.
</P>
<P>
   This would not appear to be good news for maids and professional
house cleaners, but I'm betting they could adjust. Instead of
hauling around all those buckets and mops and vacuum cleaners,
they'd simply roll in a wheelbarrow-full of dirt and spread it
around the rooms. They would have to leave the house quickly, of
course, before they are blinded by all the anti-bacterial soap rays
beaming around the house, but then again maybe a good pair of
reflective sunglasses would offer adequate protection. (Another
possible research project for Stuart Levy and his cronies at
Tufts.)
</P>
<P>
   My suggestions seem to dovetail nicely with Levy's contention
that children who wallow around in the dirt have stronger immune
systems than those who don't. Perhaps all the diseases that kids
pick up at day-care centers could be avoided if caretakers would
simply wave a bottle of anti-bacterial soap over the swing set and
sandbox. (You parents of young children may want to continue
keeping a spare bottle of ear-infection antibiotics in the
refrigerator, just in case I'm wrong about this.)
</P>
<P>
   I am supposed to clean the garage today, but I'm thinking I may
put it off. I understand that Mr. Clean has come out with some
anti-bacterial towelettes.
</P>
<P>
   If I fling a few around on the floor, the place will be as
sterile as an operating room.

GOODBYE, KATHIE LEE. ENOUGH SAID

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford exits ``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' on
Friday, and not a moment too soon. Letters, e-mails and phone calls
have piled up since her last visit to this space, where I tried,
unsuccessfully it now appears, to make the point that morning
television personalities are governed by the same rules of any
social setting.
</P>
<P>
   Either you like to hang out with these folks or you don't,
turning the channel to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   I've long turned away from Gifford, whose banter with Regis
Philbin was a delight, but who as an individual has no standout
qualities I consider worth a television talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that column, Gifford fans have been after my
firstborn and have questioned my sanity and even my patriotism,
which I still don't get.
</P>
<P>
   Most vocal was a retiree who in the past few years has become a
morning TV junkie, an expert on Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, the
brother and sister Osmonds, and any cable nature series showing a
mother eating its young.
</P>
<P>
   She wholeheartedly stands behind the adage that if you have
nothing nice to say about someone ``shut up,'' which suits me fine,
particularly in this case.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Gifford, 46, signs off Friday from ``Live With Regis
&AMP; Kathie Lee.'' Sob or celebrate.

INSIDE ART: GROUPING ART BY DATE; GETTING THE HOLZER MESSAGE IN
PHILADELPHIA; FILLING A CURATORIAL HOLE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Britain)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christie's is once again grappling with the way it
packages the art it sells, reorganizing its important fall evening
sales in New York and London. Each time, executives say, the change
is to ``reflect current collecting patterns,'' meaning Christie's
is trying to match the art with the right buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In November Christie's plans to hold three evening sales in New
York: Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculptures;
postwar art, with classic contemporary masters dating from 1945 to
1970; and contemporary art, made from 1970 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally both Christie's and Sotheby's had two categories
for their big sales: Impressionist and modern art in one auction,
contemporary art in another. Works made before the 1860s went into
19th-century day sales. Impressionist paintings, drawings and
sculptures, though executed in the late 19th century, were grouped
with 20th-century art made before 1945. Auctions of contemporary
art consisted of works dating from 1945 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Christie's made what was then considered a
radical change by putting works by 19th-century artists like
Delacroix and Ingres in the same sales as masters like van Gogh and
Monet in an auction labeled ``Impressionist and 19th-century art.''
</P>
<P>
   But the early 19th-century art tended to bog down the sales and
failed to bring the high prices experts had hoped for by placing
those works alongside the big-ticket Impressionist paintings. Last
year, Christie's quietly renamed its Impressionist and 19th-century
sale ``Impressionist and post-Impressionist art'' and auctioned the
early 19th-century art in day sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the auction house also lumped artists like Picasso and
Matisse with modern figures like Jackson Pollock and Robert
Rauschenberg in sales of 20th-century art. Art dating from the
1970s to the present went into a separate evening sale of
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   At the time everyone waited to see if Sotheby's would follow
suit. It didn't. After several weeks of internal discussions,
executives there announced that the company would stick to the old
categories: Impressionist and modern art, and contemporary art,
which it continued to define as work dating from 1945 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's is also changing the dates of its important London
sales. Instead of December, they will now take place at the end of
January and the beginning of February. The reason, Christie's
experts said, is that December is too close to the New York sales
in November; buyers won't have time to pay for their New York
purchases before they are bombarded with more works in London. But
in London there will be only two evening sales: Impressionist,
modern and postwar art in one sale on Jan. 31 and contemporary art
the following evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has also held its important London sales in December.
Executives there said Thursday that they had not yet decided if
they would follow Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're going back, but rather that we're
tailoring our sales to different markets: London and New York,''
said Franck Giraud, head of 19th- and 20th-century art for
Christie's worldwide. ``We've re-evaluated the 19th- and
20th-century picture market and examined some areas that were
successful and others that were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But still, we have to be flexible,'' Giraud added. ``Top-end
works by artists like Corot or Courbet will be included in our
Impressionist evening sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's will continue selling works dating from 1970 to the
present in their own sale. ``We created a market that didn't exist
at auction before,'' Giraud said. By offering works that used to be
sold almost exclusively at galleries, Christie's was making works
by younger artists with long waiting lists _ names like Jeff Koons
or Andreas Gursky or Damien Hirst _ more accessible to a wider
public. Often, contemporary-art dealers give new works by these
artists only to their best customers or to museums. But as soon as
they hit the auction market, prices soared, often far exceeding
those charged in galleries.
</P>
<P>
   HOLZER MESSAGES
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of charisma can be fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Use what is dominant in culture to change it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   These are two of the messages being flashed on a giant
electronic billboard at the construction site of the Kimmel Center
for the Performing Arts at Broad and Spruce Streets in Philadelphia
near the First Union Center, where the Republican National
Convention is to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
   Not the typical political messages, they are a site-specific
artwork created by Jenny Holzer, the American artist known for her
signature ``Truisms'' that have been shown everywhere from the
Guggenheim Museum in New York to the Reichstag in Berlin and the
Pompidou Center in Paris. When officials from the Kimmel Center
approached Holzer, she agreed to create the installation for no
fee. The center has only paid her expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important statement about the importance of art in our

   The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has had a gaping hole in
its curatorial staff since its chief curator, Gary Garrels,
resigned in December to become the chief curator of drawings and a
curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York. This week the San Francisco museum announced that
Madeleine Grynsztejn, the curator of contemporary art at the
Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh since 1997, has joined it as
senior curator of painting and sculpture.

TV AD MAKERS CITE TEAMSTERS PRESSURE

<P>
   BOSTON _ At the same time that it has flexed its muscle to
maintain its grip on the filmmaking industry in New England,
Teamsters Local 25 has used similarly aggressive tactics to secure
jobs for its members with makers of television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the film industry, companies involved in making TV
commercials in most states, including Massachusetts, are not under
contract with the Teamsters to hire their members as drivers.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives of several production studios, however,
the Teamsters have regularly tried to disrupt television commercial
shoots because the studios refused to hire Teamsters for
transportation jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes like a hit-and-run situation,'' said one executive,
who asked not to be identified. ``They hear we're shooting at a
certain location and converge on us. Thankfully, commercials take a
lot less time to make than films so we can work around the
problem.'' In one instance in 1993 a member of a Boston production
team, hired by the state Department of Public Health to shoot an
antismoking commercial in Quincy, just outside Boston, got into a
fight with a group of Teamsters after he resisted their attempts to
shut down the set.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for local Teamster chief George Cashman said Cashman
has instituted reforms at the union to attract movies to the
region, but federal investigators are looking into whether
filmmakers were forced to hire a local trailer-rental firm
controlled by union member James Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal grand jury in Boston subpoenaed contracts
between Local 25 and the producers of several major Hollywood films
shot in Massachusetts and the three northern New England states.
Agents from the US Department of Labor's Division of Labor and
Racketeering seized records from Flynn's Weymouth home.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci said he would speak with Cashman, Local
25 president, whom Cellucci recently reappointed to another term on
the Massachusetts Port Authority's board of directors, about the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci acknowledged that he has been asked in the past by
Hollywood studios to intervene with Cashman when they were having
problems with the local union.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that when I have been involved, when I call the
Teamsters at the request of the Hollywood studios, they have always
been very responsive,'' Cellucci said. ``So I was very surprised to
see these (newspaper) reports.'' Cashman, who defended the
Teamsters' negotiating tactics with the film industry on Monday,
has not returned phone calls in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   However, Boston lawyer John Pappalardo, who is representing the
Teamster president, denied that Cashman was either a target or
subject of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, he said, had implemented many reforms, including
``policies designed to attract the movie industry to
Massachusetts,'' since taking over as president of Local 25 nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``His efforts in this regard have been repeatedly praised by
industry officials,'' Pappalardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Weisman, who is now directing the $53 million MGM movie
``What's the Worst That Could Happen?'', around Massachusetts,
praised the work of the Teamsters. Weisman said there are at least
35 Teamsters a day on the set being supervised by Flynn and William
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended Flynn as a professional who has kept things
running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he go by the book? Yes,'' Weisman said. ``Is he
unreasonable? No.'' However, several film industry executives
interviewed by the Globe said that Local 25 is so difficult in
negotiations on such issues as the number of drivers assigned to a
set, overtime, and fringe benefits that they have decided to shoot
their movies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent film makers said they felt intimidated by local
Teamsters while negotiating contracts or trying to resolve
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Local 25 has employed its share of tough guys on film crews over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn himself was acquitted in the 1982 gangland slaying of
Brian Halloran, a Winter Hill gang member who was gunned down on
Boston's waterfront after cooperating with the FBI against James
``Whitey'' Bulger. Patrick McGonagle, a Teamster who worked on the
set of ``The Good Son'' when it was filmed in Massachusetts in
1993, was later convicted of a series of armored car robberies --
including a 1984 heist in Hudson, N.H., in which two guards died.
</P>
<P>
   McGonagle, of Charlestown, is serving 30 years in prison.

 LOS ANGELES: homes,'' she said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In California, her views shifted leftward. Soon, as in
Washington, her home became a salon. The Capitol Hill and think
tank types were replaced by Beatty; Pat Caddell, a Jimmy Carter
pollster and now a consultant for television's ``West Wing''; and
Richard Walden, head of Operation USA, a humanitarian-relief group
that uses its Hollywood connections to get aid into atypical
recipient countries, including Cuba. Her columns seemed to
gradually uncouple from the conservative express.
</P>
<P>
   She is now the host of about one book party a month, as well as
frequent dinners. The writer Christopher Hitchens noted that
Huffington had held a party for the release of his book on
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the salon of Los Angeles,'' said Michael Jackson, a
popular Los Angeles radio talk show host who attended Huffington's
party on Monday night for Norris Church. ``There's nobody who can
attract the variety and caliber that she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington can play the wonk: She's full of statistics about
poverty and racial disparities in drug convictions, gleaned from
her correspondents and assembled by her research assistant. But
when asked to compare her current and former allies, she turns pure
politico: ``I think these distinctions are completely obsolete. A
lot of my friends are just as disenchanted with the Democratic
Party as I am with the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, her new crowd is a whole lot more left, filled,
for example, with correspondents for the Nation magazine, who have
been openly squabbling with colleagues over whether Huffington's
change of heart is to be trusted. One convert is Hitchens, who had
ridiculed her in print. Recalling Huffington's dalliance with New
Age cults and the subsequent Gingrich era, he said, ``Maybe she's
finally found a safe harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Her unsuccessful efforts to assist poverty-fighting groups
helped change her political leanings. ``I saw how much harder it
was to raise money for them than it was to raise money for the
opera or a fashionable museum,'' she said. ``So I have definitely
shifted my view on the role of government funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington also lost patience with her conservative allies and
their promises of attacking poverty their way. ``It's now six years
since the Republican takeover of Congress, and none of these things
have been accomplished,'' she said. ``There was not a collective
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scheer, the liberal Los Angeles Times columnist who has
been a regular sparring partner of Huffington in print and on radio
for years, said: ``If Arianna were a man, there would be no attacks
on her whatsoever. Sure, she's shifted her views. Sure, she's
inconsistent. Sure, she likes to be on TV. But I find her one of
the brightest, most decent and hardest-working people involved in
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with her column, which appears in more than 100 newspapers
and on two Web sites, she has a recent book, ``How to Overthrow the
Government'' (Regan Books), a citizens' primer on the corrosive
effect of money in politics and what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   As with many nascent revolutions, the one Huffington wants to
ignite is comfortable behind the barricades. Surrounded by a
buzzing, chirping and whirring cacophony of phones, intercoms and
fax machines, she maintains a sunny calm, like a queen in a
madhouse. Helping her keep a Martha Stewart-like grip on life are a
nanny, a housekeeper and a house manager, who doubles as her
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Light streams into her high-ceilinged home office through a
cathedral window. The walls are covered with paintings by her
daughters (9 and 11), who provide the main diversion from her
work-centered existence. She especially likes taking them on
Saturday hikes in the nearby mountains. Huffington's 78-year-old
mother occupies a separate wing and until a recent illness did all
the cooking, even forcing her Greek specialties on the FedEx man.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington likes to work East Coast hours. She's up early,
phoning her contacts on Capitol Hill or in New York, then gets her
children ready for school. Her husband frequently chauffeurs them.
</P>
<P>
   The yard, where she stages events for her children's private
school, has a pool, a cage with rabbits and a hillside space where
her daughters have their vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour ended, she led a visitor into her daughters'
playroom, where a staff worker, looking quintessentially Southern
California with a sort of Gypsy-style hairdo and dual earrings in
each ear, was typing on a laptop amid the toys. ``Reliving his
childhood,'' Huffington said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs on the landing, the panel covering the hidden room was
again nearly closed. Atop it was a mischievous 15th-century
painting, showing two laughing cardinals horsing around over a game
of cards. It was titled ``The Winning Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Down below, at her desk, Huffington could be overheard on a
conference call, declaring triumphantly, ``Will they help? Of
course, darling.''

OPERA REVIEW: THE CITADEL WAGNER BUILT, UNDER SIEGE INSIDE AND
OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany _ Richard Wagner had in mind that all things
low and vulgar would be left behind at the bottom of the green hill
on which he built his opera house. Listeners and artists alike
would make the short climb between rows of sheltering trees and
find in the theater he dedicated to himself refreshment and
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   After 124 years, the trees have grown and the myth of the
Bayreuth Festival with them. The annual summer event is with us
again. ``Parsifal'' was played on Tuesday night, raising its hand
in a kind of preliminary blessing toward the work to come. The
first performances of a newly produced ``Ring des Niebelungen''
with ``Das Rheingold'' runs through the week. The staging is by
Juergen Flimm; Giuseppe Sinopoli conducts.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner might be alarmed to find how near to his citadel of
purity the coarseness of the world has encroached. The high street
leading to his house, Wahnfried, is a merchandiser's gantlet of
cheap-looking clothes, fast food and expensive watches.
</P>
<P>
   Vulgarity has even made its way up the hill. The opening night
audience, with only a smattering of foreigners, preened itself with
displays of elegance and material good fortune. Inside Wagner's
plain but dignified Festspielhaus were intermittent hacks, coughs
and unidentified bumps and bangs, intruding on this temple of
silence. It took the final scene of ``Parsifal,'' a moment of
extraordinary and reverential beauty, to put a less-than-perfect
world in its place. Wolfgang Wagner's 11-year-old production was
not helpful. It is a homely, slightly awkward affair to begin with
and has not aged gracefully. Movable pillars shaped in jumbles of
solid geometry reverse themselves to form interior walls. Klingsor
(Hartmut Welker) comes and goes on a kind of slow-moving elevator.
Costumes are modest to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's collection of singers was mixed in quality, but then
what international Wagner cast is not? Bayreuth at least has a
radiant Kundry, Lithuania's Violeta Urmana, and in Andreas Schmidt
an earnest and devoted Armfortas. Matthias Holle sang Gurnemanz
with touching dignity, although his appearance in the part came as
a late-hour surprise. Hans Sotin, with 29 seasons at Bayreuth
behind him, withdrew (or was asked to withdraw, depending on whom
you ask) because of ``unbridgeable differences'' with the
conductor, Christoph Eschenbach.
</P>
<P>
   As Parsifal, Poul Elming has a clear heldentenor voice of
unusual health. He is a tall, youthful presence onstage and works
hard at his part, so it is a shame he is not a more compelling
musical personality. Titurel, Holle's original role, was taken by
Alfred Reiter
</P>
<P>
   Top billing in the end belonged to the Festspielhaus itself.
``Parsifal'' is the only opera Wagner wrote with the sound of its
unusual acoustics already in his ears. Contrary to later Wagnerian
trends, the great man's priorities tilted toward words and acting.
The house's wood surfaces disperse voices with unusual clarity. The
covered orchestra pit subdues the big ensemble to such an extent
that the first rising trumpet figure, a dominant voice in most
opera houses, blends sedately into the rolling string figures. Such
a space tends to flatter even a mediocre orchestra, although this
one was better than that. Bayreuth's splendid chorus, crucial to
any ``Parsifal,'' needed no flattery at all.
</P>
<P>
   Eschenbach took the prelude so slowly that the line between the
stately and the moribund was sometimes confused. Klingsor's scene,
on the other hand, went at a furious speed. The final act was
deeply moving, rising to the level of religious piety and ancient
barbarism to which Wagner's crypto-Christian world of holy relics
and holy bloodshed aspires.
</P>
<P>
   The composer, who wrote a lot of heavenly music, found time in
his leisure hours to produce a family from hell, and today his
descendants squabble and intrigue as they always have about the
festival's future. Arguments for and against tradition are
slippery. Wolfgang, Wagner's 80-year-old grandson, has the upper
hand now, but family agitators for new ideas and artistic
renovation are closing in.
</P>
<P>
   The Festspielhaus reeks of atmosphere and history, and its
rituals (no applause after Act I of ``Parsifal''; doors opened,
shut and locked by a rigid observance of the clock) are followed as
by a congregation in church. Yet the staging is traditional in the
questionable sense of the word. Its self-conscious gesturing and
choreography address a set of audience expectations long since
superseded.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative and conservation are words with the same root, and
who knows, maybe the workmanlike simplicity of Tuesday's
``Parsifal'' would have appealed to its composer. He would have
been less pleased, I think, with those sitting in the theater,
whose aura of vanity and public display was precisely what the
Bayreuth Festival was intended to do away with.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the rich, the powerful and the politically connected
need as much enlightenment as anybody else, maybe more.

OSCAR-WINNING ACTRESS GOES TO THE SMALL SCREEN THIS FALL IN ABC
SITCOM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Each year, TV executives greenlight a
plethora of improbable concepts that they hope will captivate
audiences and seduce potential advertisers. Sometimes they succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Geena Davis' new self-titled ABC sitcom is both
improbable and immoral. Her character, a glamorous New York career
woman named Teddie Cochran, falls in love at first sight, gets
engaged at first bite and is next seen packing up the SUV and
heading to the burbs to live in premarital bliss with her fiance
Max (Peter Horton) and his two kids (John Francis Daley and
Makenzie Vega).
</P>
<P>
   The chance of something like this happening to a hip millennium
diva in a city where women outnumber men is about as likely as
Rosie O'Donnell, or anyone else in America for that matter, passing
up a hot Krispy Kreme doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love TV? You can just do anything and get away with
it!
</P>
<P>
   According to Davis, however, there's a method to this madness.
``It's meant to be clear that this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing
for both of us,'' Davis, who is also one of five executive
producers, told a group of TV critics last week. ``My character's
never had this kind of thing happen. It just hit us both over the
head and something we impulsively decided to go with. I think
that's part of what we're going to take advantage of _ that we
don't really know each other that well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the folks in the Bible Belt who might be a bit miffed that
Teddie and Max are shacking up with his kids, hold off on the
e-mail and letter-writing campaigns for a minute. The producers
plan to have Teddie and Max tie the knot real soon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking February sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two people who have made a very serious commitment
to one another, and there are children involved,'' says executive
producer Nina Wass. ``And they are engaged, so we are definitely
going to get them married in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about (having them live together) a lot and what we
thought would be interesting is, it is a contemporary family and
these people are very responsible. We thought it would be sort of
fun to explore, because we hadn't seen it explored before.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality and the lack thereof, however, is not the problem with
``The Geena Davis Show.'' The problem is that Davis, who has an
Academy Award sitting on her mantel, deserves something better. The
writing in the pilot episode is uneven, uninspired and derivative.
At one point, we see Davis and her three single girlfriends (Mimi
Rogers, Cindy Lu and Wendy McKenna) sitting in a bar drinking
cosmopolitans and exhaling over Teddie's domestic dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Remind you of another show featuring four single women?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it just so happens that the show's creator, Terri Minsky,
also used to write for HBO's ``Sex and the City.'' However, when
Minsky discovered that she was repeating herself, she quickly
changed the dynamic of Teddie's inner circle by replacing McKenna
and Lu with actress Kim Coles of ``Living Single.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the substitution of Coles might not be a fix-all, Davis
says she's not really concerned about the negative buzz from
critics who panned the pilot episode. Why should she worry? If
``The Geena Davis Show'' tanks, it's not like Davis will have to
trade in her Prada pumps for a pair of
Payless kicks. She'll have several other options to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   A. She is an established movie star.
</P>
<P>
   B. She can always shop the show to cable.
</P>
<P>
   C. She's also pretty darn handy with her bow and arrows. Davis'
competitive archery career is no joke. At the 1996 Olympic trials,
she finished 24th out of 300 and is currently ranked 10th in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who conceded that she doesn't get stage fright, didn't
appear nervous when she met the press at the Ritz-Carlton last
week. Dressed in a clingy black dress with 3-inch black sandals
that she removed during the ABC outdoor soiree later that evening,
she said she wouldn't take it personally if the show bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't control everything,'' Davis, 41, said emphatically.
``If I controlled all the aspects of the universe I would take it
to heart, but since I can only control my limited contribution . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   You ought to be applauded for sticking your long neck out there.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy launching a show when you're fully aware that more
than 80 percent of all new fall series fail within the first 13
weeks. And it must be rather disconcerting when some people assume
that the only reason an A-List actor would condescend to do
television is because his or her career is in the
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not really the case with Davis, a Massachusetts-born
actress who made her film debut in ``Tootsie,'' won the 1989 Best
Supporting Actress Oscar for ``The Accidental Tourist'' and has
appeared in 14 other memorable films, including ``Thelma &AMP;
Louise,'' ``A League of Their Own,'' ``Speechless,'' and most
recently, ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've certainly never been a snob about mediums,'' said Davis,
who previously starred in two other sitcoms, ``Buffalo Bill'' and
``Sara.'' ``It wasn't a conscious plan to pursue television at this
moment. It purely was this material. I saw this pilot and fell in
love with the writing and the concept. It was really about the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrice-married and divorced actress also added that she
could identify with Teddie. ``Actors bring parts of themselves to
everything they do. A fun part of acting is exploring different
facets of your personality. I can certainly relate to her
enthusiasm and optimism and drive. I sort of look at the world that
way, too. There's nothing I can't do if I don't really apply
myself. The funny thing about Teddie is that that doesn't always
work _ especially in this new role as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   What has worked for Davis throughout her career is her
versatility. She's as adept at drama as she is at comedy. Her
dramatic performance in ``The Fly'' with ex-husband Jeff Goldblum
was impressive. Conversely, her natural comedic timing was apparent
in ``Beetlejuice.'' And from a purely physical standpoint, Davis, a
former model, is pretty enough to play the ingenue as she did in
``Angie,'' tough enough to play an action star as she did in
ex-husband Renny Harlin's ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'' and subtle
enough to play a girl-next-door type as she did in ``A League of
Their Own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, from the beginning I was offered many different
types of parts,'' said Davis, whose next feature film will be
``Stuart Little II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been pretty fussy about what I choose to do, which
is sometimes why I take a year or two off between film roles. I've
always wanted to play a variety of things. I've been so lucky that
I've been in so many different genres in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything I can put my finger on, but when I read
something and start to picture myself in it, saying, `I want to say
that, I want to do that,
I want to be that person,' then I know it's probably be something
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her good instincts will help her overcome what now
appears to be an improbable dream.

KACZMAREK'S PORTRAYAL OF MOM IN `MALCOLM' REDEFINES ROLE OF TV MOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKI TURNER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When Jane Kaczmarek _ who plays Lois, the
unconventional mother on Fox's irreverent family sitcom ``Malcolm
in the Middle'' _ bared her breasts and shaved off her nude
husband's body hair in the kitchen during the series' premiere
episode last January, she not only altered our perceptions of the
perfect television family (you know the kind, where problems are
always solved in 22 minutes or less), but redefined the role of the
sainted television mom as well.
</P>
<P>
   The very second Lois screamed, ``Chop-chop'' at her kids, June
Cleaver died. Claire Huxtable left the room. Carol Brady covered
her eyes and ears, and Donna Reed called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Their saccharine images have been mercifully destroyed by a
mother who does things outside of the kitchen _ such as taking a
bath, making love to her husband and plotting revenge against pesky
neighbors. Lois also has that uncanny God-given ability to see all
and hear all while creating one of her infamous mystery-meat
casseroles. These are the things real moms _ those wonderfully
flawed, funny and multidimensional people who rub our tummies when
we're sick and warm our bottoms when we're bad _ do.
</P>
<P>
   This is why we love Lois. She's one bad mama.
</P>
<P>
   This also is why ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which stars the
brilliantly talented Frankie Muniz as Malcolm, a regular kid with a
high IQ _ along with Bryan Cranston as the sometimes clueless
father; and Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Justin Berfield and Erik
Per Sullivan as Malcolm's precocious brothers _ was the breakout
comedy hit of last season. Last week the show received five Emmy
nominations, including best actress in a comedy series for
Kaczmarek, who recently was honored by the Television Critics
Association for best individual performance in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarek's glee over her first Emmy nomination, however, was
bittersweet because her husband, actor Bradley Whitford, who stars
on ``The West Wing'' _ the other most-talked-about show of last
season _ didn't get a nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing because my husband wasn't
nominated,'' Kaczmarek, 44, told a group of television critics,
with her voice cracking. ``I was much more upset than he. He's a
gracious, big-hearted guy. He was very happy for me. But if you
watch `The West Wing,' my husband is the quarterback of that show.
He worked so hard and he loves it so much. He's just spectacular
and it was really disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarek and Whitford met on a blind date arranged by
Kaczmarek's roommate at Yale Drama School, Kate Burton (daughter of
Richard Burton) in 1992. Two years later they married, and in 1998
Kaczmarek gave birth to the couple's first child, Frances, who is
now 2 1/2. Their son, George, is 7 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kaczmarek _ whose television credits include
co-starring roles on ``Equal Justice,'' ``Big Wave Dave's,''
``Hometown'' and ``Paper Chase: The Second Year'' and recurring
roles on ``Felicity,'' ``Party of Five,'' ``Frasier,'' ``The
Practice,'' ``Cybill'' and ``Hill Street Blues'' _ nearly missed
out on the role that has made her one of America's most popular TV
moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd taken a year off and had been studying classical music at
UCLA and found that there was this wonderful life out there that
had nothing to do with acting,'' the veteran stage and screen
actress said. ``And when the phone rang you didn't wonder if it was
an agent. Then I got pregnant. I had a glorious year not working
and had my daughter (Frances) and thought `do I really want to go
back into this?' It was pretty great. Brad was working all the
time, I continued taking the music classes and was doing a little
bit on `Felicity' (playing Julie's long-lost mother). That was all
I did and that was terrific. I love that show.''
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   When the Whitfords decided to have a second child, Kaczmarek
instructed her agents not to send her on any auditions. But at the
end of pilot season, Mary Fox, the casting director for ``Malcolm
in the Middle,'' persuaded Kaczmarek's agents to send the actress a
script about an unusual family seen through the eyes of a young
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still didn't want to do it, but then you think, `Wow, they
really love me,''' Kaczmarek said. ``Maybe I should read this. I
did and found that there was something undeniably quirky and
endearing about Lois.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Kaczmarek, she didn't have to avoid the
inevitable comparisons to other television moms. Lois was and is an
original.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV mom I identify most with is Donna Reed, because I grew
up in that era. What I really like about Lois is that she has
depth. Mothers on television tend to not grow. They tend to be kind
of wise, nodding, influencing kind of funny ma'ams. Lois isn't
that. She yells and is kind of the mouthpiece for the family. She's
just kind of normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaczmarek's perception of her character is why she takes
exception to the ``D'' word that's often used to describe the hit
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Dysfunctional?''' This is one of the most highly
functioning families,'' says the Milwaukee native, who is the
oldest of four kids born to Edward and Evelyn Kaczmarek. ``They
have dinner together every night, which I think is impressive in
this day and age. And they don't get away with anything. They try,
and I think that's why their mischief is as clever as it is. I
think the parents are aware of everything. And I think there's
great love expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they have one bathroom is a testimony to huge
function. Do you know how organized you have to be to have one
bathroom? I grew up in a house with one bathroom and boy, you have
to work together as a family and forgive, forgive, forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kaczmarek has been finding that the lines between Lois
and Jane are becoming increasingly blurred. For example, the phrase
``Chop-chop'' that Lois uses to whip her boys into shape on the
show has become part of Jane's parental vernacular as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if life is imitating art or the other way around,''
Kaczmarek says with a laugh. ``My children are becoming a little
more mobile. And I guess I've never been fond of people who dawdle.
I'm very fond of the phrase `Chop-chop.' It's kind of, `Let's go,
let's go now and let's do it the way I want you to do it.' So I
don't know if I'm learning some good techniques for playing Lois
that I'm going to incorporate into my technique as Jane the mom,
but Lois is pretty good at keeping things going. And so far,
`Chop-chop' has worked very well around the house, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And like most TV mothers, she has to pull rank sometimes
on-screen and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I have a family at home that I really want to go home
to, when (her TV kids) sometime goof around too much or come in
unprepared _ which they really don't do, they're just having fun _
I'm usually the one who kind of tells everyone to knock it off,
concentrate and let's go,'' Kaczmarek said. ``I try not to be too
harsh, but it kind of does the trick. It got them more focused and
I got to go home a little earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Muniz says he doesn't mind Kaczmarek's gentle nudging at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me, anyway, she gets after,'' Muniz says with a
devilish grin. ``No, Jane is great. She's really like all of our
moms. She keeps us in line when she has to, but she's always there
for us, too. She's really smart and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Kaczmarek can apply some of that wisdom and good
humor to potty training Frances. The actress said that she spent
the better part of her hiatus trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to trust that they are finally going to do it on
their own time,'' Kaczmarek said. ``It's hard to accept that you
are not more clever than they are. I thought, `I'm a 44-year-old
woman with a master's degree from Yale and I can outsmart this kid,
but you can't. It was a very humbling experience. I remember the
first time she took my hand and said she didn't want to wear
diapers anymore. She wanted to go `potty.' We went into the
bathroom and you hear that little (makes tinkling noises) and I
thought I'd just won a prize. I was so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Frances has learned to chop-chop, too.

 &HT;    CRASH INVESTIGATORS DECODE CONCORDE'S 'BLACK BOXES'; MEMORIAL
SERVICE HELD FOR VICTIMS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear
government investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes''
recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and
burst into flame as the aircraft took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction. ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in
the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond
Auffray told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed
grounded as the investigation
</P>
<P>
   progressed Thursday. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights
between New York and London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation
expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations
suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told
the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades
inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all
113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to
a medical institute in Paris for examination. Most were burned
beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by
dental records or DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in
white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the
charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of
clothing _ that might help identify the victims. ``The bodies are
terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's
impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the
regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and
German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in
central Paris to pay their respects to the victims Thursday. It is
the same church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of
Princess Diana here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
familivictims, some holding one another for support, arrived in
buses provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark
glasses in the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large
bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered
here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off
Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France
employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took
place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served
by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving
families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to
hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they
would close shop to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially
opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether
charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized
maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's
thrust reverser. Such an investigation is not unusual in France
following such a large accident.

UPDATE: BARNEYS CEO QUESTROM HEADING TO JC PENNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock
figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Questrom, after spending a little over a year trying to
restore the luster to Barneys department stores after the company's
emergence from bankruptcy, is leaving to head JC Penney (JCP:NYSE),
JC Penney announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Questrom, 60, will become chairman and chief executive officer
of the Plano, Texas-based retailer on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   JC Penney was up 2 3/4, or 18 percent, at 17 5/8 in midday
trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Questrom's departure from Barneys as chairman and chief
executive officer follows the exit of four other Barneys top
executives in late June to join online retailer Eve.com, which
itself is run by Thomas Shull, a former chief executive officer of
Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Questrom formerly ran Federated Department Stores (FD:NYSE),
which he joined in 1990 just after it filed for bankruptcy.
Questrom left in 1997, and later sued Federated for $47 million in
back pay, which he argued he was entitled to under the
incentive-based portion of his compensation package. In February, a
judge threw out the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen has a superior record of success in the industry,'' said
James Oesterreicher, the present chairman and chief executive
officer of JC Penney. ``He led Federated Department Stores out of
bankruptcy and turned it into one of the largest department store
companies in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Questrom's hiring marked a change for JC Penney, which in the
past has chosen to groom its executives from within. ``It's a
breath of fresh air,'' said Walter Loeb, a longtime retail analyst
who heads equity research at Loeb Associates and publishes the
newsletter the Loeb Retail Letter. ``This is a closed society,
really.'' Loeb does not perform underwriting. Loeb has a strong buy
rating on JC Penney because of its low stock price. But he said the
retailer, the fifth-largest in the U.S., has been in steady decline
for about five years. ``It's a matter of merchandise,'' he said of
JC Penney's sinking ortunes.
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted JC Penney with Kohl's (KSS:NYSE), which has been
successful at offering quality, fashionable clothes at reasonable
prices, he said, with investors following in tow. Kohl's trades at
over 78 times earnings, with JC Penney, whose stock is off around
62 percent from its 52-week high, trades at around 13 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs a real push,'' said Loeb, who praised JC Penney's
hiring of Questrom. ``I admire him because not only does he
motivate people, but he excites people with merchandise. It's a
very opportune time to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb suggested that JC Penney shut down some its less profitable
stores, and aggressively revamp its merchandise, particularly its
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates about 1,100 JC Penney stores in the U.S.,
Puerto Rico and Mexico. In addition the company also runs over
2,600 Eckerd drugstores.

 StorageNetworks Surpasses Estimates  
(For use by clients of The New York Times News Service.) (Eds:
Stock figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of StorageNetworks Inc. (STOR:Nasdaq) fell Thursday after
the company reported that, despite a sharp jump in revenue, its net
losses continued to grow in the second quarter, increasing tenfold
from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Waltham, Mass.-based data storage company reported a
second-quarter net loss of $31.3 million, or $1.20 per share.
StorageNetworks lost $3 million, or 12 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's current losses were lower than analysts had
expected. The consensus estimate for StorageNetworks's
second-quarter losses was $1.35 per share, according to a First
Call/Thomson Financial survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been very upfront about their intentions to
build out the infrastructure. No one was looking for the same
losses as last year,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs. ``What's important is for the company to continue to build
up its business without having losses get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, revenue at StorageNetworks increased significantly from
the same year-ago period, rising to $8 million from $440,000 in
1999. The company also expanded its customer base by 71 percent,
adding such clients as Juniper Networks, Credit Suisse First Boston
and FleetBoston Financial in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's continued net losses weighed heavily on its
stock price Thursday, with shares down 7 5/8, or 5 percent, to 132,
midway through the session.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks' stock price has fluctuated wildly since its IPO
on June 30. The stock skyrocketed 234 percent to close at $90.25 a
share on its first day, after reaching an intraday high of $100.
Less than a week after its introduction, shares slipped to a
52-week low of $82. But the stock bounced back to set a new 52-week
high of $154.25 last week before slipping slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still dealing with a very young company,'' said
Conigliaro.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said competition in the computer storage data market
has increased since the company's inception. Still, StorageNetwork
boasts a ``first-mover advantage'' as it was the first to offer
such specialized services and has already built up a strong
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Conigliaro remains positive about the company's prospects,
initiating a stock rating of ``market outperform'' two days ago.
Goldman Sachs helped underwrite StorageNetworks' IPO in June.
Conigliaro does not have a target price for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetwork's customers pay a fee to connect their computer
systems to its global data storage network, allowing them to store
and access their data in an arrangement similar to the way
companies set up and use telephone services such as voice mail.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ I wouldn't know a Gibson from a Stratocaster.
My favorite guitarists are Django Reinhardt, Eddie Lang and Andres
Segovia, and none of them, as far as I know, ever played a single
note at the Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   That could cast a rather long shadow, I suppose, over my
qualifications as a guide to Music City, U.S.A., except that there
is a lot more than picking and fiddling, a lot more than ballads of
love and loss, in Nashville's past, present and future _ especially
its future. Which is no bad thing for the city, since country
music, which rang up sales of tapes and records of almost $2
billion two years ago, is suffering through a bit of a slump at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention and Visitors Bureau here has set aside $4 million
to play down the city's hillbilly image and emphasize its
developing cosmopolitanism. It should not prove too hard a sell;
like Charlotte, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and a number of other
second-tier Southern cities, this one is rapidly acquiring big-time
accouterments, including a National Football League team called the
Titans. With a brand-new $292 million stadium, a bruiser of a
running back named Eddie George and a formidable defensive end
named Jevon ``the Freak'' Kearse, the Titans went to the Super Bowl
last year and made the city swagger a little.
</P>
<P>
   Already in business or on the way are a zoo, a new Country Music
Hall of Fame, an enormous shopping complex on the scale of the Mall
of America near Minneapolis, a new library designed by Robert A.M.
Stern, an arena to house the Nashville Predators of the National
Hockey League and the ambitious new Frist Center for the Visual
Arts, about which a few more words later.
</P>
<P>
   What interests me most about Nashville, however, is its past,
notably its often neglected role as an agent of political and
intellectual change.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Nashville _ or rather from the Hermitage, his home
just east of town _ that rugged old Andrew Jackson set off for
Washington in 1829, having ousted the aristocratic John Quincy
Adams in the pivotal election of 1828. A frontiersman, a general,
the first president from west of the Alleghenies, the first
self-made man to take up residence in the White House, Jackson
shaped modern American democracy in the image of his own
egalitarianism. He fostered government by the masses instead of the
propertied classes.
</P>
<P>
   The muddy boots of Jackson's followers spoiled the carpets at
the post-inaugural party, and his opponents derided him as ``some
kind of border savage,'' in the words of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.
But he proved them wrong, taking a new, more aggressive style of
leadership to Washington and blazing a path for a fresh tramontane
dynasty that included James K. Polk and Abraham Lincoln, a
Kentuckian before he moved to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, in the early 1920s, a group of writers at
Vanderbilt University, just west of downtown Nashville, coalesced
around a journal they called The Fugitive. They railed against both
the industrialization of the South and what they called the
``moonlight and magnolia'' distortion of traditional agrarian
values.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom, two of the most important
modern American critics, were members of the group, but its star
was Robert Penn Warren. His biographer, Joseph Blotner, called him
this country's greatest 20th-century man of letters, which seems
reasonable enough given his achievements as a poet, critic,
novelist, playwright, essayist and biographer. Warren wrote what
for me is the greatest of political novels, ``All the King's Men,''
whose protagonist, Willie Stark, was a ringer for Huey P. Long, and
he was the only person to win Pulitzer Prizes for both poetry and
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years, the Fugitives became the Agrarians, and most
members drifted away from Vanderbilt, but not before they had
helped to ignite the Southern Literary Renaissance. Eventually,
those fevered nights in Nashville helped to mold publications like
The Kenyon Review and The Sewanee Review and writers like Randall
Jarrell, James Dickey and Cleanth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt may well be entering a bright new era. Founded in
1872 and endowed by Cornelius Vanderbilt, it has evolved from
Methodist and regional origins into an institution of national
repute with 10,000 students. Already among the 20 wealthiest
colleges and universities in the nation, it has found a new
champion in Martha R. Ingram, whose family controls Nashville-based
Ingram Industries, one of the nation's dozen largest privately held
companies. Among many other things, Ingram is the largest book
wholesaler in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Ingram gave Vanderbilt $300 million in Ingram stock _
the second-largest donation ever made to any American university _
and this year she played a leading role in persuading E. Gordon Gee
to come here as chancellor. A former president of Ohio State
University, Gee staggered the educational world by leaving Brown
University, where he had only recently been installed as president,
to move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the region say Ingram, who was also the prime mover in
establishing the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, has ambitions to
make Vanderbilt into a southern Stanford or Harvard, or at least to
put it on an academic par with Duke and the University of Virginia.
Not so, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culturally, we were a little deprived, but we've begun to
remedy that,'' Ingram told me. ``Education has always been taken
seriously here. Now it's time to try to take Vanderbilt up a notch
or two, but we don't want it to be a Southern equivalent of
something else. Not at all. We want to be the best we can be on our
own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's early settlers hiked through the Cumberland Gap, a
natural opening in the Appalachian barrier near the point where
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky meet. They settled along the
Cumberland River, which cuts through lovely limestone hills in this
region, and quickly established Nashborough, as it was called, as a
staging point to the west. From here, the Natchez Trace, a crude
forest track, linked the interior South to the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   For many generations, Nashville's banks and insurance companies
formed the basis of its prosperity. They gave Union Street a modest
reputation as ``the Wall Street of the South,'' but in recent years
they have been sold to out-of-town interests, along with The
Tennessean, long the city's dominant newspaper, and a number of the
more important radio and television stations.

 NASHVILLE: television stations.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Great hunks of once humble, now glittering Music Row now belong
to big foreign conglomerates like Bertelsmann of Germany and Sony
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nashville used to be a home-owned, home-operated kind of
city,'' said John Egerton, a social historian who has lived here
for 35 years. ``But for a long time, it has had an aspiration to
celebrity, and by this point it is quite clearly a city on the
make. It's a money culture. But that's the New South, I guess. The
new world.''
</P>
<P>
   As the state capital, Nashville remains a cockpit of political
drama. Closely divided between the two parties, Tennessee has
produced prominent Democrats like Cordell Hull, who was Franklin D.
Roosevelt's secretary of state; Sen. Estes Kefauver, the 1956
Democratic vice presidential nominee; and Sen. Albert Gore Sr. It
has produced powerful Republicans like Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. and
Gov. Lamar Alexander, who both aspired to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They play the game for keeps here, and they don't forget; in
casual conversation six years after he lost his seat, former Sen.
Jim Sasser bitterly condemned those who had denied him a third term
as ``reactionary know-nothings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, politics sometimes looks like Nashville's growth
industry. Vice President Al Gore, soon to be the Democratic nominee
for President, is a native son, sort of; born in Washington, he
spent summers in Carthage, one of many nearby towns with names
drawn from antiquity, then graduated from Harvard and studied for a
year at Vanderbilt's divinity school. He moved his headquarters
here when his primary campaign was floundering, and Yankee staff
members have learned more than they wanted to know about biscuits
with cream gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Republican, was promoted for a time this
year as a candidate for vice president, and there were even a few
mentions of Tennessee's other senator, William H. Frist.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, Middle Tennessee, the region anchored by
Nashville, has found more reliable ways to make a living. The most
important is health care. Nashville has a string of important
hospitals, and it is the headquarters of HCA, the largest hospital
management company in the country. HCA was founded by Frist's
father, and after many corporate tribulations, Thomas F. Frist Jr.,
the senator's brother, returned as chief executive to turn it
around.
</P>
<P>
   The city's economy benefits as well from a Nissan auto plant at
Smyrna and the Saturn factory at Spring Hill, both south of here.
Bridgestone/Firestone produces tires here, too. And Dell has just
begun shipping computers from a vast new Nashville factory.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, this has been one of the boom towns of
the South, growing more rapidly than any other metropolitan area
between Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Employment is so full that
stores and airlines have trouble filling jobs. Metropolitan
Nashville's population now exceeds a million, and it has recently
overtaken Memphis as the largest city in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The swells of Nashville live in Belle Meade, a suburb of
enormous houses beneath lofty shade trees on even more enormous
lawns. They don't mix much with the denim-clad country crowd, and
this is more and more their city.
</P>
<P>
   But the two groups have a few things in common. The whole town
assuages its sweet tooth with a locally produced candy called
Goo-Goo Clusters, a highly caloric confection of peanuts,
chocolate, caramel and marshmallow. Ronald Reagan took jelly beans
to the White House; if Al Gore wins the presidency this year, look
for him to stock the Oval Office with Goo-Goo Clusters.
</P>
<P>
   RHINESTONE COWBOYS
</P>
<P>
   As for country music, my wife, Betsey, and I are learning.
</P>
<P>
   We were prepared for the army of musicians and would-be
musicians looking for a break, waiting on tables and strumming
their guitars everywhere _ in rundown bars, on street corners, in
legendary dives like Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and Robert's Western
World. We were ready for the rhinestones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Altman saw to that in ``Nashville,'' his brilliant,
Chaucerian film about the princes and princesses of country music,
with egos the size of cathedrals, as well as the no-hopers. Now the
French photographer Michel Arnaud has brought the picture up to
date in a handsome new book, ``Nashville: Pilgrims of Guitar
Town,'' soon to be published by Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang.
</P>
<P>
   But this is one of those places that you have to see to believe.
</P>
<P>
   You could do a lot worse than start at the Country Music Hall of
Fame, which reminded even a country-music philistine like me how
much good stuff has flowed from Nashville into the American
pop-culture mainstream. A fan of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw et al.,
I was intrigued to learn more about Bob Wills, who made ``San
Antonio Rose'' popular and more or less invented the wonderfully
rhythmic music called Western Swing. Apparently he never performed
without a 5-cent cigar in his mouth. I had not known that Lester
Flatt and Earl Scruggs played that captivating banjo tune (it's
called ``Foggy Mountain Breakdown'') on the soundtrack of ``Bonnie
and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   And I ask you, for sheer gaudy glory, what could match the
hall's prize possession, Elvis Presley's ``solid gold'' Cadillac, a
perfect totem of American excess?
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers remember the days when Music Row consisted of ratty
houses used as music publishers' headquarters. The Opry played in
the pre-renovation Ryman Auditorium, whose roof sometimes leaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any air-conditioning,'' recalled Tricia Frist,
Thomas Frist's wife, ``so you stuck to the back of the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Music Row is lined with multistory office buildings, and the
Opry has moved to a riverside site on the edge of town. Today's
Grand Ole Opry House has air-conditioning, a light board and sound
system that would do credit to Las Vegas and more seats than the
Metropolitan Opera House: 4,400, versus 3,800. Nearby stand the
kitschy Opryland Hotel and a sprawling mall called Opry Mills. An
expanded Country Music Hall of Fame is to open in the area in May.

NASHVILLE: in May.  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   MUSICAL MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Its fans treat the Opry with tremendous seriousness, according
it a place in their hearts alongside stock-car racing and
evangelical Christianity. (One car in the immense parking lot bore
the license plate ``SAVED 67.'') An Opry performance feels a little
like a secular church service. The audience is, in fact, seated in
pews, not individual seats. Everyone listened raptly and
respectfully the Saturday night we were there, munching their
popcorn and slurping Big Drinks, with none of the hubbub of a rock
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from another perspective, this is vaudeville for
hayseeds, with a carefully calibrated blend of corny jokes, spangly
costumes, bottle blondes and a surprising range of music _ not just
country and bluegrass, but also honky-tonk, western, rockabilly,
gospel and quasi-Cajun. A lot of the lyrics may be banal and the
emotional range may be severely limited, but there are big voices
up there onstage, and the songs are sung with unmistakable skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd need a heart of steel not to like this stuff,'' said
Betsey, charmed by Porter Wagoner, the gold-booted MC who joined
the company 43 years ago and helped to advance the career of a
buxom thrush named Dolly Parton.
</P>
<P>
   But we realized what aliens we were in this culture when the
crowd lustily cheered an explicitly sexist, rabidly homophobic,
stunningly anti-government ditty called ``We Want America Back.''
The Supreme Court, one of the song's milder verses suggested, hands
out free condoms while frowning on the distribution of Gideon
Bibles. Rush Limbaugh would have been enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   There are other art forms in Nashville, but sometimes you have
to look around a bit to find them.
</P>
<P>
   You might despair about the city's contemporary architecture if
all you saw was its skyline, dominated by the Bell South building.
From one angle, I thought, it looked like some misbegotten
postmodern Mont St.-Michel; from another, a mooring mast for
dirigibles. As usual, the word on the street was more apt;
Nashville folk call it the Batcave or the Batman Building.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Joseph B. Ledbetter, a Nashville businessman of broad
interests, set me right. The concrete span bridge on the Natchez
Trace Parkway south of town, he said, ``is perhaps the most
beautiful sight in all of Nashville.'' So it is: a broad, lean,
handsome arch across a verdant valley, an architectural engineering
gem as graceful as the soaring Sunshine Skyway in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   `GOOD TO THE LAST DROP'
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for pictures. Nashville's showplace is Cheekwood,
the limestone mansion built in the 1930s by Leslie Cheek, who made
a pile from Maxwell House Coffee (named after the Nashville hotel
where Theodore Roosevelt supposedly proclaimed it ``Good to the
Last Drop''). While we greatly admired the English silver, some of
it by Hester Bateman and Matthew Boulton, we found the paintings
disappointing and the gardens, with the exception of the extensive
boxwood hedges, beaten down by Nashville's unforgiving midsummer
heat.
</P>
<P>
   But at Fisk University, in a far less leafy part of town, we
found an utterly unheralded trove of early American modernism.
Founded by missionaries and freedmen in 1866, only a year after
Appomattox, Fisk may be the oldest historically black institution
of higher education in the country. A statue of W.E.B. DuBois, the
school's most famous alumnus, stands on the campus. After the death
of the pioneering photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz in
1946, his widow, Georgia O'Keeffe, divided his art collection five
ways, giving most of the paintings to big urban museums but sending
101 others to Fisk, where they hang today in a modest little
red-brick building.
</P>
<P>
   A few are by European masters, including Severini and Renoir and
Signac. There is an arrestingly caustic portrait of a dandy in
pince-nez and his companion, swathed in pearls and furs, done by
the German George Grosz while he was living in New York during
World War II. Three or four less well-known artists are included
here, among them Abraham Walkowitz, whose vaguely Cezanne-like work
was represented in the famous Armory Show in Manhattan in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   The treasures of the Fisk collection, to my mind, are the large
groups of works by Marsden Hartley, Arthur G. Dove, Charles Demuth
(especially a precise, curiously touching little watercolor of an
eggplant and some bell peppers) and John Marin. There are more than
a dozen Marins, watercolors and dry-point etchings, ranging from
Venice to Manhattan to the Maine coast.
</P>
<P>
   These same artists are shown to no better advantage in
Washington's Phillips Collection, which owes part of its renown to
them. It is a pity that no corporation or government body has
stepped forward to underwrite improvements to the galleries at Fisk
or to help publish a catalog. Chronically short of cash for
decades, the university desperately needs every cent of help.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBITING ART
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day the Stieglitz collection will be shown at the
$45 million Frist Center, now being carved out of the old Nashville
Post Office, a good-looking New Deal building guarded by stone
eagles outside and decorated with elegant Art Deco aluminum screens
inside. When it opens next year, it will give Nashville 24,000
square feet of gallery space to house major traveling exhibitions
as well as temporary exhibitions of locally owned art.
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, the center will have no collection of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rather late to the party,'' said Chase W. Rynd, the
center's executive director, who came here from Tacoma, Wash.
``Good art is very expensive these days, so we are concentrating
our resources on the building, on education and on holding the
prices down. Kids 18 and under will pay nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is scheduled to open on April 8, with a show from the
Art Gallery of Ontario. Nashville will hit another cultural
milestone this fall when the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, for the
first time in its history, plays in Carnegie Hall on Sept. 25. More
than 1,000 local residents have booked trips to New York to cheer
their musicians in a program featuring the violin virtuoso Nadja
Salerno-Sonnenberg.

 NASHVILLE: Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will be a triumphal moment for Kenneth Schermerhorn, the
orchestra's music director since 1983. Earlier in a long career, he
conducted both the Milwaukee Symphony and the orchestra of the
American Ballet Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   WITH CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Classical music seems somehow appropriate for a city that has so
much classical architecture, notably timeless houses like Belle
Meade Plantation. This is the kind of Southern mansion, in the
words of the critic Roger G. Kennedy, that seems to be ``sleeping
away the centuries, its white columns composing a kind of cage to
keep what lies within from being touched by time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage is another such house, set next to a garden ablaze
with hollyhocks and crape myrtle in high summer. Its most
impressive exterior feature is its portico, with six two-story
columns painted, then sprayed with sand to simulate stone. They are
topped with what were apparently meant to be acanthus leaves, but
no botanist would recognize them as such. Inside, the furniture,
though largely original, is outshone by the textiles and
wallpapers, especially the exceptional scenes of Telemachus on his
travels, made in Paris in 1837, which hang in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the work of William Strickland, who came to
Nashville from Philadelphia after designing the magnificent Second
Bank of the United States. Here, he produced the Downtown
Presbyterian Church (1851), perhaps the finest Egyptian Revival
building in the nation, a real Thebes on the Cumberland, and the
State Capitol (1859), finished by his son. He is buried there.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Parthenon _ Nashville's Parthenon, the only
full-size replica in the world, first built of wood and plaster in
1897, and then, 25 years later, when it had started to melt like
ice cream in the sun, replaced with a copy in brownish concrete.
Like the original, it is sometimes covered with scaffolding, but
the little museum inside is open, occupied by a Winslow Homer
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   What to say about this apparition, which John Seigenthaler, the
publisher emeritus of The Tennessean, calls ``a phenomenal
monstrosity?'' Betsey said this: ``The Elgin marbles seem to be in
place, so what's the fuss about?'' &QL;

   A sampling of attractions as well as travel information follows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where to Stay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HERMITAGE SUITE HOTEL, 231 Sixth Ave. North, (615) 244-3121.
Minnesota Fats, the legendary pool hustler, passed his last days
here, and Dinah Shore began her career here with Francis Craig's
orchestra. But the magnificent, richly marbled lobby reeked of
disinfectant when we checked in, and the dated though spacious
guest rooms had dirty windows. Keener management and a less
lackadaisical staff could work wonders at this Beaux-Arts landmark.
Double room rates: $99 to $209.
</P>
<P>
   LOEWS VANDERBILT, 2100 West End Ave., (615) 320-1700. Without
doubt the best address in a city with a chronic dearth of
first-class hotels. A sparkling travertine lobby, a plugged-in
young staff (including car parkers working their way through the
university just across the street) and a convenient location more
than compensate for the somewhat anonymous, run-of-the-mill rooms.
A Ruth's Chris Steak House on the site caters to itinerant
carnivores. Double room rates: midweek, $149 to $269; weekend, $109
to $269.
</P>
<P>
   OPRYLAND HOTEL, 2800 Opryland Dr., (615) 889-1000. This is the
capitol of the Kingdom of Schlock, a maze of 2,883 guest rooms, 15
restaurants, 27 shops, 600,000 square feet of meeting and
exhibition space, three pools and nine acres of interior gardens,
hard by the Grand Ole Opry and its adjacent outlet mall.
``Shoppertainment,'' they call it. Take your hiking boots; Yogi
Berra said he crossed three time zones between the front desk and
his room. Double room rates: room with balcony and terrace that
overlooks nine and a half acres of gardens, $245; traditional room
with view of the hotel exterior, $195.
</P>
<P>
   RENAISSANCE NASHVILLE, 611 Commerce St., (615) 255-8400. Linked
to the city's convention center and arena by covered passageways,
this is Nashville's leading convention hotel. With 673 rooms in a
shiny modern tower, it meets contemporary standards of service and
amenity, but don't look for the personal touch in a place this big.
For country-music enthusiasts, the honky-tonks of Lower Broadway
and the Ryman Auditorium are within easy walking distance. Double
room rates: weekends, $99 to $109; midweek, $149 to $169.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where to Eat  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOVELESS CAFE, 8400 Highway 100, (615) 646-0067. Local foodies
complain that tourists have taken over, and they insist that the
salty country ham is not quite as authentic as it once was. Maybe
so. But the fried chicken, scratch biscuits, sweet shoepeg corn and
red-eye gravy still have that down-home flavor, and the fabulous
peach and blackberry preserves are still made in big kettles right
on the spot. You eat it all at tables with red-checkered cloths.
</P>
<P>
   ROTIER'S, 2413 Elliston Place, (615) 327-9892. This beloved hole
in the wall near Vanderbilt University has been serving things like
buttermilk and chicken-gizzard dinners since 1945. Evelyn Rotier,
who founded it with her late husband, still comes to work three
days a week. What keeps the place full are a list of 50 beers and
the truly exceptional grilled hamburgers, served on toast.
</P>
<P>
   SASSO, 1400 Woodland St., (615) 226-7942. Corey Griffith, who
cooks in this agreeable little East Nashville hot spot, says he's
shooting for quality ``without glitter or glare.'' He does well by
salmon: salmon cakes remoulade at lunch, a fillet in a Szechuan
peanut crust at dinner. There's wit at work, too; the menu offers
``roasted airline chicken breast'' as well as ``swine-whine''
barbecue. Fish and chips come wrapped in The Tennessean, naturally.

   SUNSET GRILL, 2001 Belcourt Ave., (615) 386-3663. A lot of
music-industry executives eat at this glossy, relaxed restaurant,
with a good, mostly modestly priced wine list. Pastas, salads,
stir-fries and grills dominate the menu. You'll probably encounter
the odd bit of weirdness, like swordfish stuffed with Brie,
together with a lot of imagination, like shrimp with a brisk
roasted-cumin salsa and a boffo butterscotch-habanero bread
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   WILD BOAR, 2014 Broadway, (615) 329-1313. The atmosphere is
rather sepulchral, but there is nothing gloomy about the food. Tiny
bouchot mussels in a light curry sauce, perfectly roasted quail and
a fruit extravaganza (peach ice cream served in a tuile, alongside
delectably ripe peaches on a peach bavarois) all showed solid
craftsmanship. Seafood, from scallops to grouper, is bought from
day boats. The wine list astonished us: 15,000 bottles, from $35 to
$5,000, many of them old vintages of a sort rare in this country
(and in France).
</P>
<P>
   ZOLA, 3001 West End Ave., (615) 320-7778. Debra Paquette scores
some successes, like a stacked salad of yellow and red tomatoes,
with herbed goat cheese, avocado and a topknot of mango chutney,
which seemed a definition of good midsummer eating. I also liked
the ice cream flavored with Moroccan spices. But many of the dishes
of Greek, Turkish and Italian inspiration tasted as if every
ingredient in the souk had gone into them. Closed Sundays and at
lunchtime except for special functions.

A FESTIVAL OF ANIMATION, ANIMATEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ An army of samurai come roaring on horseback down
a medieval hillside in a driving rain, kicking up mud and water.
Several of them dismount, swords and spears spinning, and break
into a brutal ballet of combat and impalings. One of them takes an
arrow through the throat, an image lifted directly from Akira
Kurosawa's ``Throne of Blood'' and given a fresh twist in this
bleak, computer-generated landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onimusha,'' the opening movie for a video game to be used in
the soon-to-be-released Sony Play Station 2, won best-of-show
honors at the computer animation festival at this year's Siggraph
convention in the humid funk of a Louisiana July.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Siggraph brings together the leading artists,
companies, researchers, animators and visionaries from the worlds
of computer animation, virtual reality and interactive technology _
and each year, one of the highlights is a computer animation
festival featuring the best of the submissions that come in from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than 650 entries were received this year; 135 were chosen
to be part of the festival. They were shown in four screening rooms
at the New Orleans convention center, just upstairs from the vast
cacophonous trade show floor where companies like Adobe, Nvidia,
NewTek, SGI and Discreet were showing off their latest high-tech
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, at the ornate, refurbished Saenger Theater, a
two-hour ``Electronic Festival'' of the year's short-film
highlights was shown each night.
</P>
<P>
   The event is seen in the world of computer graphics as a kind of
annual assessment of the state of the art in computer-generated
special effects and computer animation _ both of which are
increasingly important in Hollywood, in video games and on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It was at such festivals over the last two decades that many
breakthroughs in computer animation were first given a public
viewing, as artists in the highly competitive field showed off for
one another with the geek equivalent of a cocky swagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significant trend this year was the advance of game
animation with a more cinematic feel,'' said Joe Takai, an animator
for Industrial Light and Magic who served as chairman of this
year's festival committee. ``Game developers are paying more
attention to story development and styles in the way that feature
films have done for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Takai said the committee was particularly impressed with the
number of foreign entries _ about 48 percent of those submitted _
as well as the unusual number of high-quality entries from
students, an indication of how a new generation of cheaper
animation software is allowing even beginners to produce pieces
good enough to compete with the the offerings of the biggest
animation companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stationen,'' from a German animator named Christian
Sawade-Meyer, was just such a piece, and it won the festival's jury
award, its second prize. In the short film, a man drags a box
filled with withering plants across an apocalyptic wasteland,
occasionally pausing to try to plant some in the arid soil only to
watch them wither and die. Eventually, he discovers a glistening
spring, but it is too late: the plants are dead.
</P>
<P>
   The top award to ``Onimusha'' also highlights the high number of
festival selections from the video gaming world. These have been
made possible by advances in photo-real animation, in
motion-capture techniques (which allow actors whose bodies are
covered with computer sensors to act out complex movements that can
later be transferred to animated characters) and by a new
generation of video game consoles like Sony's Play Station 2 and
Microsoft's X-Machine, on which the games will eventually be
played.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was here, too, of course. Industrial Light and Magic
had a short film about the computer-generated water effects it
created for ``The Perfect Storm.'' Digital Domain showed the credit
sequence from ``The Fight Club,'' which begins inside a person's
head and follows a thought as it rushes through his brain and out
his eyeball. Sony Pictures' Digital Human Project showed some bits
of the intricate computer-generated skeleton and muscle work that
made possible its forthcoming invisible-man thriller, ``The Hollow
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers, at the heart of Siggraph from the
beginning, contributed pieces that highlighted advances in the use
of virtual light and three-dimensional graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Light of Mies van der Rohe,'' Henrik Wann Jensen of
Stanford University showed the interplay of natural light over an
entire day as it splashes across a computer-generated architectural
model. In ``The Last Drawing of Canaletto,'' Cameron McNall of the
University of California at Los Angeles brings to three-dimensional
life a final sketch by the artist and takes the audience on a
virtual ride through the painting, seeing the figures from various
angles inside the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Young and relatively inexperienced animators also made an
impressive showing. In the film that probably got the festival's
biggest laughs, Robert Rioux did a version of a light-saber duel
between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from ``Star Wars'' in which
they are made of Lego blocks and in which Vader ends up berating
his son for being a slacker and needing a haircut.

UPDATE: WAGE GROWTH MODERATES, BUT DURABLE-GOODS ORDERS SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) By STEVEN
VAMES   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growth in wages and benefits for U.S. workers moderated in the
second quarter, the government said Thursday in a report that could
ease the fears of economists and Federal Reserve policy-makers that
the low unemployment rate is threatening to send employers' costs
higher and raise inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But slower growth in wages and benefits does not appear to be
cutting the spending habits of American consumers and businesses,
as evidenced by June's surge in orders for durable goods. Though
much of the increase was attributable to orders for aircraft, which
have disproportionately large price tags, demand for most
big-ticket items was higher.
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index, or ECI, a measure of overall growth
in the cost of hiring and keeping workers, rose 1 percent in the
second quarter, slower than the 1.4 percent gain in the first
quarter, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items meant to
last three or more years _ rose a sharp 10 percent to $243.16
billion in June, the biggest gain since July 1991, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. The increase followed a similarly strong
7 percent gain in May, which was upwardly revised from a earlier
estimate of 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a sharp 43 percent rise in orders for
transportation-related goods, which includes high-priced commercial
and military aircraft, durable goods orders rose 0.8 percent in
June, following May's 7.1 percent gain. Defense-related goods
orders also rose 194.1 percent in June, following a 29 percent gain
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the data provide mixed signals for Fed policy-makers
and chairman Alan Greenspan, who acknowledged in recent testimony
before Congress that the Fed's future efforts to raise interest
rates to slow economic activity and avoid inflation will largely
hinge on economic data before its next meeting on Aug. 22.
Greenspan, however, did note that some areas of the economy may be
slowing to more manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index is known to be closely watched by
Greenspan, especially since unemployment has been near historic
lows. His immediate concern is that as the labor market grows
tighter, employers will need to increase wages and benefits to
attract and keep workers, a phenomenon known as ``wage push''
inflation. Business would then need to pass those costs along in
the form of higher prices for its goods and services, leading to
broader inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Year-over-year, the ECI was up 4.4 percent in the second
quarter, vs. 3.2 percent in the year-earlier period, suggesting a
longer-term accelerating trend in wages and benefits, even though
growth slowed from earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the ECI gain for the second quarter is not another
`smoking gun' for the Fed, it nevertheless will leave the Fed
remaining wary about potential wage push inflation,'' said Maury
Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   A separate reading on labor market conditions Thursday _ Labor's
weekly report of Americans applying for first-time unemployment
benefits _ dropped by 40,000 to 272,000, suggesting continued
strength in labor markets as the third-quarter rolls along.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tame reading for the ECI could temper the Fed's
concerns over labor-driven inflation to some degree, but the higher
level of durable goods orders may continue to increase fears of
demand-driven inflation, which would come as more dollars chase a
constant amount of goods.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Greenspan noted that the demand side of the
U.S. economy had shown some signs of moderation in key areas in the
second quarter. But more recent rebounds in retail sales, home
sales and consumer confidence might already be undermining
Greenspan's vision of a significantly slower economy. Durable goods
orders have risen in seven of the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times in the
past year in an attempt to avoid inflation by making it more costly
for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend. At its most
recent meeting in June, the Fed's policy-making committee decided
to keep interest rates steady because of signs that economic
activity was starting to slow in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest employment cost index included contract-signing
bonuses, profit-sharing bonuses and other bonuses for the first
time, but did not estimate the impact of those benefits on the
index. Overall benefit costs, which account for roughly a third of
the employment cost index, rose 1.1 percent after a first-quarter
gain of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and salaries rose 1 percent, slightly lower than 1.1
percent in the first quarter. The finance, insurance and real
estate sector saw the largest cooling in wage growth, cooling to a
0.5 percent pace from 2.4 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Within the durable goods data, orders for electrical and
electronic goods rose a modest 0.3 percent, following May's sharp
27.4 percent gain. Orders for primary metals rose 1.5 percent after
a 2.6 percent gain in May. Shipments of durable goods were up 1.5
percent.

 &HT;    CRASH INVESTIGATORS DECODE CONCORDE'S 'BLACK BOXES'; MEMORIAL
SERVICE HELD FOR VICTIMS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear,
government investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes''
recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and
burst into flame as the aircraft took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction. ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in
the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond
Auffray told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed
grounded as the investigation
</P>
<P>
   progressed Thursday. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights
between New York and London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation
expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations
suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told
the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades
inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all
113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to
a medical institute in Paris for examination. Most were burned
beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by
dental records or DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in
white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the
charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of
clothing _ that might help identify the victims. ``The bodies are
terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's
impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the
regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and
German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in
central Paris to pay their respects to the victims. It is the same
church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess
Diana here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
families of many of those who died. German relatives of the
victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses
provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in
the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large
bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered
here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off
Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France
employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took
place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served
by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving
families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to
hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they
would close shop to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially
opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether
charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized

ART REVIEW: MASKS OFFER AN EXOTIC TASTE OF MONGOLIAN MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mongolia, the land of Genghis Khan, windswept steppes
and tough ponies, is seldom associated with religious art. Yet such
art always thrived there, in the form of gilded Buddhist icons and
in the expressive images of a native shamanism.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of that work has vanished. Buddhism worked
hard for centuries to put shamanism out of business, and to a large
degree succeeded. In the 1930s, Stalinist purges destroyed
practically all of the Buddhist monasteries _ more than 700 _ along
with everything in them.
</P>
<P>
   Some precious objects were hidden away and have since reappeared
in the national museum collections of an independent Mongolia. And
in 1995, a remarkable cache of this material visited the United
States in an exhibition that was put together by the Asian Art
Museum in San Francisco and traveled to the Denver Art Museum and
the National Geographic Society in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The installation in Washington, in a choppy string of lobby
galleries, was something of a bust. But much of the art, sacred and
secular and mostly dating from the late 19th and 20th centuries,
was spectacular. And nothing made a stronger impression than a
handful of sculptural masks, larger than life, vividly painted and
made to be worn in epic-scale religious dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the outstanding masks from that show, along with others
visiting America for the first time, are at Asia House in ``Dancing
Demons: Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia,'' an exhibition that is
itself a slice of a larger Mongolian survey organized by the art
historian Jan Fontein at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Asia Society in temporary quarters these days _ its main
plant, farther north on Park Avenue, is under renovation _ its
gallery space is tight, and Fontein had to edit his original show
down. No harm done. The result is a usefully focused look at one
aspect of a complex hybrid culture in which Buddhism and shamanism
alternately duked it out and worked together.
</P>
<P>
   Asian shamanism remains little studied in the West, particularly
in exhibitions. But in Mongolia, as in Tibet, it was the primary
religion of a nomadic people who viewed the natural world as a
cosmic mechanism of checks and balances, controlled by ancestral
spirits, sensitive to disturbance, always threatening to tip toward
disaster. By means of ritual implements and trance-induced visions,
shamans intervened in crises and appealed to the powers that be for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   If shamanism was a grass-roots religion, Buddhism was a movable
feast. Wherever it touched down outside its birthplace in India, it
was an import item, a foreign body that aroused suspicion as well
as devotion. Perhaps for this reason it learned to be diplomatic
about making its presence felt. Rather than replace local religious
traditions outright, it borrowed from them, then gradually absorbed
them in a passive-aggressive mix of preservation and suppression.
</P>
<P>
   But traditions are traditions for a reason. They're tenacious
and resilient, and even when paved over, they keep pushing up,
blending into the new order here, standing out from it there. And
that is the organic story _ it's the ABC of cultural history _ told
in the objects at Asia Society.
</P>
<P>
   True, some of those objects seem, at least at a glance,
religiously specific, like the 19th-century shaman costumes on loan
from the National Museum of Mongolian History or items made for a
New Year celebration honoring the Buddha of the future, Maitreya.
For that occasion, a statue of Maitreya was displayed on a wooden
chariot to which the head of a magical green horse was attached.
Such a head, a velvet-covered wood carving attributed to the
artist-monk Damdinsuren (1868-1938), is in the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the horse was an emblem important to Buddhism and shamanism
alike. And both religions were thoroughly intertwined in another
grand monastic festival known as the Tsam. A combination of
morality play, circus, shoot-em-up action film and public exorcism,
it involved an eclectic cast of symbolic characters, with the god
of death _ the Buddhist Yama, the shamanist Erlik Khan _ in the
starring role.
</P>
<P>
   The event was staged in a mandala pattern. The outdoor playing
area was divided into a series of concentric circles, at the center
of which stood a doll-like form molded from a lump of fast-rising
dough. Throughout the long performance, characters attacked the
doll with knives, and its yeasty form slowly swelled as if
poisoned. (Symbolically, it was absorbing evil, including sins of
the community.) In the end, it was hacked to pieces and burned,
leaving the path to collective enlightenment clear.
</P>
<P>
   All of the roles in the pageant were acted by monks wearing
elaborate masks of the kind seen at Asia Society. A pair of
skeletal figures called Citipati, with sources in the Tibetan
Buddhist tradition, opened the proceedings with a shivery flourish.
They were followed by the pudgy, grinning Kashin Kahn and his eight
sons, characters with complicated links to Chinese Buddhism, who
served as both orchestra and receiving line, greeting new players
as they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Shamanist figures joined the festivities at various points. Some
were powerfully exotic: a mask of the Hindu deity Garuda, a horned
bird carrying a cotton serpent in its beak, embodied the spirit of
a revered holy man from the past who had ``converted'' to Buddhism.
The main shaman character, however, named the White Old Man, was a
burlesque, a doddering, bearded buffoon. Intended to provide comic
relief, he was relegated to the fringes of the central activity.
But, significantly, he was an audience favorite.
</P>
<P>
   As in many dramas, the villains were the most dynamic figures of
all, and although Yama/Erlik Khan is not directly represented in
the exhibition, several of his frightful henchmen are, among them
the ghoulish Citipati and a dancing deer with a lolling red velvet
tongue. Also on hand are snarling, bug-eyed characters known as
dharmapalas, or protectors of the Buddhist law. Indebted, like so
much Mongolian art, to Tibetan prototypes, they look demonic but
are actually agents of divine protection, meant to scare evil away.
</P>
<P>
   The show is fleshed out with interesting smaller items. One, a
brocade ritual apron stitched with the face of the Buddhist god
Mahakala, represents a kind of pictorial applique at which
Mongolian artists excelled. Another is a two-stringed violin, its
slender neck ending with green-painted horse heads, which was
designed to accompany recitations of heroic Mongolian tales passed
on through oral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition catalog _ a more modest effort by far, at least
in its English version, than the one produced by the Asian Art
Museum _ suggests that such recitations are still occasionally
performed. And apparently, the grand festivals are being revived,
and art surviving in museums and monasteries is being restored.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly be good to see more of this work, including
the glorious sculptures of the renowned artist-lama Zanabazar
(1635-1723), in New York, where enthusiasm for things Buddhist runs
high and cultural hybridity is well understood. Perhaps ``Dancing
Demons'' will inspire one of the big museums to get into the
festive groove.
</P>
<P>
   (``Dancing Demons: Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia'' remains at
Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Ave. (at 59th Street), through
Sept. 17).

JENNIFER LOPEZ STEPS INTO `THE CELL'

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Jennifer
Lopez in a scene from ``The Cell.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``The Cell'' is a film like no other.
 &HT;    Gorgeous and disturbing in its imagery, brutal yet ultimately
hopeful in its storytelling, it will surely revolt as many people
as it entertains.
 &HT;    And make no mistake, ``The Cell'' is an A-list, mainstream
production starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent
D'Onofrio, directed by video auteur Tarsem and set for wide release
on Aug. 18 by New Line Cinema.
 &HT;    ``It is all those things,'' says Lopez, the freshly minted
Latina superstar. ``There were times when I said, `This is really
out there,' but when I choose a role or a film I don't think about
whether or not it will piss people off. If it's a story I feel I
want to tell or a character I can relate to, I just go with that.
 &HT;    ```The Cell' was in development for years,'' she says. ``When I
went to New Line for a meeting with Mike DeLuca, that was on the
roster. I remembered it from years ago, when nobody would make a
movie with me.
 &HT;    ``When I saw it on their list of projects they owned, I was
like, `Oh wow, I'd love to do this,''' Lopez recalls. ``Mike said,
`Fine, let's just get a director.' That was it. It was great.''
 &HT;    The film's story involves Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a
deeply disturbed serial killer who lapses into a coma soon after
imprisoning his latest victim in a hidden cell rigged first to
torment her and then, within two days, to kill her. On the case and
at his wits' end, FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is open to
anything.
 &HT;    Anything takes the form of Catherine Deane (Lopez), a
psychologist working on a radical, chemically and electrically
stimulated therapy that enables her to link her mind to a patient's
and probe that person's dreams, fears and desires. Though skittish,
Deane accepts the challenge of entering Stargher's demented mind in
an effort to confront him and uncover the location of the imperiled
victim.
 &HT;    Deane and eventually Novak take the plunge and stumble into a
maelstrom of unbridled ego, repressed rage, childhood innocence,
gruesome torture and sick sexual fantasy, not to mention outlandish
outfits, masks and furnishings. It's a harrowing world from which
they may never escape, even if they do get out alive.
 &HT;    ``The whole dream world gave me so much room to be creative, to
go wherever as an actress,'' Lopez says by telephone from a New
York recording studio, where she's working on her next dance-music
album, due out in October. ``The costumes were (Oscar-winning
Japanese designer) Eiko Ishioka's, the sets were Tarsem's vision
and I just brought to it my aspect, which is the realness of the
character, who's this woman trying to save a little boy in a coma
and also the woman who is missing.
 &HT;    ``I tried to focus on my acting, on the character, and all this
other stuff was going on,'' she says. ``I definitely thought, `Oh
my God, I hope this works.' I had that thought every once in a
while. I was standing there in this long, white outfit with a red
scarf, like I was in a Ti-D-Bowl commercial _ but on film it looks
incredible.''
 &HT;    Lopez admits that sci-fi and horror films aren't exactly her cup
of tea _ never were and never will be. The initial concept of ``The
Cell'' called for it to be far less of a genre piece than it turned
out to be, she says.
 &HT;    ``Tarsem really brought that aspect to it,'' says Lopez, who's
due next in the comedy ``The Wedding Planner'' and the romantic
drama ``Angel Eyes.'' ``The script was really more about trying to
get into the mind of a serial killer.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know it would take that surrealistic, sci-fi type of
approach,'' she says. ``It originally didn't have that flavor in
the script. That was something that was totally Tarsem's idea and
vision and creativity.''
 &HT;    Not that she's complaining, of course.
 &HT;    ``I think it was an incredible way to go,'' Lopez says. ```The
Cell' is different. It's new. It looks great. It's wonderful.''

`THE WIND WILL CARRY US':   A MASTERLY FILM FROM IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of ``Taste of Cherry,'' the Iranian director Abbas
Kiarostami's lavishly acclaimed 1997 film, an elderly taxidermist
delivers a wise and rueful soliloquy on the value of life, a
sympathetic critique of the main character's suicidal despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wind Will Carry Us,'' Kiarostami's new movie, ends on a
similar note. A grizzled old doctor lectures the protagonist, a
saturnine engineer a long way from home, about the glory of
creation and the human obligation to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observing nature is better than playing backgammon or doing
nothing,'' the doctor muses. Developing the thought, he defines
death as what happens when ``you close your eyes on the beauty of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, there is perhaps no living filmmaker as
fully alive as Kiarostami. His eyes _ and therefore ours _ are
perpetually open. His absorption in the wide emptiness of the rural
Iranian landscape, in a remote corner of which ``The Wind Will
Carry Us'' takes place, yields views _ hillsides, valleys and
gnarled, solitary trees _ that seem almost otherworldly in their
clarity and depth. And his plots, which tend to unfold almost
entirely outdoors because of his own aesthetic priorities and the
restrictions on what Iranian films can show, seem to spring from
the air and the ground, like those of folk tales or Chekhov
stories.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to expound on the spiritual and moral
importance of opening oneself to experience _ ``prefer the
present,'' the doctor says, offering a Farsi version of an
injunction familiar to readers of Western New Age self-help
literature _ but it is a rare artist who can prove it. You don't
watch ``The Wind Will Carry Us'' so much as dwell in it. The film
lasts about two hours, and the events it depicts occur over a span
of a week or so, but the film has a density, an almost physical
presence, that cancels time. Its effects seem more like those of a
poem or a piece of music than a movie.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a movie, and, like Kiarostami's earlier films, it
tells a story at once perfectly simple and confoundingly oblique. A
team of engineers, only one of whom ever appears on screen, has
come from Tehran to the tiny Kurdish village of Siah Dareh, which
is set pueblo-style into a steep mountainside so that, a local boy
explains, ``nobody will steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders seem to be waiting for an old woman to die, so
that they can witness the local mourning ceremony. But it's not
entirely clear; this may be just the secret preoccupation of their
team leader (Behzad Dourani), whose interactions with the villagers
make up most of the action. He befriends a young boy and a local
ditch digger, as well as the keeper of a tea shop (``I've never
seen a woman serve tea before,'' he remarks), and the woman who
does her laundry on the terrace across from his.
</P>
<P>
   His exchanges with these people are frequently interrupted by
his cell phone. To receive a clear signal, he must race from the
balcony to his jeep and drive out of the village in search of
higher ground, where he conducts impatient negotiations with the
home office back in Tehran, pleading with his supervisors to extend
his crew's enigmatic mission. These phone calls, and the cryptic,
formal conversations they interrupt, take on an almost ritualistic
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer's dealings with the townspeople _ mostly women, all
played by actual residents of Siah Dareh _ are unfailingly
decorous, but they resonate with a rich sense of implication,
almost of danger. One scene, in which the engineer follows a young
woman into a darkened cellar to fetch some fresh milk, expresses an
unsettling sensuality, a feeling of taboos being tested, even
across the cultural gulf that separates American film audiences
from their Iranian counterparts. Somehow the movie, steeped in the
details of its locale, transcends exoticism.
</P>
<P>
   If you are already an admirer of Kiarostami, ``The Wind Will
Carry Us'' will confirm what you already know. But if you haven't
yet encountered the work of a man many believe to be one of the
giants of contemporary cinema, this movie is a good place to start.
It's the funniest and most accessible of his films that I've seen,
and maybe the most visually arresting.

MURPHY DELIVERS IN GROSS-OUT FILM

   In ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' he plays not just the
300-pound Sherman Klump and his sleek alter ego Buddy Love but the
character's father (in two stages of his life), mother, grandmother
and two other significant roles.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike ``Nutty I,'' the extended family members are not just
brief cameos but full-blown performances. As the movie's subtitle
indicates, the focus is less on the split personality of the title
character and more on the elder Klumps. Murphy spends 90 percent of
the running time buried under Rick Baker's Oscar-worthy makeup
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Murphy is remarkably convincing _ even endearing _ as
each of the characters. His Sherman Klump is not just Murphy in a
fat suit but a touching, finely drawn characterization. His Granny
Klump is not just Murphy in drag but an extraordinary piece of
acting. It's a tour de force (and, to be sure, a tour de ego).
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the movie itself is a scattered mess that really
doesn't add up to anything that's particularly satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   There's also something galling about the fact that it reportedly
cost $90 million _ making it the highest-budget comedy ever _ and
yet it aims so mind-bogglingly low.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' and ``Scary
Movie,'' it also seems to be part of a disturbing new Hollywood
trend this summer to outdo the competition by plumbing the absolute
depths of gross-out comedy. It's undeniably funny in spots, but it
has the sensibility of a dirty-minded eighth-grader and the soul of
a whoopee cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The story finds the professor in love with an academic colleague
(Janet Jackson), in possession of a fountain-of-youth formula and
worried about recent intrusions by his suppressed alter ego, Buddy.
Complications ensue when one of the lab experiments goes awry, and
Buddy finds a way to come to life independent of Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   But the struggle of Sherman and Buddy _ mostly over the formula
that's worth $150 million to one company _ is this time only a slim
pretext, and the film is actually more about Sherman's stumbling
efforts to get married, the dysfunctional sex life of his parents
and the romantic aspirations of his 80-year-old Granny.
</P>
<P>
   The gags are basically just more of the same of what we got in
the 1996 first installment, except that the concentration of the
humor is less on cruel fat jokes and more on geriatric sex _ which,
in the adolescent mentality of the script, is viewed as being so
unnatural and repulsive that when Granny comes on to Buddy Love, he
has no recourse but to run to the bushes and throw up.
</P>
<P>
   Part II also outdoes Part I in flatulence jokes (quite a feat,
since Leonard Maltin's review of the original claims it has
``enough flatulence jokes to last 10 lifetimes''). Here we get
Sherman in a ``2001''-like dream sequence flatulating ``The Blue
Danube'' waltz, and Father Klump half destroying a buffet
restaurant with one deadly explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty II's'' biggest gag, however, involves a laboratory
hamster that suddenly takes on the proportions of the Monster Who
Devoured Cleveland, then devastates a press conference with his
excrement and sodomizes the heavy (Larry Miller). Murphy's films
are often criticized for being unoriginal, but that's a sequence we
definitely haven't seen before.

&HT;     JUDGE CLEARS WAY FOR REPORTERS TO WATCH EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Criticizing state prison officials for trying to
limit press access to executions, a federal judge says reporters
must be allowed to watch the entire lethal injection process, from
the time the shackled prisoner is led into the chamber until death
is pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyewitness testimony is crucial to the public's evaluation of
how this extreme punishment is performed,'' U.S. District Judge
Vaughn Walker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His ruling restored and broadened the unprecedented order he
issued in 1996, requiring the San Quentin warden to lift the
curtain that had shielded the early stages of the execution process
from reporters and other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That order was in effect for only one execution before it was
set aside by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said
Walker had given too much weight to the media's access rights and
not enough to the safety of prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allowed prison officials to close the viewing area
until after the prisoner had been strapped to the gurney, needles
and tubes had been inserted, and all guards had left the chamber.
Reporters had to rely on official descriptions of events while the
curtain was closed.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court said Walker could consider another claim
by news organizations that filed the lawsuit: that the restrictions
were an exaggerated response to the prison's security concerns. The
judge agreed with that claim Wednesday, citing evidence from a
two-day non-jury trial in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of executions in California, none of the guards
who volunteer for the execution team has ever been identified by
news reports or suffered retaliation or threats by prisoners,
Walker said. He said there was no evidence of any such incidents in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said guards could wear surgical masks to conceal
their identities. And he said the state's current restrictions
appeared to have been prompted in part by public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were ``motivated, at least in part, by a concern that
the strapping of a condemned inmate, the injection of intravenous
lines or other aspects of a lethal injection execution would be
perceived as brutal by the public,'' a consideration that is
separate from ``legitimate concerns for prison personnel safety,''
Walker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a memo from Arthur Calderon, the warden of San Quentin
when the restrictions were drafted, in which he said that witnesses
might draw the wrong conclusions if guards were seen subduing a
prisoner who resisted while being strapped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we are perceived as using only the
minimal amount of force necessary to accomplish the task,''
Calderon wrote. He said using a great deal of force ``would most
certainly be misinterpreted by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials ``have a history of resistance to media
presence at executions,'' Walker said, and tried in the mid-1990s
to stop reporters from taking pencils and paper to the viewing
chamber. Those efforts run contrary to the historic right of the
public and press to have access to executions, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The last prisoner executed in California was Darrell Rich, a
convicted serial killer who was put to death by injection in March.
No executions are scheduled for the rest of this year.

   BASEBALL TOUR VISITS ALL 30 MAJOR LEAGUE STADIUMS IN 32 DAYS
</P>
<P>
   By HARRY SHATTUCK
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   I've managed some creative trip scheduling over the years, but
probably my wackiest idea _ and proudest accomplishment from an
endurance standpoint _ was visiting 26 baseball spring training
camps.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 days.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm being trumped. By a school librarian, two college
freshmen-to-be, a grandmother-grandson tandem, a retired petroleum
engineer, a video-store owner and _ gulp! _ a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a ``Millennium Tour'' organized by
Massachusetts-based Sports Travel, these eight individuals and a
coordinator/escort are in undertaking a cross-continent adventure
that is taking them to regular-season games at 30 stadiums in 32
days. Plus a closing stop at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I had it easy. The major leagues have added four teams since my
mid-'80s odyssey. And spring camps are limited to Florida and
Arizona; these warriors are visiting 17 states and two Canadian
provinces _ traveling by airplane (13 flights), bus, train, van and
taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend was a doozy. The Sports Travel team _ a designation
participants proudly accept _ spent Friday night at the Coliseum in
Oakland, Calif., Saturday afternoon at Seattle's Safeco Field and
Sunday afternoon at Houston's Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   And the airlines lost only one suitcase en route.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about dedication: Following overnight flights, the team
arrived at Bush Intercontinental Airport Sunday at 9:30 a.m. and
proceeded to the stadium to watch batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were treated royally,'' says Floridian Red McGarry, a
former executive with 3M and Polaroid who is coordinating this
marathon _ and adding to the 16 parks he'd already visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astros invited us onto the field for batting practice,''
McGarry says. ``And they upgraded our seats so that we watched the
game from the front row of the club level just behind the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie London, a teacher and librarian for 28 years in the
Milwaukee public school system, even got to chat with one of her
favorite players _ Astros infielder Bill Spiers, who previously
toiled with the Brewers in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   London, a baseball loyalist since age 4, won't admit to being a
hitting coach, but Spiers followed with two home runs, including a
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Travel Industry Association of America
found that 75.3 million U.S. adults have traveled 50 or more miles
to attend or watch a sports event over the past five years.
Participants on this tour come from diverse backgrounds and
geographical locations but possess two common bonds: a love of
baseball and a thirst for travel.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Troy and Michael Tomsky, both 18, have been best buddies
for 10 years in Stamford, Conn. They will attend different
universities, and this excursion _ high school graduation presents
_ is an opportunity to spend one last month together.
</P>
<P>
   Marcella Early, from Louisville, Ky., relishes any chance to
travel with 14-year-old grandson Scott. Visiting every baseball
stadium is her lifelong dream, and Scott already is an avid
memorabilia collector.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Short, 39, who hails from New Athens, Ill., says that he,
too, has ``fantasized about this kind of trip. I especially enjoy
seeing the contrast between the older and younger parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Westgate, 53, lives in Irving, Texas. During the '70s, he
traveled to every stadium then in existence. But that journey took
four years, not 32 days.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hook, a 30-year-old accountant, is the most unlikely
participant, having been raised in England's ``Forest of Dean,'' a
hotbed of rugby near the Welsh border.
</P>
<P>
   Hook got hooked on baseball in the early '90s. He religiously
tapes live telecasts from the United States (shown twice weekly in
the middle of the night in England), collects videocassettes of
historic games and has participated in three shorter Sports Travel
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Hook admits that his rugby-oriented chums don't share his
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends understand five weeks in America,'' he says. ``They
don't understand five weeks of baseball. They don't understand one
day of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me, `Why don't you go see the Grand Canyon
instead?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing isn't included in the tour price ($5,995 per person,
double occupancy; $7,662 single, covering game tickets,
transportation and escort but not meals), but during Week 1 some
team members visited Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., San Francisco's
Fisherman's Wharf and Seattle's Pike Place Market. Two nights each
in Chicago and New York loom promising, and the schedule may allow
a stop in Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Most spare time, though, is reserved for sleeping, eating and
frequenting hotels' self-service laundries.
</P>
<P>
   And for evaluations. Participants use a 1-to-5 point system to
grade each park on 18 criteria _ friendliness, safety, acoustics,
seat comfort and view, restroom cleanliness, food quality and
merchandise pricing among them.
</P>
<P>
   Early results haven't been tabulated, but those surveyed rank
Enron Field at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   As for San Francisco's new Pacific Bell Park?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm collecting postcards at every stadium,'' Hook says. ``A
postcard at Pac Bell costs $2; at Enron it's 35 cents. And it's a
nicer postcard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hook also is collecting T-shirts while fellow travelers save
programs and ticket stubs and purchase pins and other souvenirs.
``Several teams have given us goody bags,'' McGarry says, ``and the
Astros gave us Enron Field inaugural game programs, which was
especially nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make frequent trips to post offices to ship things home,''
McGarry says.
</P>
<P>
   Successful completion of the journey brings a coveted reward:
induction into Sports Travel's Stadium Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Travel plans a similar tour for next year and offers
shorter packages for baseball and other sports (with prices
starting at $500 per person). Customized tours can be arranged.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne
</P>
<P>
   and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a
cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike White,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weitz and Lupe Ontiveros.
</P>
<P>
   Goes from whimsical to wince-inducing early on and never
recovers. Written by and starring Mike White as an emotionally
arrested 27-year-old, the movie starts off as an off-kilter
character study. With its wry tone and candy-pop soundtrack, it's
like something by Todd Solondz (``Happiness''). Then it becomes
insufferable. (SM) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, direc the natural world. (SM) 1 hour, 30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for wrtiting inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)

<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,

<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's The Kid'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Spencer Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis may grow tired of being upstaged by children. Haley
Joel Osment ran off with last year's ``The Sixth Sense,'' and this
time, 8-year-old Spencer Breslin steals what little thunder there
is to rumble about in this sickly sweet film. Willis plays a loner
who magically meets his embarrassing child self, Rusty (Breslin).
(David Germain, Associated Press) 1 hour, 44 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanite'' Unrated (there is implied
</P>
<P>
   violence and explicit sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emmanuel Schotte
</P>
<P>
   and Severine Caneele. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   A multiple prize-winner at Cannes last year, Bruno Dumont's
relentless and demanding film may be the most melancholy movie
you'll see all year. Ostensibly, it's about a sad-sack cop
(Emmanuel Schotte) investigating the rape-murder of a young girl in
a small French village. It's a maddening near-masterwork, the sort
of thing Beckett might've written on a moody day. (ERG) 2 hours, 28
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The In Crowd'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Ward,
</P>
<P>
   Lori Heuring and Matthew Settle.
</P>
<P>
   A community theater mix of ``Rebecca'' and ``Caddyshack.'' At a
country club, young women with deep, dark secrets populate a plot
that builds to a final cat fight that has to take place in a
setting with as many lethal implements as a hardware store. (Elvis
Mitchell, New York Times) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' R (profanity, sexual and
</P>
<P>
   drug content, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book of Denis Johnson's vivid short stories that it's
based on, the movie mirrors its protagonist's sense of dislocation
as it woozily tours a few years in the life of a boozing,
pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup). The film is like
``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played out on the
suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs
</P>
<P>
   and Mena Suvari.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a bore. Jason Biggs is Paul, a scholarship student
fresh from a small Midwestern town who arrives in New York City
with full-blown naivete. He meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a bright,
Gothic-styled American beauty who's sleeping with the college's
uppity, self-absorbed English lit professor (Greg Kinnear). Paul
and Dora getting together is no surprise, but it takes an eternity
to happen. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking e 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of
violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II:
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie M(``Mephisto'') examines the first
half of the 20th century through the painful prism of three
generations of a Jewish family in Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the
central male in each passage along with a fine supporting cast.
(ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone over 6 or who isn't
already a fan of the successful British TV series, this could be
subtitled ``The Little Engine That Couldn't.'' Things start to go
wrong in a magical land where talking trains are menaced by a
bullying diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin).
It's not total a wreck, but avoid being railroaded into sitting
through it unless there's no choice. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Murphy large, but not in charge
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid).
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Professor'' put a delirious spin on the Jerry Lewis
original, transforming Sherman from a nerd to a lovably obese
sweetheart whose genetic formula unleashed his thinner, meaner id,
Buddy Love, as he tried to win his lab assistant's heart. She was
played by Jada Pinkett. This time Janet Jackson is the romantic
interest, a fellow scientist who has nothing to do but be lovely;
she's wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Sherman gets rid of Buddy _ who has a habit of popping out
of him at awkward moments _ by extracting the rogue's DNA from his
own. Naturally, Buddy manages to regenerate in the flesh, with the
help of some dog DNA. This nonsensical science is a pretty good
indication of the script as a whole. It's slapdash and episodic,
and hard to care about.
</P>
<P>
   Director Peter Segal and the handful of screenwriters involved
should have just ditched it and found a way to focus entirely on
the family, once again the movie's real comic glory.
</P>
<P>
   Submerged in Rick Baker's amazing fat suits and makeup, and
aided by terrific visual tricks that let him share the screen with
himselves, Murphy continues to be jaw-droppingly funny as Sherman's
parents, brother and grandmother. The crotchety and oversexed
granny steals the movie, especially when the arrival of the
unsuspecting Buddy Love gets her libido burning.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the movie flips back to the piecemeal plot about
Sherman and Buddy's battle to sell a youth serum to the highest
corporate bidder, it loses steam.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's moments of splendor deserve a screenplay that's as good
as he is. Maybe a sharper script is too much to ask for these days,
when comedies are becoming just a series of comic set pieces and
gross-out scenes, barely held together by a plot. ``Nutty II''
follows that pattern: bad movie, hilarious bits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time, the Klumps will leave Sherman at the lab, and
go visit their cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II:
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. Rated PG-13 for crude
humor and sex-related material. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not nutty enough.

 &HT;    Satire stumbles when teens hit rehab
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' is a cheerful but, alas, toothless
satire of homophobia and rehab programs. The potential for some
very funny stuff is evident, but after a promising start, the
picture sinks into overdone farce.
</P>
<P>
   Our protagonist, Megan (Natasha Lyonne), would appear to be a
paradigm of all-American teendom. She's a cheerleader. She has long
blond hair. She dates a football player. Still, something's not
quite right. Maybe it's the way her boyfriend's French kisses leave
her cold. Maybe it's the Melissa Etheridge poster in her bedroom.
Maybe it's that her parents are played by John Waters' workhorse
Mink Stole and Bud Cort, forever identified with the cult classic
``Harold and Maude.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, her family and friends stage an intervention and ship
her off to True Directions, a rehab center for wayward homosexuals
where the patients are rigorously indoctrinated in the straight and
narrow path of the ``happy heterosexual.'' That means everything
from chopping wood (male) to vacuuming (female).
</P>
<P>
   At first Megan is horrified _ not so much by True Directions'
insane five-step program as by the mere suggestion that she could
be (gasp) a lesbian. Then she begins to have certain feelings for
fellow inmate Graham (played by ``Girl, Interrupted's'' Clea
DuVall, who seems to have studied Oscar winner Angelina Jolie very
closely).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best moments are provided by RuPaul as a True
Directions counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and wears a
T-shirt that reads ``Straight Is Great.'' Some of the worst,
however, come from Cathy Moriarity, whose heavy-handed performance
as the center's uptight director pretty much sums up what's wrong
with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Jamie Babbit never ventures into truly risky
territory. Rather, she settles for sophomoric jokes that soon
become as laboriously obvious as the Almodovar-inspired palette of
bright blues, pinks and oranges that saturate every frame. After
all, watching limp-wristed boys try to catch a football isn't
exactly cutting-edge humor.
</P>
<P>
   That places like True Directions actually exist gives the movie
some legitimacy. However, ``Cheerleader'' flubs nearly every
opportunity to cut loose and really dish out some knowing,
provocative nastiness. Ultimately, we get two things out of the
film: RuPaul's last name (it's Charles) and the near-certainty that
the kisses between Lyonne and DuVall will probably be on the short
list at next year's MTV Movie Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall. Directed by Jamie
Babbit. Rated R for profanity and sexual themes. At Lefont Plaza. 1
hour, 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A disappointingly lame lampoon.

   NAPSTER _ SAN DIEGO _ Industry leaders and observers said
Thursday that a federal judge's injunction that would shut down
Napster significantly increases the chances of government
regulation of the online music industry. Surprisingly, some say
they welcome regulatory intervention. In any case, the court ruling
is little more than a temporary setback in the online entertainment
world, they say. And don't count Napster out of it just yet.
Company attorneys, backed by some of the heaviest hitters in
Silicon Valley, were preparing an appeal Thursday and are showing
no signs of turning down the noise in their camp anytime soon.

   NAPSTER-SIDE _ In the wake of the Napster meltdown, where are
fans going to get their downloads? What alternatives exist and how
busy are they today _ and how busy is Napster for that matter? What
are fans saying, doing as the court deadline looms? (Fernandez,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)STEVENS _ As expected, WestPoint
Stevens said earnings were hurt by a large restructuring charge.
The West Point sheet and towel maker reported a second-quarter loss
of $89.8 million, or $1.81 a share, compared with a profit of $19.6
million, or 34 cents a share, in the prior period. The results
included a one-time pretax charge of $168.2 million. (Bond, Atlanta

   UTILITY-BIAS _ Lawyers file a major class action lawsuit against
Georgia Power Co. and the parent Southern Co. alleging racial
discrimination against 2,100 employees. The lawsuit , filed by the
same law firm that represented plaintiffs in the Coca-Cola case,
alleges an ``extraordinarily hostile racial environment'' at the
utility. Georgia Power's president is addressing employees this
afternoon to issue a defense against the charges. (Quinn, Atlanta

   MARKETS _ The outlook for profits has suddenly dimmed, thanks to
the Federal Reserve's year-long series of interest rate hikes. Most
economists now think the usual second-half rebound will not occur
this year, and analysts are worried that 3rd and 4th quarter profit
growth will slow. This casts a cloud over the outlook for the stock
market. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EARTHLINK _ EarthLink Inc. on Thursday reported booming
revenues, a shrinking loss and strong customer growth as it
continued its pursuit of America Online. In reporting its second
quarter earnings, the company also acknowledged some service
problems during the earlier part of the year _ blaming them largely
on the awkardness of merging EarthLink and MindSpring. The company
also promised more acquisitions as it grows. (Kanell, Atlanta

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Miller seated in senate
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller was sworn in today to
temporarily fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of
Republican Paul Coverdell. The popular Miller, a two-term governor
of Georgia, will run in a November special election to fill the
four remaining years of Coverdell's term, giving Democrats high
hope of snatching the Senate majority from Republicans. Miller
thanked senators for their tributes to Coverdell in the past week
and added his own voice to the chorus of praise. ``Paul Coverdell
had a powerful faith in bipartisan progress,'' Miller said, ``and I
intend to keep that faith.'' Miller was sworn in by Senate
President Pro Tem Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.

   CHENEY, IN DEFENSE OF HIS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, newly picked this week to be George W. Bush's
running mate, defended his conservative record in interviews on
three network morning TV programs today. On CBS' ``Early Show'': He
voted against the Equal Rights Amendment as a congressman because
he feared it would require the drafting of women into the military.
On ABC's ``Good Morning America'': He was one of only four
lawmakers voting against banning plastic guns and armor-piercing
``cop-killer'' bullets because he's ``a great believer in ... the
right of the citizens to keep and bear arms.'' And on NBC's
``Today'': His vote not to impose economic sanctions against the
segregationist government of South Africa did not mean he opposed
freeing the imprisoned Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S THAT DRAFT QUESTION AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Nominated to be secretary of defense in 1989, Dick Cheney came
under close questioning about how he had managed to avoid the draft
and Vietnam. The issue is likely to arise again now that he's
George W. Bush's running mate. But while George W. Bush, Bill
Clinton and Dan Quayle _ vice president under Bush's father _ all
have had to answer suggestions that they pulled strings to avoid
the draft, there's not been any such suggestion about Cheney. His
father, local administrator for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service,
hardly had major political influence. ``He was not very well known
at that time,'' said Joe Meyer, who roomed with Cheney in college
and now is Wyoming's secretary of state. Meyer said Vietnam ``was
not a subject on our mind'' at the time.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT TIME TO GET AWAY
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican Party set to open its national convention in
a few days, Al Gore has veered away from the campaign trail to
``clear his head'' with a family vacation before launching a blitz
taking him into his own Democratic convention. The Gore clan was at
the family home in Tennessee before heading later today to the
North Carolina seashore for some sun and relaxation. Aides wouldn't
rule out an occasional political discussion or phone call, but made
it clear that this was not intended to be a working vacation.
</P>
<P>
   LOW PROFILE, BUT WATCHING
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, as well, intends to keep a low profile while
the Republican Party holds its convention next week. Clinton is to
attend Democratic fund-raisers in Florida on Monday, but otherwise
will have ``a pretty low-key week,'' said White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart. That's in keeping with the tradition to
avoid the spotlight while the opposing party nominates its
presidential candidate. Lockhart, however, said Clinton might be
available to comment on some aspects of the GOP gathering ``if they
do something really dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE LIKES CHENEY CHOICE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Despite the teasing pleas of a Chicago radio show host, Al Gore
wouldn't reveal whom he'll choose as his running mate. Not just
yet, Gore said. But then he added, with obvious pleasure, an
unsolicited reminder. ``Dick Cheney has been selected on the
Republican side,'' he said, his smile growing. In the days since
the Cheney announcement, Gore's campaign has publicly rejoiced. And
there's also a quieter, more private celebration going on at Gore's
Nashville headquarters, where the Cheney selection brings a level
of freedom to Gore's own high-pressure search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T FORGET, HIS INITIALS ARE JFK
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry has kept mum about his
prospects of becoming Al Gore's running mate, but the Gore campaign
has asked Kerry for his tax records, according to the Washington
Times, a new signals that Kerry has moved up the shrinking list of
names in running. Others still prominently mentioned as possibles
are ex-Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida,
Tom Harkin of Iowa and Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   GULF WAR WAS GOOD TRAINING
</P>
<P>
   Four years after helping to win the Persian Gulf War and
liberating the oil fields of Kuwait, Dick Cheney went from fighting
for oil to running a Dallas-based outfit that he's helped transform
into the world's largest oil field services company. As chairman
and CEO of Halliburton since 1995, Cheney has been able to rely
heavily on the high-level contacts in the Middle East he made as
secretary of defense to win business in the roughneck world of
international oil. Much of Halliburton's business is done with Arab
governments, and almost 70 percent of the company's nearly $15
billion in annual sales come from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   PARTING WORDS FOR HALLIBURTON
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, who is resigning as chairman and CEO of Halliburton
Co. to join the Republican ticket, told shareholders and industry
analysts that his decision to leave the oil services company was
not an easy one. ``I did not seek the job that was proffered to me.
But I concluded after the governor talked to me a number of times I
did have an obligation to return to public service if in fact I was
asked. That's obviously what has transpired,'' Cheney said. He
added that he'll be watching the company very closely since he's a
major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO FALL IN AND MARCH IN STEP
</P>
<P>
   Offering closure to a bitter primary fight, John McCain is
preparing a prime-time convention speech in which he praises George
W. Bush and declares ``it is my time to serve'' his former rival.
In a draft of his speech being reviewed by convention planners and
Bush advisers, McCain calls for ``government reform'' in general,
but avoids direct mention of his bid to overhaul election finance
laws _ the issue that divides McCain from Bush and other GOP
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING LIKE A BATTLESHIP FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf will address the Republican
convention next Tuesday _ from the battleship New Jersey.
Schwarzkopf is to join John McCain, Bob and Elizabeth Dole, and
George W. Bush's international affairs adviser, Condoleezza Rice,
in discussing the night's theme: national security. Schwarzkopf was
commander of U.S. and allied troops in the Persian Gulf War. The
887-foot New Jersey is to be towed from the Philadelphia Naval
Yard, where it was launched in 1942, to its new permanent home at a
pier across the Delaware River in Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   OLDER CITIZENS READY TO BITE BACK
</P>
<P>
   During his decade in Congress, Dick Cheney compiled a record of
voting against elderly interests on Social Security, Medicare and
assistance programs. ``His voting record on senior issues was a
disaster,'' said Bette Cooper of the National Council of Senior
Citizens. ``I haven't found one point where he could be viewed as a
friend of senior citizens.'' John Rother of the non-ideological
AARP, said the votes by George W. Bush's new running mate on a
variety of senior issues ``could be one of his biggest liabilities
as a candidate.'' Rother noted that Cheney was one of the few in
Congress to vote against the Older Americans Act and restoring
minimum benefits to Social Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   DECK STACKED ON ANTI-ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the Republican Party's position on abortion is
shaping up as one-sided, a blow to GOP abortion-rights activists
already disappointed in George W. Bush's choice of a running mate.
The group of platform committee members chosen to take up the issue
in pre-convention meetings Friday is led and dominated by
anti-abortion Republicans. The panel is ``overloaded with those who
disagree with us,'' said Susan Cullman, head of the Republican
Pro-Choice Coalition. ``It will be very hard to get a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP PRIMARY PLAN GAINS A STEP
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party moved a step closer to adopting a
presidential nominating plan in which small states would vote first
and big states last. The party's rules committee reaffirmed its
support of the plan, intended to forestall a drift to a national
primary, encourage more candidates to stay in the race longer, and
ensure that more votes matter. This year, the nominations were
settled in early March. But big states that fear irrelevance from
going last, and traditional opponents of giving party leaders more
power, are joining to fight the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE EXTRA, JUST TO MAKE SURE
</P>
<P>
   Even without heavyweight competition, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island is still pulling in big bucks. In the three-month
period ending June 30, Kennedy banked $112,325 in campaign
contributions from organized labor, the hospital and nursing-home
industry, and scores of other out-of-state benefactors. His
Republican opponent, boiler operator Stephen Cabral, couldn't
compete. The political newcomer raised $1,360 and spent $828.13
over the same three-month stretch, most of it on campaign supplies
from Staples and Copy N Print.
</P>
<P>
   BUT THERE'S NO LINCOLN BEDROOM IN THE PENTAGON
</P>
<P>
   Long before there were White House coffees for Democratic
donors, Dick Cheney entertained major Republican contributors at
private meetings at the Pentagon, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, which investigates congressional fund-raising.
Cheney was host for at least two GOP donor gatherings inside the
Defense Department in 1991 and in 1992, the records show. As
defense secretary under President Bush during the Persian Gulf War,
Cheney's popularity was then at its height. Republican National
Committee spokesman Bill Pasco declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   GORE LEADING IN JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, which both parties view as a crucial electoral
battleground, Al Gore continues to hold a slight lead over George
W. Bush, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll. The
survey (3 percentage point margin of error) shows Gore with a lead
of 46-41 percent lead in a one-on-one race. When small-party
candidates are included, Gore's lead is 42-38 over Bush, with 7
percent for Ralph Nader and 2 percent for Pat Buchanan. The survey
was taken before Bush's V.P. choice of Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   LAME DUCK MAKES PARTY SWITCH
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years in Congress, Rep. Matthew Martinez has gone
about his job in relative obscurity. But the lame-duck Californian
became the talk of Capitol Hill as he switched from the Democrats
to the Republicans. Martinez, 71, was denied renomination in the
March Democratic primary. In the closely divided House _
Republicans now will have a seven-vote margin in the chamber _ GOP
leaders sought to play up the defection to the hilt. But House
Democrats scoffed, calling the switch nothing more than a parting
shot by a bitter lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   WHOOPS, SOME OTHER BUSINESS BEFORE LAZIO
</P>
<P>
   Not many people know Hillary Clinton has a Democratic opponent
in the New York Senate race, but he challenged the first lady to a
series of debates Wednesday. Mark McMahon, a 39-year-old Manhattan
surgeon who is largely considered a nuisance opponent by the
Clinton campaign, gathered more than enough signatures to assure
himself a spot on the ballot in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary.
McMahon said he'd be a better candidate against Republican Rick
Lazio because he doesn't ``carry any of the negative baggage that
Hillary does.''
</P>
<P>
   GET THAT CANDIDATE A GOOD MAP
</P>
<P>
   New York Senate candidate Hillary Clinton, who proudly proclaims
she has visited all 62 of the state's counties, made a wrong turn
last week when she appeared on a radio station in Erie County, Pa.
She apparently believed she was on the air in New York. ``Last
week, I was up your way talking about my upstate economic agenda,''
Clinton told her befuddled radio host during a 10-minute interview
on 1,000-watt WLKK, which is located about 20 miles from the New
York border. The signal almost reaches the state line.
</P>
<P>
   SANTA CLAUS WITH PAC MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Expanding quickly beyond his local fortresses of support in Long
Island, Rick Lazio went on something of a philanthropic binge this
month, giving a total of $72,500 on the same day to all 62
Republican county committees in the state. And for good measure, he
sent an additional $4,000 to four Conservative Party county
committees. The donations, though, didn't put a dent in Lazio's
Senate campaign treasury. The money came from an obscure state
political action committee that effectively allows him to get
around strict federal fund-raising limits.
</P>
<P>
   PAC-MAN ACCOUNTABILITY?
</P>
<P>
   Congressional supporters of a new law requiring tax-exempt
political organizations to reveal who's paying for their
campaign-style activities urged the IRS to make it also apply to
lawmakers' political action committees. The leadership PACs are all
registered with the Federal Election Commission and disclose the
contributions they receive under federal law, which can be used to
directly aid candidates. But at least a dozen lawmakers, including
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, also have set up nonfederal entities _ which do not have
to report to the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   COMMON GROUND IN SAME CHURCH
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Rev. Charles Rush in Summit, N.J., found
both U.S. Senate candidates facing each other across the aisle to
receive Communion. Jon Corzine and Rep. Bob Franks may spar with
each other day in and day out on the campaign trail, but they say
their prayers together at the end of the week. Corzine, a Democrat,
lives in Summit and has been at Christ Church, an
interdenominational mix of Baptist and United Church of Christ, for
more than 20 years. Franks, a Republican who lives the next town
over in Berkeley Heights, has been going to the church for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE CAUSE OF A BIG UMBRELLA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) said he'll go to the Republican
convention to speak out on behalf of abortion rights, a position
sure to put him at odds with the convention's majority. Campbell is
facing an uphill fight to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
and California voters are heavily pro-choice. But Campbell insists
that he isn't being guided by politics. ``Truly, my purpose is to
make sure that people see the Republican Party as diverse as it
really is,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   AND IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN
</P>
<P>
   Using videotape of the violent protests during the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle to make their point, Los Angeles
police warned downtown businesses to prepare for the worst during
the Democratic convention. Business owners should consider boarding
up glass walls and windows, hiring additional security, and
stocking up on emergency provisions like flashlights, food and
water, police suggested. ``It's almost like a tornado,'' said
Detective Darryl Butler, who has been giving up to four
presentations a day to downtown workers. ``You can see it coming,
but you don't know where it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   BOXER GEORGE FOREMAN NAMED HIS FIVE SONS GEORGE
</P>
<P>
   All three Georges are coming, and the rest of the Bush clan too.
The father, George Herbert Walker Bush, will be saluted as a former
president. ``I'll be there proudly,'' he said. His eldest grandson,
George Prescott Bush, is just as thrilled, though somewhat startled
over his own, newfound fame. Coming out of the sandwich generation,
George W. Bush will be nominated for president.
</P>
<P>
   AREN'T JOURNALIST USED TO LEAKS?
</P>
<P>
   Four giant pavilions that will serve as workplaces for more than
10,000 members of the media outside the First Union Center in
Philadelphia leaked all day Wednesday as more than an inch of rain
fell on the city. Water also came in where the structures' fabric
walls meet the ground. In the months leading up to the Republican
convention, organizers have insisted the structures _ made of PVC
fabric stretched across huge aluminum arches _ should not be called
tents because of their resistance to the elements. Media critics
suggested there should have been more testing.
</P>
<P>
   HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD READY
</P>
<P>
   The QVC cable shopping channel is getting election fever. The
cable TV marketer of housewares, jewelry and exercise gear will put
on a special show from the Republican convention to hawk campaign
buttons and other mementoes. Souvenirs will range from the
inexpensive buttons to a collection of lapel pins representing all
the states and the District of Columbia, valued at more than $250.
In addition to vendors selling official souvenirs at the convention
and around the city, the GOP said it was naming QVC the official
national retailer to try to reach a wider market.
</P>
<P>
   CRACKED LIBERTY BELL, AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Each state was supposed to send a version of the Liberty Bell to
Philadelphia for the Republican convention next week. But South
Dakota's won't make the trip. ``It exploded in the kiln,'' said
potter Ken Russell of Arlington, S.D. The bell was about 2 feet
tall and 22 inches in diameter, with a grain pattern carved on it
to represent South Dakota's farmland. ``It would have been
pretty,'' Russell said glumly.

`A HOUSE DIVIDED': A PLANTATION WITH A FAMILY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Waterston plays a complicated hero in ``A House Divided.''
He's a slave owner who rapes his house servant, a black teen-ager,
and then _ many years later _ hires a lawyer to make sure their
daughter isn't denied her inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   This Showtime movie is what Hollywood agents call, with deadly
reduction, an ``issue-driven narrative.'' But, thanks to a careful,
hard-nosed script and fine performances, it sidesteps many hazards
of the genre. Love for his mixed-race child doesn't suddenly
politicize the Waterston character, David Dickson, or make him
endearing, or even worse, drive him to speechmaking. His motives
for doing the right thing are selfish and dramatically interesting:
He adores his only child, wants her to have whatever he can give
her and seems determinedly oblivious to the hostility that her
black genes might arouse in the slave-owning South.
</P>
<P>
   When he discovers that Julia, the girl he raped, tried to abort
her pregnancy (graphically depicted on screen), he goes to her room
and says, ``Just go on and have that baby, and we'll all forget
about it.'' While he acknowledges he may have behaved
inappropriately (by raping her), he doesn't apologize. He simply
wants her to understand that his lust had already been converted
into parental pride, even before his daughter was born, and that
Julia shouldn't interfere with his newfound feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Waterston has to play Dickson across several decades, so he
seems a little too old to be living with his mother, as he did at
the times of his daughter's violent conception and throughout her
upbringing. But he uses his wrinkles and a mop of stringy, untamed
hair _ and his trademark perplexity _ to emphasize Dickson's
eccentricity. Dickson is far more interested in improving his farm
(experimenting with bat dung as fertilizer) than politics. He owns
slaves and supports the Confederacy during the Civil War, but isn't
cruel _ apart from the inherent cruelty of the institution and his
complicity in it.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, he keeps his relationship with Julia
businesslike. Once he discovers her skill in mathematics and sense
of logic, he gives her increasing responsibility for management of
the farm. So even after slavery ends, she remains there _ but not
there in her rightful place, as her child's mother. Her daughter
Amanda loves her _ as a servant _ but thinks her real mother died
in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   She is able to believe this fiction because she looks white. The
filmmakers don't exactly explain how the other slaves on the farm _
who must have noticed what was happening in the big house _ didn't
spill the beans. We are only shown what happens when Amanda grows
up. These household secrets erupt to call into question her happy
childhood, and indeed, her place in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   This improbable family drama might have been imagined by
Tennessee Williams, and then who knows what would have transpired.
Instead it was inspired by, of all things, actual events as
described in a doctoral thesis, ``Woman of Color, Daughter of
Privilege,'' by Kent Anderson Leslie, and published in 1995 by the
University of Georgia Press. Leslie based much of her research on
records of the real-life trial that determined whether Amanda
America Dickson was her father's rightful heir.
</P>
<P>
   The film's director, John Kent Harrison, and its screenwriter,
Paris Qualles, have conventionally structured this psychologically
fraught drama. They use the trial as the centerpiece for their
story, which unfolds in a series of explanatory flashbacks. The
segues to the past are purely functional. ``Where did it start?''
Dickson's lawyer asks, for example, to instigate one memory trip.
The music, too, feels familiar _ sorrowful wails to let us know
that slavery was sad and evil, as if we didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   But the characterizations and acting rise above the stylistic
platitudes. Jennifer Beals conveys Amanda's hurt _ and charm and
sturdiness _ with a credible combination of hesitation and
fortitude. Tim Daly is suitably bland and earnest as Charles
Dubose, the young lawyer Dickson entrusted with the job of drafting
his will and having its provisions honored. Since the will was read
after Dickson's death in 1874, in the Reconstruction era, the issue
wasn't whether a slave could inherit property. Rather, his brother
(who wanted the land) argued that Dickson hadn't been competent
when he drafted the will. But, of course, race still was the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dubose never existed but is a fictionalized composite of the
many lawyers who actually argued the case. He was evidently created
to represent the post-Civil War New South, where one form of
selfish interest (the protection of individual rights) supersedes
another (sentimental bigotry). The filmmakers have him hail,
appropriately, from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most subtle and lovely portrait captures the alliance
_ resembling a certain kind of postsexual marital arrangement _
that develops between Dickson and Julia, who is elegantly played by
Lisa Gay Hamilton of the television series ``The Practice.'' She
convincingly portrays Julia's development from a surprisingly
innocent girl (considering her uprooted childhood, even before the
rape) to a stoical but uncompromising adult. Julia is wise, but not
annoying. You believe in her as a hurt woman who has carved herself
a dignified path through hardship.
</P>
<P>
   When Dickson is old (and Waterston's hair is gray as well as
ratty), taking account of his life and their relationship, he
describes their partnership as ``pretty good.'' The look Julia
sends him transmits every layer of text and subtext he has had to
ignore to reach that conclusion. Then she says, ``Yes, Master
David,'' because she knows there's no point in saying anything
else. It's a powerful moment, capturing a lifetime of hypocrisy,
devotion and habit.

   NAPSTER _ SAN DIEGO _ Industry leaders and observers said
Thursday that a federal judge's injunction that would shut down
Napster significantly increases the chances of government
regulation of the online music industry. Surprisingly, some say
they welcome regulatory intervention. In any case, the court ruling
is little more than a temporary setback in the online entertainment
world, they say. And don't count Napster out of it just yet.
Company attorneys, backed by some of the heaviest hitters in
Silicon Valley, were preparing an appeal Thursday and are showing
no signs of turning down the noise in their camp anytime soon.

FAT-ACCEPTANCE GROUP BLASTS `NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSE FRANCO   
 Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is
expected to be a summer blockbuster when it opens in theaters
Friday. But the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance in
Sacramento, Calif., says the film is sending the wrong message
about overweight people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore movies like this which continue to foster the myth
that we are all stupid, lazy and are constantly overeating,'' said
Frances White, spokeswoman for the group in San Francisco. The
group, with an estimated 3,000 members nationwide, provides
education on size-discrimination issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klumps'' is a PG-13 rated sequel to the $270 million, 1996
box office hit ``The Nutty Professor'' starring Eddie Murphy. In
both films, Murphy portrays several overweight characters who
overeat, use foul language and are plagued with gastrointestinal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene in the new movie, the overweight Klumps go to an
all-you-can-eat restaurant and wipe out the place except for an
avocado pit. The youngest Klump, Ernie Jr., gobbles ice cream
straight from the dispenser. Then Papa Klump ends the meal by
passing gas and setting the restaurant's curtains on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Several derogatory terms for overweight people are used in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that this is billed as a family movie because that
means that folks will take their children to see this movie and fat
hatred will be expressed to the next generation,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group does not advocate a boycott, it does alert
members about what it considers offensive material.
</P>
<P>
   Should people feel bad about going to the movie and having a
good laugh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you laugh at a Step-n-Fetchit movie?'' White asked,
referring to the comedy team that had negative stereotypes of black
people.
</P>
<P>
   But Connie Easler, a group leader for a Weight Watchers group in
Spartanburg, said she had no problems with the previous ``Nutty
Professor'' film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the other movie was real cute. I don't think people
get offended by portrayals of fat people. It's just part of the
movie. It's just a part of Eddie Murphy. It's just a part of
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's defense, the 400-pound Sherman Klump is an
intelligent, caring scientist with a heart of gold. While his alter
ego, Buddy Love, is physically fit and considered attractive but is
cruel, greedy and vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   In a touching moment, the Sherman Klump character says ``I am
used to being overweight. I am used to people making fun of me. But
I never got used to being alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Sherman isn't really alone. According to the federal
Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 55 percent of the
population is overweight; 22 percent are considered obese.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Universal was unavailable for comment.

 &HT;    DESPITE NAPSTER RULING, EXPERTS SAY ONLINE SHARING WILL SURVIVE
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Distraught music fans jammed Napster on Thursday, a
day after a federal judge ordered the leading Internet
music-swapping site to close in order to protect copyrighted
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god they killed Napster,'' wailed a visitor to a Napster
online forum who went by the name ``born-4-music.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Napster may be off line, at least temporarily, after
midnight Friday, industry observer said they don't expect the
burgeoning business of delivering music and other entertainment
over the Internet to miss more than a beat or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the law, technology and the human
appetite for something free continues to stay ahead of the law,''
said Gary Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., Internet industry consultant.
``This might slow it down, but it's not going to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering music, movies and software over the Web is one of the
hottest areas of the Internet these days. Industry researchers
predict that will only grow as more households gain high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   So far, online music has been dominated by a few companies such
as Napster that make no money from the songs listed on their
directories, but sell advertising from companies that want to tap
into the thousands of visitors they get each day. Napster, for
instance, claims 20 million visitors since it got started a little
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies _ including Napster _ aren't likely to let
the potential profits from that business pass them by because of
disagreements like the one between Napster and the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this spells the death knell at all of music or
entertainment on the Internet,'' said Larry Waks, an Austin, Texas,
attorney who specializes in music and copyright issues. ``It's just
the age-old story about the law trying to keep up with
technological inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other companies using the Napster model for
sharing music files, but the recording industry's biggest nightmare
might be a program called Gnutella, which allows individuals with
music on their personal computers to quickly make connections with
large numbers of other fans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, there is no central server with a directory of
songs that the industry can target with a lawsuit or a court
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Napster were busy Thursday preparing an appeal of
Wednesday's ruling, and the company showed no signs of giving up.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has some heavy hitters on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The lead attorney representing the San Mateo, Calif.-based
company is David Boies, who recently led the successful efforts to
win a federal antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. Its chief
executive is Hank Barry, a former entertainment industry attorney
turned venture capitalist. And the money behind Napster comes from
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, a powerful Silicon Valley venture
capital firm that pumped $15 million into the company in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``There some very smart people there, and I would suspect they
will emerge with some sort of product and technology which is more
viable,'' said Vincent Grosso, a former vice president of NBC
Interactive who now is chief executive of Into Networks Inc., which
rents software over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Internet music companies have changed the way they
do
</P>
<P>
   business. After it was sued by the RIAA earlier this year, San
Diego-based MP3.com Inc., for instance, struck a deal in which it
gives record labels a small payment each time one of its visitors
downloads a piece of copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   What Wednesday's ruling will do is force the question of who
owns what on the Internet to the forefront, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that the legislators are going to get
involved,'' said MP3.com executive vice president Billy Pitts, just
hired by the company as its chief lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Pitts and MP3.com _ named after the highly
compressed format that made music transmission over the Internet
viable at dial-up speeds _ are planning a nationwide drive to get
online music aficionados to contact their representatives. Their
goal is to get legislation or regulation on their terms and to keep
the battle out of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said he envisions an ``e-bill of rights'' that would
determine what is and isn't off-limits in sharing files over the
Internet, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet should not be ruled by a small cadre of
hand-picked judges who are trying to interpret what the law
means,'' Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that one of the industry's biggest
challenges is explaining to Congress how online music works.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say MP3 on the Hill, they say ``Oh, it's down the hall
on the right.''

 &HT;    REPORT CALLED 'DISTURBING' BUT ACTION UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    First Lede
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of major new findings that
understaffing in nursing homes leads to bedsores, malnutrition and
avoidable infections, lawmakers and the Clinton administration
Thursday took turns prodding each other to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study is disturbing,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said
as his Special Committee on Aging examined a U.S. Health and Human
Services Department report, which concludes that 54 percent of
nursing homes fall below the minimum staffing level for safe care.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he wants to require that the facilities hire more
staff when Congress considers increasing their Medicaid and
Medicare reimbursements this fall. However, the senator expressed
doubts that Congress would enact federal staffing standards any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do it more quickly,'' Grassley told Nancy-Ann
DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing Administration at HHS.
``Would you have that authority?''
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said she would have to check with her legal counsel on
how far her agency can go in enforcing current laws.
</P>
<P>
   Existing statutes have only a vague requirement for ``sufficient
nursing staff'' that includes requiring one full-time registered
nurse a day and round-the-clock coverage by a licensed practical
nurse at each facility.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said her department would need more money from Congress
to begin policing the staffing levels of the nation's 16,500
nursing homes. Moreover, she said that her department was not
prepared to set minimum standards without further research
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The latest staffing study, which was first ordered by Congress
in 1990 to be completed in 1992, focused on 1,800 nursing homes in
Texas, Ohio and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report documents the effects of low staffing and is ``the
largest and most rigorous study of the relationship between
staffing and quality of care conducted to date,'' said Andrew
Kramer, a geriatric medicine professor at the University of
Colorado, who helped conduct the research.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer told the committee that among facilities where each
resident received at least two hours of nurse's aide attention a
day, only 2 percent had a high rate of ``avoidable''
hospitalizations for ailments such as pneumonia, urinary tract
infections and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Among homes that offer less than two hours of nursing, 22
percent had a high rate of hospitalizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kramer said a single national standard would not be
practical because nursing homes with sicker residents need more
staff than those where the population is relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   That finding was applauded by Charles H. Roadman II, head of the
American Health Care Association, the largest nursing home trade
group, who opposes any attempt to mandate what he called a ``magic
ratio'' for patients and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly none of us are happy with pressure ulcers or falls or
dehydration or malnutrition,'' Roadman said, but he said the ``core
cause'' is the labor shortage and inadequate government
reimbursements through Medicare and Medicaid, which together
finance most nursing home costs.
</P>
<P>
   (trim line)
</P>
<P>
   Certified nursing assistants, who do most of the work of nursing
home care, receive low pay, have a high rate of turnover and often
suffer from on-the-job injuries as they move and lift patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these workers described to federal researchers the
conditions in nursing homes when they are short-staffed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Showers are the first things to go,'' one worker said.
``Eating is also affected. Food is put in front of sleeping
residents and taken away before it's eaten. Residents are also left
in urine and feces for a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worker said that residents who are supposed to get
showers two times a week ``might get one once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``There is a lot of weight loss because of not
feeding residents. Dehydration. Some residents just don't eat. Some
aides take the tray in and don't even try to feed, even if it says
'feeder.' It makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that nationwide, staffing levels at nursing
homes have remained about steady from 1997-1999, averaging about
3.25 nursing hours per day for each resident. Non-profit and
government facilities had more staff hours per resident than
for-profit nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the report showed that Alaska, with 4.92 nursing hours
per resident, ranked highest. Oklahoma was lowest at 2.61.
</P>
<P>
   Staff hour ratios for other states include: 3.41 for Ohio, 3.11
for Texas, 3.10 for Georgia, 3.70 for North Carolina, 3.59 for
Florida and 3.30 for Colorado.

&HT;        PHILANTHROPIST BACKS EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anand Giridharadas  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service   WASHINGTON (July 26) - Imagine
<TEXT>
walking into the doctor's office and entering into a computer your
symptoms, prior ailments and family history. Then the doctor,
tapping information from the database you just used, prescribes a
cure that appears to have worked in thousands of similar cases.
<P>
   That is what a wealthy Miami developer and philanthropist with a
history of grandiose plans is imagining these days. And he has
entered into a unique partnership with the federal government to
get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a fifty-year-old white male with prostate cancer,
and you're told you have three options,'' said Joseph H. Kanter,
75, in an interview, ``what are you going to do? You need to know
the outcomes of those three choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanter's quest is to build a database of so-called ``outcomes
research'' and place it on the Internet. The database would track
the experiences of millions of patients - from the detection of
symptoms to the course of treatment and, ultimately, to the end
result - and combine them in a user-friendly package.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter says that package would allow doctors to make more
informed medical judgments. Rather than basing decisions on
personal anecdotes and journal articles, he argues, a doctor could
quickly call up a history of similar patients with similar
troubles, and select the treatment that seemed to serve them best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the collective clinical experiences of millions of
people all over the world, just like you - and what worked with
them,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enrolls every physician permanently in an ongoing,
24-hour-a-day medical school,'' said Kanter's communications
director, Read Scott Martin.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, gathering and organizing the records of millions of
patients is a Herculean task. For one thing, in all the reams of
medical records, there is little data on the outcomes of
treatments. And even where records do exist - symptoms, diagnosis,
prescription - putting them in electronic form will be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanter is not unfamiliar with big undertakings. He began his
career in a rural Alabama general store and rose to make millions
as a builder and developer, erecting entire townships across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, he bought property in Miami, and went on to become one
of the largest landowners in South Florida, with 20,000 acres on
the Dade-Broward border. He was in banking for several years, as
chairman of the National Bank of Florida and later the Bank of
Florida. He has also produced an Oscar-winning film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a challenge,'' he said of his new task. ``It's not our
job to finish this project. But we must start.''
</P>
<P>
   In this latest bid to transform medicine, Kanter has struck an
unusual deal with the federal government. His organization, the
Kanter Family Foundation, and the federal Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality are jointly funding a project to design and
eventually build the world's first outcomes database.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership - known as HELP - is currently assessing what it
would take to build the system. HELP plans this year to build two
pilot models, focusing solely on breast and prostate cancer. Their
idea is to showcase the niche databases and use them as
steppingstones to build a register for all illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On October 30, HELP participants will convene for an all-day
conference in Washington, where experts and project leaders will
gather to cement a vision for the project and set a plan to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter acknowledges a few potential obstacles to building the
database - aside from the shear scope of it.
</P>
<P>
   The largest hurdle, he said, is to inform the public and
persuade people to volunteer their medical records. The system's
effectiveness is linked directly with the number of patients whose
records it contains.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with a detailed digest of patients' histories and
treatments available on the Internet, there may be concerns about
insurers tapping into the system to decide whether patients are
healthy enough to cover.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanter and his collaborators insist the database would be
anonymous - tracking cases, not people.
</P>
<P>
   Also, doctors might resent the system if they view it as a
fancy, new-age substitute for their judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanter said doctors, who often call this type of research
``cookbook medicine,'' should embrace the technology. He said the
database would drastically improve the quality of care and reduce
the risk of malpractice claims, by giving doctors a uniform
standard to apply in cases where they are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors should resent this to the extent that a professional
resents having an encyclopedia,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter, who himself has been diagnosed with prostate cancer,
pointed out that the notion of using data to make an informed
choice is not a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy a stock today, you can punch a button or call a
broker and get ten years of prices, dividends, earnings,'' he said.
``But you go to the doctor, and it might involve you not going back
to work or losing your leg, and you get much less information than
if you're buying a stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurence B. Gardner, chairman of the University of Miami
department of medicine, seemed to agree. ``The new world of
medicine is going to require that there be evidence for what we
do,'' he said.

   CONCORDE-CRASH _ GONESSE, France _ Investigators have fully
extracted the data from the ``black box'' recorders aboard the Air
France Concorde that crashed Tuesday, and have begun analyzing
cockpit conversations and engine readings made during the
supersonic aircraft's doomed two-minute flight, the French
government said Thursday. The government agency that investigates
aviation accidents said it was unclear how soon the information
contained on the flight data and cockpit voice records would yield
clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 when

   the Concorde slammed into a small hotel near Paris. A memorial

violence. On Thursday, authorities here reveal the conclusions of a
years-long investigation into the shocking murder of the Cardinal,
who was riddled with bullets while wearing his vestments and
crucifix. An initial theory was that the Cardinal was a mistaken
target caught in the crossfire of two vicious international
drug-trafficking gangs, one of which is still on the FBI's most

   REVIEW-CHEER _ Bubbly, bouncy Megan is a red-blooded,
all-American high school cheerleader. But her parents are
distressed about her affinity for tofu and her attachment to her
Melissa Etheridge poster. And for such a little girl, she sure has
a husky voice. You don't suppose she's a . . . Megan's perplexed
parents don't ask, they just call in the staff of True Directions,

   CHEER-PETERSON _ Long before his first script ever went before
the cameras, Brian Wayne Peterson's career was heating up. Based
solely on his spoof of gay rehabilitation camps But I'm A
Cheerleader, Variety named him one of ``10 Screenwriters to Watch''
in 1999. Now after a rocky road of production delays, a distributor
pullout and a temporary NC-17 rating, the 28-year-old gay writer
from Montana is waiting to see whether moviegoers are ready to
watch. In South Florida last month to attend a Pride FilmFest
screening, Peterson's spirits were buoyed by the reaction of the
predominantly gay audience. Still, he knows his satirical film must
attract a wider audience to succeed. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post)

   GROSSE-POINTE_ PASADENA, Calif. _ Aaron Spelling may be 148
years old, but he still has clout in this town. ``Grosse Pointe''
is a new WB comedy that satirizes what goes on behind the scenes of
a fictitious prime-time soap. The series is an obvious shot at such
campy Spelling soaps as ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' In fact, the
``Grosse Pointe'' characters look a lot like Shannen Doherty, Jason
Priestley, Luke Perry and Tori Spelling. Ah, Tori Spelling. Aaron's
no-talent daughter. In ``Grosse Pointe,'' actress Lindsay Sloane
plays Marcy Sternfeld, a Tori look-alike who also happens to be the
producer's daughter. Aaron, however, was not amused. And he let the
network know it. Reportedly, Spelling was so upset, he ordered
Jamie Kellner, the WB's CEO, to his house. Not true. Fall TV Tour,
no art. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post).

   REVIEW-PROFESSOR _ The key to a successful movie sequel is
figuring out what made the original such a hit and repeating it.
Leave it to anthropologists to explain why bodily function jokes,
crude humor, plus some clever makeup and two handfuls of
performances by Eddie Murphy sucked $270 million out of the global

   OLDIES _ DAYTON, Ohio _ In the cult action movie ``Escape From
New York,'' our hero, played by Kurt Russell, finds that every time
he meets up with someone new, the character's first line is: ``I
thought you were dead.'' Well, it seems appropriate to compare one
pop cultural form with another, especially when considering musical
acts you may have thought were dead. Maybe not in the literal sense
of having left this mortal plane, but certainly in the notion that
their time in the spotlight has passed. (Simmons, Dayton Daily

cold, sinewy fingers around the whole genre of bookreading.
Hardcover is taking on a whole other meaning that we will introduce
in this story. We'll make no vast, arguable statements about the
future success or failure of the technology; rather we will discuss
the evolution of books with a local bookclub and flip through the
advantages, disadvantages, pros, cons, eases and hassles of this
new literary tool. (Moore, Austin American-Statesman)

   STALKING _ Nearly 15 percent of American women say they have
been stalked at least once, in their lives, according to a new CDC
survey out Thursday. The results, which Atlanta women's rights
advocates say are startling, show that 2 percent were being stalked
at the time they were interviewed, one-third were injured as a
result of being stalked and more than half were so stressed that
their lives were disrupted for more than a month afterward. More
than four-fifths knew the person stalking them. Because two-thirds
of women were not injured, and one-third never reported the
stalking to police, traditional means of figuring out whether
violence against women is occurring (police reports, ER charts)
haven't found numbers like this, CDC says. The numbers come from a
survey of the female population of Louisiana but are broadly
applicable, CDC says. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

TAKING THE CHILDREN: MUTANTS? TALONS? TRYING TO THINK COMIC-BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   X-Men
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke
Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Bruce Davison
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Bryan Singer
</P>
<P>
   PG-13
</P>
<P>
   105 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Their strength is revealed when a little boy shreds a chain-link
fence in a Nazi camp. Mutants from the X-Men comic book. Over the
decades their numbers grow and ``sometime in the near future'' they
are upsetting ordinary people on a regular basis. We meet a few
examples. Wolverine ( Jackman) has Freddy Krueger-style talons that
spring from his knuckles. Storm ( Berry) is a walking hurricane and
electrical power plant. Rogue ( Paquin) sucks energy from human
bodies. Cyclops ( Marsden) can destroy a city block with a stare.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise they seem all-right sorts who would mind their own
business if others let them. The problem, of course, is that they
are different. Congress is turning McCarthyesque. A U.N. group
gathers on Ellis Island to address the perceived threat. Among the
mutants themselves there are two reactions. Professor Charles
Xavier (Stewart), who can read minds and affect thoughts, would try
to reason with normally endowed humans. Magneto (McKellen), a
mutant rebel and former colleague of Xavier's, would destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities dither, these two wage a high-voltage
comic-book zap fest for control of their breed. The professor runs
a kind of prep school for talented young mutants, and from gleaming
laboratories and battle stations beneath the ivied halls he and his
proteges struggle to outwit Magneto, whose powers seem
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they all end up in a wild electrostatic battle at the
Statue of Liberty. (With those talons, Wolverine could shut down
local power company for a week.) Magneto ends up in a plastic box
but vows to return. Think there'll be a sequel?
</P>
<P>
   Violence: Behind all those sparks and lightning bolts mutants
fling one another around like basketballs and they and regular
people get a little blood-flecked. But this is supposed to be the
comics.
</P>
<P>
   Sex: None.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Some profane exclamations.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-7: A common situation for the very young: too complicated
and too loud and intense. Not that attendance would necessarily
turn into a rout or have other damaging consequences, but this
isn't their movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 8 and up: The clouds lift. Discretion is advised, however.
Parents know their children.
</P>
<P>
   Scary Movie
</P>
<P>
   Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Anna Faris, Shannon Elizabeth,
Dave Sheridan, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Cheri Oteri
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans
</P>
<P>
   R
</P>
<P>
   88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   To lampoon the ``Scream'' movies, Wayans' film borrows from
several other teen-age slasher shows, not to mention ``The Matrix''
and ``The Usual Suspects.'' But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Late one night a pretty, vacant high school miss answers the
telephone and with a nervous titter indicates to the caller that
she is not quite dumb enough to tell him all about herself. He then
tells her he wants to look at her insides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream,'' right? Remember, though, this is a spoof. On the
stove popcorn swells suggestively in its foil tent. Time for the
first blast of flatulence. On the lawn the familiar maniac in black
robe and Edvard Munch mask flashes his long knife. But this is a
killer prone to tripping on porch steps, botching garage slashings
and getting as stoned as his potential victims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the blade he wields a gleaming cargo hook.
Actually he is the victim of a teen-age hit-and-run incident and he
wants revenge because he knows what they did. They ran him over.
``We hit a boot, but where's the foot?'' one teen-ager asks.
Finding a body they strip it of credit cards and toss it into the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a year later _ ``one year after, you know, we killed
that guy,'' says Cindy (Faris, stepping into the Neve Campbell
``Scream'' role). The television personality and author Gail
Hailstorm (Oteri) swoops down in an imitation of Gale Weathers from
the ``Scream'' adventures. Doofy (Sheridan) is the imbecilic
security man. There is a ``Blair Witch'' rush through the woods.
More flatulence and much bloodshed. You know, that Doofy is smarter
than he looks.
</P>
<P>
   Violence: One beheading, many stabbings and a sleet of gore.
(Where's your sense of humor?)
</P>
<P>
   Sex: The sex act is continually flaunted and discussed and
partially performed. Genitals are on view.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Any obscenity you've ever heard (or most).
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: On the LCD (lowest common denominator) scale, the film
rates a 9, saved from a 10 by a passing attempt at wit now and
then. Vulgarity is celebrated in all forms, from the sexual to the
intestinal, with an emphasis on bowels. Drugs are heavily in use,
and there are leaden racial jibes and stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Under Age 14: If they haven't seen it already, resist.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 14 and Up: Unless uninterested or dissuaded, they have
definitely seen it already.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon the Movie 2000
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Ikue Otani, Veronica Taylor, Rachael Lillis,
Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Michael Haigney
</P>
<P>
   G
</P>
<P>
   85 minutes
</P>
<P>
   To warm up the very little ones the presentation starts with a
short subject. The concept is ``rescue'' and involves a young
fellow who gets hung up by his backpack on a branch over a towering
waterfall. In the leafy glades below, the Pokemon (creatures
spawned by Japanese television) frolic obliviously and
unintelligibly until a few of them suddenly pop up and free the
backpacker.
</P>
<P>
   The screen goes dark, and after a good look at the Nintendo logo
we open on the main subject: a not altogether uninvolving story
about rejiggering the elements. Aboard a quite grand flying
whirligig a smug evildoer called the Collector plots to capture
three large and major Pokemon who control fire, ice and lightning.
Next he will seize the most important Pokemon, who oversees the
oceans.
</P>
<P>
   It falls to Ash, the human Pokemon trainer, and his little
yellow Pokemon pal, Pikachu, to save the environment. On
storm-tossed seas, he and his adolescent friends wreck a few
expensive powerboats and scramble around the Orange Islands in
weather conditions that, depending on which major Pokemon is in the
clutches of the Collector, vary from monsoonish to icebound. Will
pluck prevail?
</P>
<P>
   Violence: Some very mild rough and tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Sex: None.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Presumably none, but Pokemon babble is hard to
decipher.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-8: Attention may wander, but they will be entertained.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sizzling heat will expand across the West on Friday as a very
warm ridge of high pressure several thousand feet above the ground
intensifies. With residual moisture trapped under the sprawling
ridge, afternoon and evening thunderstorms will erupt in response
to the uneven heating of mountains and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will erupt near a cool front stalled
over the southern Plains. Though downpours are likely in spots, the
threat of severe weather will be limited, given the lack of wind
shear in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the recent rains along the Northeast Seaboard,
low clouds will shroud much of the region this morning, but the sun
will break through the clouds over some areas. The resulting
warming, in combination with gradually rising humidity, will make
the air feel more summerlike.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RADAR RAIN GAUGE
</P>
<P>
   While official rain gauges are many miles apart, radar can act
as a giant rain gauge blanketing a large area. When microwaves
emitted by radar encounter raindrops, the amount of energy returned
to the radar site provides an estimate of the rainfall rate. The
relationship between the reflected energy and the rainfall is a
complex one that depends in part upon the size and density of
droplets in the clouds. On Wednesday, the radar site near Boston
switched to tropical mode to provide better estimates of rainfall
from clouds streaming north from the tropical Atlantic. &QL;

 &HT;    SENATORS SEE PERIL FOR CONSUMERS IN WAVE OF AIRLINE MERGERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the Senate Commerce Committee expressed
concern Thursday that mergers in the airline industry could leave
passengers facing reduced service and higher prices from a handful
of giant carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can not think of any marketplace that works better for
consumers with fewer competitors,'' warned Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., the panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed merger of United Airlines, the nation's largest

power would force the creation of two other mega-carriers,

<P>
   ``Additional mergers in this industry will further erode airline
service to rural states, and I want the U.S. Justice Department and
the Department of Transportation to put the brakes on additional
mergers,'' said Sen. Bryon Dorgan, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Senators also said they were concerned about high ticket prices
for short trips on lesser-traveled routes. Some said they can fly
to Europe for less than they to some U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, said this was a result of the hub
system that evolved after the deregulation of airlines in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The hub system provides more flights and a variety of routes,
but a few airlines control airport hubs and tend to drive out the
competition, Klein said. With little competition, airlines can then
charge higher fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underserved population is due to predatory practices by
the big companies that keep low-cost carriers out of their hub,''
Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they have predatory practices, said Sen.
Fritz Hollings, D-S.C. ``You have to immediately break up the
hubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to high ticket prices, Klein told the
senators, is that ``airlines use computer modeling techniques and
ticketing restrictions to identify passengers to whom they can
charge higher fares.''

<P>
   But only about 6 percent of flyers pay the full price of the
ticket, said Alfred Kahn, a Cornell University emeritus professor

deregulation.''

said Kahn. Instead, government should provide adequate
infrastructure and make competition more effective. The shortage of
airports and inadequate air traffic control system is the basis of

   Hollings and other committee members agreed that government
agencies should serve as ``caution lights'' for the industry.

 &HT;    SENATORS SEE PERIL FOR CONSUMERS IN WAVE OF AIRLINE MERGERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the Senate Commerce Committee expressed
concern Thursday that mergers in the airline industry could leave
passengers facing reduced service and higher prices from a handful
of giant carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can not think of any marketplace that works better for
consumers with fewer competitors,'' warned Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., the panel's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed merger of United Airlines, the nation's largest
carrier, with US Airways is approved, some predict that its market
power would force the creation of two other mega-carriers,
American-Northwest and Delta-Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional mergers in this industry will further erode airline

 &HT;    Celebrating the Kathie Lee in all of us
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We've been in denial. We've tried to pretend it
couldn't happen. But it's finally here, after months of
teeth-grinding buildup: Kathie Lee Gifford's last day on ``LIVE
with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she debuted with Reege on the eponymous morning
chat show, she garnered if not respect, at least attention. From
her mind-bending hairdos and attire to her mind-melting chatter,
we'd never known anyone quite like her.
</P>
<P>
   Her crimes were many, her fine points few: Remember when her
Wal-Mart clothing line was revealed to be manufactured in Honduran
sweatshops? Remember when husband Frank Gifford was caught in
compromising photos with a flight attendant? (On the heels of
months of smug churn from Kathie Lee about what a devoted husband
Frank was?) And how she vowed to keep her children out of the
public eye _ only to immediately appear with son Cody on the covers
of numerous women's magazines (and star with him in a made-for-TV
movie!)?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Kathie Lee may be leaving Regis, but that doesn't mean she
has to leave us! Here are a few ways to cultivate the Kathie Lee in
you in everything you do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Add ``ie'' and ``Lee'' to your name, practice your big wink
and screeching ``REEGE''!
</P>
<P>
   _Stock up on all the fine Kathie Lee products: books, CD,
clothing, the soon-to-debut home furnishings line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boycott ``LIVE'' until Kathie Lee agrees to come back and end
our national nightmare!
</P>
<P>
   _ Kick off every day with 20 minutes of inane chat with
coworkers. Include at least one appallingly personal detail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a Carnival Cruise, don a Kathie Lee sw strawberry blonde
at every visit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk incessantly about your inner child, Cody.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proclaim shock at revelation that Third World laborers exist.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's time to start rehearsing your repertoire of cabaret
songs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the ultimate sacrifice: Have an affair with Frank.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, we agree with the New York Post: So go,
already!

`NUTTY PROFESSOR II': TREMENDOUSLY FUNNY, IN PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Eddie Murphy. He gave the performance of a lifetime in
``The Nutty Professor,'' with the kind of professional breakthrough
that showed he had become an actor with serious chops, and yet Jim
Carrey gets all the reviews. In ``The Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps,'' Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. We probably shouldn't feel too bad
for his being overlooked; after all, the first ``Professor'' was a
big hit. And this one will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the film are tremendously funny. Every single scene in
which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth of
transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family _
all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the movie provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Nutty Professor,'' made in 1963, was an update of
``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' starring Jerry Lewis as Dr. Julius
Kelp, a mega-nerd college professor crippled by his shyness. Kelp
invented a formula to unleash his inner hipster, Buddy Love. The
1996 remake starring Murphy did the same thing, with the actor
playing an overweight professor, Sherman Klump, who spent time with
his family _ mother, father, elder brother and grandmother, all
played by Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In portraying Buddy Love, Lewis was shockingly good. He burrowed
deep to come up with a dexterous, shaped performance that was both
sublime and a murderously hostile star turn: a full-blooded parody
of his former partner, Dean Martin. Lewis' impersonation came
complete with a satyr's cosmic boredom and an ability to read
people that functioned as a dry Vegas version of Sherlock Holmesian
ratiocination. For Murphy, Buddy Love is a sketch character, with
condescension for this loud-mouthed player manque built-in. Murphy
can't play this guy straight; he's too busy scoring off Love's
loutishness.
</P>
<P>
   The main crisis is that Buddy Love still exists inside Sherman,
and he erupts from Sherman's subconscious with awful frequency.
Buddy finds a way out when Sherman withdraws the aberrant gene that
created his slim but ravenous Id; the extracted gene looks like
irradiated Windex.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, performers wearing layers of makeup strain to show
off. Murphy uses the prosthetics as a tool, as they should be used;
he has worked out all of the emotional details from the inside.
(Method actors study for years to achieve this kind of
understanding.) His Sherman Klump has reserves of modesty and
charm, with a mellow bass chuckle that radiates contentment. Murphy
could play the character for cheap pathos _ the sad, heavy-set
clown who demands sympathy _ but he doesn't. Instead, Sherman is a
man who has settled into his place in the world; he has got a
jaunty, graceful gait for such a big man. It's his infatuations
that get him into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ``Professor,'' Jada Pinkett got his pheromones
going. This time it's Janet Jackson, and the biggest special effect
in the movie is her playing a genetics scientist. The names of the
chemical compounds don't come trippingly off her tongue; it's as if
they trip off her tongue. ``The Klumps'' screeches to a halt a
number of times as we get lengthy scientific explanations, leaving
skid marks and unintended comedy. And there's a lot to explain.
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   There's also straight-talking, libidinous Grandma, who brings
down the house; some of her material is unbelievably crude and
shocks a laugh out of you. She's clearly based on the gruff, dirty
comedian Moms Mabley, and her behavior shows where Buddy Love comes
from, especially when the two meet and she sizes him up like a
prime cut. Even he is put off by her audacity. ``You look just like
Ken Norton in that movie `Mandingo,''' she says, running her tongue
across her gums.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also has enough toilet humor to show that Murphy can
compete with Carrey and the Farrelly brothers. There are flatulence
flambe and projectile pellets from a giant hamster, among other
touches.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough for ``The Klumps'' to work as well as its predecessor
because there is no novelty left in Murphy's prodigious multiple
performances. (In addition, some of the characters sound similar to
Murphy's voice-over as the gruff super on the Claymation series
``The PJ's'' on Fox.) Still, he shows the discordant nimbleness of
Thelonious Monk, the brilliant jazz pianist whose hands found chord
voicings so distinctive it was as if each had a mind of its own.
How else could Murphy keep all these characters straight and still
riff in the way he does? The essentials are all worked out, and a
scene in which the Klumps gather around the television set to watch
Sherman at a news conference is a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tribute should be paid, too, to the makeup artist, Rick Baker,
who won an Oscar for the first Murphy ``Professor.'' Care has been
taken to make all the Klump men look like family; their heads are
the same shape and the plain-spoken father, Cletus, and Sherman's
brother, Ernie, are balding. Sherman has all his hair, perhaps
because he is closer in looks and temperament to his big-hearted
mother. But each of the characters has an individual and
well-defined mouth. The differentiations in Baker's workmanship
almost deserve their own movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys have been applauded for the genius
African-American triplets in ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' hip-hop
gunslingers who have filtered the chaos theory through Chris Rock
and Richard Pryor. But it's Murphy who has made the daring move:
the large, courtly Sherman Klump, with his countrified enunciation
and courtly manner _ the kind of black man who would probably be
taken for a preacher, like many other African-Americans in suits _
is a prodigy, a man who takes pride and refuge in his understanding
of science. It's subversive on a level that many African-Americans
will know, and love.

EARLY RELEASE OF SOME MAZE PRISONERS VIEWED WITH CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAZE, Northern Ireland _ Bobby Sands died here, starving himself
to death. Billy Wright, the loyalist assassin, died here, too,
gunned down by Irish republican enemies who somehow smuggled a gun
into the most secure prison in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the sprawling Maze prison
outside Belfast was the cauldron in which Northern Ireland boiled.
Prisoners demanded political status and refused to wear prison
clothes, wrapping themselves in blankets and smearing their cells
with excrement.
</P>
<P>
   When those protests failed, the hunger strikes began in 1981.
Sands and nine other republican prisoners fasted to the death in an
extraordinary show of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s, after the British government acceded to
the demands for which the hunger strikers died, the prison went
from being part of the problem to part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Using their cellblocks as a forum for debate, Irish Republican
Army prisoners and their loyalist counterparts threw their
intellectual weight behind the 1994 cease-fires and the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   And so by Friday, the Maze will become what few ever believed
possible: virtually empty.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, only about 15 political prisoners will remain in
Northern Ireland, a place that produced more of them per capita
than any place in the world over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the last of some 400 paramilitary prisoners, a
cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, is aimed at
making Northern Ireland a safer place in the long run, as it is
meant to cement the cease-fires that the major paramilitary groups,
with some murderous exceptions, have been observing since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Freeing some of these prisoners has made Northern Ireland a more
dangerous place in the short run, according to British and Irish
security sources. It has also tested the willingness of people to
swallow the disgust of watching some of Northern Ireland's most
ruthless, remorseless killers walk free.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Protestant loyalist extremists who are among the
last released will inevitably be caught up in an internecine feud
in which loyalists have been killing each other as one group tries
to keep a minority of hardliners from breaking the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   On the republican side, it is also inevitable, according to
security sources, that some IRA and republican splinter group
prisoners, especially those who have served relatively short
sentences, will drift in with dissidents trying to wreck the peace
process by placing bombs in Northern Ireland and London.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hope for the future is that an empty Maze prison will
undermine the cult of victimhood which runs deep in both the
Catholic nationalist and Protestant unionist communities.
</P>
<P>
   While this week is a momentous one in Northern Ireland's
tortuous road to peace, it is one of outrage for people like
Michelle Williamson and Sally McErlean.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, whose parents were killed with seven other
Protestant civilians by a botched IRA bombing meant for loyalist
paramilitary leaders in 1993, tried futilely in the courts to keep
the IRA bomber, Sean Kelly, from walking free this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British government has given in to the terrorists,'' a
disconsolate Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   McErlean's son Thomas was slain in 1988 as he tried to stop
loyalist assassin Michael Stone from shooting and throwing grenades
at Catholic mourners at the funerals of three IRA guerrillas gunned
down by British commandos in Gibraltar. McErlean said seeing Stone
walk free Monday to a hero's welcome ``made me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   But others did not even get the limited satisfaction of knowing
their loved one's killer spent time behind bars. Jim McCabe's wife,
Nora, was killed in 1981 by a plastic bullet fired by a police
officer who was never charged. The Royal Ulster Constabulary and
the British army used plastic bullets against civilians, mostly
Catholics, while their use was outlawed in the rest of the United
Kingdom. Of the 17 people killed by plastic and rubber bullets,
nine were under age 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they are outraged watching these men leave prison.
They at least had the luxury of seeing these people brought before
a court and face justice. I never had that luxury,'' said Jim
McCabe, who was left with three children under age 6 after his wife
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 400 people were killed by the security forces in Northern
Ireland, and only four cases resulted in convictions against
British soldiers and police. All of the security force members were
subsequently released after brief incarcerations, and the soldiers
were allowed to rejoin their regiments.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last 30 years, the prison near Lisburn was both
a cause and a byproduct of the Troubles, as the Irish in their
penchant for understatement call the political and sectarian
conflict that has killed more than 3,500 in a place the size of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The prison also underscored how Protestant loyalists, who fought
so that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom,
and Irish republicans, who fought for unity with the Irish Republic
to the south, hold polar opposite views.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still refer to the prison as Long Kesh, the original
detention camp where they were sent in the early days of the
Troubles, especially after internment, a disastrous British policy
aimed at stamping out the IRA. Because so many innocent Catholics
were caught in the dragnet, internment radicalized a whole
generation of nationalists, ensuring the IRA a steady stream of
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   For republicans, especially, prison was a political education,
``just another part of the struggle,'' according to Gerry Adams,
the leader of Sinn Fein, which is allied with the IRA. Adams, an
IRA commander in the early 1970s, was held without charge like
hundreds of other nationalists during the failed policy of
internment. And like hundreds of other young IRA volunteers, Adams
became radically politicized in prison, where IRA prisoners read
Mao and debated how they could persuade the Irish people to embrace
their vision of a 32-county socialist republic.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalists, meanwhile, were disillusioned by being imprisoned by
the very government to which they swore loyalty. But eventually
they, too, used prison to see their crimes, and their future, in
political terms.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hutchinson, jailed for killing two Catholics, came to
believe that he and a generation of young Protestants had been used
as cannon fodder by fundamentalists such as the Rev. Ian Paisley,
who whipped up anti-Catholic sentiment, ``but considered us scum
when young loyalists followed Paisley's rhetoric to its inevitable
conclusion and killed Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson came out of prison determined to improve the lives of
working-class Protestants and Catholics, who bore the brunt of the
suffering during the Troubles. Upon his release from prison, he
worked with Pat McGeown, a former IRA prisoner who nearly died on
hunger strike. When McGeown eventually died from complications
related to his fast, Hutchinson publicly praised him as ``a good
man,'' an unprecedented tribute from a loyalist to a republican.
</P>
<P>
   While most like Hutchinson and McGeown came out of prison better
educated, and few were sent back after doing their ``whack,'' as
they call prison time here, there is also the cautionary tale of
Billy Giles, who found that while prisoners could leave the Maze,
walking through its creaky metal turnstiles, some could never fully
escape the demons sharing their cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a Globe reporter toured the loyalist wings of the Maze in
1991, Giles was commanding the fellow Ulster Volunteer Force
prisoners. He proudly pointed out the differences between his men
and the IRA men on the other side of the H-blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stress individualism,'' Giles said. ``The IRA force their
men to live in a socialist collective.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, after Giles had been freed, this reporter bumped
into him at a prisoners' rehabilitation center in East Belfast.
Over coffee, he talked of how he had never gotten over murdering
Michael Fay in 1982. Fay was an innocent Catholic, on his way to
visit his daughter in the hospital, when he was abducted and killed
by Giles and a loyalist gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a man,'' Giles said, tears brimming but never
quite falling from his eyes. ``He was just a man with a wee family
and we killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Billy Giles hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a victim, too,'' he wrote in the note he left behind.
``Please let our next generation live normal lives, tell them of
our mistakes and admit to them our regrets. I've decided to bring
this to an end now. I'm tired.''

&HT;     A CLEAR CHOICE NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's selection of a doctrinaire
ultraconservative as his running mate may alleviate one campaign
problem: voter apathy born of a feeling that there isn't much
difference between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush has dropped his cloak of moderation to identify
firmly with the right wing, Vice President Al Gore is free to
respond in reverse. He let it be known he is looking seriously at
potential veeps from his party's left wing. The names of three
undeniably liberal Democrats immediately popped up: Massachusetts
Sen. John Kerry, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and Iowa
Sen. Tom Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation in all things, including politics, is customarily a
wise course. But it also confuses voters accustomed to the clang
and bang of sharp-edged partisan warfare. Elections are all about
choosing between two philosophies of governing. To make the right
choice, voters need information, not soft soap.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pew Research Center poll suggested that voter turnout
this fall may be even lower than in 1996, when only 49 percent of
eligible citizens cast ballots. The biggest reasons: boredom and
cynicism about politics and a sense that it doesn't matter much who
is elected president anyway. Thirty-three percent of those surveyed
said Bush and Gore hold similar positions.
</P>
<P>
   The two have nobody to blame but themselves for this sorry state
of affairs. They both have been trying to appeal to independent and
moderate voters by softening the ideological outlines, speaking in
soothing generalities meant to reach beyond their party base and
their core beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   On important issues, Bush is actually more vague than Gore, but
Gore is no paragon of clarity either.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew poll, however, indicated that this muddled picture was
beginning to shift even before Bush selected Dick Cheney as his
running mate. The public impression of Bush's ideology, once
equally divided between moderate and conservative, was already
tilting toward conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was seen as becoming more moderate and less liberal.
This image would certainly shift to the left, solidifying the
contrast with Bush, if Gore picks a liberal running mate.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early. The two conventions and first national
impressions of the veeps-in-waiting should stimulate fresh interest
and reshape some issues. The Pew survey reported that the
presidential race is still wide open, subject to changing voter
opinions as the campaign wears on. There was no such voter
flexibility four years ago. President Clinton held a consistent
lead over Dole in the post-primary surveys, and nothing Dole could
do changed it.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to ask if Bush is really as far to the right as the
opinions reflected in Cheney's congressional voting record from
1979 to 1989. After all, papa George Bush abandoned some
firmly-held positions, most notably opposition to supply-side
economics and support of abortion rights, when he joined Ronald
Reagan on the 1980 GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush the younger in effect answered yes to the question. ``I
obviously thought about the (Cheney) record,'' he said. ``This is a
conservative man. So am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's voting record, however, is not just conservative. It
wears high-button shoes and squeaks when it walks. ``I'm proud of
it,'' he said after Bush named him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney consistently voted against abortion rights, with no
exceptions for the life or health of the mother; against all
gun-control legislation, even a bill to outlaw cop-killer bullets;
against funds for Head Start and federal aid to college students;
against the continued existence of the Department of Education;
against strengthening laws banning discrimination in housing;
against extending the clean water act. There's more, but you get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   On all those issues, Gore was on the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there can be absolutely no doubt when the American people
go to the polls this November they will be choosing between two
very different visions for our future,'' Gore declared. If his own
running mate is one of the three liberals whose names now seem to
top his list, the present ideological ravine that separates the
presidential tickets will look like a canyon. There's a difference,
all right.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was voting on these issues a decade ago. Since then he
has been a prosperous corporate executive, his views still
conservative and pro-business but held privately. He promptly
indicated he might have second thoughts today about some of those
votes, cast during a period of federal deficits rather than an era
of Treasury surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But his heart was clearly with big defense spending and not with
support for domestic programs like education, environmental
protection or social justice. The ``compassionate'' element in
conservatism that Bush claimed to want is missing. And hearts and
minds are hard to change.

 &HT;    But `Cheerleader' comedy is too obvious
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bubbly, bouncy Megan is a red-blooded,
all-American high school cheerleader. But her parents are
distressed about her affinity for tofu and her attachment to her
Melissa Etheridge poster. And for such a little girl, she sure has
a husky voice. You don't suppose she's a . . .
</P>
<P>
   Megan's perplexed parents don't ask, they just call in the staff
of True Directions, a ``gay rehab camp,'' to stage an intervention
and cure her of this lesbian thing.
</P>
<P>
   As Megan, Natasha Lyonne (''American Pie'') is as surprised as
anyone to learn of her sexual orientation. Sure, whenever her
boyfriend stuck his tongue in her mouth, her mind would
distractedly wander to the torsos of her cheerleading colleagues.
But maybe he's just not a very good kisser, she figured.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Jamie Babbit's feature debut, ``But I'm A
Cheerleader,'' is considerably better than its execution. It goes
about its pastel-colored satire so toothlessly that audiences will
probably be way ahead of the joke. In its playful way, it traffics
in homosexual stereotypes, showing how society has defined gay
orientations for its own convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Babbit both mocks such stereotyping and wallows in it, an
indulgence she justifies because her movie eventually will come
down squarely in favor of romance in all its permutations. Since
the hypocrisy and wrong-headedness of True Directions is a given as
soon as we get a look at the camp's Chanel-suited, sadistic,
right-wing head mistress, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty, giving every
indication of being a transvestite herself), the picture takes an
awfully long time arriving at its pro-gay message. Sexual politics
clearly take precedence over comedy here, but the film remains an
amiable fable for our times.
</P>
<P>
   Surely production designer Rachel Kamerman had fun decorating
True Directions headquarters, with its behavior modification color
scheme _ bubble-gum pink for the girls' quarters and baby blue for
the guys. The deprogramming process is patterned after the
confessionals of Alcoholics Anonymous, plus some positive
reinforcement _ vacuum cleaning classes for her, wood chopping
lessons for him.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, it dawns on Megan that her parents' suspicions were
well-founded, a realization hastened by encountering sullen, bad
girl Graham (Clea DuVall, in a comic variation of her ``Girl,
Interrupted'' role). Despite the best efforts of the program, love
blooms and their sexual bent prevails, leading to a last minute
rescue of Graham, an intervention by Megan that brings to mind the
fade-out of ``The Graduate. ``
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne and DuVall play their parts straight, if you'll pardon
the expression, while the rest of the eclectic cast winks its way
through the movie. Surely Moriarty must have had Faye Dunaway as
Joan Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest'' in mind as she butches it up.
</P>
<P>
   As Mike, the ``ex-gay'' camp counselor for the guys, RuPaul
Charles appears in a rare macho role, but still infuses the
proceedings with camp. While they don't have much to do after the
opening scenes, ``Harold and Maude's'' Bud Cort and John Waters
favorite Mink Stole add a refreshingly offbeat touch as Megan's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The exaggerated reality of a Waters movie wafts throughout ``But
I'm A Cheerleader,'' but it it would have been more effective had
Brian Wayne Peterson's screenplay gone further out on a satirical
limb.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has an elbow-nudging, self-congratulatory tone that
makes its comedy more obvious than necessary. The movie amuses,
without leaving us something to truly cheer about.

INTERESTING ARTIFACTS TO BE FOUND ON SMOKING GUN WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK HUGHES COBB   
 Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by the box office, pretty much everyone rushed out to
see the movie ``Titanic.'' Believe it or not, there's more to the
story of the 1912 tragedy, and some of the more interesting
artifacts can be found on The Smoking Gun Web site.
</P>
<P>
   You can see actual SOS telegrams, printed in mimeograph purple
so ripe you can almost smell it, dashed from the doomed ship:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struck iceberg sinking fast come to our assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sinking fast passengers being put into boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those blunt words still send a chill through Danny Green, an
editor and co-founder of The Smoking Gun.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured are various true-crime quirks, ramblings from J.
Edgar Hoover and a hand-scrawled missive from Elvis Presley to
Richard Nixon requesting an audience to discuss the drug, hippie
and communist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The site _ www.thesmokinggun.com _ also has lighter fare
highlighting the absurdities of modern life, such as the Victoria's
Secret dress code booklet (store employees better be big on black)
and vintage whines of the American celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about Jim Morrison's somewhat sober testimony from his
Florida obscenity trial? Interested in the lush lives of former
love bunnies Kirstie Alley and Parker Stevenson, divvying up goods
in an ugly divorce? Need proof that Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina
Jolie are indeed legally wed?
</P>
<P>
   It's all the news they can fit on a server.
</P>
<P>
   Green and co-founder Bill Bastone, both writers and
investigative reporters in New York City, kept stumbling across
``cool and interesting'' documents from courtrooms, law enforcement
agencies and elsewhere. Words this good cry out to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the New Yorker didn't have the space to print a three-page
FBI file,'' Green said. ``And some of it was not what some would
deem newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   So back in 1996 they began investigating Internet capabilities.
After about a year of study, they went online with The Smoking Gun.
Response was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 36 hours of getting things up, we were getting e-mails
from Japan,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, ``it's not like you get flooded with letters
about every story you write. In my whole career, I've gotten maybe
two dozen letters. But all of a sudden we were getting 20 to 30
e-mails a day, saying we love your site, we hate your site, why
don't you look into this case? It was really a thrilling thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act is their friend _ and weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to write one Freedom of Information Act request a
day,'' said Green, although the site's only a part-time occupation
for the co-editors at present.
</P>
<P>
   Readers also leak documents, such as the Victoria's Secret dress
code, which raised a fuss after it went up on the site this summer.
The lacy lawyers came out gunning.
</P>
<P>
   The rather stringent code insists employees wear ``predominantly
(95 percent) black'' while covering all that skin: hosiery a must,
and bare bellies, backs and shoulders a no-no, ironic in a store
selling skimpy underwear.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of columnists, including famed gossip Liz Smith, took
note of the Secret-Gun ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is Victoria's Secret thought we were some kind of
rinky-dink site, and we'd cave easily and take it down,'' Green
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position remains: If Tyra Banks wants to call me, I'll
talk, but until then, it stays up. And she hasn't called,'' Green
said, referring to the lingerie model.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Bastone stand on the doctrine of fair use _
established by The New York Times' legal battle to publish the
Pentagon Papers _ which protects the use of newsworthy information.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoking Gun helped crack a TV farce back in February, by
publishing a judge's restraining order against Rick Rockwell, the
titular dude of the much-hyped Fox TV special ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multi-Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the genesis of a big story,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, scrupulous attention to detail reveals fun facts.
Basketball star Shaquille O'Neal sued a custom car plant for not
delivering his specialized Mercedes. In the paperwork, among
details of a $10,000 stereo and initialized grill work were orders
for a ``secret compartment'' in the car, which only O'Neal would be
able to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assumed it was for, of course, his championship rings,''
Green laughed.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the archive gives some impression of the whimsical,
tabloid-like style and dizzying breadth of the document collection:
</P>
<P>
   _ I See Dead People _ Being Groped (about perverted shenanigans
in a funeral home)
</P>
<P>
   _ Backed Into a Coroner (autopsies and death certificates of
famous people _ Elvis, JFK, Malcolm X, Frank Sinatra, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   _ The Unabomber Quiz (test your sanity the way the courts tested
Ted Kaczynski's)
</P>
<P>
   Because of low overhead _ two employees, with main expenses
being copying, mailing and phoning _ the site is paying for itself.
Sales of T-shirts and other paraphernalia, along with banner ads,
account for much of the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no fat in our organization,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green works three days a week at another site, and Bastone
continues to report for other publications. But the future looks
bright: They've just signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown for
further Smoking Gun adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our first chance to really move towards making a very
good profit,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of potential Web site mergers are in the offing, which
might change The Smoking Gun to a full-time proposition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to be putting new stuff on five or six days a week.
There's plenty of stuff out there.''

&HT;     BUSH-CHENEY WILL COURT FIVE SWING STATES EN ROUTE TO
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican partners George W. Bush and Dick
Cheney made plans Thursday to campaign in five swing states as they
travel to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. All
five states _ Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia
_ have rejected Republican presidential candidates in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and his freshly-minted running mate ``are excited
about the tour and the opportunity to spread my message of
improving schools, cutting taxes, preserving Social Security and
strengthening our national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush broke away from preparations for his pre-convention march
to Philadelphia to conduct a dress rehearsal of his scheduled
acceptance address on Aug. 3 in the comfortable surroundings of the
Texas governor's mansion that he has called home since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cheney continued to defend his conservative voting
record as a Wyoming congressman during 10 years in Congress that
ended in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of television interviews, Cheney responded to
criticism from Democrats that he had opposed the Equal Rights
Amendment, fought legislation to outlaw plastic handguns favored by
terrorists to evade airport security, opposed legislation to ban
so-called ``cop killer'' bullets capable of penetrating body armor
and had opposed U.S. sanctions against the white racist regime
governing South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I came from a conservative state and did, in fact,
vote that way,'' Cheney said. ``But I don't have any apologies to
make for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney worked in Dallas on Thursday, wrapping up his affairs as
the multimillionaire chief executive of Halliburton, a worldwide
oil-services conglomerate where Cheney worked for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, joined in Cheney's
defensive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney ``cast thousands of votes in his career'' in Congress,''
she said, adding ``If Al Gore wants to talk about each one _ let
him.'' Hughes noted that Gore, as a senator from Tennessee, had
voted in the Senate to confirm Cheney as defense secretary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney scoffed at Democrats' criticism of his voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``So whatever the Democrats want to say about me now, the fact
of the matter was many Democrats, as well as all of the
Republicans, thought I was a reasonably respectable fellow in the
1980s,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign pressed its effort to define Cheney in the
eyes of voters before the Bush-Cheney ticket could gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for Gore, called Cheney
``a card-carrying member of the `old guard,''' adding: ``Some of
his past votes are hard to explain away in any era.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani, who helped handle public relations for President
Clinton during his impeachment struggle, said the Gore campaign
would ``keep the focus on what Cheney's selection says about Bush's
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The five states being visited by the Republicans en route to the
convention, plus Pennsylvania where the convention is located,
offer 74 of the 270 electoral votes that a presidential candidate
needs to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six states last voted for a Republican presidential
candidate in 1988; West Virginia last went Republican in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney planned to travel with Bush to Arkansas and Missouri
before returning to Dallas on Saturday to prepare for his
convention appearance on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his interviews, Cheney explained that his opposition to the
ERA had stemmed from concern that the constitutional amendment
would require that women be drafted into the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the armed forces currently are permitted to serve in
near-combat positions but not in front-line ground assault units.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said on CBS News' ``The Early Show'' that he ``didn't
think that (drafting women) was a very good idea'' and had tried to
revise the proposed amendment to stipulate that women need not be
drafted. But Cheney, who oversaw the deeper integration of women
into near-combat positions during his four years as defense
secretary, said the House rules at the time would not permit such
revisions and so he voted against the ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told ABC News' ``Good Morning America'' that he joined
only three other House members in 1988 to vote against a ban on
plastic guns and a ban on body armor-piercing bullets because he
remains ``a great believer'' in protecting Americans'
constitutional right to ``keep and bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney added: ``The solution to our gun problems really lies in
enforcing existing regulations and laws that prohibit felons, for
example, from owning guns, rather than imposing new requirements on
law-abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney lambasted suggestions by critics that his vote against
imposing economic sanctions on the white racist regime of South
Africa signaled opposition to freeing Nelson Mandela, the jailed
African National Congress black nationalist. Mandela was freed in
1990 and went on to lead South Africa's black majority to a largely
peaceful takeover of the nation's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson
Mandela is a typical distortion by Al Gore,'' Cheney told NBC News'
``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney signaled during his maiden campaign trip with Bush to
Wyoming on Wednesday that many of his conservative votes in the
1980s as a member of the House GOP leadership stemmed from concern
over soaring federal budget deficits. Cheney said he was
``generally proud'' of his voting record but added: ``I'm sure if I
were to go back and look at the individual votes, I could probably
find some that I might tweak and do a bit differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney asked voters to look at his voting decisions ``based upon
the time at which they occurred,'' adding: ``I'm happy to talk
about basic fundamental principles; I think those have been
generally consistent over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, best known for helping to orchestrate the U.S.-led
ouster of Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait during the Persian
Gulf War in 1991, defended his conduct as defense secretary when he
took part in two GOP fund-raisers at the Pentagon. Donors received
policy briefings at the Pentagon from top officials, including
Cheney. ``That's a far cry from the abuses we have seen out of the
Clinton-Gore administration _ White House coffees and selling the
Lincoln bedroom,'' said Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also tried to allay any concerns about his personal
health, after suffering three heart attacks in the 1980s and
undergoing quadruple bypass surgery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he was in fine health. ``I mean, the fact of the
matter is, I wouldn't have taken on this assignment if the doctors
hadn't signed off on it and approved it,'' Cheney said on CBS.

COMMERICALS AREN'T JUST SELLING PRODUCTS; THEY'RE INFLUENCING POP
CULTURE

By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wayans brothers' hit comedy ``Scary Movie'' wields a big
parodic scythe, slicing through such targets as ``Scream,'' ``The
Sixth Sense'' and ``The Matrix.'' Those were all box-office hits,
movies that had comic bull's eyes painted on them _ and to the
Wayanses, mocking is the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Scary Movie'' also spoofs a much briefer form of
entertainment. Actually, it lampoons a sales tool: Budweiser's
``Whassup!'' TV commercials, which feature a bunch of
couch-sitting, phone-talking friends ``Watchin' the game, havin' a
Bud.'' ``Scary Movie'' isn't the only summer film to riff on the ad
campaign; the previews for ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' featured the lovable moose saying ``Whassup!?'' as
well. In fact, a brief article in the July 21 issue of
Entertainment Weekly notes that the commercial campaign has
inspired at least a half-dozen other parodies, including ones
featuring the Super Friends, the ``South Park'' characters, and a
briefly circulated one with Elian Gonzalez and Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even need to have seen the original commercial to know
whassup with that. The ads, which debuted during this year's Super
Bowl, created a catchphrase that has proved so ubiquitous, you're
probably weary of the clown at the next cubicle opening his mouth
as wide as he can and bleating the words. And it's only one example
of an ad that's filtered out to become a bigger part of the
entertainment world _ and everyday life. But not everyone goes
around quoting, say, Mountain Dew commercials, and it's not always
easy to define the quality that makes an ad outgrow its humble
beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really got to do with whether it hits a chord
with consumers,'' says Peter Beckman, founder and chief executive
officer of AdCritic.com, a Web site that displays TV commercials _
including the original ``Whassup'' ad, as well as its spinoffs and
several parodies. ``It's something that can be used in everyday
life, like (Wendy's) `Where's the beef' was in the '80s. I actually
had a teacher write on one of my papers, `Where's the beef?''' Not
to mention that Walter Mondale co-opted it for his 1984 campaign
for the Democratic presidential nomination, and that the slogan
remains so memorable, everyone contacted for this story mentioned
it.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to influential ads than catchphrases. The Gap's
``Khakis swing'' ads, which first appeared in 1998, helped expand
an incipient swing movement (and unlike that short-lived movement,
the ads learned to adapt). Volkswagen's series of music-accompanied
spots have boosted the sales of such cult artists as Trio, Nick
Drake and Spiritualized. MasterCard's ``For everything else,
there's MasterCard'' campaign has been spoofed on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' imitated in a ``Will &AMP; Grace'' promo, and borrowed for an
amusing promo for ``The Tom and Steve Show'' on Fort Worth's
KTCU/88.7 FM. The just-canned ``Yo quiero Taco Bell'' Chihuahua
also inspired an Elian Gonzalez ``drop the chalupa'' parody, as
well as a ``Yo quiero Pachelbel'' billboard for Dallas
classical-music station WRR/101.1 FM.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see these commercials,'' says Bob Garfield, ad
critic for Advertising Age, putting it simply. ``That's the answer.
A lot of people see them. So if it's the music of Nick Drake that
gets people's attention 30 years after he died, or if it's the
swing movement moving into the mainstream, or if it's a talking dog
that people think is just so darn cute, the answer is the same: If
you show the same images enough times, something's going to
click.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a recent phenomenon _ AdCritic's Beckman reminds us
that Coca-Cola's ``I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'' spun off a
hit song in the early '70s, and anyone who was a kid in the late
'60s probably mouthed Alka-Seltzer's ``I can't believe I ate the
whole thing'' slogan at least once _ but our media-drenched world
makes commercials' influence on what we say, listen to and watch
seem even more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is important,'' says Justin Reardon, art director
for DDB Chicago, the ``Whassup'' ad agency. ``Think of `Where's the
beef?' Imagine if the Internet was around back then.'' Or, he
suggests, imagine if the World Wide Web weren't around now. The
``Whassup'' ads and parodies might not be nearly as popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first parody, the Super Friends, wouldn't have had any
impact if it weren't for the Internet,'' he says. ``There's a
snowball effect. People see it online and think, `That's funny,
maybe I could do one of my own.' And then the entertainment
industry sees those, and realizes that it can do its own parodies.
I think the Internet has had a huge impact on this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also affected the campaign is that, in a way, anyone can
do it. Reardon says that not only has he heard radio ``Whassup''
contests, but thanks to the Web, he has heard the spot imitated in
Europe. In advertising, simplicity can be powerful, and Reardon's
not the only person to point that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracts parodies and spoofs are ads with a very, very
identifiable creative template,'' says Nat Puccio, creative
director for New York-based ad agency McCaan Erickson, which
created the MasterCard campaign. ``It has to be very simple, so it
can be repeated over and over, almost the way telling a great joke
is repeated over and over. Great comedians have a template for
their jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   All the ads mentioned here have that trait _ in fact, except for
the MasterCard campaign, they're so simple that they hardly have
any words. Although Volkswagen's ads occasionally contain dialogue,
more often they're just music and cars _ and sometimes, the car
isn't even moving. Many of the ``Whassup'' parodies simply place
someone else in the same positions as the original ad, and have
them mouth the same words. For the past couple of years, the Gap's
campaign has either featured production numbers or young
Gap-dressed people singing baby-boom era pop songs.
</P>
<P>
   Puccio and Reardon both say that the simplicity not only helps
keep the ads in people's minds, it helps them connect emotionally,
which keeps the ads in the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Whassup' stuff is so simple, but it'll still hit viewers
on many levels,'' Reardon says. ``It starts off with friends just
hanging out, and it builds into something with a connection. It
reminds us that some of the strangest and most original moments
we've had have been with our own friends.'' Friendship was key to
the execution of the ads as well; Reardon says that DDB auditioned
comedians and actors for days and days before deciding to cast the
commercial with director Charles Stone III's buddies, because they
gave the spot the proper relaxed mood.
</P>
<P>
   But Garfield adds that sometimes, simplicity doesn't work, and
he's not sure that it's the key. ``I think a better word is
`resonance,''' Garfield says. ``The mechanism is that the
recognition creates a resonance. This gets back to how powerful and
ubiquitous some of these ads are.''
</P>
<P>
   That resonance goes beyond simple emotional connections. The Gap
and Volkswagen commercials, for the most part, are a little bit
chillier than the ``Whassup'' campaign, especially Gap's series of
ads with stone-faced youths singing classic rock and R&AMP;B. But
they're influential for other reasons. Actually, in the case of the
Gap's ``Khakis swing'' ad, it was a matter of being influential by
being influenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gap didn't start the swing trend, but it noticed it and
amplified it,'' says Puccio, the McCaan Erickson spokesman. ``You
have to be where the action is. One of the reasons we pay a lot of
money for office space in Manhattan is that we need to have a bunch
of young creative kids who live in SoHo and are on the edge of
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   By being on that edge, creative teams can come up with ads that
appeal to people of similar ages and tastes. But the appeal of the
Gap and VW ads is more widespread. Older demographics might feel
shut out by a busy, noisy dot-com commercial or one of Nike's
ethereal, jock-driven spots. But the music in the Gap and
especially the VW commercials often crosses generational lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Volkswagen stuff, I think, is brilliant,'' Reardon says.
``Music can be personal, like when you're sitting by yourself or
singing along with it in your car. It can evoke emotions, make you
feel a certain way.'' And VW often chooses music that hasn't
completely saturated the culture, which makes people curious about
the recordings as well as the car, and gives them a subtle
connection to the product being advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the music wasn't invented for the VW commercials _ it
was discovered and/or uncovered for them, much like the nascent
swing trend was put to use for the Gap. Reardon points out that the
``Whassup'' commercials didn't invent the catchphrase, they simply
took advantage of it and popularized it (and also added new
inflections and an over-the-top, tongue-hanging-out way of saying
it).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the culture fuels the commercials, which then
affect the culture. ``It's completely cyclical,'' Puccio says.
``We're all living in the same culture. In many ways, a good
commercial is like a good 30-second movie. It has to tell the
entire story in one image.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all their entertainment value, and all their influence
on other entertainment, it's still hard to determine how effective
many of these ads are as sales tools. You may chortle at the sight
of a bunch of slackers saying ``Whassup'' and ``True, very true,''
but if your tastes run to imported beers, is the ``Whassup''
campaign gonna make you run down to the 7-Eleven and grab a
six-pack of Bud? Puccio gets a kick out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always reminds me of people in nightclubs who say that they
can't be hypnotized, and 10 minutes later they're acting like a
chicken,'' he says. ``At least you have to consciously decide not
to have a Bud. You can't buy what you don't know, and now the idea
has been implanted in your brain. A key rule in advertising is that
you have to be remembered before you can be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   All advertising psychology aside, one fact remains _ many of
these commercials, to use Garfield's word, resonate just because
they're so entertaining. Sometimes, they can be too much of a good
thing (last week's news of the Taco Bell Chihuahua's retirement
wasn't exactly heartbreaking), but often, they're more entertaining
than the shows they support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started (AdCritic.com) almost a year and a half ago, almost
as a hobby,'' Beckman says. ``Now we've been written about in
several magazines. AdWeek contacted us; we've been featured in
Newsweek, People, Time and Vanity Fair. We've actually had guys in
the military thank us for the service we're providing.''

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST MEDIA MOGUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian prosecutors dropped criminal charges Thursday
against media mogul and Kremlin opponent Vladimir Gusinsky, ending
a case that provoked concerns here and abroad that President
Vladimir V. Putin was cracking down on the press.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped on the eve of a meeting between Putin
and Russia's leading businessmen, leading some analysts to suggest
that Putin was switching tactics in his dealings with Russia's most
powerful industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky, who owns Russia's only private television station, was
arrested last month and accused of defrauding the Russian
government of $10 million. Gusinsky spent four days in jail before
being released on condition he not leave Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The travel ban was lifted on Wednesday, and Thursday,
prosecutors unexpectedly announced that there was a ``lack of
evidence that a crime had been committed,'' and dropped the
charges. Gusinsky was informed of the impending decision late
Wednesday night and left immediately for Spain where his family was
staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin understands that the Gusinsky case was harming his image
in the West,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a political analyst with the
Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's case provoked outrage in Russia and abroad. Free
speech advocates said it showed that Putin, a former KGB spy, was
intent on stifling the press and exerting authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before the arrest, masked security police raided
Gusinsky's Media-Most company, which controls the popular NTV
television station, Ekho Moskvy radio and several newspapers and
magazines. Gusinsky's media outlets had harshly criticized Putin,
reported on Kremlin corruption and questioned the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton raised the issue of press freedom in Russia at
a meeting with Putin during last week's Group of Eight summit in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin maintained that Gusinsky's case was about fighting
corruption, not muzzling the media.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky is one of Russia's so-called oligarchs,
politically-connected tycoons who used their government connections
to amass fortunes and wield enormous political power under former
president Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin pledged during his election campaign to establish a level
playing field for business and to rein in the oligarchs. In
addition to Gusinsky's case, law-enforcement bodies have opened
investigations into several other leading business moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Russian prosecutors have sought to reverse the 1997
privatization of giant metals concern Norilsk Nickel, saying it was
sold at an unfairly low price to a well-connected businessman.
Prosecutors have also launched investigations into Russia's largest
car maker, Avtovaz, oil giant Lukoil and the natural gas giant
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, media and oil baron Boris Berezovsky, widely
considered to be the most influential of Russia's tycoons, resigned
his seat in parliament to protest what he called Putin's
heavy-handed tactics. Days before his resignation, prosecutors had
questioned Berezovsky about an estimated $600 million allegedly
embezzled from Russia's national airline Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here said the dropping of Gusinsky's case and Friday's
scheduled meeting in the Kremlin, are signals that Putin has
decided to use more subtle tactics to rein in the moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Markov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said, ``A
message is being sent to the oligarchs that on one hand they don't
have to worry about being arrested, but on the other hand, they
will now need to play by new rules of the game with the Kremlin in
charge.''

MAKING BOOKS: NOVELS THAT SELL, WITHOUT THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: this column appeared in Thursday's New York Times) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To chew over The New York Times' fiction best-seller list is to
be reminded that an author doesn't necessarily need media
anointment or a splendid critical sendoff or an otherwise powerful
launching to be a striking commercial success. Often all it takes
is the gradual accumulation of popularity, the gathering together
of heaps of devotees for the writer's books, one after another,
until there is a critical mass of ardent fans.
</P>
<P>
   This is about commercial, not literary, fiction, and the writers
are not literary celebrities or sensations; rather, they are
first-class practitioners of the art of telling good yarns, mostly
about relationships. There will be three such books on the Aug. 6
best-seller list by authors whose careers have been built not only
on their storytelling, but also largely by careful, nurturing
publishing and word-of-mouth enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling is ``Not a Day Goes By'' (Doubleday) by E.
Lynn Harris, which enters at No. 2 on The Times' list and No. 1 on
the Barnes &AMP; Noble fiction list (and No. 3 on the chain's overall
list). But there was also ``Hot Six'' (St. Martin's Press) by Janet
Evanovich, which opened on The Times' list at No. 1 and is now No.
9; and ``Liar's Game'' (Dutton) by Eric Jerome Dickey, which is No.
14. Harris and Dickey write about relationships; Evanovich writes
steamy crime thrillers featuring the lusty bounty hunter from
Jersey City, Stephanie Plum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a Day Goes By,'' Harris' sixth novel, had a first printing
of 152,000 copies. There are now 212,000 in print. Harris, 42, is
African-American and gay and writes about love and friendship. His
characters are generally young, successful, attractive and black
and gay or bisexual. This is not his first best-selling novel, but
it is his fastest start out of the carton and its success puts him
into a more rarefied category of best-selling authors.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just good writing that goes into the creation of a
blastoff like Harris'. His editor, Janet Hill, said, ``We wanted a
smaller book at an attractive price to be out in time for July, to
be a beach read.'' So the novel is 271 pages, printed in a smaller
format than most hardcovers, and has a list price of $19.95. Which
means that in the doorways of the chain bookstores it can be
purchased for $11.97.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' first novel, ``Invisible Life,'' was self-published (but
later reissued by Doubleday), so the writer is rather sophisticated
about self-promotion. At book signings, he said, ``I spend lots of
time writing long autographs, and I urge people to tell their
friends, and I tell them if they don't like the book bring it back
and I'll give them back their money.'' He also buys blank journals
and fills them with the names and addresses of the fans he meets on
tour _ already more than 7,000 _ and sends them Christmas and
Valentine cards and mass e-mails. (His Web site is
www.elynnharris.com.) Harris also does a lot of interviewing on
black radio programs and goes to nearly every black-oriented
exposition he can.
</P>
<P>
   Do his numbers reflect a large cross-over of white readers? His
publisher, Stephen Rubin, and his agent, John Hawkins, say the
answer is yes, but it's inferential. ``A large number of white
women come up and tell him how much they enjoy his books,'' Rubin
said. ``Probably because his books are first and foremost very
human, the kind of stories people can relate to, whatever their
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-help is the key to the other successes. Evanovich, besides
having a state-of-the-art formula for sexy thrillers, also has a
state-of-the-art Web site (www.evanovich.com), which has the
freshest information available on her books. Generally, she puts
the first chapter of her latest book on the Web site as a teaser
leading up to the publication date; then a week or two later the
second chapter goes on the Web site. After that, it's buy the book!
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shear, publisher of the paperback and reference group of
St. Martin's Press, said, ``If you know what you are doing in your
marketing and with the right timing and with the author pushing and
pushing, you can make it happen.'' It also sends out only a small
number of galleys of Evanovich's books for reviewers only, and not
the usual thousands of advance reading copies.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton published ``Sister, Sister,'' the first novel of Dickey,
who is African-American, in October 1996, and it did so in
hardcover. His editor, Audrey LaFehr, said: ``We started him off
modestly, with no advertising and a small public relations budget,
but in hardcover because we did know that African-Americans buy
hardcover.'' We printed 18,000 copies, rather a large printing for
a first novel, but ended up grossing 40,000 copies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the next one we had a first printing of a little more, in
the low 20,000's, and we sent him on a small tour,'' she added.
``Now he tours for two months and more. He has a huge word-of-mouth
following.'' There are 140,000 copies of ``Liar's Game,'' his fifth
book, in print and that number will probably increase.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the patient, step-by-step creation of nonliterary
fiction best sellers appears so easy, particularly when reviewed
through a publisher's retrospectivescope. Nonetheless, next week we
will find out whether another writer whose novels sold
exponentially better, from a clutter of paperback originals to
hardcover, will jump out of the box to near the top of the lists.
On Tuesday Tami Hoag's fifth hardcover thriller, ``Dust to Dust''
(Bantam Books),'' will be in the marketplace.

 &HT;    E-books: Bedtime for binderies?
 &HT;    By Charlotte Moore,
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead. Turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there you go. Push its little ``Power'' button right there,
then sit back. Relax. Let it tell you a story _ heck, it'll tell
you several stories if you'll open your mind and let it.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Inspect it. Dissect it. Measure its girth and consider how
it feels in your hands. Test it out. Marvel at all the amazing
things it can do. Be excited by the fact that it can store multiple
documents in its memory.
</P>
<P>
   Show it off to your friends. One by one, let them ``oooh'' and
``aaah'' at its countless capabilities. Let them compare it to the
omnipotent computer, its ancestral patron, then pontificate
expertly on its technical innards and how it must operate. Use it
to read your little ones to sleep by the light of lamp, take it
with you when you travel abroad and, first thing in the morning,
use it out on the veranda to read your local daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Take all the time you need. Soon enough the techni-green glow of
its backlight will easily lull you into the anti-climactic
realization of what it is.
</P>
<P>
   For, beneath its obdurate exterior and various buttons, beyond
the magical powers of its stylus wand, it is merely a device for
reading.
</P>
<P>
   It is a book. And all it wants is to tell you a story.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Sullivan is very much a bathtub reader. In fact, she does
some of her best reading and thinking while wrinkling in her
bubble-filled vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take this into the bathtub,'' Sullivan said,
gesturing toward the electronic device before her, as if to ward
off its vile existence.
</P>
<P>
   The device is an electronic book, or e-book as we're commonly
calling them now. E-books are pieces of hardware about the size of
a typical paperback novel that store digital text and graphics,
much like a computer. The term e-book is also used to refer to the
actual data downloaded from a computer and then uploaded into the
e-book hardware. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact year that
e-books were introduced; they've evolved over the past five years
to become a specialized version of a portable computer, much like
laptops and personal digital assistants. While the concept of
e-books is not terribly novel, the buzz of interest within
publishing, author and reader circles across the country has just
begun, likely as an effect of the March release of Stephen King's
66-page novella ``Riding the Bullet.'' Bullet was published online
and downloaded by more than half a million people at little or no
cost. Yet, for all their recent popularity, e-books fall way short
of their conventional counterparts in some areas of functionality.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental differences in reading style
</P>
<P>
   You can't take an e-book device, bend its cover back and palm it
the way you would a paperback novel. You can't turn its pages with
your saliva-smeared finger. You can't use a Bic pen to jot down
notes in the margins of an e-book. You can't absentmindedly toss it
on the coffee table, and you wouldn't willingly relinquish your
pricey device to a friend when you know it'll be years before you
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many practical _ and even for some slightly impractical
_ purposes, electronic books are more than the intimidating
nonsensical gadgets that some traditional book-loving critics have
written them off as being.
</P>
<P>
   By now you familiar with the more popular e-books; NuvoMedia
Inc.'s Rocket eBook, Softbook Press Inc.'s SoftBook Reader and
Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Reader. There are a handful of other,
less popular devices produced by companies like Glassbook Inc. and
Everybook Inc. In general, they all come with memory, touch screen
capabilities, a rechargeable battery and built-in modem. With
minimal instruction, anyone with a credit card and an ounce of
technical skill could easily master the process of downloading
books from various Web sites. Presently, the devices cost anywhere
from $200 to $600 but come with upgrade options and can store
literally thousands of pages of text.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much the technology; we've proven
ourselves to be forward-thinkers with a willingness to welcome
easier, more efficient methods of operation. The problem seems to
be getting avid readers to do away with traditional perceptions of
what is and is not a book.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to estimate the value of e-books than two
self-prescribed bibliomaniacs? Sullivan and her colleague Shannon
Robertson, employees at Book People, weren't the least bit
intimidated by the Rocket eBook they examined for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh ... but wait. They weren't all that impressed, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the handful of locals at this month's Book People
Contemporary Fiction book club, led by Sullivan and Robertson. They
were a comfortable cluster of Austin intellectuals seated snugly
around an antique coffee table in plush vintage high-backed chairs.
They were all equipped with weathered paperback copies of Roddy
Doyle's novel ``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha'' and all were prepared to
delve into deep conversation _ a serious verbal deconstruction of
the month's featured reading.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a brief, haughty chat about e-books, ``that new
technology'' they'd seen on television or heard about on National
Public Radio. While a couple of them admitted to frequently using
their desktop or laptop computers to read excerpts of books or
other snippets of information, none had actually purchased, or even
considered purchasing, a dedicated e-book reading device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be really low down on the list of toys I'd like to
have,'' said one member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading is very important to me,'' said another. ``There is
definitely a sensual component to reading a book that's not
available with that thing. I don't think I'd want to take that to
bed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feature for taking notes but it's not the same as
keeping your pencil behind your ear,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Luddite,'' Sullivan said. ``I just kind of got tired of
looking at it and there's no cover to flip to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan thinks the e-book will appeal most to those people
already predisposed to a technical pursuit of knowledge. ``Most of
the people that are looking at the computer books aren't
necessarily reading massive amounts of theory and the kind of stuff
that we read for fun _ hey, it's a sick world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These are the types of raw _ petty, even _ concerns that arise
when ordinary folks ponder our evolving world of literature.
Bookworms are a proud people who are incited when their senses are
stimulated; they enjoy being attracted by a book's cover, the woody
smell of the pages, the way a bookshelf creaks when it's
overwhelmed by thick, heavy classics.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic books, they say, are asking them to make a mental
transition _ to veer from their ingrained appreciation for the
printed books that fill our nation's more than 120,000 public,
academic and special interest libraries _ to depend on a neoteric
gizmo that disrupts the sacred union between man and book.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the changing world of publishing
</P>
<P>
   Industry players are not as critical. In fact, they appear to be
fastidiously making room for the whole idea of e-books on their
corporate shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-books are just another way of supplying books to people,''
said Patricia Wynn Ricks, local author and owner of Pemberley
Press, which plans to publish two e-books in March 2001. ``The
electronic book will just be one way of delivering a standard book.
It will be convenient for people who travel a lot, people who enjoy
reading off their screen, people who don't have a lot of room to
store books. E-books will be cheaper than traditional books and
they will allow us to reach people at greater distances who don't
have large bookstores near them.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, electronic books are steir embryonic phase.
According to a recent report released by the Association of
American Publishers, only 10 percent of the total 2005 consumer
book market will consist of electronic content publications. But
turn those numbers into actual dollars and the $2.3 billion figure
is a projection publishers cannot easily ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'Riding the Bullet' event was an anomaly,'' said Adam
Rothberg, director of corporate communications for publisher Simon
&AMP; Schuster. ``It was one of those experiences from which we learned
absolutely everything and absolutely nothing. It was on the one
hand an event that was waiting to happen; on the other hand there
were so many variables to it that we cannot make a general
statement from it. The fact that more than 500,000 people were
willing to try the e-book experience was a big positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even small publishing companies are getting in on the digital
action. Eakin Press, an 11-person company in the Central Texas Hill
Country that publishes about 60 titles a year, has sent more than
200 of its books to be digitized by netLibrary, a Colorado-based
outfit that sells collections of digital books to libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get 50 percent of what netLibrary gets and the author gets
50 percent of what we get,'' said Ed Eakin, president of Eakin
Press. ``E-books are just another part of publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are huge in areas of academics. In keeping with
its tradition of striving to offer a competitive education, the
University of Texas is fortifying its libraries with e-book-related
material. Under the UT System Academic Library Collection
Enhancement Program, $1 million a year, for the last three years,
has been allocated by the UT System Board of Regents for the
purpose of purchasing various library aids including 5,000
Web-based e-books currently available to all UT students and
faculty from El Paso to Brownsville. Plans are to purchase another
5,000 to 10,000 e-books next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it as easy as possible for our students to be
able to do high-quality research wherever they are and whenever
they can find time,'' said Dennis Dillon, UT's head of information
resources. ``We have purchased books that are not generally read
from cover to cover or pondered at length. Most of our e-books are
purchased with the expectation that they will be used primarily to
look up quick facts or relevant chapters; or the books are
scholarly in nature and of a type where we expect that the reader
might want to quickly sample several titles on the same subject or
to examine specific chapters. We expect that UT-Austin students
will have access to a minimum of 25,000 Web-based e-books within 12
months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Book People Contemporary Fiction book club members could
certainly appreciate the advantages electronic books might offer in
schools and public libraries. But as for regular old
reading-for-the-simple-pleasure-of reading purposes, they've
already pulled the plug on electronic devices and digital text.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to play with,'' Robertson said. ``But they're up
against a thousand year-old tradition.''

 &HT;    Eddie Murphy dishes out crude humor
 &HT;    `Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'
 &HT;    2 stars
 &HT;    Starring: Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson
 &HT;    Director: Peter Segal
 &HT;    Screenwriters: Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield, Paul and
Chris Weitz
 &HT;    MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude sexual humor, language, unbridled
flatulence jokes
 &HT;    Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only funny parts of Eddie Murphy's 1996 ``The Nutty
Professor'' were the scenes of Professor Sherman Klump's family
rioting at the dinner table like ravenous Teamsters. Between
dripping swallows of barbecue, Sherman, Granny, Mama, Papa and
Ernie _ all played by Murphy upholstered in pillowy pounds of
makeup _ loosed cross-fires of acid banter and gales of gas. There
was a call-of-nature pride to the intestinal expulsions that gave
viewers a liberating glee, and a blush.
</P>
<P>
   The bloated sequel, ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' extracts
and magnifies those bawdy interludes, elevating the Klump clan to
bona fide stars, each with a subplot to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   The ambition is admirable, but it's too much on top of the main
plot, a many-tentacled mess unsure if it wants to be a
Farrelly-style gross-out or a sweet romantic comedy. It involves
Sherman's jerky alter ego Buddy Love re-emerging in order to steal
a lucrative youth serum Sherman has invented.
</P>
<P>
   There are all manner of crude gags, as well as tender longueurs
about Sherman and his girlfriend Denise (a blandly pleasant Janet
Jackson in the blank and reactive love interest role). Oddly,
there's not a whisper about Ms. Purdy, Sherman's paramour in part
one.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a lurching series of elaborate comic situations
peppered with funny lines, is overburdened and wild-eyed. It works
every angle, but the funniest bits, again, are the basest: the
Klumps at the dinner table cussing and cutting. It's worth noting
that our bulbous hero Sherman is the apologetic straight man in
these scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klumps'' is sweeter and smarter than its formulaic
predecessor. The movie's big-budget, high-concept overload and
juggling of multiple themes recalls, if never attains, the comic
grandeur of ``Ghostbusters,'' and it jitters with almost as many
special effects. Yet for all its ambition, the Murphy vehicle is
curiously routine, never veering outside the
lowest-common-denominator lines.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Love still lurks in Sherman, a courtly scientific genius
barred from social success by his 400-pound girth. He's a globular,
jiggly mensch with turkey-sausage fingers.
</P>
<P>
   As the embodiment of Sherman's sexually repressed id, Love pops
out with testosteronic vengeance, a spray of noxious virility on
the prowl. He emerges in Sherman with Tourette's syndrome-like
outbursts that threaten to sabotage his relationship with Denise.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's Disney-inspired scientific world, Sherman
undergoes a gene-removal procedure to expel Love once and for all.
It backfires with dire results. And through a freak accident far
too complicated to describe _ it concerns a dog hair and a jar of
the bad Buddy gene _ Buddy springs to life in the form of Eddie
Murphy's unadorned body.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1963 Jerry Lewis original and Murphy's '96 knockoff,
Love's motivation was to score with the ladies. This time he's a
standard-issue villain after a standard-issue potion. Love is the
only role Murphy plays in his own skin, and he's amped him up
several ratchets into a shrill and diabolical maniac, running
around screaming with his mouth wide open. Sometimes he acts like a
dog.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a dog. You're excused if you're lost. A quartet of
screenwriters, including ``American Pie'' gross-mongers Chris Weitz
and Paul Weitz, keep piling layers to the story. There's Granny
Klump cavorting like an oversexed vixen and Papa Klump guzzling the
youth serum to up his sex life. Much of it is very funny; much more
of it is lame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klumps'' has a big heart that miraculously renders the
foul family sympathetic, even genial. But attempts at real
emotional resonance _ the movie can be downright maudlin _ are
thinly contrived. Sorrows are short-lived and quickly reversed. We
never make an investment we're afraid of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's a comic wonder as the cantankerous Klumps. He etches
the characters with perceptive realism into people we might know.
But the film has no center of gravity. Rapid-fire gags and deft
editing sustain a zippy pace, but it starts to blur in the heedless
pattern of a spinning top. When a hamster grows to a ferocious
20-feet-tall and sodomizes a character, the movie glances a wall,
sputters, and falls on its side.

   COLOMBIA-INTRO _ With the highest murder and kidnapping rates in
the world, a raging civil war, the worst recession in memory and
plummeting public confidence in the army and the government,
Colombia is facing the most dire crisis in its history. Thousands
of people are fleeing the country, while human rights activists
estimate another 1 to 2 million have been displaced internally by
repeated attacks by leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary
groups. We profile two groups _ kidnap victims and displaced people
_ as a window into everyday life in Colombia. (Williams, Cox News

   COLOMBIA-KIDNAP _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families come to the
national radio station each week, clutching hand-written notes they
hope will somehow reach their kidnapped relatives. With an average
of 8 kidnappings a day, Colombia is a nation living in fear.
Leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups have turned kidnapping
into a big business _ some 3,000 victims were snatched last year -
to raise money for their armies. We profile a few families of
kidnap victims who hope against hope they will somehow see their
loved ones again. (Williams, Cox News Service).

   COLOMBIA-DISPLACED _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona watched
warring leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries battle in
her remote village for months, dodging bullets and hiding with her
five children. Finally, she fled, abandoning her small store and
restaurant, eventually making her way to Bogota, where she is now
homeless. Barahona is one more victim in the tidal wave of 1 to 2
million Colombians - mostly rural peasants - displaced by the
country's civil war. Human rights activists fear the US aid package
may only increase the flow of refugees as poor campesinos are
forced out of the countryside by crop eradication programs and the
escalating war between guerrillas and the Colombian army.

   MEXICO-MIGRATION _ SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHAS, Mexico _ Like
millions of other young Mexicans, Eusebio de Haro set out for the
United States in May, confident he'd find work like he did before.
Instead De Haro was shot to death, allegedly, by an elderly Texas
rancher after he and another young man knocked on his door to ask
for water in a remote area near the Rio Grande. The option to the
United States for work is as deeply ingrained in De Haro's home
state as the Virgin of Guadalupe. But it is an option that appears
to be getting more deadly every day for those who choose to cross
the border illegally. Migration is probably the toughest of all
issues between these two countries. And Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox, who is from De Haro's home state, has heightened the
profile even more, suggesting more visas for Mexican workers and
working toward an open border for the free flow of labor in as
little as 10 years. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   WITH MIGRATION-SIDE _ GUANAJUATO, Mexico _ Migration has
affected some towns in Fox's Guanajuato state where state social
workers attend to abandoned families and other problems. They're
also encouraging successful migrants to invest in communities to
create jobs there. These are towns that send construction workers
to Arkansas, laborers and harvestors to Texas and Georgia and
others states. We tell it from the perspective of a young social
worker we watched in action. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH

hire more than 200,000 workers to do that. Currently, new stores
open on the average of one every 43 hours. No problem, says Home

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of
naval history, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley has been
buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor - lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    PROBE INTO VICIOUS KILLING OF MEXICAN CLERIC ENDS AS IT BEGAN -
IN CONTROVERSY
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It was a spectacularly brutal assassination that
ushered in a new era of drug-related violence in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Assailants wielding automatic weapons blasted away at a Mexican
Catholic cardinal _ who was dressed in his vestments and crucifix _
as his car was entering the parking lot of Guadalajara's
international airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a special commission that probed the seven-year-old
murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo ended as it began _
with divided opinions over whether Posadas was killed accidentally
or on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In a painstaking presentation, Mexico's Attorney General's
Office described testimony by numerous jailed participants who said
Posadas was killed ``out of confusion, an error over vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The official story, which has been on the record for years, is
that Posadas was probably shot in his white Grand Marquis car by
hired guns working for Mexico's notorious Arellano Felix brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tijuana-based drug traffickers' leader, Ramon, is on the
FBI's ``10 Most-Wanted'' list. At the time of the killing, the
Arellanos were engaged in a vicious fight to control
cocaine-smuggling routes into the United States. Some of the
alleged killers were recruited from San Diego, Calif., just over
the border from Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Their target on May 23, 1993, was trafficker Joaquin Guzman,
whose wife also reportedly drove a white Grand Marquis, the
Attorney General's report said.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic Church representatives and members of the state
government of Jalisco, where the killing took place, disagreed with
the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the product of an accident,'' said Fernando
Guzman, a high-ranking aide in the Jalisco state government. He is
not related to Joaquin Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   State and church officials participated in the commission, which
met 23 times to discuss the case. But they remain convinced that
Posadas was the specific target of a conspiracy that killed his
driver and others in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The initial investigation, which quickly pointed toward the
Arellano Felix brothers, was ``deficient and manipulated,'' Guzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects were coerced and their testimony was suspicious because
some was identical, down to ``commas and periods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials since proved to be corrupt were involved in the case.
Some of the assailants were able to board a plane to Tijuana and
escape the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But assistant Attorney General Jose Luis Ramos said federal
officials had exhausted other leads and that alleged witnesses with
alternative information had failed lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was the product of hired guns that were paid
$15,000, and in a ``burst of adrenaline'' attackd the cardinal's
white car from the rear, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs with nicknames like ``the white crab'' and ``the black
marshal'' told officials they thought they were killing Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was an extraordinarily kind
man, with no enemies, and no reason existed for a group of drug
traffickers to take his life,'' Ramos said.

 ART ADVISORY: With two photos, of Samira Omar (NNS6) and teachers
at American Creativity Academy in Kuwait (NNS7) 
 By PAM LOUWAGIE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She looks every bit New York, dressed smartly in a gray
pantsuit, a flower-printed scarf fashionably flung around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Scientist Samira Omar, the head honcho of a research institute,
supervises dozens of environmental research projects every year.
From her book-filled office, she directs a staff that includes
several men.
</P>
<P>
   But as a woman in a still-traditional Arab society, Omar doesn't
have the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Women ``do have influence at the professional level,'' said
Omar, who has a doctorate. ``But the most important thing, they
deprive us from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the living oxymoron that is Kuwait. In a modern
Middle Eastern country where Western ideas are infiltrating much of
society, balancing the Westernization with traditional Arab values
is proving a difficult juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   It's evident everywhere: Stores in elaborate new malls are
filled with tank tops and miniskirts that the culture says women
are not allowed to wear. Satellite dishes adorn nearly every house,
but Islam condemns their provocative content. Kuwaiti women have
outpaced men in attendance at Kuwait University, but they're not
allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   As in many societies, Kuwaitis say change is coming through its
young people and its women, with teen-agers rebelling against Arab
traditions such as wearing robes and women becoming more educated
and taking on bigger jobs. At the same time, religious
fundamentalists are working to push the society back to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait is ``a mixture of everything,'' political scientist
Masoumah Al-Mubarak said. ``Change is everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On the seaside edge of Kuwait City, change has hit like a
tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   It's where the younger generations hang out, driving their
Mercedes and BMWs to sleek shopping centers, watching each other
parade around Starbucks in snug-fitting outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Ali Eslami, 20, strode into an Internet cafe wearing
bluejeans and a skateboarding T-shirt, and carrying an e-mail
address containing the words ``boyz2men.''
</P>
<P>
   He often goes to the cafe to chat in person or online, he said.
And he dresses in the traditional male attire, white robes called
dishdashas, only when his father asks him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a kid, I never liked traditional wear. For two to
three hours, I will wear it ... when (Father) wants to visit one of
his friends and he says, `You've got to respect that guy,''' said
Eslami, twiddling the cord of his cell phone's earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the new generation is really Westernized,'' said Hamed
Al-Azemi, taking his two children to the Internet cafe to do
research for a school project because their home computer had
broken. ``Whatever they see, they want to bring it into Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   What they see is part of the problem, some Kuwaitis say.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a country wealthy from oil money, Kuwaitis are
frequent travelers, taking long vacations in the summer to escape
the desert heat that often nears 130 degrees. Technology such as
satellite dishes and Internet connections is everywhere. Cellular
phones have become such an important part of the Kuwaiti attire
that people pay extra for an easy-to-remember number.
</P>
<P>
   Such access to images of the world has opened a market in Kuwait
for Western restaurants, products and movies. Some believe it also
has created more problems in the country, encouraging the use of
alcohol and illegal drugs, which Islam forbids, and increasing the
number of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   So the Kuwaiti government has tried to mitigate Western culture.
Outside a theater, a movie poster with a man and woman kissing has
a magazine cut-out of a face covering their lips. Inside a TGI
Friday's restaurant, the bar menu is filled with nonalcoholic
daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the infiltration of Western values is proving
impossible to control. Though Islamic culture forbids
American-style dating, teen-age boys now zip down a waterfront road
on motorcycles, carrying girlfriends who hug them from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never see this before,'' Khaled Al-Ghanem, 36, said
with disgust as a motorcycle whizzed by. ``A guy with a girl on his
bike!''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti society has even become more accepting of homosexuality,
said a 38-year-old biomedical engineer who is gay. ``It's more
Westernized. They accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonalcoholic beer made its way onto store shelves recently, but
officials considered banning it when they found it contained a
trace of alcohol. That apparently hasn't stopped the demand for
black-market alcohol, often available at underground parties,
Kuwaitis say.
</P>
<P>
   Even drugs are smuggled into the country. And violence has
turned more serious, with Kuwaitis retaining some of the weapons
they acquired for defense during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you scratch a car now, they will fight you without saying
anything,'' Eslami said.
</P>
<P>
   Many traditional laws still apply, though.
</P>
<P>
   A famous Kuwaiti singer made newspaper headlines this spring
after police caught him in a compromising position with another
man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the young people, women are most responsible for shaking
social change in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait historically has been more progressive than its Islamic
neighbors. Kuwaiti women have been allowed to seek high-level
professional jobs and now hold positions such as Kuwait University
president, ambassador and planning ministry head.
</P>
<P>
   But women still aren't allowed to vote or hold elected political
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have influence at the professional level. And as
housewives, women decide everything in the home. ... But the most
important thing, they deprive them from it,'' said Omar, who became
a women's activist while studying at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``It bothers me a lot. I don't want to feel I'm less
intelligent or less important than my colleagues just because they
are male.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traditionalists say Islam prohibits women's involvement in
politics, though women in other Middle Eastern countries where the
religion predominates, such as Iran, are allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of Kuwait's emir, the parliament took a vote on
women's suffrage in 1999. The motion failed 32-30, but many Kuwaiti
women say the narrow margin is a good sign of change to come.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the changes would be much slower if it weren't for the
Gulf War, which raised political awareness among all Kuwaitis and
made women take more active roles in providing for their families.
Though Iraqi soldiers often took Kuwaiti men prisoner, women
typically were allowed to go freely about their business. So, many
women went out to get parts to repair things in their homes or buy
supplies for their families. Some were part of an underground
resistance, transporting weapons and hiding foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women felt that if they can do it during the invasion,
they can do it after liberation,'' said Lubna Al-Qadi, a Kuwait
University sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   For petroleum engineer Sara Akbar, the war was an opportunity to
show heroism, and she is considered a leader in the women's
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar, an employee of Kuwait Oil Co., organized one of the first
teams to extinguish oil wells torched by retreating Iraqi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all the fields by heart,'' Akbar said modestly.
</P>
<P>
   When she and a team surveyed some of the oil wells and found one
gushing, she had someone simply turn off its valve. The rest
started from there.
</P>
<P>
   After putting out 42 well fires in 45 days -- a world record,
Akbar is quick to mention -- she is now pictured in films and
brochures about the fires.
</P>
<P>
   She said many other women helped during and after the war, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw these women have something strong in them,'' Akbar said.
``But they're not in positions where they would be because of ...
male dominating'' society.
</P>
<P>
   Though women have been making political strides in the past
decade, ``the tide of Islam is trying to push it back,'' Al-Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women are divided, too. Many want to embrace their heritage
and choose to dress traditionally and hold traditional roles in
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Mubarak said many women agree with the women's rights
movement but are afraid to show it. Some quietly applaud suffrage
leaders when they meet at a function or in a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call them the silent majority,'' she said. ``Some don't
have the time (to join the women's movement), or some fear what
their husbands will say.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   For the dozens of Americans living here, Kuwait is slowly
looking more like home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely not stuck out in the desert somewhere,''
said school Principal Lisa Al-Ramly, who grew up in Kokomo, Ind.
``But it hasn't always been like this.''
</P>
<P>
   American items such as chocolate chips used to be rarities in
grocery stores, but now Americans say they can find almost
anything. American restaurants are plentiful, though they're
modified to work in Arab culture: They contain no pork or alcohol.
Even A&AMP;W advertises ``root drink'' instead of root beer.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters have become more common, though films and even
movie posters are edited for content deemed too immodest. And as
modern and wealthy as Kuwait is, some primitive ways of doing
business persist, Americans there say.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners spending time in the country quickly notice a few
things: Kuwaiti nationals live in elaborate villas -- the
apartments are for the workers -- and only they can enjoy certain
benefits such as owning property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a social status. Kuwaitis are at the top of the food
chain, then the Westerners, and the Americans are at the top of
that,'' said Jesse Ruiz, 31, who has a civilian job at a military
base.
</P>
<P>
   As in America, getting things done requires influence and
connections. Mail is often slow and isn't sorted by machine, but by
laborers. Some infrastructure, such as water systems, is not on par
with that in the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as much money as they have ... they could go a lot further
with it,'' said Brenda Gange-Murad, who grew up in Seattle and has
lived in Kuwait for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Americans say they have seen Kuwait change quickly in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more open, a lot more Western,'' said Fatema Lynn,
who grew up in Kalamazoo, Mich., and has lived in Kuwait for 13
years. ``It probably would have happened anyway. It probably
happened faster because there are more Americans here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis are split on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the country has changed quickly because so many
Kuwaitis fled during the Iraqi invasion and spent seven months out
of the country, where they picked up Western habits.
</P>
<P>
   Others laugh at that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to connect this issue with seven months of
being out of the country,'' Al-Mubarak said, pointing out that
Kuwaitis have long had the money to travel the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, many in Kuwait say they expect society will
keep battling and adjusting. As Omar says, conflict in social
change is inevitable: ``It happens in every society when it moves
forward.''

 ART ADVISORY: With photo of Abdul Hameed Al-Attar (NNS5) 
 By PAM LOUWAGIE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He hears the muffled, pleading shouts replay in his mind every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father, I'm in here! I'm in here!''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Abdul Hameed Al-Attar has lived with the
chilling memories of his 26-year-old son Jamal's cries, the last
words of a young man taken prisoner in his own neighborhood by
Iraqi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He's heard the horrific stories about the torture Kuwaiti
prisoners endured during the Persian Gulf War, cooped up in cement
cellars without food, forced to do unfathomable acts such as drink
their own urine, enduring Iraqi soldiers zapping them with
electricity or cutting off their genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining his son dead is almost easier than imagining the
torture. ``I always see him in my eyes as insane, out of his mind
from the torture,'' Al-Attar said, his hazel eyes shiny with welled
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after Iraqi soldiers consumed the oil-rich emirate and
allied forces drove them back, Kuwait is still missing 605 of its
own, quite a lot given there are only about 650,000 Kuwaiti
nationals in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kuwaiti families are missing a relative or friend. And
that's why accounting for the missing is still a major issue.
Yellow ribbons and the slogan ``Remember our POWs'' adorn
everything from private business cards to billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows somebody. ... Those things keep reminding
us,'' said Sara Akbar, a petroleum engineer with three missing
co-workers and a neighbor who was abducted while fetching food for
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important to us,'' Al-Attar said indignantly.
``The Iraqis refuse to give us answers about any of them. They
refuse to give us information.''
</P>
<P>
   A nagging guilt drives Al-Attar to volunteer every night at a
center for the missing, where other parents like him are still
wondering about their children. He can't rest until he knows for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, formally called the Council for Missing and POW
Affairs, pictures of the missing are tacked neatly on a wall to
form a memorial behind iron bars and barbed wire: A smiling
14-year-old boy was taken away as he scrawled ``Long live Kuwait''
on a building; a relative of a member of the Kuwaiti Parliament who
once supported Saddam Hussein but spit in an Iraqi soldier's face
during the invasion disappeared; and there's Al-Attar's son.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Attar often cries when he speaks to groups about his son. He
carries extra copies of the photo with him to remind people of the
horrors that came at the hands of Iraqis and to tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watch of enemy soldiers, Al-Attar happened to see his
son while Jamal was out with members of a small resistance
movement, an activity that made a protective father nervous. They
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Take care of yourself.' He said, `Don't worry,
Father, I am OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Jamal was snatched by Iraqi soldiers. As Al-Attar
pleaded with guards at the police station, Jamal heard his father's
voice and shouted to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in here!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last the two heard from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I blame myself,'' Al-Attar said. ``Was I followed
by the Iraqi police? That's the only explanation I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq denies that it has any Kuwaiti prisoners, but Kuwaitis say
they know otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Until each missing person is accounted for, Kuwaitis have vowed
they will not stop searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot help checking and asking,'' Al-Attar said. ``These
are our people.''

 ART ADVISORY: With two photos, of restaurants (NNS3) and Hazem
Jaber Ahmad (NNS4)
 By PAM LOUWAGIE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the weekend, time for Fozan Muhammed and his wife to
abandon their large house in the city, load their two children into
the Jeep, hitch up their boat and head for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The date was Aug. 1, 1990. Soldiers from neighboring Iraq were
threatening their tiny Persian Gulf emirate, disputing borders and
control over oil, but many Kuwaitis weren't fretting. Political
leaders were talking and many figured it would be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was thinking that things were getting cleared up,''
Muhammed said. ``There were no worries.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and his family hit the highway for a 45-minute drive to
their seaside ``chalet'' for a reprieve from the ovenlike heat.
They slept peacefully that night.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, their country was gone.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours, Iraqi soldiers had occupied all 6,900
square miles of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slept as Kuwaitis and woke up as Iraqis,'' said Sara Akbar,
a petroleum engineer. ``We lost our identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mass confusion filled the road back to Kuwait City. People drove
the wrong way on streets, desperate to escape Iraqi checkpoints.
Desert-beige tanks lined some roads. Muhammed and his family heard
bombing and shooting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Panic blanketed the country for nearly seven months, as Iraqi
soldiers ransacked houses, raped women and gathered families to
witness the execution of a husband or father.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy Kuwaitis used to traveling the world suddenly felt a
trip across town was too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out of money, out of everything, out of country,''
Muhammed said. ``It's a strange feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Months of economic sanctions and intense negotiations by the
United Nations and the United States failed to persuade Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops and release his
choke hold on the world's oil supply and thousands of Westerners
trapped in Kuwait. So on Jan. 16, 1991, the United States and its
allies simultaneously started bombing the Iraqi capital of Baghdad
and parts of Kuwait to drive out Iraqi troops. When Operation
Desert Storm ended 42 days later, more than 500,000 American troops
had left home, families, friends and careers to answer the call.
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of the Iraqi invasion approaches, Kuwaitis
speak matter-of-factly about the conflict that changed their lives,
the rebuilding process and the unease they still feel about Iraq.
Most of the physical signs of war are gone. Roads torn up by tanks
have been paved smooth. Buildings once pockmarked from artillery
have been restored, and yards are cheery with blooming flowers.
Downtown, fancy cars buzz between tall buildings. Men in
traditional white robes carry briefcases into posh offices.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Kuwait looks like a modern, prosperous place
where locals have rebuilt their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Memories aren't cleaned up so easily, though.
</P>
<P>
   While many Westerners dismiss the Gulf War as a tidy conflict
that America dominated, Kuwaitis are still haunted by the gruesome
memories and by doubt about the country's own defenses and its role
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cleaned our houses, but our insides are still affected. You
feel the fear,'' said Masoumah Al-Mubarak, a political scientist at
Kuwait University. ``There's fear inside every Kuwaiti.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear has turned Hazem Jaber Ahmad into a war machine.
</P>
<P>
   A resistance organizer during the Gulf War, Ahmad has nightmares
about the day he watched his friends die.
</P>
<P>
   He and 18 other resisters knew the war was coming to an end, so
they gathered in a house in the middle of a neatly kept subdivision
to planfor the country's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the conversation in detail,'' Ahmad said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted after nearly seven months of secretly plotting against
Iraqi occupiers, they sat on the home's pink carpet and
wide-striped couch, where they dared to think about life returning
to normal, joking and envisioning a peaceful vacation Ahmad and two
others planned to take in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, a knock at the door changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi soldier stood outside, and the Kuwaiti resisters
grabbed their guns to defend themselves. A first shot launched a
10-hour battle that eventually included about 700 Iraqi soldiers
laying siege to the house with tanks and guns.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ahmad's friends was killed when shrapnel ripped into his
arm and side. Several others were shot when Iraqis stormed the
house. The two he planned to vacation with died.
</P>
<P>
   When the battle became too much, Ahmad climbed into a ceiling
crawl space and hid, listening for hours to the horrors of war
around him.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of only seven survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Now called the Al-Quarain House, the building stands untouched
as a museumlike memorial. Shattered plaster littering the floor and
dried blood spattered on the wall serve as reminders of the human
price of war.
</P>
<P>
   The memories have driven Ahmad to prepare his mind and body for
future battles. He has spent the past decade studying weapons and
resistance methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Iraqis come again, I want to do more,'' said Ahmad, a
33-year-old policeman. ``Now I have the ability to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   It's memories like Ahmad's -- the nightmares, the stress of
knowing the enemy's leader is still in power just miles away --
that nag at Kuwaitis and keep the society strapped with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Horrific war crimes were reported during and after the war.
Amnesty International said Iraqi forces killed and tortured
hundreds of Kuwaitis, sometimes gouging out eyes or cutting off
tongues, ears or genitals; raping women; and leaving a dead Kuwaiti
hanging from a crane for others to see. One report said Iraqis left
more than 300 premature babies to die after stealing their
incubators from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more cautious now,'' Akbar said. ``It's like when a
person gets bit by a snake: Every time he sees a rope moving, he
thinks it's a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there is a hint of trouble along the Iraq-Kuwait
border, people flock to grocery stores as if preparing for a
hurricane. Most families own a sport-utility vehicle capable of
plowing through desert sand in case they need to flee another
invasion. More are stashing money in foreign banks where they can
reach it if their country is invaded again, Kuwaitis said.
</P>
<P>
   Violent-crime rates have risen in the country, where citizens
possess weapons left over from the war.
</P>
<P>
   They live every day knowing their comforts can slip out from
under them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to keep her china only for the guests,'' one
Kuwaiti said. ``Then the Iraqis took it. She said she wished she
had enjoyed it more with her family.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the anger is directed at Saddam, who continues to
resurrect threats as he rules Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's there, we can never be safe,'' said Khaled
Al-Ghanem, a Kuwaiti insurance broker.
</P>
<P>
   The only sense of safety comes from the U.S. soldiers and other
troops standing guard at Camp Doha, a permanent base about 20 miles
from Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   Financed mostly by the Kuwaiti government, the troops stand to
ward off aggression from Iraq's army. Nobody knows for sure how
long they will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy kilometers from here are 1 million Iraqi soldiers
waiting to kill you,'' Lt. Col. Robert Costello of the Army
Reserve's 377th Theater Support Command in New Orleans told the
group during a recent training mission. Although considered a war
game by some, ``we don't play games here,'' Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kuwaitis are grateful to have the troops there, they also
worry that America's presence has caused Kuwait to lose its status
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing they appear to be a puppet of the superpower, they
wonder whether the United States is quietly playing one country
against another for its own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you guys,'' said investment manager Khalid Al-Habib,
while relaxing at a ``diwaniyah,'' a weekly Kuwaiti social
gathering where men in white robes drink tea and discuss politics.
``But ... you don't know how embarrassed we are when other states
say we are agents of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Kuwait and Iraq had existed for 30 years, by
some estimates. Kuwait often bought off Iraqi aggression, even
supporting Iraq to the tune of billions of dollars during the
Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. But in 1990, Iraq claimed Kuwait had
stolen billions from Iraq's oil fields by drilling slanted wells
across the border. A decade later, bombings often still occur after
Iraqis try to shoot down U.S. planes patroling a no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   And with Saddam still in power, the United Nations continues to
closely monitor Iraq's activities. Banned from most international
trade because of its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq is allowed to sell
oil to buy food and medicine for its people, and spare parts to
rebuild its oil industry, destroyed in Operation Desert Storm. But
U.N. inspectors fear Iraq also might restart the nuclear weapons
program it was forced to dismantle after the war.
</P>
<P>
   For Kuwait, that could mean that their Western defenders will be
with them for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis realize their country was rescued because of the oil
flowing under it. ``We like the fact that they (America) said from
the beginning they were here to take care of their own interests as
well as take care of Kuwait,'' Al-Ghanem said. ``We used to joke,
`Why do we have to worry? Why don't we just ask the States to make
it 51 states?'''
</P>
<P>
   American business came into the country en masse to help
extinguish more than 700 oil-well fires that retreating Iraqi
soldiers had set ablaze. Smoke covered the country for months,
turning daylight into dusk even at high noon.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, American influence on the culture has become
evident; in the past 10 years, Chili's, TGI Friday's, Fuddrucker's,
McDonald's and Applebee's have built restaurants near Kuwait City's
beaches and have become hot spots for teens. Calvin Klein jeans and
other U.S. goods fill fancy malls.
</P>
<P>
   In a traditionally conservative Islamic society, that's not
necessarily the kind of influence the locals want.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trendy food and clothes, ``teach me about technology,
hospitals, cars, education,'' Al-Habib said, ``not burritos.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kuwait's physical recovery was swift, the government
still is working on healing the emotional scars the war brought. In
an emirate rich with social welfare, the programs for emotional
healing are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the war ended, the emir created a special
government agency to coddle families of the ``Martyrs,'' the 589
Kuwaitis killed during the Gulf War. A social agency helps take
care of their children, following each child's school progress.
Psychologists help all family members deal with their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to replace the father,'' said Torky Al-Anboy, a
manager at the agency. ``Especially for the kids who saw their
fathers being killed before their eyes, we need to break the hate
inside them. ... Instead of being aggressive, we need to bring them
back to normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But as some Kuwaitis can attest, with war memories still fresh
in their hearts and an enemy leader still in power next door, life
as they knew it before the war might never return. As reminders,
war monuments dot the country, and yellow ribbons adorn signs,
business cards and bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Faiyza Al-Shubaiki, another worker at the government agency,
pulled out a thick photo album filled with photographs of dead
Kuwaitis, their bodies bruised, singed from acid or charred from
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know what happened,'' Al-Shubaiki said.
``Some people don't know about the torture. All they know was that
Kuwait was invaded and liberated.''

   KUWAIT-RECOVERY _ Ten Years After Gulf War, Kuwait Remains Wary
(First of two articles; with sidebar, `KUWAIT-MISSING') (KUWAIT
CITY, Kuwait) On the surface, Kuwait looks like a modern,
prosperous place where locals have rebuilt their lives. Memories
aren't cleaned up so easily, though. As the 10th anniversary of the
Iraqi invasion approaches, Kuwaitis are still haunted by the
gruesome memories of war and by doubt about the country's own

   KUWAIT-MISSING _ Families Still Search for Those Absent Since
War (With ``KUWAIT-RECOVERY'') (KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait) Ten years the
Iraqi invasion, Kuwait is still missing 605 of its own -- quite a
lot given there are only about 650,000 Kuwaiti nationals in the
country. Most Kuwaiti families are missing a relative or friend.
And that's why accounting for the missing is still a major issue.
Yellow ribbons and the slogan ``Remember our POWs'' adorn

<P>
   KUWAIT-CULTURE _ Western Culture Transforming Country (Second of
two articles) (KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait) Kuwait is a living oxymoron. In
a modern Middle Eastern country where Western ideas are
infiltrating much of society, balancing the Westernization with
traditional Arab values is proving a difficult juggling act. As in
many societies, Kuwaitis say change is coming through its young
people and its women, with teen-agers rebelling against Arab
traditions such as wearing robes and women becoming more educated
and taking on bigger jobs. At the same time, religious
fundamentalists are working to push the society back to tradition.

   House slaves, says Joan Johnson, were often misjudged.
</P>
<P>
   They were viewed as docile and loyal, she says, when, in fact,
``they were spitting in their (masters') food, urinating in their
food to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't do is the upfront thing,'' the 66-year-old
suburban public official says, describing that as a lesson
hard-learned by black Americans in slavery and segregation. ``It
has helped me to get where I am today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand on the edge of history because I learned survival
skills as a child growing up in the South, that when I hear racist
and bigoted stuff in the North that I thought didn't exist, I just
simply bide my time and say, `I'll have my opportunity someday.'''
</P>
<P>
   That day is now, and Johnson's perch on the lip of history is
more than a rhetorical flourish.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade as the elected town clerk of Islip, N.Y.,
Johnson is the Republican Party's anointed choice to succeed Rick
Lazio as New York's 2nd District representative in Congress. That
makes her at least even money to become the first black Republican
women ever elected to Congress. She would also double black
Republican representation on Capitol Hill, joining J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, at a time when the Republican Party is desperate to
demonstrate greater appeal to black and brown Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's candidacy is, of course, thrilling to folks like
Ronald Radford Sr., president of Suffolk County's 35-year-old
Afro-American Republican Club.
</P>
<P>
   But her selection also delights more than a few black Democrats
in her Long Island district, who are instantly better situated to
make demands on their own party now that it's not the only one
seriously contending for black votes. It's a scenario that the
nation's small cadre of black Republicans has promoted for years,
but one that seldom had the benefit of a compelling and concrete
example.
</P>
<P>
   And while her prospective opponents dismiss her as a well-worn
cog in the Republican machine whose experience best qualifies her
to continue issuing peddler's permits and marriage licenses, the
Joan Johnson who emerges from an interview in her campaign office
along quaint Main Street is the anti-clerk, a black woman liberated
and on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to black people across this country is you should
divorce the Democratic Party for non-support,'' she declares.
``Look at your lives. Individuals have benefited, but they don't
seem to be able to translate that back to your community. Why
haven't they been bartering their votes to bring things to their
communities? ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one group in the country that gives 85 percent of
its vote to one party. No group. No group,'' she roars. ``People
just getting off the boat don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthy,'' said Paul Johnson, past president of the
Suffolk County Council of Black Democrats, of his unrelated
namesake's selection by the rival party.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a retired public relations executive with the Long
Island Lighting Co., is supporting Steve Israel, a councilman in
his hometown of Huntington, who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for Lazio's seat. But, he said, ``This is a wake-up call
for everybody. Generally we're given a chance to run for something
we can't win, just to bring out the black vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, in addition to Joan Johnson, there are only two other
black elected officials in Suffolk County -- a Democratic town
clerk in Babylon and a Republican judge from Islip.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, we just got outflanked,'' said Leonard
F. Canton Jr., one of those black Democrats who has run and lost in
Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   But Canton's second reaction was to join an effort by
like-minded black Democrats in the town of Babylon to field a
29-year-old black woman lawyer, Ghenya Grant, for the Democratic
nomination for Congress. Canton and his allies are angered at what
they consider a long history of being taken for granted and
double-dealed by the Democratic powers-that-be locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They betrayed us. They are going to feel our rage,'' said
Eugene Burnett, who chairs the Babylon Town Caucus of Black
Democrats and is mentoring Grant's candidacy. ``It would be
interesting, two African-American women running for Congress on
Long Island. I'd love that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of one African-American woman running for Congress
on Long Island has proved plenty interesting as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shocker; it took everybody by surprise,'' said Delano
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was Jesse Jackson's Long Island campaign
coordinator in 1984, publishes Point of View, a monthly
African-American newspaper in Suffolk. When Suffolk Republicans
announced the choice of Johnson, Stewart wrote that it was, to some
observers, ``a stroke of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The district is only about 10 percent black, and another 10
percent Hispanic. But if, as he believes, Johnson can pull up to
half the black vote -- which usually votes more than 90 percent
Democratic -- it could make the difference in a district that
overwhelmingly re-elected Lazio yet also decisively voted for
President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson notes that she has outpolled white running mates in town
elections, even providing some crossover coattails. But others
wonder whether these mostly white Republican suburbs are really
prepared to send a black woman like Johnson to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the white Republicans vote for Joan Johnson?'' Canton
asked. Not, he suspects, in sufficient numbers.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson faces a Republican primary in September against Robert
T. Walsh, who works as the United Nations representative of a
humanitarian agency that cares for orphans, cancer victims and the
homeless and who will also run in November as the Right-to-Life
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he has heard from many loyal Republicans upset with
the party's choice. ``Party leaders chose her, with all due
respect, because of her race, her gender and her (abortion rights)
position on life,'' said Walsh. ``I tell you they've blown it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also faces a primary for the Conservative Party line, on
which Republicans depend for a crucial lift in close elections. But
the Suffolk Conservative Party chairman predicted that Johnson will
easily prevail.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Grant and Israel, 42, will face David
Bishop, 35, a county legislator from Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the very fact that Johnson was picked by a powerful
machine that never shows the slightest attraction to lost causes is
evidence she can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting move,'' said Jeff Garrett, who runs a
beauty supply store in the heart of Wyandanch, the district's most
concentrated black community. But, he concluded, ``The Republicans
in Islip know what they are doing. They have a stranglehold on the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the choice of state Sen. Caesar Trunzo, the boss in
Islip, which makes up half the district, and the new Suffolk County
Republican Chairman Anthony Apollaro. With control of Congress in
the balance, loss of this seat would look very bad.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is not the only black Republican candidate for Congress
this year.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, an expert on black politics at the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said that when
the dust settles from the last primaries, they will probably number
18 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bositis said, Johnson is the only one with a really good
chance of winning. Two others -- Jennifer Carroll in Florida and
Dylan Glenn in Georgia -- are running formidable campaigns against
black Democratic incumbents but remain very long shots, in his
view.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis said Johnson struck him as a ``good fit and wise pick''
for New York Republicans. He thinks she will be a tough target for
Democrats because ``she comes across as authentically black. She
doesn't sound like a white guy who works for the Republican
National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up ensconced in the warmth of a large and
successful extended family in segregated West Palm Beach, Fla. Her
clan had their own compound, their own water tower. ``We owned the
service station, beauty shop and general store,'' she recalled. Her
father was a butler and chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Racism intruded when she would venture outside ``colored town,''
or, most vividly, the time when she was 12 or 13 and a white police
officer, who had apparently just beaten up a neighbor boy, saw her
point him out to a girlfriend as he drove by where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If I ever see you point a finger at a white man
again, you see this revolver, I'll blow your brains out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although her father was out of sight but close by, she did not
call out to him. ``I remember that in that split moment I thought
that if I called my father, my father could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came to New York City to pursue a career as a jazz
singer (she imagines Congress as ``another opening, another
show''), but in the 1960s moved to Suffolk with her husband, a New
York City police officer, to raise a family. She became a
Republican because that was what you did to ``move around out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choice of party was confirmed when, not long after, as an
official of the local NAACP, she sought to persuade Democratic
candidates in Islip to take on open housing as an issue. She was
told it was political suicide because ``you people don't vote.''
She reported back to the NAACP that, ``if I closed my eyes I was at
a Klan meeting in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans who ran Islip, where her husband
was by then the housing administrator, enacted what she describes
as a very strong open housing law. By 1969, her husband was Islip's
deputy supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker by training, she has served over the years as a
school board member, Head Start director, affirmative action
officer and deputy commissioner of human services for the town.
</P>
<P>
   When she was sworn in as Islip town clerk in 1991, she said,
``I'm hoping this will do for politics (on Long Island) what Jackie
Robinson did for baseball.'' (Robinson himself was a Rockefeller
Republican.) She said upfront and out loud that it was a
steppingstone to higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has officiated at 2,500 weddings. She won the
title Ms. Senior New York, performing ``My Funny Valentine.'' This
year she sang the national anthem at the opening day of the new
local baseball franchise, the Long Island Ducks. She teaches a
local college course on urban minorities for criminal justice
majors, some of whom, she said, ``come from the antiseptic
communities of Long Island, have never had to deal with black
people and live in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   But then New York Mayor Giuliani bowed out of the Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Lazio jumped in, and Pete McGowan,
the Islip town supervisor and obvious successor to Lazio, stood
aside. Johnson wanted it, and Apollaro and Trunzo gave her the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they were going to be so smart,'' Johnson said,
adding that she thought her biggest political obstacle would not be
her race but her gender.
</P>
<P>
   On the issues, Johnson is a shade more liberal than Lazio, an
old ally, who compiled a moderate record in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   She supports abortion rights, and partial birth abortion if the
mother's life is at stake. She supports gun registration. She
helped persuade Lazio to defy Republican efforts to gut the
National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The one issue where she is most at odds with most blacks is that
she believes President Clinton should have been impeached, an issue
over which Lazio agonized. ``He put his hand on the Bible and he
lied,'' Johnson said of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She has already been to GOP candidate school in Washington, and
dined with Majority Leader Dick Armey and top party fund-raisers at
the Capitol Grill. She has been given time to speak on the opening
morning of the national convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard University political scientist Lorenzo Morris said
that
</P>
<P>
   if she wants to raise the money she will need, she will have to
toe the national Republican line to a degree that will make it
impossible for her to claim half the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   There are now 38 black Democrats in the House, and with
Democratic control they would gain the chairmanships of some of the
most powerful committees, beginning with Harlem's Charlie Rangel at
Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
   (FOURTH OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think African-American voters will realize that a Democratic
Congress is critical to the future of African-Americans in this
country,'' said David Bishop, the primary contender.
</P>
<P>
   (FOURTH OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Says Johnson, ``Charlie Rangel's party had the damn majority for
40 years and there has been no appreciable change in the lives of
black people in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks she can win this argument, and that when she
does, she can sell it to black voters elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to transport it,'' she said. ``I am going to be the
Harriet Tubman, I am going to take them through the underground and
out of the Democratic Party.''

 &HT;    PROBE INTO VICIOUS KILLING OF MEXICAN CLERIC ENDS AS IT BEGAN -
IN CONTROVERSY
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It was a spectacularly brutal assassination that
ushered in a new era of drug-related violence in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Assailants wielding automatic weapons blasted away at a Mexican
Catholic cardinal _ who was dressed in his vestments and crucifix _
as his car was entering the parking lot of Guadalajara's
international airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a special commission that probed the seven-year-old
murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo ended as it began _
with divided opinions over whether Posadas was killed accidentally
or on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In a painstaking presentation, Mexico's Attorney General's
Office described testimony by numerous jailed participants who said
Posadas was killed ``out of confusion, an error over vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The official story, which has been on the record for years, is
that Posadas was probably shot in his white Grand Marquis car by
hired guns working for Mexico's notorious Arellano Felix brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tijuana-based drug traffickers' leader, Ramon, is on the
FBI's ``10 Most-Wanted'' list. At the time of the killing, the
Arellanos were engaged in a vicious fight to control
cocaine-smuggling routes into the United States. Some of the
alleged killers were recruited from San Diego, Calif., just over
the border from Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Their target on May 23, 1993, was trafficker Joaquin Guzman,
whose wife also reportedly drove a white Grand Marquis, the
Attorney General's report said.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic Church representatives and members of the state
government of Jalisco, where the killing took place, disagreed with
the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the product of an accident,'' said Fernando
Guzman, a high-ranking aide in the Jalisco state government. He is
not related to Joaquin Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   State and church officials participated in the commission, which
met 23 times to discuss the case. But they remain convinced that
Posadas was the specific target of a conspiracy that killed his
driver and others in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The initial investigation, which quickly pointed toward the
Arellano Felix brothers, was ``deficient and manipulated,'' Guzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects were coerced and their testimony was suspicious because
some was identical, down to ``commas and periods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials since proved to be corrupt were involved in the case.
Some of the assailants were able to board a plane to Tijuana and
escape the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But assistant Attorney General Jose Luis Ramos said federal
officials had exhausted other leads and that alleged witnesses with
alternative information had failed lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was the product of hired guns that were paid
$15,000, and in a ``burst of adrenaline'' attacked the cardinal's
white car from the rear, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs with nicknames like ``the white crab'' and ``the black
marshal'' told officials they thought they were killing Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was an extraordinarily kind
man, with no enemies, and no reason existed for a group of drug
traffickers to take his life,'' Ramos said.

 &HT;    Being stereotyped not a concern for gay scriptwriter
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Long before his first script ever went before
the cameras, Brian Wayne Peterson's career was heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Based solely on his spoof of gay rehabilitation camps ``But I'm
A Cheerleader,'' Variety named him one of ``10 Screenwriters to
Watch'' in 1999. Now after a rocky road of production delays, a
distributor pullout and a temporary NC-17 rating, the 28-year-old
gay writer from Montana is waiting to see whether moviegoers are
ready to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In South Florida last month to attend a Pride FilmFest
screening, Peterson's spirits were buoyed by the reaction of the
predominantly gay audience. Still, he knows his satirical film must
attract a wider audience to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do definitely think this has crossover appeal,'' he said,
sitting at a Fort Lauderdale bookstore cafe. ``At worst, it's going
to capture the gay market.'' But that is hardly a demographic that
needs to hear the message of tolerance. ``I don't think a movie can
ever change someone's mind, but it can become a catalyst for
dialogue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Cheerleader `` came from first-time feature
director Jamie Babbit, who grew up around an alcohol rehab facility
where her mother worked. It led her to lampoon gay deprogramming
camps, which are proliferating. ``They're everywhere,'' reports
Peterson. Many are ``around Orange County, Calif., and other
rabidly conservative areas. But anywhere you are in the country you
can find them.''
</P>
<P>
   As ridiculous as he tried to make the camp, it is not far from
the truth, Peterson says. ``The funny thing is I don't think we
could make it any more absurd than it is. That's why we pushed it
even further, because otherwise it would have been reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Peterson actually visited a gay rehab to research his
script. ``No, I'm a very angry person and I wouldn't have lasted
long in one,'' he concedes. ``I probably would have gotten
arrested.'' At college in Oregon, while several anti-gay voter
initiatives were pending, he obtained a propaganda video that
depicted the rehab process. ``I would go around to fraternities
doing like this Homo 101 program, explaining that we are not like
the video says we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he make any progress? ``I got a really good date out of one
of them,'' he reports with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson came to Babbit's attention because of his unproduced
University of Southern California master's thesis script about a
gay rodeo. Yes, they do exist. ``I just think it's the greatest
world for a film, because of the juxtaposition of two different
things you would never expect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he is not worried about being stereotyped as a gay
screenwriter. ``Everything that anyone's ever told me has been
`Write what you know, write what you like,' '' explains Peterson.
``Every time I have not been very successful has been when I do
stray from that, doing something because I think it will be
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself at the beginning, if possible I would always
have a positive representation of a gay or lesbian in my movies.
Even if it's a minor character, it can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   From this low-budget independent picture, Peterson learned that
making movies is about rewriting and waiting. He began writing
around Christmas 1997, completing the first draft in a month.
Babbit liked what she read, a production company called Ignite
bought it and Peterson spent the next year revising the screenplay.
At one point, Fine Line signed to distribute ``Cheerleader,'' then
dropped out. ``I honestly don't know what happened with the
negotiations,'' says Peterson. ``I was wearing a Fine Line shirt at
Sundance and now I have a Lion's Gate T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   He does know what happened with the movie's rating and feels
certain a double standard was at work. ``Cheerleader'' was
initially slapped with a deadly NC-17 rating because it dealt with
gay teen sex and was made outside the Hollywood system, Peterson
says. His view was confirmed for him when he saw the R-rated
``Election,'' which covers similar territory. ``But it was with a
big studio that had the clout and because it was a straight
situation, not a gay situation,'' he charges. Cuts were made to
gain an R-rating, though ``I can't even really tell where the scene
is different. That's how minuscule the change is.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson has other film scripts he is trying to peddle and he
has been taking developmental meetings about some television work.
</P>
<P>
   His fate now largely rests with the box office response to
``Cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ifmed Lance Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is very good at keeping these characters distinct and
vivid, but the real star is five-time Oscar-winning makeup wizard
Rick Baker. Frankly, the only reason I am sure Murphy is under all
that latex is that the credits say so. With enough makeup, you can
hide anyone these days, as ``Big Momma's House'' with Martin
Lawrence proved.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ and the preview audience that was convulsed in
laughter showed no evidence of minding _ is that director Peter
Segal (''Naked Gun 33-1/3'') and his committee of writers from ``In
Living Color,'' ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``American Pie'' have
no idea what to do with all these characters beyond flatulence and
bodily fluid jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps, as you may recall, are robust eaters, so early on
they head to a buffet to chow down with gusto and break wind with
equal satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   If Sherman took a weight-reduction potion last time that turned
him into lean, mean Buddy, this time he comes up with a youth
serum. Having made sufficient fun of fat people, the sequel targets
old folks, taking particular amusement in the effects of age and
gravity on the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy is back and, for the sake of a few strained laughs, he
occasionally thinks he is a dog. Muddying the plot _ which never
manages to feel like a sustained story _ is Sherman's tampering
with his DNA, which causes him to gradually lose brain cells. And
the rest of the Klumps prattle on, led by randy Granny, grouchy
Papa and upbeat Mama.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the sketch comedy writing is an odd detour for a
parody of ``Star Wars,'' whose reason for existing seems to be the
revelation that the force behind The Force is _ what else? _
flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   Plugged into the Jada Pinkett role as Sherman's romantic
interest is Janet Jackson, playing a professorial colleague who
also doesn't miss many meals. She is the movie's lone straight man,
which means looking teary-eyed as Sherman's brain turns to mush.
</P>
<P>
   Listed again as one of the movie's executive producers is Jerry
Lewis, an acknowledgement that all this began with his 1963 Jekyll
and Hyde update. At the risk of siding with the French, that
kinder, gentler, no-less-silly comic style seems a remnant of a
golden age, compared with what Murphy hath wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he is not alone, as the popularity of ``Scary Movie''
and ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' demonstrate. One day, dumb and gross
comedies will fall out of favor, but it doesn't look like it will
happen anytime soon.

 &HT;    HOUSE PASSES BILL TO EASE TAX ON SOME SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Passing yet another tax cut bill before beginning a
long summer recess, the House voted Thursday to reduce the amount
of Social Security benefits for higher-income retirees that would
be subject to federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 265-159. Fifty-two Democrats crossed party lines to
join all but four Republicans in supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was the latest in a series of tax cut bills, the
product of a strategy to win in small pieces what GOP leaders
failed to achieve last year, when President Clinton vetoed a
comprehensive tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the leaders offered a proposed repeal of the
3 percent federal telephone excise tax, a phase-out of the estate
tax, and adjustments to the so-called ``marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto all the measures,
claiming the bills favor the rich, spend the projected budget
surplus, and place Social Security and Medicare at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Senate action is not likely until Congress returns in September.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would reduce from 85 percent to 50 percent the
amount of Social Security benefits subject to the federal income
tax for elderly individuals who earn more than $34,000, and couples
earning more than $44,000 who file jointly. That was the level
subject to taxation before the law was changed in 1993 as part of
the Clinton deficit reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would reduce the amount of taxes credited to Medicare
by $117 billion over 10 years and replace that with money from the
projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would veto the
bill ``unless they can come up with a way of doing this that does
not threaten the Medicare trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who managed the bill on the House
floor, said it was immoral to tax Social Security recipients on
benefits for which they already have paid taxes when they were
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to tax people on getting their own money back,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the tax rate was increased at a time when the
federal government faced a $255 billion deficit, House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, argued that it was
no longer necessary because the federal surplus this year is $233
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned that rolling back the Social Security tax could
jeopardize Medicare because the increased rate is earmarked for the
Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose the speculated surplus doesn't show up?'' asked Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., argued that the GOP plan was ``a gift
to the very rich,'' because it would not affect 80 percent of the
Social Security recipients who do not pay the highest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw argued that ``to say we're ... helping our rich friends is
absolutely ludicrous, unless you think people making $34,000 are
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the GOP plan would further endanger
efforts to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Republicans responded that reducing the Social Security rate would
not affect Medicare and would not prohibit adoption of a
prescription drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic alternative that would have raised the threshold on
those eligible for the maximum tax liability from $34,000 to
$80,000 for individuals and from $44,000 to $100,000 for couples
was rejected, 256-169.

 &HT;    DESPITE NAPSTER RULING, EXPERTS SAY ONLINE SHARING WILL SURVIVE
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB KEEFE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Distraught music fans jammed Napster on Thursday, a
day after a federal judge ordered the leading Internet
music-swapping site to close in order to protect copyrighted
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god they killed Napster,'' wailed a visitor to a Napster
online forum who went by the name ``born-4-music.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Napster may be off line, at least temporarily, after
midnight Friday, industry observer said they don't expect the
burgeoning business of delivering music and other entertainment
over the Internet to miss more than a beat or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the law, technology and the human
appetite for something free continues to stay ahead of the law,''
said Gary Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., Internet industry consultant.
``This might slow it down, but it's not going to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering music, movies and software over the Web is one of the
hottest areas of the Internet these days. Industry researchers
predict that will only grow as more households gain high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   So far, online music has been dominated by a few companies such
as Napster that make no money from the songs listed on their
directories, but sell advertising from companies that want to tap
into the thousands of visitors they get each day. Napster, for
instance, claims 20 million visitors since it got started a little
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies _ including Napster _ aren't likely to let
the potential profits from that business pass them by because of
disagreements like the one between Napster and the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this spells the death knell at all of music or
entertainment on the Internet,'' said Larry Waks, an Austin, Texas,
attorney who specializes in music and copyright issues. ``It's just
the age-old story about the law trying to keep up with
technological inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other companies using the Napster model for
sharing music files, but the recording industry's biggest nightmare
might be a program called Gnutella, which allows individuals with
music on their personal computers to quickly make connections with
large numbers of other fans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, there is no central server with a directory of
songs that the industry can target with a lawsuit or a court
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Napster were busy Thursday preparing an appeal of
Wednesday's ruling, and the company showed no signs of giving up.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has some heavy hitters on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The lead attorney representing the San Mateo, Calif.-based
company is David Boies, who recently led the successful efforts to
win a federal antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. Its chief
executive is Hank Barry, a former entertainment industry attorney
turned venture capitalist. And the money behind Napster comes from
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, a powerful Silicon Valley venture
capital firm that pumped $15 million into the company in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``There some very smart people there, and I would suspect they
will emerge with some sort of product and technology which is more
viable,'' said Vincent Grosso, a former vice president of NBC
Interactive who now is chief executive of Into Networks Inc., which
rents software over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Internet music companies have changed the way they
do
</P>
<P>
   business. After it was sued by the RIAA earlier this year, San
Diego-based MP3.com Inc., for instance, struck a deal in which it
gives record labels a small payment each time one of its visitors
downloads a piece of copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   What Wednesday's ruling will do is force the question of who
owns what on the Internet to the forefront, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that the legislators are going to get
involved,'' said MP3.com executive vice president Billy Pitts, just
hired by the company as its chief lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Pitts and MP3.com _ named after the highly
compressed format that made music transmission over the Internet
viable at dial-up speeds _ are planning a nationwide drive to get
online music aficionados to contact their representatives. Their
goal is to get legislation or regulation on their terms and to keep
the battle out of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts said he envisions an ``e-bill of rights'' that would
determine what is and isn't off-limits in sharing files over the
Internet, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet should not be ruled by a small cadre of
hand-picked judges who are trying to interpret what the law
means,'' Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that one of the industry's biggest
challenges is explaining to Congress how online music works.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say MP3 on the Hill, they say ``Oh, it's down the hall
on the right.''

 &HT;    WestPoint Stevens has expected loss, blamed on large
restructuring charge
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As expected, WestPoint Stevens said earnings were hurt
by a large restructuring charge.
</P>
<P>
   The West Point-based sheet and towel maker reported a
second-quarter loss of $89.8 million, or $1.81 a share, compared
with a profit of $19.6 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same
quarter last year. The results included a one-time pretax charge of
$168.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens announced a major restructuring last month.
Another $27 million in one-time charges will come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the quarter rose slightly to $462 million, compared
with $453.5 million one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, WestPoint Stevens recorded a loss of $74.2
million, or $1.50 a share, compared with profit of $35.2 million,
or 61 cents a share. Those results include the one-time charge.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, WestPoint Stevens said it will close some old mills
and get rid of certain support and administrative jobs as it tries
to pay off debt. The company hasn't identified the operations that
will go.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring, which follows a derailed plan to take
WestPoint Stevens private, is expected to save the company $5
million this year and $15 million next year.

 &HT;    WorldCom hints at spinoff as profits rise
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WorldCom Thursday reported a solid quarter of growth,
while hinting at a spinoff or tracking stock for its business in
consumer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, Miss.-based WorldCom's revenue rose to $10.2 billion
during the second quarter, compared to $9.1 billion during the same
period of 1999. The company reported earnings of $1.3 billion,
representing 46 cents per share, up from $865 million, or 30 cents
a share, one year earlier. Those results matched a consensus of
analyst expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Those results did not include a $55 million charge taken by the
company as part of the failed deal with Sprint _ an agreement
blocked by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic largely because
the merged company would share long-distance domination with AT&AMP;T.
WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers bitterly criticized the
regulators, arguing that price wars and competition make profits
increasingly hard to come by in consumer long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   A former Wall Street highflier, WorldCom has seen its stock
languish of late, weighed down by investor disdain for slow growth
and iffy profits. WorldCom stock this year has dropped about 25
percent, compared to a 12 percent decline for SBC Communications
and a 16 percent dip for BellSouth. However, AT&AMP;T has fallen 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rumors continue to fly about WorldCom's next move.
The company has ached to go wireless, an urge that may not have
died along with the Sprint deal. But few enticing _ and affordable
_ targets remain. WorldCom could bid against Deutsche Telekom,
which has a $50 billion pact to buy VoiceStream. It could return to
Nextel, now much more costly than when WorldCom passed up a
purchase. There are other players, like Alltel and Powertel, that
are attractive, if not national.
</P>
<P>
   And WorldCom might still find a way to purchase Sprint's
wireless unit.

&HT;     PELOSI CONFIDENT OF HOUSE LEADERSHIP POST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she has
enough support from fellow Democrats to become majority whip, the
No. 3 position in the House leadership, if the party wins control
of the chamber in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   In her most confident statement yet about her prospects for
capturing the post, Pelosi said that if Democratic lawmakers were
to vote today, she would defeat her rival, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland. The whip acts as the chief vote counter and works to
rally party members to support the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear majority,'' Pelosi said. ``It's undeniable that
I have the commitments. I am very confident about the numbers that
I have.''
</P>
<P>
   She said more than 80 Democratic representatives were supporting
her. But her quest for the leadership job hinges on whether the
party achieves its goal of regaining a majority in the House, six
years after the Republicans won control of both the House and
Senate in a humiliating defeat for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The whip contest heated up last week after Georgia Rep. John
Lewis announced that he was dropping out of consideration after
concluding ``the votes are simply not there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis then endorsed Hoyer, setting off a feverish scramble by
the remaining two candidates to capture commitments from his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said he won commitments from about half of Lewis' 30
supporters, while Pelosi said Lewis' exit gave her enough new
supporters to put her over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic of John getting out of the race added to my
numbers,'' Pelosi said. ``The boost I received from Lewis leaving
the race has solidified it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said Pelosi's claim of victory is premature and that it is
``a tactic to try to stampede people into thinking it's a done
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Any candidate would need a majority of votes from the Democratic
Caucus, which now has 210 members. There are 223 Republicans and
two independents in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats gain control of the House, Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri, now the minority leader, would become speaker. David
E. Bonior of Michigan, now the minority whip, would become majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said between 90 and 95 House colleagues were supporting
his candidacy for the No. 3 post.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have it locked up and I believe I have more votes
than she does,'' Hoyer said of Pelosi. ``They wouldn't be trying so
hard if they had it locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said a majority of members have told him they think he
would be a better whip, but that some have said they are supporting
Pelosi ``because they think we need gender diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer, now in his 10th term, is more senior than Pelosi, who is
serving her 7th two-year term in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer added that he hasn't pressured anyone to publicly declare
support for him because the whip's race is hypothetical unless
Democrats win control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a reason to trot out a bunch of lists,'' Hoyer
said. ``If there was a real race, that's a different story.''

 &HT;    CRASH INVESTIGATORS DECODE CONCORDE'S 'BLACK BOXES'; MEMORIAL
SERVICE HELD FOR VICTIMS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear,
government investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes''
recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and
burst into flame as the aircraft took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said. ``In the sound
recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No.
2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No. 2
lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No. 1
temporarily lost power,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction. ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in
the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond
Auffray told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed
grounded as the investigation
</P>
<P>
   progressed Thursday. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights
between New York and London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday,
adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation
expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations
suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told
the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades
inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all
113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to
a medical institute in Paris for examination. Most were burned
beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by
dental records or DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in
white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the
charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of
clothing _ that might help identify the victims. ``The bodies are
terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's
impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the
regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and
German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in
central Paris to pay their respects to the victims. It is the same
church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess
Diana here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
families of many of those who died. German relatives of the
victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses
provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in
the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large
bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered
here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off
Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France
employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took
place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served
by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving
families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to
hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they
would close shop to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially
opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether
charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized
maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's
thrust reverser. Such an investigation is not unusual in France
following such a large accident.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian prosecutors Thursday abruptly dropped their
high-profile criminal inquiry into Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the
Russian press tycoon whose Media-Most empire has been among the
Kremlin's sharpest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not explain why had they abandoned the
investigation, which began with a spectacular May raid by
ski-masked policemen and climaxed in June with Gusinsky's brief
imprisonment on embezzlement charges. As recently as three weeks
ago, prosecutors insisted to Parliament that Gusinsky had defrauded
the government of at least $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was notable that the inquiry was halted virtually on the eve
of a Kremlin meeting between many of the country's wealthiest
tycoons and President Vladimir Putin, whose government has moved
against several of them in tax and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called round table is widely viewed as an attempt to win
concessions from the tycoons _ including, perhaps, promises to
surrender their deep-rooted influence over government agencies and
leaders _ in exchange for an end to federal hectoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was not invited to that meeting. But like other
tycoons, he in effect stood accused of building his empire _ a
collection of print and broadcast outlets _ through corruption and
influence-peddling in the early days of Russian independence, and
the other had lined up to support him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gusinsky insisted that the charges were a sham,
designed to punish Media-Most for its criticism of Putin's handling
of the war in Chechnya and of corruption in the administration of
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's counterattack proved so adroit that even the U.S.
White House offered him its tacit support, sending President
Clinton to an interview at a Media-Most radio station during the
recent summit meeting in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Gusinsky's spokesman and his lawyer said simply that
the charges had been dropped for lack of evidence to support them.
A letter from the prosecutor's office was published Thursday on the
Media-Most Web site (www.mediamost.ru) stating only that the
proceedings had been canceled and that assets seized during its
course had been unfrozen.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office refused to confirm that the letter was
genuine. But an unidentified official in the agency's
public-relations office told the Interfax news service that
Gusinsky had been cleared as a suspect in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day in mid-May that the federal police swooped into
the headquarters of Media-Most, toting automatic rifles and wearing
camouflage and black ski masks, the object of the investigation has
never been completely clear.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky apparently was accused of swindling $10 million or more
from the Yeltsin government in 1997, during a deal involving the
privatization of a bankrupt St. Petersburg television station. But
details of that accusation never became public.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, investigators seized records of hundreds of
millions of dollars in loans or guarantees given Media-Most by
Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas monopoly, which has
called the aid a simple business investment. And at one point, the
prosecutors seized a souvenir gun that Yeltsin had once given
Gusinsky, saying he had no permit to own it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the anonymous spokesman for the prosecutors told
Interfax that the inquiry into the St. Petersburg television deal
would continue, but that its focus had shifted from Gusinsky and
Media-Most.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gusinsky, freed from the prosecutors' ban on his travel outside
Russia, had flown to Spain on Wednesday evening to see his family
and was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the investigation, in mid-June, officials
jailed Gusinsky, a multimillionaire with citizenship in both Russia
and Israel, for three days in Butyrskaya detention center, a
notoriously decrepit and dangerous holding pen for Moscow street
criminals. The resulting outcry led even government officials to
say the investigators might have pushed the boundaries of
propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Putin at times seemed to mildly rebuke the prosecutors for their
conduct, but maintained that the prosecutor's office was an
independent agency beyond his control. More than once, he has
suggested that the tycoons built their riches on corruption and
that they have no grounds to complain when that corruption comes
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it was never quite clear how much Putin was involved in the
campaign against Gusinsky. And today, it was still not clear how
much he was involved in its apparent end.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, I'd say this has a certain rough
correspondence with the way the rule of law is supposed to work _
they investigated him, didn't find anything, and closed the case,''
said Alan E. Rousso, the director of the Moscow Center of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``But the reality is a
little more nuanced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact he's been cleared of all charges doesn't exonerate
the government for the way this was done,'' Rousso said. ``And it
doesn't answer the question about whether this is some sort of
witch hunt and exertion of presidential power, or a true clearing
of the Augean stables. That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   One tycoon, Anatoly Chubais, who got his start as Yeltsin's
economic expert and deputy prime minister, called on Putin on
Thursday in an interview in the business newspaper Kommersant to
show his hand and either wave the prosecutors off, or let
corruption inquiries go forward with his explicit blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was implying that the prosecutor's office was
not independent, as Putin says, Chubais was succinct. ``Never has
been, is not, and won't be for some time,'' he said.

NEW MAN AT JFK LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy was an ardent internationalist. Had he lived, it
is safe to say he would now be deeply fascinated and involved with
the complex forces of globalization, and especially the
strengthening of democracy and human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the appointment announced Thursday of John Shattuck, now US
ambassador to the Czech Republic, to be the new chief executive
officer of the Kennedy Library and Foundation, is both appropriate
and hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck's selection signals significant changes. For one thing,
he will be the first leader of the Library and Foundation who did
not know Kennedy personally. He succeeds Charles U. Daly, who was
in Larry O'Brien's legislative office in the Kennedy White House.
This transition, too, is fitting, for most of the people who visit
the Library now have no personal memory of JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the success of Shattuck's tenure at the Library will
likely depend on his ability to marshal the institution's abundant
resources not in response to people's memories, but in support of
their desires _ especially for public service.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck, a former executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union office in Washington, was also a vice president of
Harvard; in Cambridge he was active in supporting improvements in
public education.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said Thursday a key to Shattuck's
appointment was his note expressing ``a real vision for the Library
for the next 20 years,'' including strengthened programs to inspire
young people and promote civic action.
</P>
<P>
   This is crucial. People, young or old, cannot be shamed into
public service; they will participate enthusiastically when they
believe their efforts will bear fruit. Shattuck has laid out an
impressive agenda including human rights, public education, the
Peace Corps, and the promotion of political debate around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library and Foundation has always been more than a
museum. Shattuck will serve his neighbors in Boston and the global
community well if he can further strengthen its substantive work
and its clout.

NAPSTER'S LAST DAYS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of free music on the Internet are swamping the Napster Web
site to complain about a judge's ruling against the music service _
while also snatching a few last downloads. But Judge Marilyn Patel
was correct: Napster facilitates copyright infringement and should
not operate in its present form.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry, which brought the suit, would be wise
not to blindly oppose downloading of popular songs, however.
Instead it should adapt this useful technology so that industry and
artists get a fair return. Otherwise, music fans will seek out
alternative free sources of music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than keep fighting this case through the courts, music
companies would be better off buying or allying themselves with
Napster, which has the most popular music search program on the
Net. Many of the 20 million people who have downloaded the program
would pay reasonable monthly fees for an improved Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a long legal struggle is likely. Napster lawyers went
before the US appeals court in San Francisco in hopes of staving
off compliance with the decision, which was to take effect this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Napster argues that it does not encourage the sharing of
copyrighted works. That argument is disingenuous. Unlike other
music services on the Web, Napster does not focus on new artists
who make their work freely available. Instead it encourages users
to search for performers they know, almost invariably famous acts
who have not given approval for the use of their copyrighted tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Patel did not order Napster shut down, but her decision would
force it to prevent the sharing of copyrighted songs, a practical
impossibility. She considered the evidence so overwhelming that she
took action before the lawsuit went to trial. Napster's case is
weak as it pursues legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is an easy-to-use program, which would benefit from
improvements to track specific songs and encourage connecting links
so users could sample new artists and learn more about favorite
performers. If it abandons its resistance-at-any-cost strategy, the
recording industry could make beautiful music with this powerful
technology.

GIVING PEACE ANOTHER CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement that Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will
meet Sunday to renew their search for a comprehensive agreement
suggests a shared realization that there is no tolerable
alternative to a negotiated peace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the triumphal welcome for Yasser Arafat orchestrated by
his Fatah faction, the reality is that, in the wake of his failure
to get to yes at Camp David, his people have to go on living under
the thumb of Israel _ without jobs, without proper public services,
and deprived of the conditions for genuine self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one crucial reason why Arafat was not able to engage in
the give-and-take required for a compromise on the key issue of
Jerusalem is that his corrupt and incompetent governance of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza the last few years has
eroded his popularity, his credibility, and his margin for
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   For different reasons, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel has
also suffered attrition in his political standing. Because of
defections from his governing coalition, Barak arrived at Camp
David without the optimal flexibility for striking a historic
compromise with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that both sides are saying that the missed
opportunity at Camp David marks not a dead-end but a stepping stone
on the path to an agreement. For this rosy rhetoric to become a
reality, certain decisive actions must be taken:
</P>
<P>
   Barak will have to reconstitute a coalition that backs the
difficult concessions required for peace. Arafat will have to
refrain from unilaterally declaring an independent Palestinian
state on Sept. 13 if there is no accord by that date. President
Clinton will need to call in some chits with the Saudis and the
Egyptians, pressing them to give Arafat the cover he needs to
accept partial rather than complete Palestinian sovereignty in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Arab regimes have a long history of giving
the Palestinians nothing but lip service. Now they have to give
Arafat the leeway to strike a realistic bargain with Israel, for
the sake of his people and their future.

DRIVING AWAY MOVIEMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A grand jury probe of the contracts between Teamsters Local 25
and major Hollywood movie producers will cast some needed light on
the featherbedding and strong-arm tactics that undercut moviemaking
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Cellucci, a big fan of both movies and Teamsters, needs
to focus on reality. He is the chief executive of a state where the
shakedown of movie producers is apparently an art form. The hiring
of no-show drivers is just part of it. The grand jury is also
investigating allegations that Teamster officials pressure
producers to hire the Location Connection, an equipment rental
company with suspected links to organized crime in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of low-budget movies or commercials who are not
required to hire Teamsters also face the prospect of disruptions on
the set. They learn quickly that Teamsters leaning on their horns
don't do much to enhance a boudoir scene. Slashed tires are a sign
to roll with the Teamsters or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Local 25 Teamster chief George Cashman and Cellucci
administration officials have been promoting the construction of a
sound stage complex in Boston to give the region a better chance to
attract large-scale movie productions. Cashman had pledged to put
an end to Teamster turmoil on the set. But he didn't deliver. It
now appears that any sound stage with Teamster involvement will be
nothing more than a snare for movie producers who will later be
devoured by the movie unit of Local 25.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor in New England cannot be pleased by the
performance of their Teamster brothers. Union carpenters, painters,
electricians, actors, and others lose work when wary movie
producers shun New England. Teamsters President James P. Hoffa
can't be happy, either. His Boston operation is becoming a magnet
for federal agents precisely when he is promising to find and sever
links to organized crime in order to end federal supervision of the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The movie unit of Local 25 needs to be brought under control.
It's driving away good business.

   WASHINGTON - If America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. are
allowed to merge, consumers will see the Internet taken ``to the
next level - connecting, informing and entertaining people around
the world as never before,'' AOL chairman Steve Case assured
federal regulators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate competitors and consumer advocates warned the
Federal Communications Commission that the combined company could
put ``choke holds'' on the Internet, restricting consumer choices
by controlling both the cable ``pipes'' and the content flowing
through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the unprecedented concentration of market power that
would be created by this merger, there is a clear threat to
consumer choice,'' said Preston Padden, a lobbyist for Walt Disney
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Though shareholders of the world's No. 1 online service company
have approved the merger with the No. 2 U.S. cable-TV operator, the
companies still need approval from the FCC, as well as the Federal
Trade Commission and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner executives argue their proposed merger
raises no serious anti-trust issues because their companies operate
in different markets. AOL has 23 million online subscribers. Time
Warner owns cable TV operations and media companies that generate
news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   By combining their strengths, ``AOL and Time Warner will drive
the Internet's development - helping to spur a new era of
innovation and robust competition,'' Case said during the four-hour
FCC hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney, General Electric Co.'s NBC and a host of other
companies have been filing objections to the merger. Disney is
asking the FCC to separate AOL Time Warner's cable distribution
system from the content-providing operations, saying neither
company can be by trusted to look out for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald Levin promised their
merged company would provide competitors with access to their
high-speed connections, but declined to provide a definite date.
However, Levin said he ``remained quite confident we can make that
happen faster than anyone else in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Padden objected to such reassurances. ``This massive aggregation
of market power cannot be left to voluntary promises of good
behavior,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. executive William Reddersen said his company
believes the FCC should bar any relationship between AT&AMP;T and Time
Warner, warning that any deals between those two giants in the
cable industry could limit the ability of rivals, such as
BellSouth, to compete in offering Internet service, instant
messaging and cable service.
</P>
<P>
   While phone and media companies are primarily concerned about
the combination of content and cable lines, others are worried
about AOL's control over Internet services, especially instant
messaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from history that those who unfairly exploit a market
dominance don't get nicer as they get bigger,'' Tribal Voice Chief
Executive Ross Bagully said in prepared testimony. Tribal Voice
developed Internet messaging technology used by some AOL
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger would ``give AOL-Time Warner plenty of
opportunities to bundle its extraordinary media properties with its
stranglehold over instant messaging to favor its content and
prevent innovations that might threaten its dominance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness for consumers, Barry Orton of the University of
Wisconsin, said the FCC should give local cable franchising
authorities the power to force AOL to meet minimal customer service
standards for cable Internet service. He noted that local
authorities already can make such demands on traditional cable
companies, and that AOL ought to be held to similar service
standards.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard summarized the issues before the
regulators: ``Will the merger deliver on the promises that have
been made, including accelerated broadband deployment, innovative
services and a continued commitment to multiple broadband
platforms?
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it usher in the anticipated convergence of the Internet
with television, and unleash all of the intriguing possibilities
therein? Or will it instead, as others contend, potentially impair
the competitive, consumer-driven evolution of these technologies?''

innovation and robust competition,'' Case said during the four-hour
FCC hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney, General Electric Co.'s NBC and a host of other
companies have been filing objections to the merger. Disney is
asking the FCC to separate AOL Time Warner's cable distribution
system from the content-providing operations, saying neither
company can be by trusted to look out for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald Levin promised their
merged company would provide competitors with access to their
high-speed connections, but declined to provide a definite date.
However, Levin said he ``remained quite confident we can make that
happen faster than anyone else in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Padden objected to such reassurances. ``This massive aggregation
of market power cannot be left to voluntary promises of good
behavior,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. executive William Reddersen said his company
believes the FCC should bar any relationship between AT&AMP;T and Time
Warner, warning that any deals between those two giants in the
cable industry could limit the ability of rivals, such as
BellSouth, to compete in offering Internet service, instant
messaging and cable service.
</P>
<P>
   While phone and media companies are primarily concerned about
the combination of content and cable lines, others are worried
about AOL's control over Internet services, especially instant
messaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from history that those who unfairly exploit a market
dominance don't get nicer as they get bigger,'' Tribal Voice Chief
Executive Ross Bagully said in prepared testimony. Tribal Voice
developed Internet messaging technology used by some AOL
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger would ``give AOL-Time Warner plenty of
opportunities to bundle its extraordinary media properties with its
stranglehold over instant messaging to favor its content and
prevent innovations that might threaten its dominance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness for consumers, Barry Orton of the University of
Wisconsin, said the FCC should give local cable franchising
authorities the power to force AOL to meet minimal customer service
standards for cable Internet service. He noted that local
authorities already can make such demands on traditional cable
companies, and that AOL ought to be held to similar service
standards.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard summarized the issues before the
regulators: ``Will the merger deliver on the promises that have
been made, including accelerated broadband deployment, innovative
services and a continued commitment to multiple broadband
platforms?
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it usher in the anticipated convergence of the Internet
with television, and unleash all of the intriguing possibilities
therein? Or will it instead, as others contend, potentially impair
the competitive, consumer-driven evolution of these technologies?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ He promised a revolution, and he has kept
his word. Since being swept to power here 18 months ago, Hugo
Chavez has uprooted every institution, assaulted every elite and
derided every orthodoxy with the unrelenting combativeness of the
army paratrooper he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress and Supreme Court he called ``corrupt'' and
``worm-eaten'' are gone, and the two political parties that
governed for 40 years have collapsed. Military power has been
vastly expanded, the powerful government oil company he criticized
as ``a state within the state'' has been purged and the authority
of governors and mayors curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   In speech after speech, he has attacked the business, opposition
and media leaders who have expressed doubts about his methods and
objectives, calling them ``degenerates'' and ``squealing pigs.''
When Roman Catholic bishops dared suggest that he should be less
confrontational, he dismissed them as ``devils in vestments.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Chavez's plan to transform Venezuela, which
has been the United States' leading source of imported oil in
recent years, is a new constitution he hails as ``the most
democratic in the world.'' Hand-tailored for him in a Constituent
Assembly by his leftist Patriotic Pole movement, the document
enlarges the powers of the state while weakening the legislature
and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Now the former army colonel, who will be 46 on Friday, seems
assured of six more years in office with virtually no restraints on
his authority. An election scheduled for Sunday to ``relegitimize''
his rule, choose governors and a new Congress is expected to hand
him a sweeping victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oligarchs tremble, because now is when the revolution is going
forward,'' he warned recently. ``This is going to be delicious:
we're going to deliver a knockout punch to the counterrevolution.''
</P>
<P>
   For the left here and in the rest of Latin America, hungry for a
home-grown hero, Chavez is a godsend: a charismatic military man
who condemns ``savage capitalism,'' embraces Fidel Castro and
promises social justice. An orator who is by turns spellbinding and
funny, Chavez has gathered the poor into a powerful force that is
demanding change.
</P>
<P>
   But to many others, unwilling to forget the unsuccessful coup he
led eight years ago, Chavez reawakens memories of the authoritarian
caudillo _ the classic military strongman with little patience for
the give-and-take of democracy. To them, his language reeks of
class hatred and demagoguery, his vituperative attacks
foreshadowing even greater conflicts to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``His movement is contradictory, and Hugo Chavez is a divided
soul,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, a former guerrilla and government
official who is now editor of an irreverent new daily newspaper
here, Tal Cual. ``At the same time, he is Menshevik and Bolshevik,
Girardist and Jacobin, Danton and Robespierre.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez seems to be everywhere, his image
plastered on posters, his voice booming over the airwaves. But the
man himself _ as well as a clear picture of how he intends to
exercise the enormous power he has been accumulating _ remains
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected in a landslide in 1998 by promising a ``peaceful
social revolution'' that would usher in a ``golden age.'' Thus far,
he has failed to deliver either prosperity or equality: the
Venezuelan economy shrank by 7 percent last year, and more than
half the work force remains unemployed or working in the
underground economy. The well-off, fearful of his recent
declarations, have spirited more than $8 billion out of the
country, mostly to the United States, since he came to power,
according to Venezuelan central bank data.
</P>
<P>
   He has ordered government security forces not to move against
squatters who invade buildings or farms, and has just backed a
measure that would expropriate landholdings that the government
deems to be ``idle.''
</P>
<P>
   His followers, drawn from the 80 percent of Venezuelans who live
below the poverty line, have been kept in a permanent state of
agitation. His speeches refer to his ``plan of battle,'' the need
to ``take every piece of space by assault,'' and efforts to ``force
the adversaries of the people into their caves and foxholes'' but
offer few policy specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now brothers, let us unsheath the sword of truth,'' Chavez
intoned in a recent speech. ``All of you are warriors, so let us
once again seek the oracle of war and put on our combat boots. I am
certain that from today on the popular offensive will be as
implacable as ever and that the attack will come from all sides
because the Venezuelan people have clasped their banner and are
going on to battle and victory again.''
</P>
<P>
   In view of the two decades Chavez spent in the military, it is
hardly surprising that his public declarations have a martial tone,
or that he has brought large numbers of former military officers
into his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Von Clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics
by other means, but it also works the other way around,'' he said
in an interview. ``Whether it be war or some other kind of
challenge, you are always talking about struggle, battles, advances
and retreats.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also draws heavily on religious imagery, comparing
himself and his mission to that of Jesus, and his opponents to the
demons of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   When Roman Catholic bishops sent him a letter last spring
cautioning him that it was false to suggest that ``God has blessed
one political project'' above others, he responded with a 20-page
letter that read like a papal encyclical, complete with biblical
citations.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez leavens that aggressive rhetoric with jokes, proverbs,
bits of popular songs, asides to his wife, Marisabel, and anecdotes
about friends, his boyhood and his days as a baseball player. His
opponents say they find his performances coarse and clownish, but
his folksy approach has helped cement his ties to ordinary
Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of us,'' said Beatriz Tovar Mendieta, a washerwoman
here. ``We've never had another president like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chavez is more closely identified with the masses
in terms of the ethnic or racial divide that characterizes
Venezuela. The predecessors he attacks as members of a ``rotten
oligarchic elite'' are typical ``mantuanos,'' as people with
European features and pretensions are called here.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Chavez is a typical ``pardo,'' or brown-skinned
person, with traces of Indian blood, ``curly hair, Chinese-looking
eyes, a thick mouth and an aquiline nose,'' in the words of one of
his biographers, Angela Zago. In speeches, the president has been
known to underline his resemblance to his followers by referring to
himself as ``the Indian from Barinas.''
</P>
<P>
   William Lara, who met the president when both were studying
political science in a postgraduate course a decade ago and is now
one of his closest political advisers, said: ``Like Hugo Chavez, I
am from the plains, which is a place that has very few trees. So
when a plainsman sees a tree, his first impulse is to look behind
it to see if someone is waiting there to ambush him. Hugo Chavez
has that characteristic.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with that self-reliance is a certain distrust of and
disdain for technocrats that leads him to rely on his own instincts
more than advice from experts. ``You need to take an aspirin, but
they prescribe Viagra,'' Chavez complained in a recent speech.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's index of American workers' wages continued to
rise at a steady clip this spring, confirming that the labor force
is reaping the fruits of their growing productivity and
unprecedented strength in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index, closely watched by the Federal
Reserve Board as a signal of future inflation, increased 1 percent
in the April through June period, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This was slightly below the 1.4 percent rise in wages in the
first three months of this year, and matched a 1 percent increase
in the final three months of last year. The index is a tally of
employers' costs for both wages and benefits, such as health
insurance and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The gains, offset by increasing productivity, were seen as
encouraging by some investors, who pushed the Dow Jones industrial
average up 69.65 points, or 0.7 percent, Thursday to 10,586.13. The
Nasdaq Composite index, however, dropped 145.46 points, or 3.6
percent, to 3842.26, reacting to poor financial results by
Amazon.com and other technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Strong and persistent wage gains have protected workers'
paychecks from being eroded by inflation. For the year, the wage
index gained 4.4 percent, well above the inflation rate of 3.7
percent. That was not the case during most of the 1990s: Household
incomes, adjusted for inflation, did not begin to expand until
1997, according to a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the nation's unemployment rate at 4 percent, a 30-year
low, employees are apparently becoming increasingly adept at using
their leverage in a job market desperate for talent to win raises
and beef up their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are ahead of the game,'' said Denis McSweeney,
regional commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which
released the ECI data Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While workers are slightly better off, there was some concern
among economists that another surge in wages would add to price
pressures that may be building in a still-hot US economy. Labor
costs account for two-thirds of all business costs.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of strong economic growth, the federal
government also reported Thursday that orders for manufactured
durable goods rose 10 percent in June. That was the biggest monthly
increase since July 1991, when orders jumped nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times during
the past year in an attempt to cool the economy and hold inflation
in check. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before the House
Banking Committee on Tuesday, said he would be watching the
economic data closely for signs of inflation during the weeks
leading up to the Fed's next meeting on interest-rate policy,
scheduled for August 22.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan also said he believed the current data, such as
slowing retail and home sales, show that interest-rate increase
were beginning to temper the economy and reduce the risk of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the new employment cost index data did not
contradict Greenspan. The gains, though robust, were not enough to
cause concern because workers are also producing more goods. If
productivity keeps pace with wage gains, as it has month after
month, then manufacturers do not have to raise their prices to
cover the costs of higher output.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers aren't good, but they're not a disaster,'' said
Steve Ricchiuto, chief economist at ABN AMRO, a financial firm.
``They confirm an upward trend, but it's not horrible enough for a
rate hike in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers' productivity grew at a 3.7 percent pace in the first
quarter, and Oscar Gonzalez, economist for John Hancock Financial
Services Inc. in Boston, forecast that productivity would exceed 3
percent again in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages are ``a natural consequence of the ability of
workers to be more productive,'' Gonzalez said. ``That's really the
key to the whole puzzle. If you don't have those productivity
gains, things would start to fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also included
in its employment cost index calculation the cost to employers of
referral and hiring bonuses, which are becoming increasingly
popular as a way of attracting workers. But the addition had little
effect on the overall numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gonzalez added, the 1 percent gain in wages and
benefits was ``a big number.'' The government breakdown of the
index found that wages and salaries rose 1 percent during the
April-to-June quarter, while benefits increased 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, wage gains were roughly even with the national
trend, preliminary data showed.

 CARACAS, Venezuela: recent speech. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Complex Attitude Toward U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's relationship with the United States is no less
complicated. Aside from a passion for baseball that works its way
into almost every speech, he is also a fan of U.S. movies and
television, referring to them almost as frequently as he adorns his
speeches with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and
Walt Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   But when floods and mudslides inundated the Caribbean coast last
December, killing thousands of people, Chavez refused help from a
U.S. military team. Their presence, he said, would offend
Venezuela's sovereignty, even though he allowed in doctors from
Cuba, relief workers from Spain and Mexico and aid from China and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He personally takes responsibility for the dramatic rise in oil
prices and record gasoline prices in the United States. On the
campaign trail here, he reminds voters it was his government's
decision to lower production and adhere to OPEC quotas that has
resulted in a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of Venezuelan
crude since he took office 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Venezuela often been the leading source of oil for
the United States, but the country's minister of energy, Ali
Rodriguez, is now OPEC president. In recent speeches, Chavez has
bragged to Venezuelans about telephone calls from President Clinton
asking for relief on oil prices, but he has also made it clear that
he does not intend to give any ground.
</P>
<P>
   Once the election is over, Chavez plans a Mideast tour to
discuss with ``our Arab brothers,'' as he calls them, an OPEC heads
of state meeting scheduled here in late September. Although he
plans stops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Chavez seems bent on
tweaking Washington by visiting Iraq, Iran and Libya, and inviting
their leaders to the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what the pharisees will say when they see me with
Saddam Hussein,'' Chavez said with a big grin during a recent
speech.
</P>
<P>
   His foreign policy has shown a fascination with rogue elements
around the world. One peculiar example is his correspondence with
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the Venezuelan-born former guerrilla known
as Carlos the Jackal, who was convicted of murder and kidnappings
across Europe, including an attack on OPEC ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chavez has cited the government of Col. Moammar
Gadhafi in Libya as a model for participatory democracy. He has
also repeatedly praised Castro's rule in Cuba, much to the distress
of Venezuelans still resentful of Cuban support for past guerrilla
movements here, saying both nations are ``swimming together toward
the same sea of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez abruptly withdrew Venezuela from annual U.S. -sponsored
joint naval maneuvers and just this week accused the United States
of trying to install a missile base in neighboring Guyana. But,
perhaps most immediately troubling to Washington is his decision to
ban U.S. drug surveillance flights from using Venezuelan airspace.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the U.S. response has been restrained, arguing, no
doubt with an eye on oil supplies, that forbearance and dialogue
are the best way to avoid further radicalization of the situation
here.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican members of Congress are clamoring for sanctions
against Venezuela, and the U.S. ambassador who has been carrying
out the wait-and-see policy here is being replaced next month by
Donna Jean Hrinak, who as ambassador to the Dominican Republic took
a hard line against that country's wily authoritarian president,
Joaquin Balaguer.
</P>
<P>
   `A Tough Little Kid'
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born in Sabaneta de Barinas, a
small town in the vast, sparsely-populated savannah that is
Venezuela's equivalent of the Great Plains. As teachers in the
local elementary school, his parents, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez and
Helena Frias, had social but not material status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up there selling bananas and sowing corn'' and when
students finished the sixth grade ``we had to go somewhere else, to
the state capital, if we were going to continue our studies,''
Chavez recalled in an autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   The new student in the capital was first ridiculed as a country
bumpkin but he soon stood out for his ability to recite poems and
speeches at local festivals and for his athletic prowess. Baseball
is the national pastime here, and Chavez excelled as both a
left-handed pitcher and a power-hitting first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tough little kid, mischievous, a real talker and
dreamer, but as tenacious as hell,'' Jose ``Tintan'' Lopez,
Chavez's baseball coach, said in an interview. ``Even when he was 7
or 8 years old, he could put the ball where he wanted and wasn't
afraid to come in on a batter with his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Indirectly, it was baseball that led to Chavez's military
career. His plan was to qualify for the army's team and capture the
attention of major league scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon developed arm trouble and his ambitions shifted.
``When I met some officers and read a bit of history, I felt
something stirring inside me,'' he has said. He drew inspiration
from Latin American military leaders like Juan Velasco of Peru,
Juan Peron of Argentina and Omar Torrijos of Panama _ men who used
their power to shake up the status quo, not reinforce it.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he was assigned to a succession of posts: an
armored unit, anti-guerrilla duty along the Colombian border, a
military ethics instructor, paratrooper training and eventually
staff duty at the Ministry of Defense. But there was also a
conspiratorial side he was careful to keep hidden from his
superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a group of four or five captains who used to jog
together in the afternoons, and one day in 1983 Chavez suggested we
swear an oath to fight against corruption and for the welfare of
our country,'' recalled Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, a former
classmate and friend who recently broke with the president. ``From
that moment on, we began to study the problems of Venezuela in a
systematic way, and as time passed, we got more and more young
officers to join us.''

 CARACAS, Venezuela: join us.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Two-Year Term in Prison
</P>
<P>
   After world oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s, neither of
the country's two political parties proved capable of governing
effectively or honestly in a situation that called for
belt-tightening. In 1989, a popular uprising against an
International Monetary Fund austerity program resulted in the
deaths of several hundred people and convinced Chavez and his
co-conspirators that the system could no longer function.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, 1992, Chavez, Francisco Arias Cardenas, then his
closest comrade-in-arms but now his challenger in this Sunday's
vote, and other officers attacked the presidential palace. It was a
failure, resulting in the deaths of more than a score of soldiers.
But most Venezuelans caught their first glance of their future
leader then, and Chavez has described the episode as the turning
point in his life.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering, he was paraded in front of television
cameras, wearing the bright red military beret that he and his
followers today wear as the symbol of their movement, to call on
the last holdout units to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, comrades, the objectives that we established have
unfortunately not been achieved in the capital,'' the young army
colonel said, with a touch of bravado that resonated deeply among
ordinary people. Then he was bundled off to jail
</P>
<P>
   By Chavez's own account, the two-plus years he spent there were
devoted largely to reading and debating. In an interview last year,
Chavez described himself as ``a promiscuous reader,'' with a
reading list that included Camus, Cicero, Martin Luther King, Mao,
Montesquieu, Neruda, Nietzche, Ortega y Gasset, Rousseau, Alvin
Toffler and Walt Whitman, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors of all political persuasions were allowed to see him,
including some of the most influential members of what is now his
government. Among them were two veterans of the left who would
become his mentors: Luis Miquilena, now head of the Congress, and
Jose Vicente Rangel, his foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   After Chavez was freed in 1994, Miquilena and other admirers
decided he needed to travel abroad because the young officer knew
little of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his role in attempted overthrow of a democratically
elected government, the United States refused to grant him a visa,
a policy that remained in effect until he was elected president.
But he traveled throughout Latin America, and on one trip he met an
obscure Argentine sociologist named Norberto Ceresole.
</P>
<P>
   Ceresole's language can be murky, but in essence he envisions
political leadership as an almost mystical bond between the masses
and a charismatic figure. Such a ``post-democratic'' relationship
eliminates the need for political parties, he argues, because the
military can more reliably serve as a sort of conveyor belt between
the leader and the led.
</P>
<P>
   To critics, such notions are little more than warmed-over
fascism. Ceresole also denies the Holocaust and calls for third
world coalitions to counter the power of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Chavez was elected, Ceresole visited Venezuela and
proudly described the president-elect as ``my disciple.'' Chavez
was clearly irritated by the remarks and, according to Urdaneta,
then his secret police chief, ordered the Argentine to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many Venezuelans remain convinced that Ceresole's
ideas influence Chavez's government.
</P>
<P>
   As he was discovering Ceresole, Chavez made his first trip to
Havana, where he was welcomed by Castro. At a 1994 news conference
there, Chavez, clearly dazzled by having been treated almost as a
head of state, was full of admiration for Castro and the Cuban
revolution. He has continued to visit Havana as president, even
playing baseball with Castro last year, and has offered Cuba
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   To Chavez's critics, the president's fascination with two
figures as ideologically divergent as Castro and Ceresole indicates
he has no core beliefs of his own, only a set of postures that he
tailors for his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wall Street, he talks about the wonders of capitalism, in
China he quotes from Chairman Mao, and in England, he praises Tony
Blair and the Third Way'' said Urdaneta. ``He wants to be on good
terms with everybody, so he says what people want to hear. We will
only see the true Hugo Chavez emerge after this election.''
</P>
<P>
   That chapter will open after the vote on Sunday when pressure to
deliver results can only mount.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there doesn't seem to be a coherent plan,'' said Robert
Bottome, editor of Veneconomia, the leading business newsletter
here. ``The formal economy is being more and more destroyed, and I
don't think it is deliberate. It's just that he doesn't understand,
he doesn't know what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as the hour of his greatest triumph draws closer,
Chavez has passed up an opportunity to be magnanimous or
conciliatory. Instead, he has stepped up attacks on all who
question his vision or recoil at the conflict he says he relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no third way here,'' he said recently. ``No, here
there is only revolution and counterrevolution, and we are going to
annihilate the counterrevolution.''

DOOMED CONCORDE HAD TROUBLE WITH LEFT ENGINES AND LANDING GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Flight recorders show that the pilots of the Air France
Concorde that crashed on Tuesday had problems with both engines on
the plane's left side and also reported that the pilots could not
retract the landing gear, investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The recorders make clear that the plane was too far down the
runway to abort the flight when air controllers told the pilot that
they could see flames at the back of his plane.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots responded that the No. 2 engine had stalled and
shortly after takeoff, they reported that they could not store the
landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight recorders also show that the No.1 engine had
failed briefly as well during takeoff. And one minute into the
flight, it failed again just before the plane rolled to the left
and crashed into a small hotel on the outskirts of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the investigators said that the plane was in the
process of breaking up throughout its brief flight as debris was
found along its path. They also noted that scraps of tire had been
found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   But many questions remained about what might have triggered the
crash: whether it was related to objects like parts of tires or
wheels being sucked into an engine, last-minute repairs made to
engine No. 2 before Air France flight 4590 took off from Charles de
Gaulle airport or still some other reason.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators from the BEA, a French government agency that
investigates crashes, said that their inquiry was still in its
preliminary stages and far from determining what had caused the
supersonic jet to crash, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be until all the facts and elements have been
assembled and synthesized that a complete analysis of the
circumstances and causes of the accident can be known,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said Thursday that it was unlikely the repairs to
the No. 2 engine's thrust reversers had anything to do with the
kind of fire that seemed to engulf the left side of the plane as
the plane's captain, Christian Marty, tried desperately to cut
short the flight and land at the smaller, nearby airport, Le
Bourget. The repair job, the experts said, would have had to have
been badly botched, causing a rupture in a fuel line for instance,
to create the kind of engine collapse that occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Others have speculated that it was more likely that something
was sucked into the engine on take off. The finding that pieces of
tire were on the runway gave this theory more weight Thursday.
Brian Trubshaw, a former chief test pilot for the British team that
developed the Concorde, said that Thursday's findings suggested
that either a tire or a wheel sucked into the engine might have
been the cause of the failure of engine No. 2.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When I hear today's facts, it could well be that this was the
thing that started the sequence of events,'' Trubshaw said. ``But
you really can't be sure until all the facts are in.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators studied the clues, many relatives of the
victims and Air France employees, gathered for a memorial service
at the La Madeleine church in Paris. Flight attendants and pilots
in uniform formed a kind of honor guard as the mourners, often
clutching hands and holding on to each other, climbed the church's
front steps. During the service, attended by a German delegation
headed by Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher and several French
ministers, 113 candles were place on the altar.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the ceremony, a minute of silence was observed
in each of Paris' three airports.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, a gritty, working class suburb, firefighters
finished the grim job of collecting the bodies of the 100
passengers, 9 crew members and four hotel employees who were killed
in the fireball created by the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the town's residents have hailed the pilot as a kind of
hero for bringing his jet down in a sparsely populated part of
town, believing that he deliberately tried to avoid the center. But
experts say there is no way to judge whether he intentionally
navigated the plane towards a sparsely populated field. Pilots in
the kind of crisis that Marty was facing are scarcely aware of what
is beneath them, they said. In many cases, they even lose control
of the plane because they are so busy dealing with the crisis that
they ``forget to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said they had still not made any decisions
about when to put Air France's remaining Concorde's back in
service. The sleek needle nosed jets are a favorite of celebrities
and corporate executives who pay as much as $11,000 for a
round-trip trans-Atlantic flight at 1,300 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Air France announced that it would pay about $20,000 to
relatives of the victims for their ``immediate material needs.''
The airline also said it would pay for the victims funerals and any
psychological counseling the relatives needed.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the BEA said that a preliminary report on the
crash would not be ready until the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the Concorde sometimes criticized for being too
noisy and costly had never crashed.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the
Concorde has had a history of small problems with its wheels and
tires.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's engines may have been damaged by debris from its own
tires on three previous occasions; in a fourth incident, a tire
blown on takeoff caused fuel and hydraulic leaks. But on all four
of those occasions, damage was minor. Modifications were made to
the wheels after the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Jet engines are highly susceptible to damage to the blades
inside the engine that suck air into the combustion chamber, or
other internal parts. Each engine creates a vortex in front of it,
a little like the swirl that appears in a full bathtub when the
drain plug is pulled out, that can suck loose objects into the
engine; birds or debris on the runway are most often the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1979, for instance, an Air France Concorde taking off
from Dulles International Airport near Washington suffered fuel and
hydraulic line leaks because of debris from blown tires.
</P>
<P>
   The next month an Air France Concorde was taking off again from
Dulles when according to the FAA the blades that suck air into the
engine stopped pulling in air smoothly due to some damage from a
foreign object.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1980, a British Airways Concorde landing at Dulles
blew a tire and ``pieces of tire damaged engine and airframe,''
according to an FAA database.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 19, 1981, an Air France Concorde blew a tire on takeoff
from Dulles. The aircraft landed safely at Kennedy International
Airport with one engine shut down ``due to vibration,'' caused by
part of the tire entering the engine, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of aircraft engines drawing in parts of its own tires
depends on design; for those with engines in the far rear, and
close to the fuselage, like DC-9s and Boeing 727s, it is less of a
problem; for planes with engines under the wings, like the
Concorde, it is a bigger hazard.

COLUMN: AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, wants to end his term by enacting new rules to increase
the independence of auditors from their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is,'' Levitt said near the end of a long day of public
hearings, ``a cultural change we are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditors are the only profession enshrined in our nation's
securities laws. If you want to sell stock to the public, you don't
have to hire a lawyer or an investment banker, but you do need an
independent accountant. Levitt fears that auditors are not
sufficiently concerned with assuring that they are seen as
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the accounting industry bitterly resent Levitt's latest
moves, which would force the accounting firms to stop providing
some consulting services they now provide to companies whose books
they audit. They say those services make them more familiar with
the company, and thus able to do better audits. And, they say,
there is no evidence that such relationships have led to bad
audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the rules say we must be independent in fact,'' said
James Copeland, the chief executive of Deloitte &AMP; Touche, in an
interview. Levitt is pushing rules that demand ``independence in
appearance,'' he said, adding that ``this Caesar's wife quote is
absurd.'' That's the one that says some people must be above
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   There probably never was a golden age of accounting
independence. Back in 1957, Leonard Spacek, the legendary managing
partner of Arthur Andersen, was warning that ``the profession's
existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough
independence. He complained that the accounting principle-setters
of that era ``yielded quickly'' when companies complained that a
new standard would cut their profits. ``Proper accounting
principles in this case were not even discussed,'' he moaned. He
warned that it was dangerous for auditors to be perceived as
advocates for their clients, rather than impartial fact finders.
</P>
<P>
   Many things have changed for the better since then. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board now sets accounting rules and
has exhibited backbone.
</P>
<P>
   But accounting chief executives talk a different language than
Spacek did. They are very confident that the public has confidence
in them, and point to high stock prices as evidence that investors
trust the financial statements they certify. To the extent there is
a perception that they lack independence, they blame the SEC for
raising the issue. You get the impression everything would be fine
if Levitt would just shut up or go away.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the major accounting firms _ Andersen, Deloitte and
KPMG _ are determined to fight the new SEC proposal. They are
lining up allies in Congress and preparing to go to court. They
hope to delay action until a new president can appoint a new SEC
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   They may win that fight. But such a victory would be pyrrhic.
Highly publicized resistance to rules that are described as seeking
to promote auditor independence will be remembered when _ as will
surely happen _ there is another case of an audit gone awry,
particularly if the auditing firm got far more money from
consulting relationships than it did for doing the audit.
</P>
<P>
   The industry should seek a compromise, perhaps one that lets
auditors continue to do more information technology consulting than
the SEC seems to want, but with safeguards and fuller disclosures.
But for now, there may be too much anger to allow such talks to
even get under way.

CARDINAL FORGIVES $28 MILLION OWED TO BOSTON ARCHDIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing an ancient biblical tradition of forgiving debts
every 50 years, Cardinal Bernard F. Law has decided to write off
$28 million owed to the Archdiocese of Boston by 104 Eastern
Massachusetts parishes.
</P>
<P>
   The debts, owed by nearly one-third of the parishes in the
archdiocese for items such as building renovations and insurance
premiums, have been a financial and psychological burden for many
of the poorest parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Many parishes with the highest levels of debt are urban parishes
that now minister to immigrant populations unable to pay the costs
of sprawling physical plants constructed by earlier, more affluent
generations of Catholics who have since migrated to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never stand on our own two feet because we always had
this debt hanging over us,'' said the Rev. William C. Francis,
pastor of Holy Family in Boston's Dorchester section, which will
have $700,000 in debts wiped away. ``Plus you always wonder if you
owe so much money and are not able to pay it, if they ever have to
come to a crunch, are you going to be the one that's crunched? This
will be one less worry to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Family is typical of the parishes that will be granted debt
relief. On the one hand, the parish is doing what parishes are
supposed to do: ministering to immigrants from Latin America and
the Caribbean as well as providing a school, a homeless shelter,
and a summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   But the parish could never hope to pay off the money it spent to
repair its church and its school _ weekly collections at Mass run
$1,000, and without a regular subsidy from the archdiocese the
church couldn't even stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Some parishes are also struggling to support schools once
attended predominanly by Catholic children and staffed at low cost
by priests and nuns but now attended by numerous non-Catholics
whose families are not parishoners and staffed by laypeople who
expect higher salaries than clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Law declined a request for an interview, but a top diocesan
official said the cardinal was moved not only by the moral
imperative of the jubilee year, but also by the desire to complete
a long-term effort at consolidating and strengthening parishes by
restoring them to financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these are inner city parishes that can't support the
old structures -- in a sense they educated themselves out of
existence, with fine Catholic schools that gave immigrant kids a
good Catholic education but now those kids live in Wellesley and
Weston and Sudbury,'' said the Rev. Thomas Groome, a Boston College
theologian. ``But society owes them a debt, and the cardinal's
forgiveness is...an extraordinary gesture of generosity in a
jubilee year in which the cardinal is clearly practicing what he
preaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian leaders, including Pope John Paul II, have made
debt forgiveness a theme this year, saying that a passage in
Leviticus requires debt forgiveness in jubilee years, which occur
every 50 years. Christians are celebrating a jubilee year this year
to mark the 2,000th anniversary of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious leaders have focused their debt forgiveness
efforts on pushing the United States and other wealthy governments
to forgive debt owed by poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Catholic hierarchy has been taking a more direct
approach to debt forgiveness. A number of Catholic bishops have
forgiven debts owed by parishes, although Law's action appears to
be the largest to date. Among the dioceses that have previously
acted are Camden, NJ, which forgave $12 million; St. Petersburg, $7
million; Buffalo, $5.5 million; and Pittsburgh, $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the $28 million in debt forgiveness will be granted
to 104 of the 372 parishes in the archdiocese. About 60 percent of
the aid will eliminate the debt of the 28 poorest parishes; the
balance will used to help reduce the debt of other parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to stabilize and position these parishes to move
forward into the new millennium without dealing with debts that
were insurmountable,'' said David W. Smith, the archdiocese's vice
chancellor for financial affairs. ``We are taking care of each
other, as we are supposed to do. Now these parishes can go forward
and implement their own individual missions without having to face
financial burdens that are beyond their ability to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual parishes in the Boston area are not incorporated, so
they can not borrow money from banks. Instead, they borrow money
from a revolving fund maintained by the archdiocese. Wealthy
parishes deposit savings into the account, earning 5.5 percent
interest; that money is loaned to poorer parishes, at an annual
rate of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese also provides a variety of types of insurance
coverage and employee benefits for parishes, and charges them fees
for those services.
</P>
<P>
   The debts are incurred when parishes can not afford to pay back
the money they owe to the archdiocese. Failure to repay debt does
not result in parish closings or other Draconian steps, but pastors
and parishes often find high levels of debt hurt morale and
distract parishes from other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The $28 million forgiven will have to be made up through
fundraising, Smith said. That amount is a fairly large sum for the
archdiocese -- by way of comparison, Law raises about $17 million a
year through contributions.

GOP MOVES TOWARD REVAMPED PRIMARY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a potentially serious blow to New Hampshire's
status as the first-primary state, a bitterly divided Republican
National Committee has tentatively approved to a plan that does not
guarantee any state the right of being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire officials held out hope that the Republican
nominee-in-waiting, George W. Bush, would come to the rescue,
either arranging for the Rules Committee to kill the plan Friday or
by persuading enough delegates to oppose it during a final vote on
the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself is in an awkward position. He made the usual pledge
before this year's New Hampshire primary that he supported the
state's first-in-the-nation status. But Bush then lost the primary
to Senator John McCain of Arizona, who took advantage of New
Hampshire's independent-minded electorate to win the state and
nearly upset Bush's run for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Bush supporters are not anxious to support New
Hampshire's cause. A Bush spokesman, asked whether the governor
would try to help New Hampshire by urging defeat of the plan, said
Bush so far is taking a wait-and-see role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concern about the plan but we have not weighed in
yet and we want to listen to the different sides as the delegates
debate it,'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   While the fight sounds like the proverbial pre-convention
``inside baseball,'' it filled nearly the entire agenda of the RNC
Thursday because the issue appears to be the only one that might
erupt into a fight on the convention floor _ the sort of discord
the Bush forces have worked hard to avoid. The Bush team, for
example, has gone to lengths to prevent a fight on abortion or any
other policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of radically altering the primary schedule
affects so many delegates so directly that many are anxious to take
the historic step of rewriting the rules. Many party leaders are
fed up with the current system, in which some states rush to be
first, creating a front-loaded calendar in which the nomination is
settled within weeks and many states have little or no say in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all of the states would be put in several
``pods,'' with the 12 smallest states going first and the largest
states going last. Most of the larger states, including
Massachusetts, opposed the plan out of concern that the nomination
would be decided before the last one or two rounds of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was approved by the RNC, made up mostly of
representatives of the state, by a vote of 92-55. Friday, a
different group, the convention's Rules Committee, takes up the
matter. It is possible the plan will be killed by that body because
it may want to avoid a floor fight. But if it goes to the floor,
the states would vote on a proportional basis, meaning that the
more populous states would have far more voting power than the
smaller ones and could join together to kill the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, the national committeeman from New Hampshire, said the
larger states are likely to have enough votes to kill the plan, but
it was too close to call. In any case, Rath said he was pleased
that the RNC adopted a ``flexibility amendment'' allowing the plan
to be rewritten at any time. ``I'm not worried,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rath, who considered offering a motion that would have
solidified New Hampshire's status, decided against doing so because
it might have been defeated. When a South Carolina delegate asked
for an exemption from the plan to remain an early primary state, he
lost on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not strip away New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
status, but instead is silent on the question and put the state in
the same ``primary pod'' as 11 other small states. Some New
Hampshire officials said that in the worst case scenario, they
could ignore the party and hold the first primary while forfeiting
the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the plan is defeated, it is likely another version
will be proposed. RNC chairman Jim Nicholson said the current
system is so front-loaded with early primaries that it is headed
for a ``train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's influence is in danger partly because it has a
recent history of upsetting the candidates preferred by the
Republican establishment, which holds much influence over the
primary structure. Patrick Buchanan made a strong second-place
showing that hurt then-President Bush in 1992. Buchanan won in
1996, upsetting Bob Dole, and McCain won this year.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, whatever the Republicans do in the coming days,
there is no assurance that the Democrats will follow suit.

BUCHANAN OPPONENTS WANT 250,000 BALLOTS INVALIDATED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Opponents of Patrick Buchanan will attempt this
weekend to invalidate more than 250,000 ballots requested for
Buchanan supporters in a plebiscite to determine the Reform Party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan is essentially stuffing the ballot box,'' Russell
Verney, a former chairman of the party founded by Ross Perot, said
in a telephone interview Thursday. The names, Verney said, were
submitted by the Buchanan campaign from a database of the
candidate's Republican supporters rather than from the rolls of
Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
   The party's 10-member executive committee will take up the issue
at a meeting in Dallas Saturday, following a ruling Wednesday night
by a separate subcommittee that the Buchanan campaign had failed to
verify that the ballots would be going to bona fide Reform Party
members.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mangia, national secretary of the Reform Party, said he
originally expected about 100,000 party members to vote for this
year's nominee, a number that would be swamped if the Buchanan
voters are approved. Mangia also opposes Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign belittled the challenge, saying the latest
charges were based on inaccurate information. ``We are confident
that Pat Buchanan is going to get the nomination. He has gone state
by state, winning strong majorities,'' said K.B. Forbes, a Buchanan
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Reform Party is being roiled by charges and
countercharges as it moves toward a national convention beginning
August 10 in Long Beach, Cal. In the years since Perot established
the party and ran as its presidential nominee in 1992 and 1996 the
organization has become the scene of nearly constant conflict.
Verney, a Perot loyalist, said the Texas businessman had no role in
the current infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ballots, Buchanan forces and veteran Reform Party
officials are squabbling over the credentials of delegates planning
to attend the convention. Rival delegates from as many as 40 states
may show up at the convention, Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Buchanan began his push to claim the Reform Party
nomination less than a year ago, his followers have seized control
of delegations in a number of states. His opponents say the
Buchanan supporters have no interest in Reform Party precepts and
are merely using it as a vehicle for Buchanan's candidacy. Also at
stake is $12.5 million in Federal campaign funds that will be
turned over to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than building the party, they are muscling people
out,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Verney and other long-time Reform Party leaders are rallying
behind John Hagelin, a physicist who has run for president twice
before as a Natural Law Party candidate. In a press conference here
earlier this week, Hagelin said he ``will not let this process be
stolen by what could be massive voter fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The feud over delegates may be resolved at a meeting of the
163-member national committee two days before the convention
begins, when Buchanan forces are expected to try to install a
friendly chairman of the credentials committee in order to ensure
that Buchanan delegates will be seated.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks are expected to erupt. In February, a meeting of the
national committee dissolved into a near riot and police threatened
several times to intervene and bring the proceedings to a halt.
Just before that meeting, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota bolted
the party and claimed it had become ``hopelessly dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's activisits were ousted at the February meeting by an
alliance of Buchanan supporters and the old Perot faction, but that
coalition has now broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds confusing,'' Verney said. ``We're not only
here to govern, we're here to entertain.''

NASA TO VENTURE BACK TO MARS, TANTALIZED BY PROSPECTS OF WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo.)   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With new, tantalizing evidence of possible running water on Mars
in the recent past, NASA has decided to send at least one and
perhaps two large robotic roving vehicles to scout the planet's
surface for signs of water, past or present.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
announced Thursday that a spacecraft carrying the rover would be
launched in 2003 on a seven-month journey to the planet, arriving
in January 2004. The rover would be a larger, more elaborate
version of the Mars Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, that operated for
a few weeks on the planet in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space
science, made the decision to develop a landing craft with a rover
for the 2003 Mars mission, instead of flying another spacecraft for
making observations from an orbit of the planet. Another orbiter is
already being built and is to be launched toward Mars next April.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Weiler said he was still weighing
the possibility of launching a second 2003 rover at the same time.
The two vehicles would be sent to widely separated and diverse
landing sites, probably a dry lake bed or apparent flood channel.
Landing sites are to be selected on the basis of mapping data being
gathered by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which has been
orbiting the planet since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look into what could be an amazing opportunity, as
well as a challenge, by sending two such rovers to two very
different locations,'' he said, promising to reach that decision in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from NASA headquarters in Washington,
Scott Hubbard, the agency's Mars program director, said, ``Two
landers and rovers have a lot to offer, but we have to do a careful
study of the scheduling and budget implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plans for Mars exploration represent NASA's latest
effort to recover from two devastating failures of Mars missions
last year and to take advantage of excitement over new findings by
the Mars Global Surveyor, which suggest the presence of reservoirs
of liquid water hidden under parts of the dry, cold Martian
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Any hint that Mars had or still has some liquid water provokes
thoughts of the planet's harboring some forms of life in the past
and possibly even now. Some scientists recently saw in surface
markings evidence of possible subsurface liquid water there. Even
if this was not supporting Martian life, the presence of water
could be a source of oxygen and fuel for human explorers to the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   In studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
and Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, engineers came up with
a mission plan that resembled the successful Mars Pathfinder
landing _ only on a larger scale. The lander would parachute to a
bouncing, rolling touchdown on Mars. The rover, weighing about 300
pounds, would constitute nearly all of the payload.
</P>
<P>
   The new rover would be able to travel about 110 yards each day,
almost as far in one Martian day as the Sojourner rover did over
its entire lifetime. It should be capable of operating for at least
90 days, until late April 2004, but could prove more durable.
Beside testing for signs of water and making geological studies,
the rover will send back detailed color and infrared pictures of
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``By studying a diverse array of Martian materials, including
the interiors of rocks, the instruments aboard the rover will
reveal the secrets of past Martian environments,'' said James
Garvin, Mars program scientist at NASA headquarters. ``This is a
key stepping stone to the future of our Mars exploration program.''

 &HT;    Cheney successful in politics and business By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Dick Cheney came to the cloistered,
good-ol' boy world of the oil business five years ago as chief
executive of Halliburton Co., many wondered whether he could make
the transition.
</P>
<P>
   He'd spent his entire working life in Washington as either a
White House staffer, Congressman or cabinet member. It was hard for
some to see how a life inside the Beltway would play in the oil
patch of West Texas, the oil fields of the Middle East or the North
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney proved surprisingly well suited to running a global
business, those who observed him from inside and outside the
company say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mixed bag initially because he didn't have any
business experience,'' industry analyst Gary Russell, who worked at
Halliburton from 1990 to 1997, said of the reaction within the
company to Cheney's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney quickly put any worries to rest by recognizing his lack
of industry experience and submerging himself into the grit of oil
and gas production.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the well site and technology labs,'' said Dale
Jones, former vice chairman at Halliburton who retired in late
1998. ``He got up to speed in the first six to nine months. He
really focused on that and made everyone in the company who may
have been concerned about that aspect of his background more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is said to have caught the eye of former Halliburton
Chief Executive Tom Cruikshank on a fishing trip with several CEO's
in 1994 when Cruikshank was contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Cruikshank were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had about a week together,'' said Kent Hance, a former
Texas Railroad Commission chairman and attorney specializing in oil
and gas, who talked to Cruikshank about it later. ``He said he was
impressed with (Cheney's) depth and understanding of world
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was hired because he knew the right people in the right
places to be an asset to the oil industry. He worked in one White
House that suffered through an oil crisis _ as chief of staff under
former President Ford _ and directed a war over oil for another _
the elder Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: Cheney possessed star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who knew people all over the world. He could get
audience with them and get Halliburton's foot in the door,'' said
Hance.
</P>
<P>
   He and Cheney entered Congress the same year, 1979. Cheney
represented Wyoming, and Hance represented Lubbock, Midland and
Odessa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the former secretary of defense wants to meet with CEO and
president of Shell Oil in Amsterdam, they're going to see him,''
Hance said. ``If he wants to meet with King Fahd in Saudi Arabia,
they're going to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Cheney's draw was impressive, said Jones, who
accompanied Cheney on several trips overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of customers and potential customers who we
could see with him. They recognized him and wanted to meet him.
These were people used to meeting with CEOs. Here was a person who
had name recognition all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Cheney's contacts and name recognition paid off in
contracts such as the $2.5 billion deal Halliburton recently won
with Petrobas, Brazil's state-owned oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's other contributions are harder to gauge. The company is
more than double the size it was when Cheney took over, but it's
had to struggle with one of the industry's worst recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue climbed to $14.9 billion from $5.9 billion between 1995
and 1999. Market capitalization _ the value of all shareholders'
stock _ rose to $18.5 billion from about $6.2 billion. Employment
nearly doubled during the same time, rising to 103,000 from 57,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've definitely taken steps in right direction,'' said
Russell, who follows Halliburton for Frost Securities in Dallas.
``I don't know how much can be attributed to him; but while he's
been there, a lot of good things happened with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney demonstrated a command of the art of compromise and
negotiation two years ago in orchestrating the merger with Dresser
Industries Inc., Halliburton's cross-town rival in the
oilfield-services business.
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger had been probed extensively just a few years
before by Cheney's predecessor but was abandoned because of
Halliburton's weak stock price at the time, said Jones, who worked
on the merger with both Cheney and Cruikshank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the deal,'' Jones said of Cheney. ``Some deals can can
get done in an amicable way, and some can't. When this was
finished, Dick and Bill Bradford (Dresser's chief executive) were
good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's years of experience negotiating delicate matters, such
as the multinational coalition that made the Gulf War possible,
were evident from the start at Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes into a meeting, you don't get the sense he's
going to railroad you. He doesn't pound the table,'' Jones said.
``I never saw the guy blow up or come close to it. He doesn't use
foul language of any type. He's got such a vocabulary that he
doesn't have to resort to that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all easy: As he did with the military while secretary
of defense, Cheney had to make painful cuts. Just months after the
Dresser acquisition, Cheney had to lay off about 9,500 people when
an industry recession set in.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain how Cheney's tenure ultimately will be viewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, his tenure coincided with a recession in the
energy business,'' said Tom Escott, managing director,
Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta, who follows Halliburton.
``There's nothing he could have done to prevent a worldwide
downturn in drilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's management style was forged by running a White House
under siege in the mid-70s and a Pentagon at war in the early
1990s. He was unlike his predecessor at Halliburton, who would meet
several times with executives before making a major decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick was more used to people coming in (once), giving a
presentation, offering alternatives and then making a decision
right then and there. It's a pattern he'd become accustomed to as
secretary of defense. It wasn't a bad pattern, just different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney didn't drop names or play up his involvement in the
Persian Gulf War around the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty humble guy,'' Jones said. ``He didn't tell war
stories. It's not his character. He felt it would wear pretty
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was comfortable making big decisions himself, but he kept
his options open and didn't burn bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he sought consensus, but I would say he sought
input,'' Jones sa$5.6 million. He still holds stock options today
worth $8.4 million more than what he'd have to pay to exercise
them.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton became a more Republican environment during the past
five years. Since Cheney took over, Halliburton has given around
$400,000 each election cycle, totaling $1.2 million over six years.
All but $40,000 of it has gone to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cheney's arrival, its political contributions were much
smaller and somewhat more evenly split between the parties. In the
1992 cycle, the company gave $67,000, 25 percent of which went to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, two people with long ties to the Bushes and the
Republican party, joined the board:
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hunt, chief executive of Dallas-based Hunt Oil Co., is
national finance chairman for Victory 2000, the Republican National
Committee's voter-participation arm.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Eagleburger, an adviser to a Washington, D.C., law
firm, was deputy secretary of state for President Bush. Hance said
he wasn't surprised by Cheney's return to politics and said he's a
good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured for some time he'd be in Bush's cabinet if he wanted
to,'' Hance said. ``More surprising is he got in the oil business
in the first place.''

 &HT;    CDC investigates stalking as issue of public health
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than one in every six American women may have been stalked
at least once in her life, according to a study released Thursday
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one-third of women who have been stalked have been
injured as a result, and more than half experienced profound stress
because they were forced to disrupt their lives for more than a
month to avoid their stalkers, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, one of the first to look at stalking from a public
health perspective rather than through law enforcement records, was
based on telephone interviews with 1,171 women in Louisiana.
However, it is applicable beyond that state, CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to recognize that this level of violence is so
endemic that it constitutes an actual threat to public health,''
said Tina Trent, who researches violence against women at Emory
University and is the former director of Georgians for Choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, four out of five women who were stalked said that
they knew the stalker; in half of stalking cases, the person
threatening them was a former spouse or boyfriend. Three-fourths of
the women believed their lives were in danger from the stalker,
even though most escaped injury.
</P>
<P>
   Members of law enforcement who work on violence against women
said the CDC's findings were reliable, possibly even an
underestimate. The CDC found, for instance, that two-thirds of
women who had been stalked had reported the crime to law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect not-reporting to be much higher,'' said Gerald
Blaney of Gwinnett County's State Court Solicitor's Office. His
caseload includes 100 instances of stalking a year, prosecuted
under a Georgia law that went into effect three years ago.
Successful prosecution requires ``an enthusiastic, cooperative,
observant victim,'' he said. ``It is not the kind of crime that an
officer can be patrolling on the street and see occur. It has to be
reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Because two-thirds of women who were stalked were not injured,
and one-third never reported the stalking to police, traditional
means of uncovering violence against women such as police reports
and medical records may not be a reliable guide to the problem, CDC
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney agreed that many cases never reach the justice system,
despite their severe impact on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that it is disruptive of lives is a gross
understatement,'' he said. ``It's just horrible for people. It's a
relief that our society has recognized it as a problem.''

&HT;     PELOSI CONFIDENT OF HOUSE LEADERSHIP POST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she has
enough support from fellow Democrats to become majority whip, the
No. 3 position in the House leadership, if the party wins control
of the chamber in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   In her most confident statement yet about her prospects for
capturing the post, Pelosi said that if Democratic lawmakers were
to vote today, she would defeat her rival, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland. The whip acts as the chief vote counter and works to
rally party members to support the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a clear majority,'' Pelosi said. ``It's undeniable that
I have the commitments. I am very confident about the numbers that
I have.''
</P>
<P>
   She said more than 80 Democratic representatives were supporting
her. But her quest for the leadership job hinges on whether the
party achieves its goal of regaining a majority in the House, six
years after the Republicans won control of both the House and
Senate in a humiliating defeat for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The whip contest heated up last week after Georgia Rep. John
Lewis announced that he was dropping out of consideration after
concluding ``the votes are simply not there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis then endorsed Hoyer, setting off a feverish scramble by
the remaining two candidates to capture commitments from his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said he won commitments from about half of Lewis' 30
supporters, while Pelosi said Lewis' exit gave her enough new
supporters to put her over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic of John getting out of the race added to my
numbers,'' Pelosi said. ``The boost I received from Lewis leaving
the race has solidified it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said Pelosi's claim of victory is premature and that it is
``a tactic to try to stampede people into thinking it's a done
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Any candidate would need a majority of votes from the Democratic
Caucus, which now has 210 members. There are 223 Republicans and
two independents in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats gain control of the House, Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri, now the minority leader, would become speaker. David
E. Bonior of Michigan, now the minority whip, would become majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said between 90 and 95 House colleagues were supporting
his candidacy for the No. 3 post.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have it locked up and I believe I have more votes
than she does,'' Hoyer said of Pelosi. ``They wouldn't be trying so
hard if they had it locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said a majority of members have told him they think he
would be a better whip, but that some have said they are supporting
Pelosi ``because they think we need gender diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer, now in his 10th term, is more senior than Pelosi, who is
serving her 7th two-year term in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer added that he hasn't pressured anyone to publicly declare
support for him because the whip's race is hypothetical unless
Democrats win control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a reason to trot out a bunch of lists,'' Hoyer
said. ``If there was a real race, that's a different story.''

 &HT;    EarthLink has strong growth, lower losses
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Inc. on Thursday reported booming revenue, a
shrinking loss and strong customer growth as it continued its
pursuit of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The company also acknowledged that quality of service _ on which
it pegs its reputation _ suffered at least in the first few months
of the merger between EarthLink and MindSpring Enterprises as the
companies melded network and customer service operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some rocky times in the first quarter,'' said
company President Michael McQuary. ``I think we will continue to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company offers Internet access _ including
high-speed connections _ as well as Web hosting services. The
company says recent troubles have been temporary and limited, and
that customers should check its Web site or _ if they cannot get
online _ call customer support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever problems there have been, EarthLink has not shed
customers more rapidly than before. In fact, during the first
quarter, 5 percent of customers broke their EarthLink connection, a
``churn'' rate that dipped to 4.2 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink reported revenue of $230.9 million for the quarter
ended June 30, up 41 percent from revenue of $163.7 million in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net loss for the quarter of $35.2
million, or 29 cents per share, not including acquisition and
merger-related costs. EarthLink had net income of $5.3 million, or
5 cents per share, during the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But growth matters more right now than short-term profits, in
EarthLink's view, and the company finished the quarter with 3.7
million subscribers. With ``organic'' growth and the completion of
a deal to acquire OneMain.com, EarthLink will reach 5 million
subscribers by year's end, McQuary said.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of EarthLink's growth comes from former AOL members,
he said. ``We are in the second inning, not the seventh inning. We
will continue to close the gap with AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has more than 23 million members, in addition to its massive
deal to buy Time Warner. If that merger is completed, AOL will
increasingly become a media company, owning content like the shows
that run on Time Warner's cable service, McQuary said. ``We are in
a different business. We don't compete against Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer dial-up represents a declining portion of the
business _ about 85 percent of revenues. Meanwhile, the company
increasingly looks elsewhere for future profits. For instance,
high-speed lines are increasingly seen as the preferred connection
to the Net. EarthLink now has 80,000 customers with that
``broadband'' link. The company expects to have 150,000 broadband
customers by year's end using digital subscriber lines (DSL), cable
modems and wireless.

 &HT;    American Software fighting for Wall Street attention
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American Software's performance is anything but
monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been up. We've been down. We've been up. We've been
down. And at this particular point in time, we're in a down
cycle,'' said James Edenfield, chief executive officer and
co-founder of the Atlanta-based company.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barron's last month called American Software ``a busted
technology play.'' But the financial weekly also said the stock,
selling at about $4, was a potential bargain. For that price,
buyers could pick up a company with $2 per share in cash and 85
percent ownership in Logility, another software company with nearly
as much cash per share, Barron's noted.
</P>
<P>
   American Software stock had been trading at more than $8 in
mid-May, when the company issued an earnings warning. It posted a
fourth-quarter loss of $2.7 million, or 12 cents a share, on $23.3
million in revenue. For the fiscal year it lost $1.2 million, or 6
cents a share, on revenue of $105.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old company now hopes to repair its image with Wall
Street and reward shareholders by taking at least one, and maybe
more, of its subsidiaries public.
</P>
<P>
   First up will be AmQuest, which provides computer services,
including a home for Web sites. American Software had hoped to take
the unit public earlier this year, until the IPO market fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield predicts that AmQuest on its own will be worth more
than American Software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the market, at the present time, really
understands it. And maybe if it does understand it, doesn't quite
believe it, but we're going to bring this off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, American Software announced it was considering an
IPO for AmQuest, a unit on track to produce about $25 million in
annual revenue and operating at about break even, according to
Edenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Edenfield sold 237,262 Class A shares of
American Software. Chairman Thomas Newberry, the other founder,
sold 80,000 ``A'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams of Jefferies &AMP; Co., the only analyst following
American Software, likened the selling to ``shooting yourself in
the foot ahead of the offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield doesn't quite see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I kind of believe it's better to sell when the
stock is high than when it's low,'' he said. ``So it was a little
bit of that. And then I had a need to diversify my holdings for
estate planning purposes. And we had never entered the registration
process with AmQuest, nor have we yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield holds only 72,000 ``A'' shares, plus options to buy
another 53,000, according to American Software. But he still owns
just over 2.1 million ``B'' shares, which can be converted to ``A''
shares on a one-to-one basis and which carry 10 times the voting
power of an ``A'' share. Only he and Newberry own ``B'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   American Software plans to sell less than 20 percent of AmQuest
to the public, making it possible to distribute the rest of the
stock tax-free to American Software shareholders. That would be a
change from the Logility IPO in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   American Software sold about 16 percent of Logility to the
public and has held on to the rest, although a distribution of the
stock has not been ruled out, Edenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest possible offering of AmQuest would be in the fall,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has a ``buy'' rating on American Software,
recently estimated AmQuest's potential market value at between $286
million and $418 million. American Software's market value is about
$130 million.
</P>
<P>
   American Software is also looking at the possibility of an IPO
for Intellimedia Commerce, which builds and manages Web sites _
AirTran Airways is a client _ and invests in start-up companies
through a venture capital partnership with Cordova Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting for a minute the IPO possibilities, the issue at
American Software and Logility is not their productstion, he says,
plus general weakness in the enterprise resource planning market.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, American Software, which sells software to control
manufacturing, ordering, distribution and other processes, has
added an Internet-based version of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Logility, headed by Michael Edenfield, James' son, has doubled
its sales force over the last year and a half and reached deals
with IBM and Great Plains Software to expand distribution channels.
Logility's software is used to improve the efficiency of
manufacturing, distribution and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   American Software's products fare well against those of larger
competitors, and service and support scores are above the industry
average, according to Jim Lebinski, vice president and research
director of Gartner Decision Drivers Interactive in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas that could use improvement, he said, have nothing to
do with the products and everything to do with assuring potential
customers about what to expect in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Software must consistently improve on, and show
positive financial results, in order to assure future viability,''
he said. Also, he added, the company needs to gain market share and
``aggressively'' tell potential customers where the company is
headed on product development.

MITCHELL TIES TO BIG TOBACCO COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Al Gore decides to pick a running mate with the kind of
heavy-hitting sobriety that George W. Bush sought in Dick Cheney,
he could reach for George Mitchell, the former Senate majority
leader who successfully guided the Irish peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But a Mitchell candidacy would also carry a major complication:
ties to every major American tobacco company that have brought
millions of dollars annually to the Washington law firm he now
calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it peculiar that someone as respected and with the
stature of George Mitchell would go to work for the tobacco
companies that make a product that kills 400,000 Americans every
year,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for
Public Integrity, a government ethics group. ``I just hope they're
paying him a lot to tarnish his otherwise impressive credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore aides won't say who is being considered for the vice
presidential spot, Mitchell is being praised by some prominent
Democrats, including President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's work for the tobacco industry has been rarely
mentioned. When Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co., among others, found their
livelihoods being threatened a few years ago by anti-tobacco
activists, they turned to just about every prominent lobbyist they
could find, both Republican and Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson
&AMP; Hand offered strategic advice from two of the Senate's most
experienced players _ Mitchell, the Democrat who represented Maine
for 15 years, and Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader
from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The firm took in $10.6 million from tobacco companies in 1996
and $8.9 million in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group. So far this year,
Verner Liipfert has collected $4.8 million from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Senator Mitchell's record is very good. This smoking
thing was a major blot on his record,'' said John Banzhaf, the
executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, an anti-smoking
group.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to key figures in the tobacco legislation and
litigation saga, Mitchell played an active role reaching out to
Democrats and public health groups to bring them to the negotiating
table. At the first major meeting of all the parties at a
Washington-area hotel, Mitchell welcomed the participants and
opened the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal impression was he used his stature and his
credibility to try to provide sufficient credibility to the tobacco
companies' overture to organizations like mine and the state
attorneys general,'' said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign
for Tobacco-Free Kids. Myers said he received a phone call from
Mitchell to persuade him to join the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the cigarette manufacturers became increasingly unhappy with
tobacco legislation pending in the Senate, their lobbyists helped
stop the measure in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry then turned to the state attorneys general,
cutting a separate deal to pay the states $368 billion in exchange
for immunity from future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's connection to the tobacco industry could be a problem
for Gore, who has had his own off-and-on relationship with tobacco,
and who employs Carter Eskew, the media strategist who once crafted
the cigarette industry's multimillion-dollar advertising campaign
against a tobacco tax.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago, Gore gave an
emotional speech detailing his sister Nancy's ``unbearable pain''
as she lay dying of lung cancer from the cigarettes she began
smoking at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore continued taking campaign contributions from the
tobacco industry even after his sister's death in 1984. As a
presidential candidate in 1988, he opposed restrictions on tobacco
advertising and defended those who earned their livelihoods farming
tobacco. During a speech in North Carolina, Gore proudly recounted
that his own family grew tobacco on their Tennessee farm.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore frequently speaks of his desire to prevent
youngsters from starting to smoke, as well as the need to restrict
tobacco advertising directed at children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the vice president's controversial past with tobacco,
given the snafus over his speech in Chicago and over his own media
adviser, it would seem ill-advised to make a vice presidential
selection that revives the tobacco issue,'' said one Democratic
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has stated three criteria for his running mate,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman. ``He's looking for someone
who could take over at a moment's notice if necessary, who can work
closely with him as a partner, and who can join him in taking on
the powerful special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mitchell would fulfill the final criterion is up to
Gore. The vice president, aides say, will announce his choice of a
running mate sometime after the Republicans wrap up their
convention in Philadelphia at the end of next week.

TENSIONS BUILD AS INAUGURATION IN PERU NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In this capital on Thursday, women were washing
Peruvian flags they say have been sullied by President Alberto K.
Fujimori, vendors were selling crude gas masks and riot police were
taking up positions.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is to begin his third five-year term on Friday, having
resisted pressures for democratic reforms. It promises to be a
raucous inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Through a mix of economic populism, political repression and
deal making in Congress, he has tightened his grip on power since
his re-election eight weeks ago, which was roundly criticized for
vote tampering and campaign dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   After the voting, Fujimori promised to work with the
Organization of American States to strengthen the independence of
the judiciary, to revamp electoral agencies and to expand freedom
of the press. He has, however, reduced the influence of officials
in his government who have most advocated reform.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, led by Alejandro Toledo, the business professor
who dropped out of the presidential race a week before the May 28
runoff, has organized more than 100,000 people across the country
to march in an attempt to blemish the inauguration. But efforts to
block the ceremony have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has appeared oblivious to criticism from the United
States and many Latin American and European governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinions of other countries are not important to us,'' he
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Using the large majority he controlled in the lame-duck
Congress, Fujimori pushed through legislation that gives the agency
regulating telecommunications more power to monitor private phone
conversations and to obtain access to computer and telephone
records without court order.
</P>
<P>
   He also has broken with his usual free-market policies, through
a new law that removes tax benefits for foreign mining companies
that reinvest profits in the country. He has blocked several
privatizations in order to maintain control over gas and water
prices as well as to shore up a government pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have upset businessmen and Wall Street analysts, who
express concerns that Fujimori will use populist economic policies
to buttress his political position.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress acted not only to clear high-level
Fujimori campaign officials of charges that they led an effort to
forge a million signatures to put the president on the ballot, but
also voted to make four whistle-blowers who exposed the forgery
criminally liable.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of forged signatures, substantiated by the newspaper
El Comercio, badly damaged Fujimori during the campaign and were a
large factor in his failure to win a first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS is continuing to press for a democratic opening, but
Fujimori has refused to follow a demand that he fire his
intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, for campaign abuses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fujimori has not faced international sanctions, aside
from a few mostly symbolic actions by the U.S. Congress, which
delayed delivery of $42 million in foreign aid and excluded Peru
from a recent $1.3 billion anti-narcotics package that primarily
helps Colombia, but also Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has signaled that it will continue to
work with Fujimori, particularly on anti-narcotics programs. Still,
it expressed strong comments about Fujimori when Ambassador John
Hamilton told a July 4 gathering in Lima that ``cosmetic or
superficial changes will not resolve the crisis of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton will lead a spare U.S. delegation to the inauguration.
The only foreign presidents to attend will be Hugo Banzer of
Bolivia and Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador. Nine Latin American
presidents attended Fujimori's last inauguration in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has tried to head off a chilling of relations with
Washington by ordering the air force to deploy 18 Sukhoi-25
tactical fighter jets, formerly used as a deterrent against
Ecuador, to fight the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition had placed its hopes on international influence,
believing that the United States and the Organization of American
States might even prevail on Peru to hold new elections. But now
Toledo and other opposition leaders are expressing bitter
disappointment, going so far as to accuse the regional group of
complicity in Fujimori's election victory.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or so opposition legislators have changed sides in the
last two months, so Toledo's ability to pressure Fujimori has
decreased. In one case, a former Toledo ally in the new Congress
changed his allegiances after judges friendly to Fujimori reversed
an embezzlement conviction against him.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have found rising concentrations of a newly
identified gas in the air that traps heat more effectively than all
other known greenhouse gases, the dozens of compounds released by
industry and the burning of fuels that act like a greenhouse roof
and may be warming the global climate.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic gas is extremely rare, so far reaching
concentrations just over one-tenth of one part per trillion of air,
according to a paper being published Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   But it still poses potential problems, the paper's authors say,
because concentrations of the gas are rising quickly, the gas
probably takes more than 1,000 years to break down and its source _
although certainly from human activities _ is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there is far too small a quantity to be of concern,''
said William T. Sturges, an atmospheric chemist at the University
of East Anglia in Norwich, England, and the study's principal
author. ``But I wouldn't want to see it enormously increased.''
</P>
<P>
   The study provides the latest evidence of the global reach of
pollution and the sometimes unintended consequences of industrial
activity, said many chemists familiar with the report. Advance
copies of the paper circulated this week by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some chemists said Thursday that it was possible that the gas
was being used secretly in military equipment. A similar gas,
sulfur hexafluoride, or SF6, is on lists of chemicals used in
electronics and in weapons and for other military purposes. But
they added that the new gas might also be used secretly by some
industry or it could simply be an unintentional byproduct of some
manufacturing process somewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The gas was found in samples taken by instrument-laden balloons
21 miles up in the stratosphere and in air trapped under layers of
Antarctic snow. Its name, trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride, is
enough of a tongue twister that chemists prefer to talk about it
using its chemical formula, SF5 CF3.
</P>
<P>
   Its discoverers found no evidence of the gas in the air before
the 1950s, with only a scattering of molecules appearing in the
1960s and then a steady rise, with concentrations now rising about
6 percent a year. Altogether, the scientists calculated, about
4,000 tons have been released so far, with another 270 tons emitted
each year.
</P>
<P>
   That still has resulted in an overall concentration of only
about 0.12 parts per trillion in air, making the gas exceedingly
rare, Sturges said.
</P>
<P>
   But because SF5 CF3 is such a potent, and nearly permanent,
heat-trapping gas, he and his colleagues said, they hope the
finding will serve as a call to industry and governments to find
its source.
</P>
<P>
   Molecule for molecule, it is 18,000 times as effective at
trapping heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the most
familiar greenhouse gas, Sturges said. And, like the durable
chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, or CFCs, that can erode the earth's
protective ozone layer, the gas is extremely long-lived, with
molecules probably persisting for 1,000 years or more once they are
lofted in the air, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several chemists who work with similar compounds
said that they were astonished to learn that thousands of tons of
the chemical had infiltrated the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly fell off my chair,'' said Gary A. Gard, a chemistry
professor at Portland State University in Oregon, who is a leading
expert in the properties of compounds containing fluorine, a
versatile element that has helped scientists produce the atom bomb,
prevent tooth decay and make products like Teflon coatings and
refrigerants.
</P>
<P>
   Gard recalled how SF5 CF3 had first been synthesized more than
40 years ago by one of his mentors, George H. Cady, at the
University of Washington, but had never found much use beyond pure
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one is using it on an
industrial scale,'' Gard said. ``It's the kind of research chemical
where you'd buy 100 grams or 50 grams, but you wouldn't buy a ton
of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chemists said that SF5 CF3 was briefly employed about 30
years ago as a kind of chemical tag to track the flow of pollution
from smokestacks. The advantages were that it was inert and stood
out clearly in samples taken downwind, said Edward A. Tyczkowski, a
fluorine chemist in Newport, Tenn., who once manufactured about 100
pounds of the material for government scientists. But he said only
a few pounds were used in such tests and he knew of no large-scale
production of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Gard agreed with a theory proposed by Sturges that the traces of
the chemical in the air could be some unnoticed byproduct of
industrial processes using fluorine. He also agreed that a search
should be made for the source.
</P>
<P>
   F. Sherwood Rowland, an atmospheric chemist at the University of
California at Irvine, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1995 for
discovering the link between CFCs and the ozone layer, noted that
other greenhouse gases containing fluorine were unintended
industrial byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the new finding was important because it
underscored the need to give serious consideration to even the
atmosphere's most minor constituents.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, he said, the new gas is similar to CFCs, which
prompted an international treaty to protect the ozone layer but
have never existed in concentrations higher than 550 parts per
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Gard said the newly discovered atmospheric gas also served as a
reminder that the atmosphere is not some boundless expanse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago people thought, We can dump anything we want
in the ocean because it's so vast,'' he said. ``It's the same thing
with the atmosphere. It's just been seen as this huge sink. Now we
see it's not an infinite reservoir. People should realize that and
start taking better care of it.''

WORKPLACE BANS ON DISCUSSING PAY COME UNDER ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Vt., Ill., Tenn., Wis., Va.)   By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago when Mary Craig went to work as an assistant cook
at an Ohio nursing home, her new boss made an odd demand: Never
discuss pay with the other help. Loose lips would cause hard
feelings, the boss said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig soon racked up a promotion, an Employee of the Month
award, an outstanding year-end evaluation and written praise for
her hard work and cooperative attitude. The nursing home, the Main
Street Terrace Care Center in Lancaster, Ohio, also gave her a
raise. Again, her boss told her not to discuss pay.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig disobeyed those orders. The other kitchen helpers kept
coming to her with their paycheck woes, and she was a sympathetic
listener. One said that she was being shortchanged on overtime.
Another said her hourly rate had been cut. A third woman, promised
a raise when Craig was told about her own, compared notes two
months later and discovered that only Craig had received an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Would Craig help? ``I said, `Sure!''' Craig, now 52, recalled.
She brought the complaints to the supervisor. Adjustments were made
to the others' paychecks. And soon, 10 days before Christmas 1997,
Craig was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The job market may be extraordinarily employee-friendly these
days, but that does not necessarily mean you get to tell colleagues
about your pay, perks and bonuses. Some managers still warn
employees not to discuss pay, under penalty of dismissal. And every
so often, one makes good on the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one seems to track how commonplace pay-confidentiality
policies are, and though many employees prefer to keep their
earnings secret in any case, complaints have come about in
companies of all shapes and sizes. And now working-women's groups
are attacking pay-secrecy rules, arguing that they perpetuate the
gap between men's and women's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Company policies that prohibit employees from discussing their
salaries with co-workers keep them in the dark'' about
discriminatory discrepancies, said Gail S. Shaffer, chief executive
of Business and Professional Women/USA, in testimony last month
before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions.
</P>
<P>
   She urged the senators to support legislation, proposed in both
houses of Congress, that proponents say would bring attention and
add muscle to laws that already make it illegal for employers to
discriminate based on gender or to fire or reprimand employees for
revealing their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between men's and women's earnings has narrowed
consistently since the Equal Pay Act became law in 1963, but it has
not disappeared. Government data for 1999 show, for example, that
male nurses earn 6 percent more than female nurses and male
accountants earn 37 percent more than their female counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for such disparities have been debated for years,
but pay-equity advocates believe that discrimination plays a part,
often hidden behind a veil of confidentiality. ``We have
consistently heard that many employers have rules against employees
sharing salary information with each other,'' said Ellen J.
Vargyas, legal counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9 to 5, the National Association of
Working Women, said her group has heard the same story through the
hot line it runs for women with workplace problems. ``We hear this
from professionals as well as entry-level workers,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bills would amend the 1963 statute, which currently
prohibits pay differences based on sex for men and women doing
similar work in the ``same establishment.'' The amendments would
allow for class-action lawsuits, with compensatory and punitive
damages; eliminate the ``same establishment'' requirement; make it
harder for employers to explain away wage differentials; direct the
Labor Department to create guidelines for ``comparable'' jobs; and
make it illegal to fire or reprimand employees for talking about
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a much more limited bill was introduced by Sen. James
M. Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the committee holding the hearings.
It would prohibit employers from issuing oral or written
pay-confidentiality orders and from firing workers who discuss
their pay. But it does not address such contentious issues as
punitive damages or comparable worth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is already illegal to forbid discussions of pay,
under federal labor laws enacted in 1935. For 65 years, the
administrative courts of the National Labor Relations Board have
held in case after case that employees are free to reveal their
wages to one another, and that people fired for doing so must be
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   But with organized labor in a deep decline, few employees know
about the labor laws anymore. And a lot of employers erroneously
assume that the statutes do not apply to nonunion employees.
</P>
<P>
   For many managers, including those who do not formally make pay
confidential, the thought of any new law that could set off a wave
of freewheeling pay discussions is disturbing. There are many valid
reasons, they say, for keeping pay under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would create morale problems if one person were allowed to
boast about their huge merit bonus,'' said Sally J. Scott, a
partner in the Chicago law firm of Franczek Sullivan, an employment
law firm that represents management.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation ``is treated as a trade secret,'' added Jay W.
Waks, a management labor lawyer at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP;
Handler in New York. ``If a competitor finds out, it could mount a
really successful hiring attack.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And a spokeswoman from the American Management Association,
which tracks workplace practices, said it is not just managers who
want to keep pay secret _so do many employees.
</P>
<P>
   Allison McAfee, director of communications for the Service
Merchandise Co., said that had been the reasoning behind her
company's written pay-confidentiality policy. ``It's not so much to
prevent employees from telling others, as asking others what they
make,'' she said, adding that nosy employees can be a nuisance to
their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Service Merchandise, a Nashville, Tenn.-based retailer, dropped
its policy after a saleswoman who was fired for discussing wages
filed a complaint with the NLRB. A three-judge panel in 1990
rejected the company's arguments that it had to keep wages secret
to protect employee privacy, and to compete in the Tennessee labor
markets, and ordered the retailer to offer the saleswoman her job
back and post a notice that it was rescinding the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Randel K. Johnson, vice president for labor and employee
benefits at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, questioned the need for
new legislation, arguing that if fear of firing were really such a
big problem there would be more suits, under the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws shouldn't be amended just because somebody thinks it's a
good idea,'' Johnson said. ``Laws should be amended because it's
been shown there's a compelling national reason. If anybody's been
fired for this, I've never heard about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees confronted with confidentiality rules often worry that
if they complain they will only make matters worse. Still, some
take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tracy Jones of Milwaukee found work through a
temporary employment agency, preparing furniture and appliances for
shipping. One day, she overheard her male co-workers chatting about
what good pay they were getting for such easy work, so she asked
them what they made. She was shocked to learn they all were paid
$1.12 an hour more than she was, even though they all came from the
same temp agency, MaxStaff Employment Services, and none had more
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now 33, said she went to MaxStaff, and asked why she, the
only woman, was being paid less than all the men. The supervisor
told her that she was wrong, that no one was paid more than she
was. When the employees assembled for their van ride to the
warehouse the next day, Jones recalled, the MaxStaff supervisor
laid down the law: If they discussed their pay, they would be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could talk about anything I wanted to talk
about,'' Jones said, so she waited until the boss was out of
earshot, then challenged the men to prove they were paid more than
she was. Some of them gave her their pay stubs, which she took to
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Jones was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that legal in America?'' asked Jones, whose EEOC
complaint is still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for MaxStaff's parent, Maximus Inc. of Mclean,
Va., said she was not aware of Jones' situation, but said Maximus
has no corporatewide policy against revealing pay. (She added that
MaxStaff was a pilot venture and would be closed by the end of this
month because it did not fit within the Maximus business model.)
</P>
<P>
   After her dismissal, Jones said she tried to talk other MaxStaff
women into filing complaints, but without success. ``They were
encouraging me to do it, but they didn't want to do it themselves
because they didn't want to get fired,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the former nursing home cook, said she had much the same
experience. ``I tell you, there's not very many that'll fight
back,'' she said. ``They know no one else will hire them if they
take a company to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the center fired Craig _ giving her no reason for
the termination _ she started looking for a new job, and
encountered applications asking if she had ever sued an employer.
Craig said she answered truthfully and found a new job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not have known she could file a complaint if
it had not been for her husband, who owns a small oil-drilling
business and has had to learn a smattering of labor law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `It ain't right! It ain't right!' And my
husband, from his experience, knew just who to call,'' she said.
Last year the NLRB ruled that the nursing home must reinstate her
and pay her back wages, less the money she has earned in her new
job. This month a federal appellate court affirmed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Webster, the lawyer who represented the nursing home,
said his client had complaints about Craig's work and believes it
dismissed her lawfully. The ruling, he added, involves only a small
amount of money: about $3,000, after deducting Craig's earnings
from her new job.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of multibillion-dollar tobacco verdicts, that is small
potatoes, but Craig said she did not sue for the money. Nor does
she want her old job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be afraid to take it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Craig said she sued to make a point. In response to her
complaint, the labor board has ordered the nursing home to post a
sign on its bulletin board, stating that employees are free to
discuss pay if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every employee can read it, whenever they want,'' Craig said.
``That's what I want.''

FORMER GEORGIA GOVERNOR SWORN IN AS U.S. SENATOR, SHAVING GOP
MAJORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaving behind the tranquility of the Georgia
mountains to come to the Capitol, Zell Miller, a Democrat and
former Georgia governor, came out of retirement Thursday to be
sworn in as a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the oath of office, Miller spoke eloquently on the
Senate floor of the man whose seat he is filling, Paul Coverdell,
the mild-mannered but dogged 61-year-old Republican leader who died
of a brain hemorrhage on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is 68 and one of the state's most popular
politicians, agreed only reluctantly to take the job offered him by
the current governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes. He will run in a
special election on Nov. 7 to fill the remainder of Coverdell's
term, which ends in 2005, a decision that has buoyed Democratic
hopes for reclaiming control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A two-term governor who retired just last year, Miller arrives
in the Senate amidst partisan discord; just this week Democrats
virtually shut down the Senate, objecting to the way Republicans
are handling federal judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Miller, a centrist, made it clear that he hopes to
honor Coverdell by trying to leap beyond the restraints of party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to what he accomplished, Paul will always be
remembered for how he accomplished it,'' Miller said on the Senate
floor. ``He was as committed a Republican as I am a dedicated
Democrat. And yet, he was always looking for ways to get things
done across party lines. He did so not by abandoning his
principles, but by heeding and listening to the proverb, `a soft
answer turneth away wrath. With grievous words stir up anger.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me repeat the pledge I made to my governor and to the
people of Georgia when I accepted this mission,'' Miller added. ``I
will serve no single political party, but rather 7.5 million
Georgians.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were gleeful about Miller's decision to accept the
Senate seat and compete in the November election, and said that his
potential victory might tilt the balance of power in their favor.
Republicans now hold 54 seats to the Democrats' 46.
</P>
<P>
   When he left office in 1999, Miller had an approval rating in
the state of 80 percent, and Democrats say he is one of the few
candidates who can, on short notice, assemble a campaign and raise
the money needed to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a while, there is a real feeling we can
capture the Senate,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican challenger has yet stepped forward, but a
potential candidate emerged Thursday: Lewis Jordan, the wealthy
former chief executive of ValueJet. Aides said that Republican
leaders were pleased with the prospect because Jordan is wealthy
enough to help finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is also considering a run for the Senate
seat, but the rest of the state's delegation has withdrawn from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 7 election is a quirky one; it is officially
nonpartisan, and the winning candidate requires 50 percent of the
vote in order to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say a change in party control of the Senate is
unlikely, but they do not rule it out. Democrats have fewer
vulnerable incumbents than Republicans and are well-positioned in
several races for open seats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledged Miller's popularity in his home state
and said that Democrats had chosen wisely. ``They shrewdly picked
the one person in Georgia that gives them any chance of taking the
seat back from Republicans,'' said Chuck Clay, the state Republican
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the Senate was not the statehouse, no matter how
many times Thursday Democrats evoked Coverdell's name and the
spirit of cooperation. ``You cannot say you are going to vote on
and implement the Paul Coverdell view of things and be a
Democrat,'' Clay said. ``You can't do that in Washington. You are
on one team or on the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Miller's showcase accomplishment was establishing a
state lottery and using the money to create a college scholarship
fund for Georgia students.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, lauded
the former governor's ability to transcend partisanship. ``In
deciding public policy,'' Daschle recounted, ``he has said, `the
most important question is not: How will this affect my chances in
the next election? The proper question is: What will this mean for
my grandchildren?'''

 `THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER': SNIPING AMONG FRIENDS, 30s STYLE

By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A life-giving blast of anarchy sweeps the stage late in the
soggy revival of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' that opened
Thursday night at the American Airlines Theater in New York. The
gale is named Lewis J. Stadlen, who improbably appears to be
impersonating all of the Marx Brothers at once and, even more
improbably, succeeding at it.
</P>
<P>
   Stadlen plays a character named Banjo (read Harpo) in what is
probably the most brazen comedie a clef in American theater.
Written by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in the late 1930s as a
poison-pen valentine to their famous friends, ``The Man Who Came to
Dinner'' revels in the wonderful, horrible and glamorously
impossible ways of the wild and celebrated, creatures so very
different from us groundlings in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   With his claxon voice, gravity-defying walk and enchantingly
demented gaze, Stadlen's Banjo makes a persuasive case indeed for
this play's barbed form of celebrity worship, while gleefully
dragging an era long past into the present tense. The same can be
said of Byron Jennings, who shimmers fleetingly as a self-adoring
actor and playwright, clearly modeled on Noel Coward and a
blindingly polished monument to narcissistic charm.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately neither Jennings' character nor Stadlen's is the
domineering man of the play's title, and their moments on the stage
feel as brief and brilliant as lightning. The man who comes to
dinner and stays and stays and stays is named Sheridan Whiteside, a
writer, lecturer and radio host frankly modeled in the image of
Alexander Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan is played by Nathan Lane, one of God's rare major gifts
to Broadway in the last several decades. Yet this highly evolved
scene stealer, who normally turns wherever he is standing into
center stage, here seems more like an uncomfortable bystander (or
sitter, since he is mostly in a wheelchair). It is as if he were
waiting for some deus ex machina that might galvanize him into a
decided character.
</P>
<P>
   Like the audience, he perks up with the arrival of Jennings (in
the second act) and Stadlen (in the third). Unfortunately these
actors are seen for perhaps 15 minutes altogether, which leaves
well over two hours more to account for in the production, which
has been staged in uncertain fits and starts by Jerry Zaks. What
should be a buoyant balloon of an evening is more often an exercise
in deflation.
</P>
<P>
   When the curtain goes up on Tony Walton's richly colored,
showroom-perfect representation of an upper-middle-class living
room in small-town Ohio in 1939, the audience applauds in happy
salutation. The setting breathes a promise of refuge from the
abrasions of the 21st century, a chance to step back into a
frothier era of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   What we actually step into is an awkward place that exists in
neither the then nor the now. Though ``The Man Who Came to Dinner''
is a textbook example of Kaufman and Hart's meticulous
orchestration of comic chaos, a lot of what made it such a smash in
1939 has to do with more perishable assets. The play drops more
names than a Louella Parsons column, and it is doubtful that most
contemporary audiences will understand punch lines that hinge on
references to ZaSu Pitts, Dorothy di Frasso and Chauncey Depew.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is built on the reign of terror conducted by Whiteside
over the home of the smug and prosperous Mr. and Mrs. Stanley
(Terry Beaver and Linda Stephens). Having come there as a dinner
guest during one of his lucrative lecture tours, Whiteside becomes
an unhappy house guest after injuring his hip in a fall on the
front steps.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the delight that audiences of the late Depression
derived from this situation came from their knowledge that
Whiteside was modeled on Woollcott, who was first offered the role,
which Monty Woolley created on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of the play from that time devoted much ink to the
similarities and differences between the character and his
prototype. And it is worth noting that when Woollcott took the role
in the West Coast productions, some observers felt that Woolley was
actually more like Woollcott than Woollcott was.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to participate in this voyeuristic blurring of
reality and caricature to enjoy ``The Man Who Came to Dinner.'' But
you do have to be presented with a world that exists confidently on
its own terms, and this is exactly what Zaks' staging doesn't
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows, little expense has been spared in resurrecting the
play's antic mayhem as the Stanleys' home is invaded by everything
from a group of homicidal convicts to a caroling boys' choir, from
flamboyant stage stars to a wacky entomologist (Stephen DeRosa)
bearing a cockroach farm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the production feels busy without being lively. Much of the
acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes and
epigrams without being anchored to character. This, alas, includes
Lane's performance.
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in The New York Observer, Lane spoke of
his research on his role and his awareness, after watching Woolley
in the 1941 movie version, of the dangers of making the arrogant,
curmudegonly Whiteside too unpleasant. Yet if Whiteside isn't a
convincing monster, the central joke of the play falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his
professorial beard, Lane never really raises the hackles, even when
shooting off the annihilating invective in which his character
specializes. (``Listen, Repulsive'' is a typical beginning of a
Whiteside sentence.) His delivery fluctuates between Anglo-accented
barks, bringing to mind Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins, and campy
moments of self-satirizing melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   He has some terrific isolated bits of business: his petulant,
childish silence over being neglected by his longtime,
long-suffering secretary, Maggie Cutler (Harriet Harris); his
appreciative Gatling gun laughter for rare souls who give as good
as they get from Whiteside. But the elements never cohere into a
complete performance; it is as if he is still experimenting with
his options.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the supporting performances suffer from a similar
feeling of distance between actors and their parts, a sense that
lines are being played strictly for the comic moment with little
regard for context. Jean Smart _ best known for the sitcom
``Designing Women'' but capable of shrewd and subtle dramatic
performances _ here disappointingly overplays the role of an
ambitious man-trap of an actress. Her exaggerated affectations
suggest less a diva of the theater than a civilian's half-formed
idea of such an exotic being.
</P>
<P>
   Harris comes closer to a proper period tone, though she, too,
can lapse into florid comic hysteria when crispness would be more
welcome. Mary Catherine Wright has several winningly spontaneous
displays of exasperation as Whiteside's put-upon nurse. And Julie
Boyd, as the household maid, sweetly conveys the glazed infatuation
that Whiteside is meant to inspire even as he infuriates.
</P>
<P>
   That ultimately is the basis of whatever enduring appeal this
play has: the illusion of being privy to an urbane celebrity
Olympus, where obnoxiousness wears the exonerating halo of high
madcap style. That's what Stadlen celebrates in his performance,
careering through the set like a jet-propelled satyr, and what
Jennings offers in his suggestion of a star who seems to be looking
fondly into an invisible mirror at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also gets to perform a song Cole Porter gave to the
play, a perfect imitation of wry Cowardesque wistfulness. When
Jennings sings it, in a voice that melds the generosity and vanity
of the consummately suave showman, he opens a door onto a shining,
frivolous landscape in which one could happily spend a whole
evening. That door shuts abruptly when the song is over. &QL;

INVESTIGATORS DISAGREE ON 1993 MURDER OF MEXICAN CARDINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After years of investigations, federal, state and
church authorities said Thursday they had agreed to disagree about
the events that led to the 1993 murder of one of Mexico's two Roman
Catholic cardinals during a shootout at an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the latest review of evidence, which itself took
two years, federal prosecutors ridiculed suggestions that the
prelate was the target of a conspiracy, and they stood by the
conclusion of the initial investigation. They said that the
cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, was shot to death during an
afternoon of gunfire and mayhem at the Guadalajara airport by
narcotics traffickers who mistook him for a rival drug lord
</P>
<P>
   But top officials from Jalisco state where the murder occurred,
and church leaders who participated in the review, cast doubts,
noting that the first investigation was secretly led by an army
general later found to be working for the narcotics cartels. The
Jalisco officials also cited signs of evidence tampering, the
pressuring of witnesses and other irregularities in the course of
the full investigation that spanned seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent conclusions mean that a cloud of public doubt will
linger about the murder, which served as a wake-up call to many
Mexicans about the reckless arrogance of the drug lords and the
power they had accumulated as Mexico's marijuana and opium crops
proliferated and its importance grew as a smuggling route for
Colombian cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The final report Thursday by a committee that included
representatives of Mexico's attorney general, the Jalisco
government and the Catholic Church brings the lengthy inquiry to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first months of the investigation in 1993, the
authorities discovered that Posadas had approached the Guadalajara
airport on May 24, 1993, just at the moment in which gunmen led by
Ramon Arellano Felix, a leader of the main cocaine smuggling
organization in the Mexican state that borders California, had
opened fire with automatic rifles on members of a rival drug cartel
based in the states south of Arizona, commanded by Joaquin Guzman
Loera and Hector Palma Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   For months, members of the rival gangs had been assassinating
each other in wild shootouts at discos and restaurants. The
Guadalajara airport became an inferno as the two drug gangs
exchanged automatic rifle fire. Posadas, who was 66 at the time,
had gone to the airport to pick up the papal nuncio, who was
arriving in Guadalajara for a visit. As he sat in his car outside
the terminal, Posadas was shot 14 times at close range. At least
six other bystanders were also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first weeks after the crime, Guzman Loera and dozens
of gunmen who participated in the shooting, including several
federal and Jalisco state police found to be working for him, were
arrested and put on trial for drug crimes and for their involvement
in the airport violence. Palma Salazar was also jailed two years
later. Arellano has never been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrible killing that occurred by accident,'' Jose
Luis Ramos, a top federal prosecutor concluded Thursday in a news
conference, as Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar listened.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the government of Jalisco state, led by Gov.
Alberto Cardenas Jimenez, a member of president-elect Vicente Fox's
center-right party, disputed the federal government's conclusion,
and two bishops representing the Catholic Church's episcopal
conference said they shared the doubts of the Jalisco officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a premeditated homicide,'' said Fernando Guzman
Perez, the Jalisco government's No. 2 official. ``This was no
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain the Jalisco government's skeptical view, Guzman noted
that federal prosecutors had originally argued that Posadas had
been killed in crossfire until ballistic tests showed he had been
shot at point-blank range. He also noted that prosecutors had
changed the testimony of several witnesses, and that official
documents and videotapes from the investigation had gone missing
during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An especially troubling aspect of the official investigation,
Guzman said, was that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the general in
charge of the Guadalajara region, rather than civilian prosecutors,
had led the original investigation, in which suspects were
interrogated and evidence stored at an army base.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez was later arrested and is still on trial for drug
crimes, accused as a long-time associate of Mexico's largest drug
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the church, this case is not closed,'' said Juan Cardinal
Sandoval Iniguez, Posadas' successor at the Guadalajara
archdiocese, who participated in the review.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MAY DILUTE GERMAN GOVERNMENT STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom is considering ways to reduce the German
government's stake in the company as it prepares to wage a
behind-the-scenes political battle to win approval of its plan to
buy VoiceStream Wireless Corp., the company's chief executive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawmakers have opposed the acquisition of an American
telecommunications company by a corporation controlled by a foreign
government, throwing up a significant hurdle to the expansion of
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest phone company. Existing law
generally puts the limit of foreign government ownership at 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One option, which illustrates how Deutsche Telekom's $50.7
billion offer for VoiceStream is unlikely to satisfy the company's
appetite for expansion, would be to acquire one or more additional
telecommunications companies, either in the United States or
elsewhere, worth as much as $100 billion, which would lower the
German government's overall stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to buy today a company about the size of Deutsche
Telekom, that would dilute the government's stake down to about 22
percent, it's that simple,'' Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's
chairman, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few companies rival the size of Deutsche Telekom, the
second-largest telephone company after Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone of Japan. That is why the German company is expected to
pursue several acquisitions at once, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, seemingly less predictable, would be the sale of
Germany's shares in the company. The German government owns about
58 percent of Deutsche Telekom's stock but has pledged to decrease
its holdings. If Deutsche Telekom succeeds in buying VoiceStream,
based in Bellevue, Wash., the German government's stake would fall
to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other European countries like France, Germany does not
have legislation that prevents the government from reducing its
stake in its national telecommunications company. Nor are there
rules that give the government a ``golden share,'' allowing it to
veto certain management decisions, as there are in Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sale of the government's stake would depend on the
price. ``We always said the government would sell according to
market conditions,'' Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   Given political opposition to Deutsche Telekom's expansion in
the United States, it is important for Sommer to underscore the
German government's intent to decrease its ownership. In Europe,
Deutsche Telekom could try to buy Telefonica SA of Spain, whose
chairman, Juan Villalonga, resigned on Wednesday, or make another
bid for Telecom Italia, said Bob House, a vice president in the
London office of Renaissance Strategy, a telecommunications
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a handful of large telecommunications
companies have been mentioned as potential takeover targets for
Deutsche Telekom, including WorldCom Inc., which recently failed in
its bid to acquire Sprint Corp., and Global Crossing, based in
Hamilton, Bermuda, which has a growing global fiber optic network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are political complexities in these moves, but Deutsche
Telekom knows that they are all in play,'' House said.
</P>
<P>
   As the company debates its options, Sommer said that much of
Deutsche Telekom's energy in the United States would be focused on
securing approval in Washington to buy VoiceStream. To do so,
Deutsche Telekom has hired several lobbying and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying is expected to focus on thwarting legislation sponsored
by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and supported by several
congressional leaders, which would block Deutsche Telekom's
takeover of VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer's comments came after Deutsche Telekom released results
Thursday showing that its second-quarter profit declined by nearly
half, to 200 million euros, or about $188 million, after the
company spent heavily to expand its mobile phone operations, most
recently in Britain and Austria. Shares of Deutsche Telekom fell
1.17 euros, or 2.3 percent, to 49.50 euros. The stock has declined
more than 34 percent since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire what Deutsche Telekom is doing to expand, but I
prefer smaller, faster-growing companies,'' said Michael Eggly,
co-manager of the Northern Global Communications Fund in Chicago.
``The former national telephone company of Germany isn't attractive
to us.''

 &HT;    Slower profits expected as Fed action takes hold
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has done
his job too well. Wall Street thinks so, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst a flurry of second-quarter corporate profit reports that
are upbeat by any standard, the market refuses to break out of a
four-month trading range. Some strategists see the best of the year
behind us already.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly spoiled by a decade of stellar earnings growth,
investors are focusing on the disappointments of companies that are
not living up to analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the outlook for stocks in the second half is
not very good since by all accounts profit growth in 2000 has
probably peaked.
</P>
<P>
   First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that tracks
earnings forecasts, said that with two-thirds of the companies in
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index already reporting, overall
second-quarter earnings growth is ``in the 22 percent to 23 percent
range.''
</P>
<P>
   That's close to the S&AMP;P-500's first-quarter earnings growth of
23.6 percent, year-over-year. One or the other of these quarters is
likely to be the earnings peak for the year, according to a report
by First Call research analyst Anthony Crooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, it's been all down hill for the second half,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts are projecting third-quarter profit growth of
just over 18 percent, just over 16 percent for the fourth quarter
and just under 16 percent for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious villain in this scenario is the Federal Reserve,
which has raised short-term interest rates for the past year to put
the brakes on an economy whose growth rate it regards as
inflationary. And, apparently, the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to report today that the economy
expanded at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Though brisk by historical standards, that would be down from
the 5.1 percent annual growth in the first quarter and 4.6 percent
in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. economic performance is shifting from the truly
spectacular to the merely good,'' Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. chief
economist Bruce Steinberg told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed would like to see annual economic growth of less than 3
percent, but even Greenspan has said that's not likely in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to economists, is that the Fed's goal of
an economic ``soft landing'' _ growth of less than 3 percent with
inflation under control _ is a difficult assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed succeeded in engineering such a soft landing in 1994 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts at Ned Davis Research found that most of the Fed's
attempts to slow the economy by raising interest rates have
resulted in recessions or shorter economic dips.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the Fed reads the economic news, the slowing
that already has occurred in the economy may be enough to persuade
Greenspan and colleagues to stop raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That would almost certainly result in a stock market rally.
Thursday produced a good news/bad news situation for the market.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that the government's second-quarter
Employment Cost Index, a measure of change in wages, rose only 1.0
percent from the first quarter, in line with expectations. This is
nothing that would push the Fed to raise rates at its Aug. 22
policy meeting, First Union economist David Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   But June orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items not
frequently purchased _ surged 10 percent compared to analysts'
projections of only a 0.2 percent increase. But most of the
increase was for commercial airplanes and not consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's trading on Wall Street, investors were less
interested in economic news than in disappointing earnings reports
from Amazon.com, WorldCom and Nokia, which sparked a technology
selloff that depressed the Nasdaq composite index by 145.49 points
to 3,842.23.
</P>
<P>
   But buying in blue chips gave the Dow Jones industrial average a
boost of 69.65 points to 10,586.13.

SAN DIEGO BEGINS FREE DNA TESTS FOR INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The San Diego County district attorney has begun a
policy of offering free DNA testing to prison inmates who claim
they were wrongly convicted and would be exonerated by this
increasingly common scientific method.
</P>
<P>
   This appears to be one of the first instances in the country
where a district attorney has not just waited to be petitioned, but
has taken the initiative in searching for cases where DNA tests had
not been performed originally and where it could change a verdict,
or possibly a life.
</P>
<P>
   Several other counties in Southern California reported they were
considering adopting similar policies, and a bill working its way
through the California Legislature would mandate such reviews and
testing statewide.
</P>
<P>
   George Clarke, a deputy district attorney in San Diego County,
said his office was focusing on about 560 cases where guilty
verdicts were rendered before 1992, when DNA testing began there.
He said that two law students were conducting the review and that
of 40 cases already examined, one had been found that would qualify
for the free testing.
</P>
<P>
   He added that not that many cases appeared likely to meet the
criteria. The cases must involve people still in prison, the
inmates must have consistently maintained innocence of their crimes
and the DNA evidence must still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we were not to wait for them to come around to
us,'' said Clarke. ``We decided we were going to take a proactive
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the policy would apply largely to sexual assault
cases, where some biological evidence frequently exists, but would
also apply to some homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The tests cost $3,000 to $5,000 apiece, but Clarke and other
prosecutors in the region said that cost would not be a factor
because of the importance of the effort to clear those wrongfully
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego district attorney, Paul Pfingst, and his office
have been criticized over several cases in which highly publicized
claims of prosecutorial misconduct arose. But Clarke and others in
the office said that was not a factor in the adoption of the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a legitimate effort and it's a move in the
right direction,'' said Steven Carroll, the chief public defender
in San Diego. ``Still, the bigger problem we have is you still have
a system that wrongfully convicts people, and those problems have
to be looked at too.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tagami, an assistant district attorney in adjacent
Riverside County, said his office was also considering such a
program, partly because of a case earlier this year in which a man
convicted in a vicious rape and robbery case several years ago had
consistently maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The man had been positively identified by the victim, Tagami
said, and there was other corroborating evidence, but when the DNA
test was finally conducted he was exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is easier said than done because there are not that many
cases where the evidence is still there,'' Tagami said. ``But this
won't be an issue in a few years. The testing will be done all the
time. The expense won't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system requires that the inmates agree to be tested.
Several prosecutors said that, in some instances, the inmates
refused because their DNA ``fingerprint'' might then be used to
convict them in other crimes in which their guilt had not been
previously established.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers argued that while the adoption of such testing
policies could prove a boon for some inmates, the policy merely
exposed persistent flaws in the prosecutorial system, and that
those broader issues should also be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this reveals with unusual clarity is flaws in our
criminal justice system that allows innocent people to be convicted
because of all sorts of problems,'' said Michael Judge, the chief
public defender in Los Angeles County, which has yet to enact such
a proactive DNA testing program. ``That's the story that hasn't
been told yet. The question is what broader reforms should be
adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Stiglitz, a professor at the California Western School of
Law in San Diego, is a co-director of the Innocence Project there,
which supports the DNA testing policy. He said that one person
reviewing old cases was a student of his and that initially the
effort appeared to have been overly broad and too time-consuming.
At the students' insistence, he said, it had been narrowed and
appeared to be effective in finding cases in which the testing
would help, making the program a powerful tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely support this and believe it is the right step,''
Stiglitz said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to outdoor sculpture in New York City
this summer, the animal kingdom seems to have walked off with the
main prizes.
</P>
<P>
   For quality and sheer size, there is Jeff Koons' ``Puppy,'' a
43-foot-tall flower-covered sculpture in the shape of a West
Highland terrier sitting perkily on its haunches center stage at
Rockefeller Center. One of the best, most popular public sculptures
in recent memory, this work should become an annual event, the
summer equivalent of the Christmas tree that traditionally occupies
the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for quantity, ubiquity, relentless aw-shucks hokiness
and frequent stupidity, the prize goes hoofs down to ``Cow
Parade.'' This herd of nearly 500 life-size fiberglass heifers,
each decorated by a different artist or school group, makes outdoor
sculpture a nearly inescapable condition. Although the cows are
especially plentiful up and down the borders of Central Park, where
they sometimes seem to outnumber benches, they can be found all
over Manhattan on sidewalks, in and around many of the city's
smaller parks, at intersections and in the other boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, ``Puppy'' and ``Cow Parade'' represent opposite
sides of the same coin, the popularization of contemporary art.
``Puppy'' proves that outstanding contemporary artists can make
work that speaks to a broad public. Koons has managed to turn the
Duchampian readymade, one of modernism's more esoteric points of
origin, into a crowd-pleaser. The cows re-enact the more
avant-garde notion of modern art as a participatory activity,
somewhere between a Happening and an art class at summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cow artists seem to have spent way, way too much
time working the words moo or cow into their titles, usually with
grim results. There are site-specific efforts: a cow painted with
Kay Thompson's images of Eloise outside the Plaza, a faux-bronze
cow next to Atlas at Rockefeller Center, a cow with a mohawk and
other punk accessories in Tompkins Square Park. There are pointless
physical alterations, like the slinky cow at Union Square Park. The
most amiable of the several dozen I have encountered tend to be
gaily colored, often with flowers, like a slick kind of folk art.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Cow Parade'' is temporary, unlike the parade of
unimaginative buildings that are allowed to go up each year.
Essentially, to paraphase David Foster Wallace, it is ``a
supposedly fun thing'' that, one hopes, the city will never do
again.
</P>
<P>
   Even without these two exceptional occurrences, the summer's
outdoor sculpture offerings cover a great range, especially if you
stretch your definition of public sculpture a bit. One of the high
points of the summer, and of modern sculpture itself, is the
display of seven works by David Smith (1906-1965), the Abstract
Expressionist sculptor, appropriately above it all, on the roof of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Another standout is ``Dunescape,''
a fountain-shelter-sculpture combo that has converted the spacious
courtyard at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island
City, Queens, into a kind of beach, albeit one out of ``Blade
Runner'' or even ``Mad Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Socrates Sculpture Park, the Metrotech Center and the Brooklyn
branch of Long Island University are weighing in with their annual
summer shows. Barbara Kruger has two billboards in Manhattan, as
well as text pieces on the windows at Saks Fifth Avenue, straight
across from Koons' ``Puppy.'' And definitely pushing the envelope
of outdoor sculpture is the first stage of Creative Times' DNAid
project, a series of public artworks that tackle the issue of gene
research. The first project uses a great urban icon: the disposable
coffee cup. A series of cups have been designed by five artists and
illustrators and rendered at actual size. They are available at
three coffee shops in Manhattan and are being delivered randomly.
The designs, which are the work of Roz Chast, Maira Kalman, Cary
Leibowitz, Tom Tomorrow and Larry Miller, vary in style and
approach but share a distinctly dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the Met's On the Roof Series, the boxy jugglings of Smith's
silvery stainless steel sculptures, mostly from his ``Cubi''
series, need more real space: They seem a bit cramped on the
rooftop. But Smith loved to display his work outdoors, playing
their geometries and surfaces off the forms of nature. The best
time to see these works is late afternoon on a clear day when the
sun electrifies the drawing on their stainless steel surfaces. The
animated surfaces underscore the works' deliberate precariousness;
each arrangement of cubes, planes, rectangles and cylinders is
carefully kept off balance, revealing new tensions and
contradictions as the viewer moves around it. Made in the early
1960s, when Smith's career was drawing to a close and Minimalism
was just around the corner, these works are one of the last great
gasps of the tradition of Cubist-based welded-steel sculpture that
began with Picasso and Julio Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Ursula von Rydingsvard's large cedar sculptures attempt to
combine the flat-footed structures of Minimal Art with the
sensitively carved or modeled surfaces that dominated sculpture
until the early 20th century. Usually the combination doesn't work
for Rydingsvard, but ``Bowl With Folds'' at Doris C. Freedman Plaza
is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   This massive crumpled sphere of solid wood _ 12 feet tall and 16
in diameter _ is an eerie combination of opposites. It sits on the
plaza, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, like a fallen
meteorite or deeply creviced boulder, but it is clearly handmade.
It consists of hundreds of 4-by-4 cedar beams and has been
assembled and carved (with a chain saw) layer by layer, then
finished off with a hammer and chisel and touches of graphite that
darken the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The cedar beams provide the Minimalist part, a grid that
intermittently asserts its order on the creviced surface, across
changing textures and patches of light and dark. The effect is
weirdly painterly and not a little Cubist, and it may be
Rydingsvard's best effort.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of wood, specifically of cedar, figures in
``Dunescape'' at P.S. 1. This free-form multipurpose structure, a
sure hit with the younger set, is the work of SHoP/Sharpless Holden
Pasquarelli, a New York-based architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   SHoP's computer-generated slatted design definitely conjures the
beach, the roll of sand and wave, the repeating lathe of dune
fences and deck chairs. It incorporates wading pools, sprays and
gushes of water, eaves for shade, benches for sitting, slopes for
sunning, an interior for changing. If Alvar Aalto had a
post-apocalyptic phase, it might look like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Removed,'' at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island
City, Queens, often seems to deliberately confront sculpture's
storage problem and frequent homelessness. In fact, displacement in
various forms is the show's stated theme. Its standouts include Tom
Kotik's ``Buried Treasure,'' an exact, full-scale replica of the
top four feet, chimneys, bricks and all, of the Brooklyn brownstone
in which the artist grew up. It eerily suggests the wasteland that,
given a few natural or unnatural catastrophes, New York City could
easily become.
</P>
<P>
   The case for recycling is made by Bradley McCallum, who is
showing 36 of the 228 manhole covers he made from guns confiscated
by the Hartford police department. (They were actually used
throughout Hartford.) Similarly, Claire Lesteven, a French artist,
has converted an abandoned New York City water tower into a pinhole
camera, using it to create and house a 360-degree negative image of
the surroundings, from the river and the Manhattan skyline to
adjacent sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting displaced feelings of a profoundly dangerous sort,
Dread Scott achieves the show's most dramatic moment. ``Jasper the
Ghost'' is a memorial to James Byrd, the black man who was dragged
to his death in Jasper, Texas, in 1998. Made with found materials,
it uses telephone poles, chains, animal bones and a truck fender
with a Texas license plate to delineate an immense rectilinear
volume _ a horrible emptiness _ in a way that is casual, pitiless
and for all its obviousness, quite resonant.
</P>
<P>
   The two other fixtures on the summer outdoor sculpture circuit
are relatively weak. At Long Island University, ``New Urban
Sculpture'' has been organized this year by Joe Amrhein of Pierogi
2000, a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, gallery. Dan Devine is showing
``Sideswipe,'' the negative space, cast in cement, between two cars
that were apparently much too close for comfort, while Elana Herzog
has given the glazed brick courtyard a wainscoting of incongruously
homespun yellow clapboard (actually vinyl siding).
</P>
<P>
   A short walk away, in ``New Urban Sculpture'' at the Metrotech
Center, invisibility all but carries the day. First of all, James
Carl's ``Dupes,'' crisp cardboard actual-size facsimiles of an ATM,
a baggage X-ray machine and a Fedex deposit box, and Kirsten
Mosher's ``Local Park Express,'' which consists of a bench and a
planter that can roll back and forth on a short length of track,
are not outdoors at all, but in the lobby of 1 Metrotech Center.
</P>
<P>
   The only work that is impossible to miss is Jason Middlebrook's
``Grand Entrance at the Commons,'' a realistic, full-scale
rendition, in Styrofoam, of the kind of rough-hewn stone gates that
announced the public spaces of the 19th century. Out of place and
isolated, it evokes a certain lost grandeur until you get close;
then it brings to mind the work of several other artists. On the
Street
</P>
<P>
   After all this, there's a definite resonance to Barbara Kruger's
billboard-size banners, sponsored by the Public Art Fund and the
Whitney Museum of American Art on the occasion of the artist's
retrospective there. Part of Kruger's achievement has been to make
work that aggressively makes itself seen and heard in the real
world. The street, the editorial page and the book and magazine
cover are her art's natural habitat. Situated on Eighth Avenue
across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and on Washington
Street between Spring and Canal Streets (visible from the
southbound lanes of the West Side Highway), both Kruger billboards
feature a 1990 work that combines the image of a a woman looking
through a magnifying glass with the words, ``It's a small world,
but not if you have to clean it,'' the billboards say.
</P>
<P>
   Any number of sculptors and cow artists might also keep this

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SAY NEGOTIATIONS WILL RESUME NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Amid a flurry of political and diplomatic moves on
both sides, Israel and the Palestinians made plain on Thursday that
they are eager to put the failed Camp David talks behind them and
move forward with a renewed peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides confirmed that negotiators would meet on Sunday at
the border of the Gaza Strip, and said that ideas floated at Camp
David by President Clinton _ including proposals that the
Palestinians rejected on the future of East Jerusalem _ have
carried the peace process further than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after completing their long flights home,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, laid out new travel plans suggesting that both
believe that some form of agreement _ perhaps only partial,
officials said, and possibly excluding the deal-breaking issue of
Jerusalem _ may yet be possible in the weeks and months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After a hectic round of consultations with Israeli ministers and
opposition leaders who will decide the fate of Barak's beleaguered
coalition government in a series of parliamentary votes next week,
the prime minister announced he would fly to Egypt on Friday to
meet with President Hosni Mubarak. Arafat had stopped in Alexandria
on his way back from Camp David on Wednesday to brief Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian leader, a key player in Middle East peace moves for
two decades, is seen by both sides as crucial to the shape of any
eventual agreement _ especially on Jerusalem, the issue on which
the Camp David negotiations reportedly foundered on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, announced he would leave before the
weekend for a whistle-stop tour that will include talks with
President Jacques Chirac of France, long regarded as one of the
Western nations most sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and on
to meetings with a succession of unspecified Arab leaders. Arafat
has usually made such tours in the wake of major negotiating
sessions, but with the issue of Jerusalem now squarely on the
table, these briefings were certain to be more critical and
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the various trips and meetings reflected a sense that
something substantial, even historic, had occurred even though
Barak and Arafat came down out of Camp David seemingly
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, commentators said, the decision to return so rapidly
to the negotiating table reflected a recognition that the talks, in
particular the American ideas for a settlement in Jerusalem, have
swept the historic rivals into new political terrain that they must
now explore, and from which neither can easily retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The plan put forward by Clinton, as outlined by Israeli and
Palestinian officials who have spoken with reporters here, would
have established a complex mosaic of jurisdictions in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead Sher, one of Barak's top aides at Camp David, said the
president had proposed that Arafat have a presidential office in
the Muslim quarter of the walled Old City of Jerusalem, a move that
according to Israeli commentators would allow the Palestinians to
claim that they had fulfilled their pledge to establish the capital
of their new state in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israeli officials said that the American proposals had
provided for some of East Jerusalem's Arab quarters annexed to
other Palestinian territories outside the city and expanded to
establish a new city to be known as Al Quds, the historic Arabic
name for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, these officials said, the Palestinians would have
been given vaguely defined authority, short of sovereignty, over
the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City, control of the
Dome of the Rock and other Muslim holy places, and a new bridge
allowing Palestinians unhindered access to the Muslim holy places
from areas under their control to the east of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sher told Israel radio that the talks with Clinton opened a new
horizon in the peace effort, even if the Jerusalem proposals were
rejected by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that definitely yes, it's possible to finish the
conflict and reach a reasonable settlement in not too long a time
as long as there is talk between the sides,'' Sher said.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a senior Arafat aide at Camp David who has taken a
positive stance from the day the talks concluded, confirmed that he
would meet with Oded Eran, a senior Israeli negotiator, to renew
peace talks on Sunday at Erez, on the border between Israel and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating remarks that he made Wednesday on the ABC News program
``Nightline,'' Erekat told reporters in the West Bank city of
Jericho that ``many taboo subjects'' had been discussed at Camp
David for the first time, including Jerusalem, and that the two
sides were now ``closer than ever'' to ending their 52-year-old
conflict. ``I don't think our negotiations will ever be the same
after Camp David,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Erez meeting will follow one held there on Wednesday between
Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, and Tayeb Abdel
Rahim, a senior aide to Arafat, at which the two men discussed
joint efforts to prevent outbreaks of violence by Israelis or
Palestinians discontented by the events at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, officials pointed to the Wednesday talks as a
mark of how far the peace effort has come since the days when
orchestration of violent protests was a ready tactic for
Palestinian officials seeking to wring concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, a top Arafat official on the West Bank, told
reporters that neither side could gain from violence. ``We must
keep things quiet and wait until September,'' he said, referring to
the Sept. 13 date Arafat has set as the deadline for unilaterally
declaring an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The change of mood was not without its darker notes. Both Barak
and Arafat, in statements and through aides, continued to stake out
what in the parlance of the region are known as ``red lines'' _ the
limits of what the two sides publicly claim they can accept in any
final settlement on Jerusalem, on Jewish settlements, on the return
of Palestinian refugees and on other issues that have been left
unresolved in the stuttering process that began with the Oslo
agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for example, continued to insist at a sparsely attended
ally in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah on the West
Bank that ``there is not one among us who can give up a grain of
soil of noble Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Barak, since returning home, has been emphasizing
that Israel, by accepting key parts of the Clinton plan involving
Jerusalem, has escaped ever having to compromise sovereignty over
the city in any comprehensive way, and, in addition, has
established the principle of Israeli sovereignty over most of the
145 Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak's immediate challenge was to shore up his political
position at home, and the signs as he prepared for his journey to
Egypt were that his fractious, 14-month-old government would
survive a battery of three no-confidence votes in the Parliament on
Monday, as well as a separate vote on Wednesday in which opposition
groups will seek the dissolution of the parliament and a new
election.
</P>
<P>
   Head counts of voting intentions among more than a dozen
political parties and factions, combined with intensive new
contacts between Barak and two coalition parties that left the
government on the eve of the Camp David talks _ the religious Shas
party and the left-wing Meretz party _ suggested that Barak's
coalition, led by his One Israel movement, would survive by at
least a narrow majority.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, the parliament will adjourn for its summer
recess, giving Barak, if he survives, a respite from the constant
political challenges. Barak is also likely to elude an option that
some conservatives in the ruling coalition have urged on him in the
wake of the Camp David talks, the formation of a ``national unity
government'' with Likud, the right-wing opposition party led by
Ariel Sharon. That option appeared to be as good as dead on
Thursday after leading officials of One Israel and Likud pronounced
it unacceptable because of the harshly opposed stands the two
parties have taken on the peace effort.

   LUBA, Equatorial Guinea _ Not counting the yapping cocker
spaniel that was terrifying some men who were practicing witchcraft
in the jungle the night before and now feared being found out by
the sharp-eyed dog, this town was pretty much dead on a recent
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A drizzle from the clouds on this side of the volcanic island of
Bioko had kept most people indoors. A handful of children splashed
in the murky canal that snakes through this town. A large monkey
lay dead on a front porch, waiting only for the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A knock on the governor's temporary house (the longtime
president of this tiny Central African nation, Teodoro Obiang
Nguema Mbasogo, has grown so fond of the governor's house that he
has appropriated it for his visits here) found the man in question,
Deogracias Miguel Olomo, looking relaxed in sweats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a couple of years ago, there was absolutely nothing
here,'' Olomo told an unexpected visitor. ``Now Luba can be, well,
not the capital. But it can be the economic capital.''
</P>
<P>
   If Luba, population 3,000, is thinking big these days, it is
merely a reflection of the national mood. Equatorial Guinea, once
the penniless neighbor in a region awash with oil, has finally hit
the jackpot. With perhaps 120,000 barrels a day of crude, and much
more to come, forgotten towns are now daring to dream of El Dorado.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spanish colonialists left in 1968, Luba, despite being
the second town on this island after the national capital, Malabo,
sank into darkness. With nothing going on here, people stepped back
into the jungle to hunt and grow crops. The roads linking Luba to
Malabo to the north and Riaba to the east became virtually
impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while much of the road to Riaba remains hidden under
overgrown trees and bush, workers are digging up and paving over
the way to Malabo. A new port for the oil companies is being built
here.
</P>
<P>
   As for Equatorial Guinea's government, it says it wants to
develop every town in the country. And to that effect, it has
adopted a novel strategy: in June it moved the entire government,
or most of it, off this island and onto the mainland in the city of
Bata.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Nguema Lima, the secretary of state at the Ministry of
Mines and Energy and a son of Obiang, explained that the move would
perhaps last six months. After that, the government will keep
moving to other towns, returning to Malabo after an indefinite
journey, Nguema added.
</P>
<P>
   In Malabo, the move caught most people unawares. That was hardly
a surprise in a country with no daily newspapers and a history of
authoritarian, corrupt governments.
</P>
<P>
   At El Sabroson, a restaurant on Avenida de la Independencia, a
couple of days before he was scheduled to join his colleagues in
Bata, the information minister, Lucas Nguema Esono Mbang, was
having lunch with a ponytailed Spanish businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``By moving the government away from here,'' the information
minister said, picking at his plate of antipasto, ``we can
redevelop the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish businessman, who was awarded a government contract
earlier that day, nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' the information minister went on, ``Spain should
follow our example by moving the government to Barcelona or the
Basque country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactamente,'' the Spanish businessman said, looking down at
his plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he is a great admirer of Franco,'' the minister said
of the businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' the businessman said. ``Authority is good! That's
why this country is good. You can leave 100,000 francs on this
table,'' or about $150, he went on, ``and no one will take it.
Liberty! What is liberty if you cannot leave 100,000 francs on this
table without worrying?''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, at the headquarters of the Union Popular, an
opposition party, people ascribed different motives to the
government's move to Bata.
</P>
<P>
   Fabian Nsue Nguema, the party's secretary general, brought up
the point that in the final months of the administration of
Francisco Macias Nguema, the country's first president, the
government was also moved to the mainland. Macias, a brutal
dictator, eventually placed the government in his hometown,
Mongomo, at the country's easternmost point. Shortly after that, he
was toppled and then executed by his nephew, the current president,
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dictatorship,'' Nsue said of the government. ``What
distinguishes dictatorships is that they are afraid. So they are
afraid and want to move from place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Agapito Ona Nguema, another party officer, added: ``Why do they
have to move from place to place to develop the country? Your
government in Washington, does it have to move to New York or Los
Angeles to develop them? And yet they are developed, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's family, a subclan of the Fang ethnic group, has
controlled the country since independence. Though they come from
the mainland, they have governed from Malabo, the capital
established by the Spaniards. An ethnic group known as the Bubi
makes up the indigenous people of Malabo and the rest of the island
of Bioko.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, enough resentment toward the mainland
rulers had built up that some Bubi rebels killed two soldiers here
in Luba and marched north toward Malabo. They were stopped near the
capital by soldiers, who are believed to have carried out reprisal
attacks in and around Luba.
</P>
<P>
   These days, things seemed to have settled down. Filiberto
Estrada, 27, a mason, is one of the many people who have gravitated
here after hearing of job opportunities. He has not found one yet,
complaining, as do many other jobless young men, that the jobs go
to those with connections to the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   He did not understand why the government was packing up and
going to Bata.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've heard of it,'' Estrada said. He
added, with a smile: ``Each country has its own way of doing
things. And here in Equatorial Guinea, we have our own way of doing
things.''

   CAMPBELL-SOUP (Camden, N.J.) _ In headline after headline, one
food company after another has committed to a sale or a merger,
leaving the descendents of John T. Dorrance, the chemist who
invented condensed soup more than a century ago, with an agonizing
decision. Should they sell the Campbell Soup Company or should they
hire new management? The family, which owns just over half the
stock, has brought in David W. Johnson, a former chief executive,
to decide what to do. The family would not be interviewed but
Johnson talked with Reed Abelson.

   PROFILE-PECK (Undated) _ Run since its inception by its

Theglobe.com became Wall Street legend for its 1998 initial public

fall was sharp, too _ from $40 in April 1999 to around $2 now. The

   SCREEN-STRIKE (Los Angeles) _ In the early days of cable, Screen
Actors Guild representatives say, actors and writers cut deals
below network rates to help the fledgling industry. Now, they say,
it's time for payback. As the strike stretches on, movie and
television production are being accelerated as Hollywood prepares
for the possibility of strikes by actors and writers when their

reflects the new economics of television as cable gains, networks
retreat and new options are created in electronic media, including
the Internet. By Barbara Whitaker.

   ECON-COLUMN-NAIRU (Undated) _ For many years a raise in interest
rates has hinged on a principle that goes by the acronym Nairu _
Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. Nairu describes a
level below which the unemployment rate cannot fall without the
inflation rate speeding up. A goal in slowing the economy is to
increase unemployment. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, has been publicly skeptical for months about Nairu, but
Louis Uchitelle writes that there is something disingenuous about
his burying Nairu while embracing almost the same principle in a
different incarnation. Meanwhile pressure is mounting for the Fed
to wait for inflation to accelerate before it acts again.

INTERNET MUSIC-EXCHANGE SERVICE FIGHTS INJUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MUSIC-RULING-REACT) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawyers for Napster asked a federal court here
Thursday to stay a preliminary injunction issued by a judge on
Wednesday, asserting that the injunction would effectively put the
Internet service, which permits computer users to freely exchange
music, out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, filed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ,
Napster lawyers argued that Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the U.S.
District Court overstepped her authority by seeking to extend
copyright law to a new technology. The brief also argued that
Patel, in the 90-minute hearing, did not consider all of the
evidence, including studies that contend that Napster helps, rather
than hinders, record sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing the same reasoning at Court of Appeals they
tried at the judge,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording
Industry Association of America, the industry group that had sought
the injunction. ``The judge's reasoning was solid and this won't be
successful,'' she said of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction, which is to take effect on Friday at midnight,
precludes Napster from allowing its users to exchange copyrighted
music owned by the major record labels, pending a trial. Napster
says the injunction effectively will put it out of business since
it cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs. No trial date has
yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Although the record industry praised the judge's action on
Wednesday, its celebration was tempered by what analysts say is an
imposing challenge: putting their own businesses online to meet a
demand for music that Napster so clearly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got to fill the vacuum,'' said Michael B. Nathanson,
a record industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, the securities
firm. ``They just can't keep stopping these things. They've got to
be aggressive over the next six to 12 months'' in making their
music available online.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathanson and industry executives have been speaking with
such urgent tones for the last two years, and, in some cases by
their own admission, they have little to show for it. The major
record labels have begun selling some music, mostly singles, for
download, and are exploring subscription-based sites in which
visitors could pay a fee to download music.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, for instance, has roughly 50 songs available for download,
selling them for $2.49 each. The company has a partnership with
Universal Music Group to develop a subscription-based model.
Meanwhile, EMI, another major record label, has begun making
downloads available, and will soon sell singles for $3.49 and full
albums for $17.95 on a site called musicmaker.com.
</P>
<P>
   The labels say they have aggressively pursued strategies for
distributing music online, striking business deals with music
sites, working to develop secure technology, and exploring new
business models. But the challenge is daunting because they want to
create encryption technology that will prevent their music from
being freely exchanged. They assert that Napster makes online music
distribution look deceivingly easy because it facilitates the free
exchange of songs; the service claims that 20 million users
downloaded its free file-sharing software, and recording industry
lawyers say that 14,000 songs change hands each minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to be realistic. We're not going to re-create
Napster overnight,'' said Rosen of the Recording Industry
Association. ``It's a lot harder to get people to come to a party
than to a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   But they might eventually re-create a service similar to
Napster, or even purchase Napster itself, people within the record
industry say. A person at one of the major record labels said that
most, if not all, of the labels have considered purchasing Napster
and finding a way to license the content exchanged by users. But
that person said that the labels appear not to be able to find a
way to make the service profitable while permitting the wide
exchange of content that has made it so popular.

AROUND THE WORLD IN A '49 BUICK 
</HEADLINE>

   How many flat tires would you expect to get driving around the
world? The ``China Clipper,'' a 1949 Buick Super wood-paneled
station wagon, handled the 20,000 overland miles with none.
</P>
<P>
   Pat and Mary Brooks of Marshalltown, Iowa, one of 10 American
teams participating in the Around the World in 80 Days Motor
Challenge sponsored by the Classic Rally Association, outfitted
their car with eight-ply truck tires. Normal car tires are
four-ply. The rally, which began May 1 at Tower Bridge in London,
ended there last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marathon,'' Brooks said of the chase for a finishers
medal. ``Sprinters don't fare as well at the end as they did in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brookses, who received $10,000 in sponsorship money from
Buick, finished 21st out of 29 entries in the division that covered
cars from 1941 to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Bill Secrest, the only father-daughter team, were a
last-minute entry without a sponsor, yet managed to finish third in
the division for cars dating from 1940 and earlier. They were
driving a borrowed 1935 Chrysler Airflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been rallying since 1961,'' Bill Secrest, a retired Trans
World Airline pilot from South Shore, Ky., said in an interview
earlier this month while driving through Morocco. ``I knew it would
eat me alive for the rest of my life if we didn't get in on this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Secrest is a Massachusetts state trooper from Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers traveled east across Europe and Asia, generally
following Marco Polo's fabled silk route. The cars were airlifted
from Beijing to Anchorage, driven down the West Coast from Alaska,
then through the northern United States, a route that included
small cities like Shelby, Mont., and Marquette, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The cars were again airlifted from Newark to Marrakesh, Morocco,
to finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second rally to circumnavigate the world. The
first was the 1908 around-the-world race that traveled west from
New York to Paris and was won by an American, Thomas Flyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Brookses _ Pat is a lawyer and Mary is a retired social
worker _ bought their car four years ago; it had 43,000 miles on it
then. Although its tires remained intact during the rally, it
suffered other ills. On Day 3, the Secrests lost their brakes in
the French Alps, which caused the car to overheat and catch on
fire, with no serious consequences. Later, a rear wheel bearing
burned out in Alaska. The Brookses didn't have the correct tool to
fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke down next to a dilapidated, abandoned building,''
Brooks said. ``There was a huge pile of debris. We found an old
pipe and pounded that bearing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the nonmechanical problems that arose as 42 cars, 40 of
which actually finished, circled the globe were difficulties with
customs officials in Turkey, a rerouting by the Chinese government
and very poor roads in the Republic of Georgia. In Turkey, for
reasons that remained mysterious to the competitors, local
residents threw stones at the cars after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drive, though, was a return to basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very simple life,'' Brooks said. ``You only have one
task to do: follow the route. You just drive.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed legislation Thursday that would
reduce taxes on some Social Security benefits, giving Republicans
another victory in their effort to make tax cuts a defining
election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 265-159. Fifty-two Democrats broke ranks to support
the bill, which President Clinton said he would veto.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would roll back a tax imposed in 1993, at Clinton's
behest, on part of the benefits received by the roughly one-fifth
of Social Security recipients with the highest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted earlier this month to approve a similar measure
as an amendment to another bill, but later stripped out the
amendment for procedural reasons. Republicans said they hoped to
bring it up again in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final major piece in a series of tax cuts brought up
this year by Republicans, who have succeeded in attracting
considerable support for the bills from Democrats in Congress even
as Clinton has vowed to keep them from becoming law. They include
tax cuts for married couples, repeal of the federal estate tax and
expansion of retirement savings programs.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday came as Republicans prepared for the opening
of their national convention on Monday in Philadelphia. Republicans
plan to use the convention to press their case that voters will not
see any substantial tax cuts, despite the large and growing federal
budget surplus, until a Republican is in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying these are good, common sense tax cuts for the
American people, they ought to be signed, there's no excuse,'' said
the speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton pressed his case that Republicans were
frittering away the projected budget surplus on tax cuts without
addressing other long-term problems including the solvency of
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed that the Republican Congress continues to
strip away our fiscal discipline bill by bill by passing another in
a series of costly tax cuts that, taken together, will spend our
entire hard-earned surplus,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the House Thursday would repeal an element of
the budget deficit-reduction plan pushed through Congress by
Clinton in 1993 without support from a single Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 measure increased to 85 percent, from 50 percent, the
part of Social Security benefits subject to income tax when a
recipient's income, including half the annual Social Security
benefit, exceeds certain levels. Those levels are $34,000 for a
single person and $44,000 for a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   The tax revenue generated by the 1993 measure _ about $8 billion
this year and rising fast _ is earmarked only for Medicare. It is
projected to double over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Thursday would reduce the taxable portion of the
benefit back to 50 percent, the level agreed on by President Reagan
and Congress in 1983, when they first imposed a tax on Social
Security. The 50 percent level applies starting at lower income
threshholds than the 85 percent level _ $25,000 for a single person
and $32,000 for a couple filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the change would reduce federal revenues by $117
billion over the next decade. The bill would provide for the same
amount of money to be channeled into Medicare out of general tax
revenues, thereby, leaving Medicare unharmed by the change,
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would only affect relatively well off beneficiaries,
the issue has considerable political sensitivity. Vice President Al
Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the 1993
measure, and Republicans linked him to it throughout the day of
debate on the House floor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Facing attacks from Democrats over their proposals to create
private investment accounts within the retirement system,
Republicans also saw the bill as a way to attract support from
older voters, who polls show tend to be leery of tinkering with
Social Security. The bill also proved attractive to Democrats who
have large numbers of elderly voters in their districts and those
who were always uncomfortable levying a tax on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that since the additional levy on Social
Security had been imposed in 1993 to help eliminate the budget
deficit, it should be repealed now that the deficit has given way
to a substantial surplus. Moreover, they said, it was wrong to tax
retirees on benefits they had spent a lifetime earning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill would help those retired people who
needed help the least, and would do nothing for four-fifths of
Social Security recipients, including those for whom Social
Security is their only retirement income.

 &HT;    EDS: Change in wording in 1st graf.
 &HT;    EarthLink has strong growth, lower losses
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EarthLink Inc. on Thursday reported booming revenue, a
smaller than expected loss and strong customer growth as it
continued its pursuit of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The company also acknowledged that quality of service _ on which
it pegs its reputation _ suffered at least in the first few months
of the merger between EarthLink and MindSpring Enterprises as the
companies melded network and customer service operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some rocky times in the first quarter,'' said
company President Michael McQuary. ``I think we will continue to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company offers Internet access _ including
high-speed connections _ as well as Web hosting services. The
company says recent troubles have been temporary and limited, and
that customers should check its Web site or _ if they cannot get
online _ call customer support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever problems there have been, EarthLink has not shed
customers more rapidly than before. In fact, during the first
quarter, 5 percent of customers broke their EarthLink connection, a
``churn'' rate that dipped to 4.2 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink reported revenue of $230.9 million for the quarter
ended June 30, up 41 percent from revenue of $163.7 million in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net loss for the quarter of $35.2
million, or 29 cents per share, not including acquisition and
merger-related costs. EarthLink had net income of $5.3 million, or
5 cents per share, during the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But growth matters more right now than short-term profits, in
EarthLink's view, and the company finished the quarter with 3.7
million subscribers. With ``organic'' growth and the completion of
a deal to acquire OneMain.com, EarthLink will reach 5 million
subscribers by year's end, McQuary said.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of EarthLink's growth comes from former AOL members,
he said. ``We are in the second inning, not the seventh inning. We
will continue to close the gap with AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has more than 23 million members, in addition to its massive
deal to buy Time Warner. If that merger is completed, AOL will
increasingly become a media company, owning content like the shows
that run on Time Warner's cable service, McQuary said. ``We are in
a different business. We don't compete against Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumer dial-up represents a declining portion of the
business _ about 85 percent of revenues. Meanwhile, the company
increasingly looks elsewhere for future profits. For instance,
high-speed lines are increasingly seen as the preferred connection
to the Net. EarthLink now has 80,000 customers with that
``broadband'' link. The company expects to have 150,000 broadband
customers by year's end using digital subscriber lines (DSL), cable
modems and wireless.

IN ILLINOIS SUBURB, LITTLE ENTHUSIASM FOR BUSH AND GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   by PAM BELLUCK  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ It is a puzzling political season for George
Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major presidential candidates were identified
months ago, Gauthier, a builder, has no idea whom he will vote for.
</P>
<P>
   He knows where he stands on the issues and has thoughtful,
nuanced ideas about what a president should be. But so far, no
candidate has given him enough to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush doesn't have the strengths in foreign and national
politics that his father did,'' said Gauthier, 59, who also runs an
organization to help lower-income people obtain homes, ``and
there's been good and bad state governors as presidents, so he
comes into it having to answer why he should be executive of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Gore, my fear is that his programs would be too big, too
expensive,'' said Gauthier, who voted for Republicans in the last
four presidential elections, Democrats in the previous three and
knows only that he will not vote for a third-party candidate this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both of them show leadership potential, an ability to
project their vision of the future,'' he said. ``Neither is going
to effect major radical change. It's a question of how they would
lean, which bias they have. It's hard to find the best candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican and Democratic conventions coming up,
Gauthier is hardly in the minority, interviews with voters suggest.
In dozens of discussions in Evanston, a diverse, middle-class
suburb just north of Chicago in a critical swing-vote state, people
were studiously skeptical, waiting for answers, and wary of the
campaign games politicians play.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a single urgent issue like war or economic
crisis, voters were sizing up candidates as managers, stewards and
respect-worthy leaders rather than as rallying, agenda-driven
politicians. Voters were more interested in what kind of cabinet
officials and Supreme Court justices the candidates would appoint
and in how they would work with Congress, than in where they stood
on every issue.
</P>
<P>
   And while most said they wanted a president with consistency and
integrity, someone unlikely to be swayed by interest-group
pressure, they doubted whether any candidate had those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a leader who's not captive of special
interests, but it may be impossible,'' said Edith Eisner, a
75-year-old retired English teacher who said she would vote for
Vice President Al Gore. ``I think both the candidates now can be
pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Butkus, the president of an engineering firm who said he
would vote for Gov. George W. Bush, said: ``My big concern about
presidential politics is once you get to be able to run for
president you've had to make so many promises and compromises that
you've compromised yourself coming through the system. Gore got his
hand caught in the cookie jar in fund-raising, but really the
system made him do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Evanston, home of Northwestern University and one of the few
racially diverse communities in the Illinois suburbs, more people
vote for Democrats. But the interviews focused on people across the
political spectrum. All except one of those interviewed said they
had ruled out voting for the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader of
the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party. Most
considered them extreme or narrowly focused, although some said
they found Nader appealing but unelectable.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, among people who said they would support Gore or
Bush, there was frequently little passion about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Wilson, a 40-year-old civil rights lawyer, said she had
always voted Democratic and would again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said: ``I think Gore is questionable. I don't think
he tells the truth all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, with two children and a husband who is also a lawyer,
said she was fairly certain that Gore agreed with her on education,
the environment, affirmative action and other issues, but had
reservations about ``him as a person.'' She said she believed, for
example, that he was ``pandering'' when he said that Elian Gonzalez
and his father should be given permanent residency status, and she
said his ethics on campaign financing were ``a little loose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to always say what people want to hear,'' she said.
``I can't get excited about him and trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Butkus, 48, who typically backs Republicans for president, said
of Governor Bush: ``I believe that his political background is
wanting. He doesn't have a lot of political experience. There's
just not a big book on him to let you now how he'd act in
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``not happy'' with Bush's vague response about
whether he had used cocaine, but added, ``There's abuses on the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I'm impressed with Bush about is that he has
been picking good people and they're sticking by him,'' Butkus
said. ``It hasn't been a revolving door.''
</P>
<P>
   People seem well aware of what presidential power can and cannot
do these days. Their priorities included Supreme Court appointments
and keeping Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board. Some would like a foreign policy leader to help resolve the
Middle East conflict, deal firmly with Russia and either scrap or
build a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Some mentioned health care that would be affordable for all
citizens and progress in race relations. Most said they believed
the economy would continue strongly under either candidate. And no
one linked his or her vote to a single issue, like school vouchers
or the death penalty _ indeed, a few said such issues should be
left to the states.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Butkus' wife, Ellen, 47, said she strongly opposed abortion, but
would not make that a litmus test. ``The check mark in the little
box just doesn't give you a sense of all the different ways that
this candidate could affect things,'' said Mrs. Butkus, a nurse who
works with the homebound elderly through her Mennonite church.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Mrs. Butkus, who is undecided and would not rule out
Nader, is more concerned about how candidates would deal with
racial issues and what impact they would have on things like the
death penalty and school choice. ``I think a president is in a
position to raise people's awareness of how the country behaves as
a whole, of what the injustices are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several people seemed to favor both the pro-business,
smaller-government approach historically associated with
Republicans and the sense of social justice and inclusiveness
typically linked to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want someone who's going to have a balance in being
generally businesslike in the management of government,'' said Don
Colleton, a 58-year-old lawyer leaning toward Bush. ``But I'm not
one to play around with some of these social issues. I want folks
to behave in a way that is just resolute in acknowledging the
intrinsic equal dignity of members of the human race, whatever
color or size they come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier exemplifies the sense of wanting to borrow from both
Republicans and Democrats. He says that the federal government
should deal with social problems by financing private nonprofit
agencies like his housing coalition, which he contends are more
cost-effective than government agencies. He says he thinks a
prescription drug plan should include means-testing so that those
people most in need will benefit, and that eventually, there will
have to be means tests for Social Security and Medicare. He also
contends school vouchers are unworkable, and that the government
should take some of the money now being spent on the military and
battling illegal drugs and put it into drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gauthier is so concerned with balance that he said he
might vote for the candidate whose party appeared that it would not
have a majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Several people expressed concern that Bush might be influenced
by radical right-wing voices in the Republican Party, but none
seemed concerned that Gore would be similarly pulled from the
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush's heart is one place and his head is another,''
said the Rev. Larry Bullock, an African Methodist Episcopal
minister who also owns construction businesses. ``I think he is a
compassionate conservative, but I think he's too beholden to
certain wings of his party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said he would probably vote for Gore, but wanted the
Democratic candidate to ``show a freshness and a newness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really got to rattle those bones,'' Bullock said.
``Clinton gave us the bridge to the 21st century. Gore needs to
tell us what's on the other side of the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed said their view of President Clinton
would not affect their vote. Supporters and critics said Gore was
appropriately loyal in defending the president in the Monica
Lewinsky matter. And most said that he deserved neither credit nor
criticism for Clinton administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was Lorraine Morton, the Democratic mayor of
Evanston, who said she did not have ``great enthusiasm'' for Gore,
but ``Clinton did a fantastic job,'' and if elected, ``Gore can
pick up the telephone and say, `Bill. what do you think about so
and so.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although most people said Bush made a good choice in Dick Cheney
as his running mate, those interviewed said it would not affect
their views.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign heats up, the candidates might do well to listen
to the likes of Barry Slotnick.
</P>
<P>
   Slotnick, 28, who works in his family's travel business and owns
a fitness equipment company, considers himself ``fiscally
conservative and socially liberal,'' pro-entrepreneur and
pro-abortion rights. He voted Republican in 1992 and 1996, but
started this campaign admiring Bill Bradley, especially his
progressive views on race relations. ``As Bradley's situation
started to fade,'' he said, ``I really took an interest in John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Slotnick is ``very much on the fence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Republican platform when it comes to small
government,'' he said, but he said he was worried about ``some very
frightening people in the far reaches of the Republican Party, the
far right.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush, he said, he is unsure ``how much has been attained
because he's daddy's boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that Gore brings more
experience, having been vice president for eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Slotnick said he believed that Bush ``could probably get
a good cabinet together.'' And while ``Bush seems to me like a
grown-up frat boy,'' Slotnick said, he also ``seems like a more
approachable, more normal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems less political,'' Slotnick said. ``Gore, everything
he does seems a little rehearsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Slotnick said he thinks ``both Gore and Bush can keep the
momentum in the economy going,'' adding: ``So this year I'm really
looking more at the person. At the end of the day you look for
someone who really you can look up to and trust. Are they a good
representation of the country?''

MASS AND CLASS AND CASH ($68,425) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 (Editors: Also see CARS-PORSCHE-BOXSTER . )  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What do Americans want? More, always more, it
seems, and automakers are happy to comply, cramming six pistons
into cars that run nicely on four and shoehorning V-8s into engine
bays where V-6s are a tight fit. Not often does a redesigned car or
truck end up smaller than the one it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   Already large automobiles are not exempt from size creep.
Mercedes-Benz once offered both long- and longer-wheelbase versions
of its biggest sedan, but Americans showed a strong preference for
the first-class cabin, rendering business-class accommodations
unnecessary. BMW has the 740iL and 750iL, with rear seats that come
closer to meeting the bottom-line needs of well-fed customers.
Jaguar, whose charms have included famously cozy rear quarters,
added the commodious XJ8 L and Vanden Plas. A slightly stretched
Lincoln now accounts for 8 percent of Town Car sales.
</P>
<P>
   So who should be surprised that for 2000, Audi has the A8L, a
five-inch-longer version of its all-aluminum luxury liner. Only
those, perhaps, who recall that when the A8 made its debut, less
than four years ago, Audi mocked competitors by summarizing its
car's virtues as ``excellence without excess, class without mass.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still excellence in the A8s advanced space frame, a
rigid skeleton of lightweight aluminum, and in its unobtrusive
Quattro all-wheel drive. There is class, too, in the understated
but sumptuous cabin, which has gained nearly 3 inches of rear
legroom and a bit of extra space for heads and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   As for mass, the A8L is hardly lacking, since even with all
those aluminum pieces it tips the scales at 4,156 pounds, a bit
more than the steel-body Mercedes S500. The A8L measures 203.3
inches long, about the same as the Mercedes and a bit longer than
the BMW 740iL.
</P>
<P>
   The pluses and minuses of this outsized Audi were evident on a
1,500-mile trip through Northern California and Nevada, given that
the car was saddled with four adults, six sizable bags and a few
bottles of cabernet sauvignon picked up during stops in wine
country. The $72,525 test car (base price, $68,425) proved an
excellent choice for luxurious grand touring, pampering passengers
with a ride that was practically serene.
</P>
<P>
   Its climate control was put to the test, since we visited wine
country during a heat wave. After a memorable hot lunch in a
restaurant whose air conditioner had failed, the Audi's external
thermometer registered 120 degrees. Given what it was up against,
the climate system coped admirably.
</P>
<P>
   The backseat is the big news here, and it got rave reviews from
its occupants. There were firm but cosseting seats covered in
perforated leather, power-adjusted headrests and lumbar support and
no lack of space. Two 70-something passengers could quibble only
about the backrest (raked a little too steeply) and the sunscreens
(ineffective against a blazing California sun). But they
appreciated how the wider doors aided entrances and exits,
particularly when noontime placed them at their fourth wine tasting
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, though, the Audi reminds one about the
march of progress. While the A8 seemed so innovative in 1996 _ it
was called ``the first luxury car of the 21st century'' on this
page _ it competes in a segment that changed radically a year ago
with the arrival of an all-new S-Class. While the Audi has bulked
up, the Mercedes trimmed down and learned to dance.
</P>
<P>
   In our travels, the A8L never faltered, whether tracing
switchbacks in the Sierra Nevada or negotiating jagged ocean-view
turns on Highway 1. If it had, a new stability control could step
in to save the day. Yet a touch of body roll on turns, and steering
that didn't feel as crisp as it actually proved to be, made it
clear that this is a luxury cruiser, not an overgrown sport sedan.
Its luxurious size also made for tight maneuvers in cramped public
garages. On sharp descents, the five-speed Tiptronic transmission
resolutely refused to engage first gear except for an instant after
a standing stop, forcing overuse of the brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a brisk car for its size, capable of 0-to-60 dashes in
well under 7 seconds, yet the test car felt leaden in a range of
1,200 to 1,800 rpm. The horsepower of the dual-cam 4.2-liter V-8
has been raised to 310. There is 302 foot-pounds of peak torque for
Autobahn zoom at cruising speeds. Yet the A8L managed to feel a bit
sluggish when merging into traffic at 45 mph or climbing a steep
grade in high elevations.
</P>
<P>
   A long car trip turns little annoyances into oversized
irritations. In the A8L, these included a touchy throttle that
works against smooth starts; one-touch window switches that never
performed as expected; and overcomplicated audio and climate
controls. I did not use the standard-equipment navigation system,
for lack of a map disk, and I eventually switched off the acoustic
parking sensors (a $700 option), which detect obstacles as you try
to dock this zeppelin. The system is calibrated so sensitively that
it beeps long before you're close to another car's bumper, and it
makes a terrible racket, too.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the cabin is a little Las Vegas of red lights, with
more than 100 switches, knobs and buttons. Aside from being a bit
overwhelming, the controls are not particularly intuitive, but they
do put one in the mood to visit a casino. No wonder that when we
pulled up to Harrah's on Lake Tahoe in our impressively oversized
Audi, friendly people greeted us as if we were high rollers. &QL;

EXPERTS SUGGEST PAIN IN INFANCY MAY CAUSE LIFELONG PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass.)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study showing that pain administered in infancy can
permanently rewire the nervous system in rats may have implications
for human infants undergoing painful medical procedures,
researchers are reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Animals given sore feet for a few days as infants ended up
hypersensitive to pain as adults, according to the researchers'
report appearing in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   They said the finding could be worrisome for babies and
premature infants in intensive care units who are repeatedly stuck
with needles and subjected to other painful tests and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   If the findings in animals are confirmed in people, they will
provide strong evidence that even the smallest premature babies
need careful treatment for pain. In the past, it was thought that
newborns and premature infants had little pain sensitivity, and
circumcisions and even major operations were often done without
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   It is now known that infants are quite sensitive to pain, and
they are no longer subjected to surgery without anesthesia. But
they do still undergo other painful procedures, like repeated blood
tests without the use of painkilling creams that numb the skin.
</P>
<P>
   In the rats, hypersensitivity apparently occurred because their
nervous systems were still developing and reacted to the foot
irritation by sprouting extra pain nerves in the spinal cord,
according to a report by Dr. Maryann Ruda and other researchers
from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research &UR;  &LR; in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear how much bearing the findings have on
people, even though baby rats and human infants behave similarly in
response to pain, and the pain pathways in their nervous systems
develop in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Berde, a professor of pediatrics and anesthesiology
at Harvard Medical School, who did not take part in the new study,
said some research in human infants had also suggested that lasting
hypersensitivity could result from pain in infancy. But, he said,
the findings are highly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotionally charged area,'' Berde said.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme, he said, are researchers who argue that babies
are highly resilient and recover from all manner of noxious
experiences. At the other extreme are those who take the view that
injury and pain will damage a child for life. The truth may fall
somewhere in between, he said, but good data about long-term
effects are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly true that injury in early life causes changes
in the pattern of connections and nerve organization,'' Berde said.
``That has good and bad aspects. There may be persistent
oversensitivity to pain, but there may also be more capacity to
recover from it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that premature babies in intensive care units often did
become hypersensitive to pain, but that it was not known how long
the condition lasted. Paradoxically, in some cases where children
might be expected to become hypersensitive, they do not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he added, babies with shoulder injuries resulting
from difficult births rarely show signs of pain, even during
physical therapy. But adults with similar injuries from motorcycle
accidents frequently have long-term pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ruda and her colleagues injected an irritating substance to
create a sore and swollen hind foot for five to seven days in
newborn rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them mature like normal rats would, and when they were
adults we looked at the anatomical organization of the nerves
innervating the hind paw, going from the foot to the spinal cord,''
she said. The researchers found that extra nerve endings had
sprouted and had also branched into new areas of the spinal cord
where they would not normally be found.
</P>
<P>
   The adult animals also showed a greater than normal response to
pain, Ruda said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that rats were generally considered good models for
studying pain in humans, but that a study in people would be needed
to determine whether they suffered similar long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's needed now is to get a population of individuals that
did have treatments that caused significant pain and tissue injury
as neonates and do careful pain measures on them now and see if
there are differences and to what extent they occur,'' Ruda said.

FLASH AND CASH ($49,000) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 (Editors: Also see CARS-AUDI . )  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New! Improved! Few products deserve those exclamation points,
but the Porsche Boxster S is an exception. What began as a fun
roadster has been transformed into a serious sports car, at the
added expense of a relatively modest $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   The plain-vanilla Porsche Boxster came to America in 1997, just
as Mercedes-Benz and BMW were landing their own pricey little
roadsters. All three found enthusiastic, if somewhat different,
customers. The Mercedes SLK230, with its soft ride, automatic
transmission, retractable hardtop and candy colors, attracted women
buyers. The BMW Z3, with its elegant retro looks and initially tame
engine, picked up a preppier suburban crowd. Meanwhile, the
Boxster, with its swoopy futuristic sheet metal and austere ride,
was slotted as the roadster for real drivers _ those who craved an
entry-level sports car rather than a touring vehicle for weekends
in Napa or the Hamptons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I fit myself in the last category, but was a bit frustrated by
the original Boxster's elusive hints of greatness. And $40,000-plus
seemed high for a roadster of modest comfort, whose performance was
so overshadowed by the muscular Porsche 911. The company did not
have any trouble selling the cars, and still doesn't, but it went
back and finished the job. The Boxster S is everything I wanted the
first time around.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did Porsche accomplish this transformation? The engineers
started with the same horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine that
sits just forward of the rear wheels in both models. But they
increased the engine's displacement from 2.5 liters (in the 1999
Boxster) to 3.2 liters, giving it 250 horsepower as compared with
201 horsepower. (For 2000, the standard-issue Boxster has 217
horsepower.) The greater displacement, complemented by improvements
in both the air-intake system and the electronics, also raised the
maximum torque by 25 percent, to a hefty 225 foot-pounds. Most of
that torque, by the way, is available at relatively low engine
speeds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it takes a lot more than muscle to make a sports car.
A perfectly adequate five-speed manual transmission has been
replaced by the mechanically tougher six-speed gearbox from the
911. The 16-inch wheels were replaced by 17-inch wheels that carry
wider, lower profile speed-rated rubber. The big disc brakes were
replaced with even bigger disc brakes (again, from the 911 parts
bin). And the suspension was beefed up to improve high-speed
cornering stability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The visual cues distinguishing the Boxster S are, to say the
least, discreet: a third air intake located at the front bumper,
twin tailpipe outlets, different wheels to show off the big brake
calipers painted red. The interior plastic and leather are
highlighted with aluminum trim.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomics are excellent, with comfortable, supportive
bucket seats and a mix of dials, digital readouts and idiot lights
that minimizes distractions from the road. But Porsche made some
improvements for the S version, notably a height adjustment for the
seats and a steering wheel that telescopes as well as tilts. The
power softtops on the two models are nearly identical, but Porsche
added padding to the inside of the top on the Boxster S, which
provides significant sound insulation to an already nicely fitted
top. A removable aluminum roof is an option on both Boxsters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this amounts to preface. What counts in deciding whether the
S is worth the extra bucks is how the new version compares on the
road. And here, there's just no contest. The engine on the ordinary
Boxster still feels a touch sluggish in hard acceleration. The
Boxster S may be less than a second faster to 60 miles per hour
(5.7 seconds versus 6.4 seconds) but feels much stronger at engine
speeds below 4,000 r.p.m. Indeed, the S engine offers so much
torque across so wide a band that its feels fine in third gear
anywhere between 20 and 80 miles an hour _ a flexibility that pays
off in heavy traffic where frequent shifting can be a big bore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The differences in steering and handling are yet more
impressive. While both Boxsters offer marvelous road manners and
both have rear spoilers that extend automatically at 75 mph to
offset the tendency of the body to take off, the S is more the
master in a variety of driving situations. It stays heavier and
more stable on rough roads, yet takes corners at higher speeds
without a hint of roll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Boxsters come with an optional traction control system that
uses both the brakes and the engine to prevent the rear wheels from
sliding on slippery surfaces. Those who want to corner using
controlled oversteer can shut off the system with a button. But the
fat tires on the S are so grippy that aggressive
``throttle-steering,'' pushing the car hard enough so that the rear
wheels slide, would probably not be practical in real world
situations for any but the most skilled drivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gripes? Just a few. The interior seems a bit cheesy for a
$50,000 car: in my otherwise delightful week of driving the Boxster
S, two pieces of interior plastic trim self-destructed and one
idiot light refused to go off. This shouldn't surprise; the
original Boxster proved to be far from 100 percent reliable in
long-term tests conducted by several magazines.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, too many things that should be standard on a
car this expensive are options: cruise control, premium sound,
leather, wind deflector and cassette and CD storage units for the
dash. &QL;

 &HT;    Reality TV rules and everything else suffers

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ During the last session of this marathon TV
tour, UPN President Dean Valentine was asked what happened to ``I
Spike,'' a series the network was developing about women volleyball
players who moonlight as _ don't laugh _ spies.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine smiled, shifted nervously in his chair, then bowed his
head. Finally, in the most honest answer I have heard in three
weeks here, he said: ``I can't bring myself to b.s. you. It was
just bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He could as easily have been talking about the fall TV season.
Last year at this time, network suits and TV critics were buzzing
about such shows as ``Once and Again,'' ``The West Wing,''
``Angel,'' ``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Now &AMP; Again.'' There was a
strong sense of excitement and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   But most of this year's woeful crop of shows are just
frustratingly average. At first, I thought I was the only critic
having a tough time mustering any enthusiasm. Maybe I was being a
bit cynical. But after chatting at length with several colleagues,
I learned practically all of us felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The only show that got critics really buzzing _ and laughing _
was NBC's ``Titans,'' Aaron Spelling's latest guilty pleasure soap,
which will probably become the season's breakout hit. Perhaps
that's because Yasmine Bleeth looked mighty yummy in a bikini. You
know a TV season's in trouble when one of the most talked-about
shows stars Casper Van Dien. I mean, the guy has the acting range
of a shellfish. But Van Dien, best known for battling giant bugs in
``Starship Troopers,'' does have washboard abs and a perfectly
square jaw. And, let's face it, that's all any male actor really
needs on a Spelling series.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics were also high on CBS' ``The Fugitive `` and the
WB's ``Gilmore Girls,'' a family drama about a relationship between
a caring mom (Lauren Graham) and her 16-year-old daughter (newcomer
Alexis Bledel). I'm still not convinced, though. ``The Fugitive,''
which stars a meek-looking Tim Daly, has a been-there, done-that
feel, which isn't too surprising since it's been-there on TV
already before it was turned into a movie with Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But buzz, as Pax TV President and CEO Jeff Sagansky pointed out
while we were waiting for our cars one night in front of the
Ritz-Carlton, can be overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at a show like 'Action,' `` he said, referring to Fox's
howling sharp Hollywood satire. ``It had all kinds of buzz
surrounding it and got canceled in a few weeks. Buzz doesn't mean
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of shows that hold any promise. Bette
Midler is brassy, sassy and funny in ``Bette,'' her new CBS sitcom.
A pouty-mouthed, butt-kicking Jessica Alba could be the next Buffy
in Fox's ``Dark Angel,'' a James Cameron-produced sci-fi series
about a genetically enhanced human hunted by the military. The WB's
``Grosse Pointe'' is a dead-on parody of teen soaps. Craig T.
Nelson is charming and charismatic as a Washington, D.C., police
chief in CBS' ``The District;'' and ``Welcome to New York,'' a CBS
comedy about an Indiana weatherman (Jim Gaffigan) adjusting to life
in the Big Apple with Christine Baranski as his boss, often made me
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about it, folks.
</P>
<P>
   I hope I'm wrong. Two or three sleeper hits always rise from the
ashes. Last year, for instance, I trashed ``Family Law'' and
``Third Watch.'' Now they're must-sees.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major networks, ABC has the smallest lineup of new shows
_ four _ and the worst lineup, and that includes UPN, which will
change its name to the Paramount Network on Jan. 1. (Will that
help?)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trouble With Normal,'' a sitcom about a group of paranoid
buddies, should be called ``The Trouble With ABC.'' Series star Jon
Cryer has no real comedic talent. Yet he still gets work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the reason American television is so bad,'' joked Cryer,
probably not realizing his statement wasn't that far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is also trotting out poor shows starring such names as
Gabriel Byrne, Geena Davis and Andre Braugher. But ABC is not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, NBC has forgot how to make funny sitcoms. ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' one of the most highly anticipated series since it
marks the return of the ``Seinfeld'' star, could be headed for
disaster. The pilot is being reworked and new co-stars such as
William Devane have been added. But any comedy that relies on
William Devane for laughs is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox has morphed into a gloomy Sci-Fi Channel. Three
of Fox's six new shows have a grim, sci-fi theme. ``Freakylinks,''
from ``The Blair Witch'' gang, follows a techno-geek who runs an
underground Web site devoted to debunking paranormal mysteries;
``Night Visions'' is a ``Twilight Zone''-like anthology series (and
we all know how successful anthology shows are, right?) and, of
course, there's ``Dark Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the network learn any lessons from ``Millennium''?
``Harsh Realm''? ``Time of Your Life''? Even Fox admits it's
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spread of material just wasn't there,'' says Sandy
Grushow, chairman of Fox Television Entertainment Group. ``It's not
like we looked at five great blue sky, colorful, optimistic pilots
and said, 'Oh, they're too cheery. Let's go dark.' We sort of dealt
with the pieces we had to deal with. . . . I'd prefer to see a more
balanced Fox schedule, one that relies less on dark sci-fi and more
on shows that speak to a young adult female audience.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how'd it get this bad after such a fine season last year?
</P>
<P>
   Blame ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' and ``Survivor.'' With
the success of those white-hot shows, the networks have fallen in
love with finding the next, great reality series. The result?
Scripted dramas and comedies are taking a back seat to developing
new reality programs. It's almost as if the fall season was a mere
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's happened in our business is the
boundaries have changed and reality programming is definitely
here,'' says Scott Sassa, NBC's West Coast president. ``This is not
just a fad, it's a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa is wrong. It is a fad _ and a fading one. Outside of
``Survivor'' and MTV's ``The Real World,'' name one other
successful reality series.
</P>
<P>
   Time's up. Unfortunately, the networks are decreasing the
chances of finding the next ``West Wing'' or ``Once and Again'' by
chasing yet another bandwagon fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send in the clones,'' cracks Dick Wolf, a veteran TV producer
and the executive producer of ``Deadline,'' a new NBC drama about a
crusading newspaper columnist. ``Every time something happens, then
everybody wants to imitate it. And the one thing that I've seen
time and time again is that unless you're first, there's no sense
in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about every network has a reality show of some sort in the
works. The most ridiculous of all is ``Chains of Love,'' an
upcoming NBC series in which a woman is shackled to four men. The
object is for her to free herself to go on a dream date with one
man.
</P>
<P>
   You can also blame belt-tightening networks, which are often
more concerned about cost than quality. In attempt to save money,
more shows are either being produced or co-produced by the
networks. ``The Trouble With Normal `` and ``The Geena Davis
Show,'' for example, are both co-produced by Touchstone Television.
And we all know that Disney owns both ABC and Touchstone. Five of
the seven new NBC series are produced or co-produced by the
network.
</P>
<P>
   When networks begin forsaking quality for bottom line profits,
we're all in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And so, I'm afraid, is the upcoming fall TV season.

`GIRL ON THE BRIDGE': EXPLORING THE KNIFE'S EDGE OF DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last two decades or so, sex in movies _ even French
movies _ has become demystified, conventional and, well, unsexy.
Even the most artfully directed writhing, the most ardently
counterfeited sighs and moans can seem a bit pro forma. And so
ambitious filmmakers _ especially French ones _ are faced with the
challenge of how to bring genuine erotic heat to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Girl on the Bridge,'' a soap-bubble of romantic attitude
and second-hand glamour, Patrice Leconte succeeds by discovering
something sexier than sex, at once a perfect metaphor and a
convincing substitute for it. That something is knifethrowing, an
obscure music-hall attraction that Leconte dusts off and places at
the center of this giddy sendup of (and tribute to) European cinema
in its heady postwar golden age.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in sumptuous black and white, replete with dizzy, swooping
camera effects and gorgeous shots of Paris, Monaco, Athens and
Istanbul, ``Girl on the Bridge'' is like a pocket anthology of your
favorite foreign movies (or mine, anyway), a meticulous
cut-and-paste collage of a half-dozen half-remembered, dreamed-up
movies by Godard, Truffaut and, above all, Fellini. The story is
``La Strada'' without the poverty and fatalism: It follows the
sadomasochistic, symbiotic relationship between a knocked-around
carnival performer and his assistant. The homage to Fellini is far
from subtle: there is the parade of clowns, dwarves and
contortionists, big luxury cruise ships and garish casinos,
pore-tight close-ups and careening crane shots.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the knife throwing. Adele (Vanessa Paradis) is a
young woman who has drifted through a life of aimless, passive
promiscuity (``I believe every promise I hear'') that has led her
to the brink of suicide. Standing on a chilly Paris bridge she
meets Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), a profane, philosophical knife
thrower out recruiting new talent. After saving her life, he
persuades her to risk it, and they set out to conquer the cabarets
and casinos of Europe with their act. He seems a bit uncertain of
his own skill, but that, he assures her, is a secondary
consideration. The secret to knife throwing is to find a fortunate
target.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Gabor briefs Adele on the finer points of his
worldview, a kind of gambler's mysticism based on the cosmology of
luck. He also instructs her in the cultivation of her gifts. ``The
audience must fall in love with you,'' he instructs. It isn't
difficult. The coltish, gap-toothed Paradis, heretofore best known
in France as a pop singer, has the effortless gamine appeal of Jean
Seberg in ``Breathless'' or Audrey Hepburn in ``Funny Face.''
Gabor, needless to say, falls hard, but the only consummation he
needs is to stand and hurl the tools of his trade, with their long,
symmetrical, rounded blades, at her trembling form.
</P>
<P>
   The first time they do this for an audience, she's hidden behind
a sheet, and it's one of the most sexually charged sequences ever
filmed, full of danger and audacity. But as the film pursues the
metaphoric link between cutlery and concupiscence, with its
overtones of risk and domination, it loses some of its insouciant
accuracy. By the time Gabor and Adele perform in private, in an
empty warehouse, for the sole purpose of satisfying their own
desires, the scene has a cheap, heavy-breathing staginess. They
might as well be doing it the old-fashioned way, between the
sheets, without any sharp objects on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl on the Bridge'' is most entertaining when it takes itself
least seriously, when it forsakes melancholy romanticism for the
gaudy, extravagant kind. The chemistry between Auteuil, with his
craggy, unshaven sensuality, and Paradis, with her sexual
incandescence, is so perfect that it undermines the movie's attempt
to generate conflict and distance between them.
</P>
<P>
   Adele is supposedly still drawn to her old, man-crazy life, but
her intoxication with Gabor and his blades is so evident that we
don't understand why she would want anything else. The targets of
her lust seem so pretty and callow that they can't be serious
rivals, and the film's last third, during which the couple's luck
turns bad, is so predictable and lacking in dramatic force that not
even the glories of the Acropolis at dusk or the shimmering lights
of the Bosphorus can save the movie. The final scene is such a
heavy dose of Hollywood schmaltz that you half expect Auteuil and
Paradis to be replaced by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this film, with its brightly underscored themes of luck
and risk, is like watching a high-stakes gambler amass a big pile
of chips and then fritter it away on a series of small, pointless
bets. Leconte's visual instincts are so impressive that they
outstrip his story, leaving us flushed and bedazzled, but also, as
after a long night of champagne and baccarat (to say nothing of
other irresponsible pleasures) hungry, tired, and homesick.

   BRITAIN: HEALTH SERVICE REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed the biggest reform of the
beleaguered National Health Service in its 52 years, with promises
of more doctors and nurses, improved patient care, reduced waiting
times and spending increases of 6.1 percent above inflation over
the next four years to bring the service in line with European
averages. The erosion in health services has hurt Blair's

   GERMANY: EXPLOSION IN DUESSELDORF
</P>
<P>
   An explosion in a pedestrian tunnel leading into a commuter
railway station injured nine people, two of them seriously, and the
police said a bomb was suspected. No claims of responsibility were
made. Bomb attacks have been rare in Germany in recent years. A
grenade attack on a Hamburg disco this year has been linked to the

   ITALY: NO THREEPENNY OPERA
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Pavarotti has agreed to pay more than $12 million in
back taxes, ending one of the more operatic tax disputes in Italian
fiscal history. The government maintained that the tenor had
falsely listed a house in the tax haven of Monte Carlo as his
primary residence. In a letter to the Turin newspaper, La Stampa,
Pavarotti wrote that ``it is very difficult to explain the life of
one who travels the world and who visits 50 cities every year.''

   The mayor of the port town of Nakhodka in Russia's Far East,

   President-elect Vicente Fox met with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the
leftist former Mexico City mayor who finished a distant third in
July 2 presidential balloting. Fox said he apologized for harsh
criticisms he may have made during the campaign and expressed hopes
that some of Cardenas' associates would take part in his
government. Cardenas remained noncommital, saying his party
intended to act as a ``constructive opposition.''

   CANADA: JAILED AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   An American who fled to Canada in 1971 to escape a four-year
prison term for a minor drug offense will have to spend at least
eight more months in a New York State jail before being eligible
for parole, state parole officials say. Allen Richardson, 50,
surrendered to American authorities last month to clear up his
status after serving only a few months of a four-year sentence for
selling $20 worth of LSD to an undercover police officer three
decades ago. Richardson, who worked until June at a physics
laboratory at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said
he fled a low security work camp to avoid being transferred to the
state prison in Attica.

   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications' net income dropped 82 percent in
the second quarter to $91.2 million, down from $505.8 million
reported a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease was due in part to a one-time $908.5 million gain
on investments reported in second quarter 1999 and an increase in
interest expense in the quarter just ended. Per share earnings for
the quarter were 17 cents, vs. 90 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fifth-largest cable company reported operating cash
flow, a measure often used to gauge the performance of media
companies, of $337 million, up from $195.8 million last year.
Operating income fell to $33.1 million, against $36.5 million a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue grew to $878.9 million from $509.8 million in the same
quarter a year ago, fueled primarily by increased subscribers for
advanced digital data and telephony services.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, net income was $1.15 billion, or $1.99 a
share, against $757 million, or $1.34 a share last year.

DICK CHENEY, FISCAL CONSERVATIVE?

 By ROBERT S. MCINTYRE    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asked this week why he voted against Head Start
when he was in Congress in the 1980s, Dick Cheney said he was
``motivated by a concern for fiscal responsibility in an era when
the nation did not have the projected surpluses it now has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not vote against Head Start today,'' the expected
Republican vice presidential candidate said on Tuesday. When
pressed a day later about some of his votes in Congress, he
underlined the point that the Reagan era of the 1980s was a time
``when we had huge budget deficits, no money and when we really had
to be concerned about federal spending.''
</P>
<P>
   One can easily understand why Cheney might have worried about
fiscal responsibility as a congressman in the deficit-ridden 1980s.
But it's pretty hard to swallow his claim that such concerns were
why he was one of only a handful of legislators to oppose improving
education opportunities for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, the Head Start program cost about $1 billion
a year. That's very small potatoes compared with President Ronald
Reagan's 1981 tax reduction act, which cost $870 billion over its
first five years. Yet while Cheney says he saw the tiny Head Start
program as unaffordable, he was able to put aside any fiscal doubts
he may have harbored and enthusiastically support Reagan's
budget-busting tax plan. He voiced no objection to the measure's
hundreds of billions of dollars in tax subsidies for oil companies,
utilities, railroads and other corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also happily voted for Reagan's big increases in defense
spending, which grew from $134 billion in 1980 to $273 billion by
1986 _ almost a 50 percent increase adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of these Cheney-supported policies was to triple the
budget deficit between 1980 and 1986, bringing it to its highest
level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II.
We've only recently climbed our way out of the enormous deficit
hole that Cheney helped dig.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't blind loyalty to Reagan that caused him to vote the
way he did as a congressman. After all, Reagan supported the Head
Start program. And in 1986, when Reagan pushed to undo some of the
damage his earlier tax bills had wrought, Cheney worked hard to try
to defeat the president. In opposing the 1986 Tax Reform Act,
widely considered to be Reagan's finest accomplishment, Cheney once
again allied himself with an array of special interests _ tax
shelter promoters, oil and timber companies, tax-avoiding defense
contractors and so on _ that fought to defeat the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite his revisionist concern about fiscal discipline in
the '80s, Cheney's record shows that he is pretty much a
big-deficit, tax-loophole-loving kind of guy. That, of course,
makes him an ideal running mate for Gov. George W. Bush, whose $1.9
trillion upper-income tax cut plan would use up almost the entire
projected non-Social Security surplus over the next decade _ even
before Bush gets to his various expensive spending plans, from the
dubious missile defense system to the voter-friendly drug coverage
for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   True, Bush touts the fact that some of his proposed tax cuts
would go to low- and moderate-income working families. Never mind
that only about 2 percent of those tax cuts are so targeted,
compared with 62 percent of the breaks that would go to the
best-off tenth of all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's running mate, Cheney seems to be trying to avoid the
hard-hearted image that voters might see in his congressional
votes. But Newt Gingrich was right to note this week that when he
and Cheney served together in the House, ``Cheney's voting record
was slightly more conservative than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Or put another way, if the choice is between welfare for the
rich and opportunities for the needy, Dick Cheney's record makes it
pretty clear where he stands. By choosing him, Bush may have
clarified his own stance as well.

   STANFORD, Calif. _ Here's an adage for the Internet age: New
technology has a way of making itself indispensable _ even to those
who are at first wary of it.
</P>
<P>
   This will be true even for the big music labels, which won an
important battle against Napster, an online music bazaar that
allows computer users to exchange music without paying a penny for
the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the music companies are naturally gratified that a
federal district judge has ruled that Napster violated copyright
law and has ordered the online service to stop permitting the
exchange of music, effectively shutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry's mind, its music and its artists have been
protected from digital piracy. But a year or two down the road,
these same companies may find that some comparable online service
could be their indispensable friend.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 years ago, music publishers filed a copyright lawsuit
to stop the manufacture of piano rolls, on the ground that they
would undercut sales of sheet music. The publishers lost their case
in the Supreme Court but soon got Congress to amend the copyright
act in their favor, requiring manufacturers of music rolls, as well
as the newly popular phonograph records, to pay lucrative royalty
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, when radio stations broadcast musical works
without paying royalties, the publishers sued again. The stations
contended that their broadcasts were free and, in any case,
increased the sales of sheet music _ virtually the same arguments
Napster made two weeks ago in Senate hearings, when it claimed that
its service was free and that it boosted record companies' sales.
As in the case of Napster, the argument of the radio stations did
not succeed in court. Because of this, radio stations today pay to
broadcast music _ and music publishers and record companies depend
on these stations to promote their products.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every confrontation between the entertainment industry
and new technology ends in the same way: four or five years after
the litigation and legislation end, the new technology _ once the
industry's fearsome enemy _ becomes its staunchest ally. Indeed,
the technology ends up generating abundant new revenue for the
owners of copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not confined to music. In the late 1970s,
motion picture companies sued to stop the sale of VCRs, arguing
that the industry lost money anytime viewers copied movies from
television broadcasts. Also, in the early '80s, the movie companies
went to Congress to ask for legislation requiring video stores to
pay a royalty each time they rented a cassette. The companies lost
in court and in Congress. Yet, without either of the legal rights
they sought, the industry developed a fresh source of revenue
through the expanded sale of videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Napster's lawyer, the company could be forced to
shut down if it loses its appeal. Napster may no longer exist, but
the technology will likely live on and thrive on the Internet. It's
not hard to see how music companies could benefit from online
services. Already, some companies are licensed to distribute music
on the Web. With modest levels of encryption and reasonable
pricing, music companies could make hundreds of millions of dollars
by offering their products online.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, music companies will adapt to these new services.
The industry may be able to shut down Napster, but it can't stop
the advance of technology.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    FBI wants to learn from Waco mistakes
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, cleared of wrongdoing
in the deadly 1993 Branch Davidian siege, said Thursday that her
agency would learn from its mistakes and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't think in terms of exoneration when you look at
something like that,'' Reno said, referring to the fatal fire at
the cult compound near Waco. ``That was a terrible tragedy and . .
. we've got to look to the future to see what we can learn about
human behavior to avoid tragedies like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments followed last Friday's release of investigator
John Danforth's preliminary report, in which he concluded that
Branch Davidian leader David Koresh started the blaze that killed
81 cult members at their compound as FBI agents moved in.
</P>
<P>
   But Danforth, a former U.S. senator from Missouri, faulted FBI
agents for failing to tell senior officials for six years that
federal lawmen used pyrotechnic tear-gas devices four hours before
the final fire April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That failure led Reno to tell Congress that pyrotechnic devices
weren't used at the cult's compound, scene of a lengthy siege by
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in federal law enforcement fell when the FBI
belatedly disclosed last year that the devices might have been
used, Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Danforth's preliminary report excused Reno of blame, the
attorney general said the bad end to the siege not only remains a
painful memory but also a motivation to improve law enforcement
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion that it weighs heavily in terms of dragging me
down, I don't let things like that do that,'' Reno said at her
regular Thursday briefing with reporters. ``I just try to look to
the future and say, what can we do when another David Koresh or
somebody like him appears? Make sure that we know as much as we can
about human behavior and what we can do to prevent such a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a Democrat, has said it was her desire to restore public
confidence in the Justice Department that led her in September to
name Danforth, a Republican, to conduct the independent inquiry
into the assault after the government's possible use of
pyrotechnics came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's initial report found that the devices were used, but
cleared the government of any wrongdoing or cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary study, completed after 10 months and $12
million, left unanswered why federal agents concealed the use of
pyrotechnic devices. Danforth said he plans to answer that question
in his final report this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Danforth's investigation is incomplete, Reno said,
``There will come a time when it's appropriate for me to comment
and I think that Senator Danforth, since he has indicated he has
additional matters that he wants to pursue, should be able to
pursue them without comment from me.''

 &HT;    CRASH INVESTIGATORS DECODE CONCORDE'S 'BLACK BOXES'; MEMORIAL
SERVICE HELD FOR VICTIMS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear,
government investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes''
recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and
burst into flame as the aircraft took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said. ``In the sound
recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No.
2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No. 2
lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No. 1
temporarily lost power,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction. ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in
the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond
Auffray told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed
grounded as the investigation
</P>
<P>
   progressed Thursday. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights
between New York and London Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday,
adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA repo a spokesman at the regional police
headquarters, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and
German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in
central Paris to pay their respects to the victims. It is the same
church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess
Diana here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
families of many of those who died. German relatives of the
victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses
provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in
the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large bouque

 &HT;    Napster feeding frenzy
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez and Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pop music potluck is far from finished; the
party's just moving to another house.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites with alternative file-sharing software were gridlocked
Thursday as music lovers soon-to-be-evicted from Napster Inc.
sought fertile pastures where the downloads remain free.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary injunction issued Wednesday against Napster could
force the MP3 file-sharing giant to cease operations at 3 a.m.
Saturday. Anxious Napster clients converged on the company's
central servers for a final free-for-all mission to nab toll-free
music. Close to 1 million members on one of more than 100 Napster
servers were scouring each other's hard drives for tunes Thursday
afternoon, almost twice the normal traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And while the company appeals, it appears the phenomenon of
downloading free music won't stall, no matter what the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a million other sites out there,'' says Kelly Watts,
22, an employee at Tower Records in Atlanta who has more than 3,000
Napster song files on his home computer. ``If you try to stop it,
it's only going to encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular sites heating up was iMesh based in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Downloads of the iMesh software _ which allow users to share
MP3s, JPEGs and other files in the same manner Napster does _
doubled from a daily average of 8,000 to 16,000 in just a few
hours, says Uri Rotshpein, iMesh vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In a mere 10 minutes Thursday, 160 new members were registered,
adding to the more than 1 million existing iMesh members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is we're very similar (to Napster),'' Rotshpein
says.
</P>
<P>
   Gnutella and Scour Exchange software also can hunt for songs as
well as video and image files. At Scour Exchange, more than 31,000
people had used Scour Exchange to share more than 2 million songs
by midday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But GlobalSCAPE Inc., which manufactures CuteMX file-sharing
software, isn't eager to take in Napster's nomads. The company late
Thursday decided to embargo its software from being downloaded
until legal issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there may be 20 million people who need somewhere to
go, we don't necessarily want them here,'' said Sandra
Poole-Christal, president of San Antonio-based GlobalSCAPE Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Watts is among those who already has Gnutella file-sharing
software on his computer, and he prefers it in some ways to
Napster. It can search for everything from a video clip to a
recipe. ``Download time is quicker,'' he said, comparing Gnutella
to Napster. ``There's another site called webradio.com that will
probably do better than Napster because you don't have to download
any software.''
</P>
<P>
   He sheds no tears for Napster, noting the army of software
makers lining up to take its place. But Watts lamented the
shortsightedness of the music industry for failing to realize that
Napster and similar programs actually draw listeners turned on by
downloaded music into record stores to lay down cash for their
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a value; it informed the customers,'' he said. ``But
they're still going to be able to use other software. The record
companies need to work it out. If they produced quality albums, it
wouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Han, 21, of Atlanta, who has been a Napster member since
the software became available last year, also questioned the ruling
and the logic behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends are upset about it,'' she says. ``I
understand the record industry's case, but if they think people are
burning CDs, how can they prove that? Napster as a program doesn't
force the person to copy it. We listen to the radio and hear music
for free and can tape it. Is that different from Napster? Are you
going to ban radio?''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Chuck D of the group Public Enemy had partnered with
Napster for a promotion on his website, www.rapstation.com, and
unabashedly celebrated the software's potential to promote new
musical acts. He says the ruling was a victory for record industry
executives, not artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of salty about it,'' he says. ``The bigger issue at
hand is they can't stop file sharing. Thousands of start up
companies are going to do the same thing. It's funny how the power
is never in the people's hands, no matter what they say. Typical of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's emergence hasn't necessarily hurt sales at music
stores. It's even spawned demand for the equipment needed to burn
MP3 files on recordable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 50 percent of my customers use Napster and a lot could
care less,'' says John Montez, store manager of one of Atlanta's
Tower Records stores. He called the recordable CD format a growing
sales niche ``and it's not just because of Napster but because of
the technology. It's become the new blank tape.''
</P>
<P>
   And the evolution of such technology, and its use by consumers,
is among the bigger issues in the Napster fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the law, technology and the human
appetite for something free continues to stay ahead of the law,''
said Gary Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., Internet industry consultant.
``This might slow it down, but it's not going to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies _ including Napster _ aren't likely to let
the potential profits from that business pass them by because of
disagreements such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this spells the death knell at all of music or
entertainment on the Internet,'' said Larry Waks, an Austin, Texas,
attorney who specializes in music and copyright issues. ``It's just
the age-old story about the law trying to keep up with
technological inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Internet music companies have changed the way they
do business.
</P>
<P>
   After it was sued by the Recording Industry Association of
America earlier this year, San Diego-based MP3.com Inc. struck a
deal in which it gives record labels a small payment each time one
of its visitors downloads a piece of copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday's ruling likely will force the question of who
owns what on the Internet to the forefront, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that the legislators are going to get
involved,'' said MP3.com executive vice president Billy Pitts, just
hired by the company as its chief lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Pitts and MP3.com _ named after the highly
compressed format that made music transmission over the Internet
viable at dial-up speeds _ are planning a nationwide drive to get
online music aficionados to contact their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to get legislation or regulation on their terms
and to keep the battle out of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts says he envisions an ``e-bill of rights'' that would
determine what is and isn't off-limits in sharing files over the
Internet, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet should not be ruled by a small cadre of
hand-picked judges who are trying to interpret what the law
means,'' Pitts says.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that one of the industry's biggest
challenges is explaining to Congress how online music works.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say MP3 on the Hill, they say, `Oh, it's down the hall
on the right.' ''

FANS OF SWAPPING MUSIC ON INTERNET NOT DETERRED BY COURT ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ariz., Pa., Britain)  (With MUSIC-RULING) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was around 8 p.m. on Wednesday when Joe Frost heard that a
federal judge had issued an order that effectively shut down
Napster. By 11 p.m., he had linked his computer to one of several
underground networks that allow users to do the same thing as the
popular Internet music-swapping service, only without providing a
central target.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Napster's millions of users, Frost, a 23-year-old
systems administrator in San Francisco, did not see the court's
ruling as a victory for copyright law or a defeat for a particular
company. He saw it as a call to arms. ``I wanted to get more
involved in keeping free music distribution alive,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to prohibit Napster from offering access to
songs whose copyrights are owned by the major record labels is
being viewed as a serious blow to those who had hoped to build a
business around the trading of copyrighted music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the cultural phenomenon shows no signs of abating, as
Internet users swarmed to other services that are not necessarily
designed to make money. And since many of the alternatives are
decentralized and noncommercial, they are likely to be much harder
for the recording industry to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a San Mateo, Calif., company that hopes to make money
through advertising, sponsored promotions and sales of CDs and
other music-related items, asked the court for an emergency stay of
the preliminary injunction Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the case's ultimate outcome, Hugh Trout, 15, of
Washington, who has copied hundreds of songs using Napster over the
last year, said he was spending Thursday learning how to use
Gnutella, a free program that connects people who want to trade
music files by linking hundreds of thousands of individual
computers together, rather than operating with a single central Web
site like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks just as good as Napster,'' said Trout, who downloaded
the program before the main Gnutella Web site was overloaded late
Thursday afternoon, leaving visitors with the message that its
servers had to be taken off-line temporarily ``due to the
unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Downloads of Freenet, a program that allows users to share video
and text files as well as music, had quadrupled from a daily
average of about 1,000 by noon Thursday, said Tim Perdue, the
administrator of sourceforge.net, the site that posts it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gnutella, Freenet uses a model that has come to be known as
``peer to peer'' computing, allowing users to download free
software and directly gain access to files on each others'
computers. Both are being developed under the ``open-source''
model, in which programmers around the world donate their services
and software code free.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, Freenet's primary creator, said the Napster
injunction could have no impact on him or his program. ``I've got
no direct control over how people use it,'' Clarke said Thursday
from London. ``If someone put a gun to my head and said `shut this
down,' I would be unable to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kan, one of the chief developers of Gnutella, said:
``Gnutella's not a company. It's a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reason Napster has been so much more popular than
services like Freenet is because it was much easier for average
computer users to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important parts of the judge's comments
Thursday is the message it sends to the venture capitalist and
business community about commercializing these services,'' said
Hilary Rosen, chief counsel for the Recording Industry Association
of America, the trade association representing the record labels
that are suing Napster for contributing to copyright infringement.
``It's when they get commercial to a large degree that they get
more user friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Users and developers say the surge in interest Thursday in such
programs, despite their lack of easy interface, underscores the
degree to which people around the world resist the idea that
intellectual property, like a digital music file, should be valued
in the same way as physical property, like a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just want free music,'' Clarke said, ``But
there is a philosophy that justifies that kind of instinct.
Copyright is predicated on the assumption that information is
property. I would contest that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster users saying last rites in the service's chat rooms
Thursday while slurping up as many songs as they could before
Friday at midnight, when the court order is due to start, evinced a
range of philosophies regarding copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 2600 files!!! DOWNLOAD THEM WHILE YOU CAN,''
suggested one user in Napster's ``Alternative Music'' discussion
forum Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Longenecker, a medical sonographer in Lake Havasu City,
Ariz., said he used Napster only to find songs he couldn't get in a
record store. To that end, he went to his computer Thursday morning
and started typing in his favorite artists to look for rare remixes
that might no longer be available to him after the service was shut
down. One he said he was pleased to find: a medley including
AC/DC's ``You Shook Me All Night Long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you can buy around here,'' said
Longenecker, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Roth, 27, of Washington, took a less delicate approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of searching by song title, I'm looking for bands,''
he said. ``The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones. Then I
choose a bunch of them to download. With a cable modem, it's taking
me about three minutes per song.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the record industry hopes that shutting down Napster will
result in more CD sales, Sam Chodur, 14, of Lake Hauto, Pa., said
they could not count on any from him, at least not right away. He
is supporting one of several groups calling for a boycott on buying
CDs from the major record labels through the end of October, he
said in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Chodur and several friends are setting up a server on the
OpenNap network, another chain of computers that connects would-be
music traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to do this because I thought it was unfair what they
did to Napster,'' wrote Chodur, who will be in the ninth grade this
fall. ``It lets me sample the songs from a CD and I get to see if I
want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be any damaging to
any musicians. I actually think it is helping them.''

FEDERAL AGENCIES OUTLINE PROPOSALS TO SAVE COLUMBIA SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE AND SAM SKOLNIK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal agencies proposed Thursday what may be a final
effort to save endangered salmon runs in the Columbia Basin,
embracing everything from better habitat to smarter-run hatcheries
_ but not dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extinction,'' said George Frampton, acting chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality, ``is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton and representatives of other federal agencies threw on
the table an array of efforts _ ultimately costing hundreds of
millions _ to save 12 species of salmon and steelhead in the
Columbia and Snake rivers protected under the Endangered Species
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do nothing, salmon in the Columbia River are going to go
extinct,'' said Will Stelle, northwest regional administrator for
the National Marine Fisheries Service. ``It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged cooperation to avoid extinction. ``Only
in partnership with state and tribal governments and other
stakeholders can we restore the salmon without resorting to
costlier measures,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that litigation, not cooperation, will be
the order of future days.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Indian tribes said they may sue to
change what was proposed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is dead on arrival, just like the salmon,'' said
Peter Kelley of American Rivers, a Washington, D.C.-based
conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were disappointed that the plan proposes
waiting five years to determine whether the measures are working
and that it avoids dam removal.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes, too, want dams breached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal decision not to breach the lower Snake River dams
is a purposeful and conscious decision to cause the extinction of
all salmon in the Snake River,'' said Antone Minthorn, chairman of
the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla. ``Today is a dark day in
the history of this great country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbia Basin, attempts will be made to increase water
flows in streams and remove barriers to fish passage. Fish harvests
would be capped or even reduced. Hydroelectric dams would be
required to improve water flows and nearby habitat to protect fish.
Hatcheries might be required to become ``emergency rooms'' that
would raise and release wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts, however, will stop short of doing what Frampton
acknowledged ``is the single most beneficial thing we could do''
for the salmon runs: breaching four dams on the lower Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton admitted that political support for dam-breaching,
especially from Northwest members of Congress, is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the necessary studies needed to get the
required congressional approval haven't been done. But the plan
unveiled Thursday recommends that those studies, including
engineering plans, move forward.
</P>
<P>
   That would lay the groundwork for seeking approval to breach
dams, which would be triggered if evaluations done after five- and
eight-year intervals showed continued declines in salmon and
steelhead stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, federal agencies are gambling that hard-hit runs,
such as those in the Snake River, will not decline. If they do, the
government is betting that the stocks will not become extinct in
the six to eight years it would take to remove the dams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risk environmental groups aren't willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``As written, it failed to get the job done,'' said Bill Arthur,
Northwest regional director of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur said the dire situation of many species of Northwestern
salmon means ``we don't have the luxury of waiting 8-10 years'' to
dismantle the dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is long overdue,'' added Chris Zimmer, spokesman for
Save Our Wild Salmon, a Seattle-based coalition of environmental
groups and commercial fishermen. ``Unfortunately, it's not going to
pass muster, legally, scientifically, or publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
criticized the plan as ``nothing more than cover for Vice President
Al Gore,'' since it delays any decision on dam removal until after
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of our state deserve an administration that will be
honest with them and work with them to recover salmon without
forcing things on us. I intend to introduce legislation this year
to prohibit this administration from using any funds whatsoever for
the purpose of dam removal,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said the focus on dams has left
people with the false impression that the only choice is to breach
or not to breach. She praised the plan as moving beyond that
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When partisan politics are injected into such a complex issue,
it has the effect of dividing people rather than bringing them
together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 2005 and 2008, the plan will be evaluated. One performance
standard would be whether efforts called for had been undertaken.
Another would involve the status of salmon stocks in several
different parts of the Columbia and Snake rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to count fish,'' Frampton said. ``We're going to
see how they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require changes not only by federal agencies _
the fisheries service, Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of
Engineers and others _ but also by state agents, tribal governments
and private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives and technical help would be provided to help private
landowners and other groups work to protect salmon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the plan will cost to implement isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least $100 million a year more will be needed, Frampton said.
Among other things, the Army Corps of Engineers will need money for
an engineering study on breaching the dams. That request likely
will run into political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville Power Administration has estimated that the plan
will cost it $400 million to $700 million annually from 2001 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
   However, BPA officials say fish-protection efforts should not
increase electrical rates for homeowners nor should it cut overall
power production.
</P>
<P>
   State and tribal governments now have 60 days to comment on the
documents. Then federal agencies will produce a final plan.

 &HT;    Strip club can't use Home Depot-like sign
 &HT;    By Marc Caputo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ One of them sells shovels and saws. The other
offers strippers who sell exotic dances.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to confuse the services of the Home Depot and Adult
Depot, and a federal magistrate judge has decided to keep it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   At Home Depot's urging, Judge Lurana Snow ruled that Adult Depot
should stop imitating the home-maintenance store's signs and
mascot. Home Depot sued the X-rated store for trademark
infringement in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to rip off Home Depot's reputation for their profit
and the court saw through that,'' said Steve Levy, lawyer for the
Atlanta-based company that claims $30 billion in sales last year.
The company will not be reimbursed attorney's fees.
</P>
<P>
   Adult Depot's lawyer, Bruce Loren, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling late last month, the Adult Depot
agreed to change its signs at its Boynton Beach and suburban Lake
Worth locations. Both have orange signs with white, stenciled
lettering that look similar to Home Depot's.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the Adult Depot submitted a new sign design to Home
Depot last week. The sex store, which sells adult movies and toys,
will get to keep its name but the signs will change by mid-August,
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Adult Depot also must scrap its imitation of Home Depot's
tool-clad mascot, Homer. The Adult Depot's Homer look-alike had a
sex toy strapped to his side in an advertisement for a pornography
star's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But Adult Depot's problems aren't over.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County wants to remove the strip club from its
location on Lake Worth Road west of Congress Avenue, saying it's
too close to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners Edward Schultz and Fernando Carmona have fought the
county to a standstill; the two sides are trying to settle the case
by agreeing on a new spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Levy is happy that Adult Depot looks a little
less like the home-care store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want any confusion between the two,'' Levy said.
``They're not the same type of business by far.''

POSTAL SERVICE HAVING PROBLEMS IN TRACKING CERTIFIED MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Del., Ill., N.Y.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the annals of poor excuses, ``the check is in the
mail'' has an exalted place. But it turns out that tens of
thousands of taxpayers can rightly blame the Postal Service for
delays of a month or more in delivering their payments to
government offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Local postmasters have acknowledged that inadequate planning and
problems installing a new computer system for tracking certified
mail have led to pileups of those letters _ which include not just
tax payments, but legal documents like foreclosure notices and
court filings _ in postal warehouses from Manhattan to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, New York City Finance Department officials met with
Postal Service executives to ask why $75 million of tax payments
sat in the Church Street post office in Manhattan from mid-June
until mid-July. The city realized something was wrong early this
month, when ``people began to notice there was a lot of property
tax money due and started asking where it was,'' said Dave
Neustadt, the spokesman for Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Before the city discovered that the Postal Service was at fault,
hundreds of city taxpayers were sent notices demanding penalties
and interest for failing to make their June property tax payments
on time. ``Correcting this will be an embarrassing and costly
process,'' Andrew S. Eristoff, the city revenue commissioner, wrote
to Pat Vacchiarelli, the Church Street postmaster, on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Tax authorities in Connecticut discovered the problem in May,
when they realized that regular first-class mail had arrived in the
expected volumes, but that the number of certified letters
delivered was much lower than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials went to the West Hartford post office, where they were
told that there was no undelivered mail. But then a postal official
opened a door and shouted an exclamation at seeing thousands of
certified letters on a floor, said Gene Gavin, the Connecticut
revenue commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, containing $140 million in tax payments, were found
days after the Legislature passed a budget and then adjourned. Only
after grilling Gavin at a special hearing were Democratic
legislators satisfied that the Republican administration had not
purposely understated state tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with delivery of certified mail have also been reported
in Delaware, Illinois and California. Because of the volume of tax
payments that are sent by certified mail, some tax agencies track
it closely, but ``it is clear that this is a systemic problem
affecting the Postal Service nationwide and not just a problem of
tax payments,'' Gavin said. He estimated that the delivery delays
cost Connecticut alone as much as $300,000 in interest earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Saunders, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington,
said on Thursday that he was aware of problems in only two cities _
Hartford and Los Angeles _ and that the Postal Service thought the
problems were limited to mid-April, when income tax payments are
due.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no national problem,'' Saunders said. As for other
first-class mail, Postal Service standards call for certified
letters to be delivered within three days _ sooner, for deliveries
in the mailer's home city.
</P>
<P>
   Local Postal Service executives have been more forthcoming in
their communications with tax officials. Danny Jackson, the Postal
Service's vice president for operations in the Great Lakes region,
wrote to Illinois tax officials on June 23 that the delays were
caused by problems with a new electronic system for tracking
certified mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said there was ``a lack of available equipment for bar
code scanning,'' compounded by the absence of ``a contingency plan
to implement as a countermeasure for our lack of scanning
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service issued a nationwide directive that on March
15, all old certified mail forms were to be destroyed and only new
ones _ with scannable bar codes _ were to be used. But the software
to scan the bar codes was not downloaded into post office computers
until this week, said Julie Rios, a Postal Service information
systems manager.
</P>
<P>
   When they met with New York City tax officials on Thursday,
``the postal guys attempted to explain how from their point of view
everything was working fine,'' said Eristoff, the city revenue
commissioner. ``And then we proved with their own documents _
manifests and date stamps and such _ that there is a problem at
Church Street station,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the meeting, he said, ``the postal officials were
beginning to contemplate acknowledging a problem.'' Vacchiarelli,
the Church Street postmaster, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Informed by a reporter of the tax officials' concerns, Rep. John
McHugh, the New York Republican who is chairman of the postal
subcommittee of the House Government Reform Committee, said on
Thursday that he would ask the Postal Service's inspector general
to audit the certified mail system.
</P>
<P>
   When the subcommittee was told about the new system earlier this
year, he said, ``we were given no indication from the Postal
Service that a problem was likely to arise out of this change.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers should not face penalties because of delays in
delivering their payments, because deadlines are based on when a
letter is postmarked, not when it is delivered, tax officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 870,000 pieces of certified mail are delivered each day;
deliveries generally peak at 1.3 million pieces a day in late
April, according to Saunders, the Postal Service spokesman. It
costs $1.40 to send a letter by certified mail, and $1.25 more for
a receipt documenting that the letter was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said it was too early to say whether the Postal Service
would consider paying any expenses that New York City and other
government agencies incurred because of late delivery of certified
mail.
</P>
<P>
   A related service, registered mail, has a much smaller volume.
Used for shipping valuables like stock certificates and jewelry,
registered mail is transported in locked containers. Tax officials,
who do not receive much registered mail, said they had no
indication whether it was also affected by the delays.

PLATFORM FAVORS AMENDMENT TO BAN ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A draft of the Republican Party's convention
platform retains an endorsement of a constitutional amendment that
would ban abortion, but adds a new section on women's health and
deletes some of the strident attacks on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed platform was released Thursday night and was not
immediately available to most delegates who will vote on it. But
the document will be the subject of hearings for the next two days,
with the most likely fight coming over abortion. Overall, the
document seeks to mirror the tone set by the nominee-in-waiting,
George W. Bush, whose campaign was greatly responsible for its
content.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said for months that the anti-abortion plank should be
retained, so that is no surprise. By any measure, the platform is a
mostly conservative document, but the party is clearly reaching out
to moderates on some issues and has a much more muted tone in many
areas. The platform drops a call for the elimination of the
Department of Education and it says Republicans support ``a strong
federal role in environmental protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The new tone is by design, according to Senator Bill Frist of
Tennessee, a co-chairman of the platform committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are upbeat, optimistic, enthusiastic,'' Frist said as the
draft was handed out to reporters. Thus, the platform deletes
direct attacks on the Democrats and inserts appeals to women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the plank on affirmative action in 1996 said, ``We
scorn Bill Clinton's notion that any person should be denied a job,
promotion, contract or a chance at higher education because of
their race or gender.'' In the new platform, the plank has been
renamed ``equal access'' and there is no mention of scorn. Still,
the GOP principle on the issue is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In the section called ``right to bear arms,'' the 1996 platform
referred to Clinton's actions on gun control as ``strange.'' The
new platform deletes such attacks and adds an acknowledgment of the
recent spread of violence in the schools. ``With a special emphasis
upon school safety, we propose the crackdown on youth violence,''
the platform says.
</P>
<P>
   The new section on women's health, while not likely to mollify
supporters of abortion rights, is clearly aimed at women voters.
``Republicans are at the forefront in aggressively developing
health care initiatives targeted specifically at the needs of
women...and we are reaching out to under-served and minority female
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform is titled ``Renewing America's Prosperity.
Together.'' In recounting how the economy has turned around in the
last eight years, the platform says: ``That wasn't magic. It took
honest and guts from a Congress that manages the nation's purse
strings.'' Just as the platform deletes the attacks on Clinton, it
does not give the president, or Vice President Gore, any credit for
the economy, either.

GOP DRAFT PLATFORM KEEPS HARD LINE ON ABORTION BUT SOFTENS EDGES
ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The proposed Republican platform would drop
several of the more hard-edged conservative positions adopted four
years ago _ like calling for the abolition of the Department of
Education _ and transform much of the document's tone to reflect
the ``compassionate conservatism'' of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects the continuing power of the party's
conservative base, most notably in its word-by-word reaffirmation
of the abortion plank, calling for a ban on abortion with no
exceptions and the appointment of judges who ``respect traditional
family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the platform was written under the guidance of Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the platform committee chairman, and
was distributed to members of the platform committee gathering here
Thursday night. It will be reviewed _ possibly rewritten _ and
voted upon by the 107-member platform committee over the next two
days. The full convention will consider the resulting product on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Thursday night that he hoped the draft reflected
``a more uplifting view of the Republican Party, one that's more
inclusive, that attempts to build a winning team, that people can
rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was also intended to reflect the Bush philosophy,
adding that he took the chairman's job ``because my friend the
governor asked me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much he expected the committee to change this draft,
Thompson said, ``I hope not much, but I know some.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee,
said Thursday that Republicans were simply putting ``compassionate
conservative wrapping paper'' around the same old conservative
dogma. She argued that the platform's changes were ``around the
margins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the American people wanted one sign that the Republican
Party had moved out of the 19th century,'' Backus said, ``it would
have been some understanding that American women want the right to
choose protected.''
</P>
<P>
   As written, the document is in large part a road map of the Bush
campaign's political imperatives in the general election campaign.
The section on immigration, for example, no longer demands a
constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the
children born of illegal immigrants, as it did four years ago.
Rather than calling for ``the official recognition of English as
the nation's common language,'' it declares, ``Another sign of our
unity is the role of English as our common language.'' The tone, in
general, is far more welcoming, reflecting Republicans' attempts to
reach out to Hispanics and other immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the document includes a careful appeal to women,
pledging the party's commitment to women's health issues, and to
the elderly, considered a critical swing vote this year.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to give Medicare ``a new lease on life'' by giving
each of its 39 million beneficiaries a choice of health plans, an
allusion to efforts to get more private insurance plans involved.
And it accuses the Clinton administration of treating ``Social
Security as a slogan rather than a priority,'' while touting Bush's
proposal to allow people to invest a portion of their payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all these appeals to voters in the center, this is
hardly a rebuttal of conservative orthodoxy. The platform
reiterates a defense of ``the constitutional right to keep and bear
arms'' and argues that ``self defense is a basic human right.'' The
answer to gun violence, it argues, is stronger enforcement of
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The platform assails the Supreme Court's recent decision
overturning state laws barring what critics call ``partial birth''
abortion, asserting that the decision ``shocks the conscience of
the nation.'' And while Bush has said he would allow abortions in
the case of rape, incest and to save the life of the woman, the
platform remains unswervingly opposed. Bush and other Republican
leaders had promised the anti-abortion movement early on that the
abortion plank would not change.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the document was intended to sound a far
less partisan tone than the 1996 platform, which is in keeping with
the Bush campaign's effort to present its candidate as ``a uniter,
not a divider.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the references are opaque: In a section titled
``Government for the People,'' the draft is apparently referring to
the impeachment of Clinton when it declares, ``At a time when the
nation felt betrayed by misconduct in high office, the Republican
Congress responded with gravity and high purpose. We applaud those
members who did their duty to conscience and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform goes to great lengths, though, to try to build a
case against giving the Democrats any credit for the current
economic boom. It argues that the economy was in ``shambles'' under
President Carter, was saved by the Reagan and Bush administrations,
and was jeopardized anew by the election of the Clinton
administration in 1992, although that election occurred in a
recession. Only the ``honesty and guts'' of a Republican Congress
managed to erase the budget deficit and steady the economy for this
boom, the platform draft declares.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when that Republican Congress was still in full
cry, the platform called for the elimination of the Departments of
Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education and Energy. This
draft generally calls for ``downsizing'' of the ``mess'' in
Washington, where there are ``too many departments and agencies
with competing programs that waste resources and fail to deliver
the goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the draft was written by the staff of the
Republican National Committee, the Bush campaign and his own
operation, under his guidance and that of his two co-chairs, Rep.
Sue Myrick of North Carolina and Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most scathing criticism in the draft comes in the
section on foreign policy, when the administration is assailed for
mishandling crises from the Balkans to Mexico: ``Reacting belatedly
to inevitable crises, the administration constantly enlarges the
reach of its rhetoric _ most recently in Vice President [Al) Gore's
`new security agenda' that adds disease, climate, and all the
world's ethnic or religious conflicts to an undiminished set of
existing American responsibilities. If there is some limit to
candidate Gore's new agenda for America as global social worker, he
has yet to define it,'' the draft declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for America to regain its focus,'' it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, responded, ``Sounds like
the Republicans are turning back the clock to the days of
isolationism and a head-in-the-sand view of the world. It's only
common sense to address these problems before they develop into
conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform draft also takes aim at Gore's environmental
activism, arguing that a Republican president will reduce harmful
emissions without ``forcing Americans to walk to work.''

<P>
   HAMILTON, Texas _ With grasshoppers pinging off the windshield
like hailstones, Marvin Schrank mows through row after row of ripe
milo maize, swarms of the insects rolling in waves of dust just
ahead of his John Deere combine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those yellow hoppers have finished with the leaves and gone on
to eating the seed,'' Schrank said. ``They're hurting me now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of Schrank's grain field, his brother Alan shakes
the branches of a native peach tree and sends dozens of
grasshoppers skittering into the blazing afternoon sun. He points
to a green peach eaten halfway through to the pit, saying, ``Look
here what they done.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas farmers and ranchers like the Schrank brothers _ whose
family has worked the same fields near here since the 1890s _ a
growing season marked by falling commodities prices and relentless
drought has, in the last few months, added yet another burden: a
costly infestation of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst I've seen in my 31 years of working in Texas,''
said Cliff Hoelscher, an entomologist with Texas A&AMP;M University's
Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   Several warm winters in a row, combined with drought conditions
in much of Texas for the last three years, have created nearly
perfect breeding conditions for the 15 to 20 species of
grasshoppers commonly found in the state, Hoelscher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a cold winter or a wet spring, the eggs all hatch, and
all of the young grasshoppers are able to mature,'' he said. ``The
bigger they are, the more they'll eat.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 63 of the 254 counties in Texas have been affected,
Hoelscher said. And reports of infestations have come to his office
from New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit, Hoelscher said, are farmers and ranchers raising
cattle food: leafy green vegetation like hay, grain sorghum and
coastal bermuda grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll move into an area and strip 15 to 20 percent of the
available forage away in no time at all,'' he said. ``That's 15 to
20 percent more feed that ranchers have to buy to make up the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Though insecticides can help rid an area of the grasshoppers,
Hoelscher said, many of the insects will escape and move to an
adjacent unsprayed field. A natural enemy of the grasshoppers, the
entomophagous fungus, would help control their numbers, but it only
thrives in wet weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wet weather is something we haven't seen a lot of in Texas for
the last few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Knutson, also an entomologist and a member of Texas A&AMP;M's
Extension Service, estimated that 21 million acres of pasture and
hay fields have been affected by grasshoppers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant presence of grasshoppers might be eight to 10
insects per square yard,'' Knutson said. ``But we're seeing
incidents of 30 to 40 grasshoppers per square yard in some fields.
And that's causing us real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Rich, of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, said his state was
also suffering from the invasion of grasshoppers, but had not yet
calculated the financial damage. ``Some losses will be
significant,'' he said. ``I just don't know the numbers yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Glenn E. Studebaker, an entomologist with the
Cooperative Extension Service at Little Rock, said: ``I wouldn't
call it a plague of locusts. We have some problem with grasshoppers
in southern Arkansas: soybeans in particular and some rice and some
pastureland. It's heavier than usual, but nothing like Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Knutson said, losses for this year alone have already
totaled at least $190 million in lost crops and treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those treatment costs include spraying insecticides on infested
fields. And in that war, the area around the Schrank brothers' farm
_ about 100 miles southwest of Dallas _ is ground zero, said Steve
Watson, who runs a family-owned farm and ranch supplies store in
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had places out there that had hundreds of grasshoppers
per square yard,'' he said. ``We watched them take one 60-acre
field of coastal Bermuda grass from 2 and a half feet high down to
4 inches almost overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson sells insecticides to area farmers and ranchers, and
conducts many of the spraying operations himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to order 10 times more insecticide than I normally
would, and we've been working daylight to dark, seven days a week,
putting the stuff out in the fields, since early spring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get rid of them,'' Watson said. ``All you can do is
slow them down and try to protect your most valuable crops first.''
</P>
<P>
   But even keeping pace with the grasshoppers can be expensive, he
said. It costs $8 to $10 an acre to treat infected fields, he said,
and for an average-sized farm near this community of 3,000, that
can quickly add up to $6,000 to $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to spray twice or more, and then here will
come another batch of new grasshoppers flying in from somewhere
else,'' he said. Malathion and liquid Sevin are Watson's weapons of
choice, and he says that in the last few months he has killed
``billions'' of grasshoppers. ``I think, finally, we're gaining on
them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly. But Shauna Melde, who lives across a dusty county road
from the Schrank brothers, says she has had so many grasshoppers
that her sister began packing them in 5-gallon containers and
freezing them for fishing bait.
</P>
<P>
   Melde said her husband had tried spraying insecticide several
times in the last few days, but apparently with little effect.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched dozens of grasshoppers dancing across the
tattered remains of her front yard, she said: ``Look at them. They
really just seem to be enjoying it.''

ANOTHER BIRD WITH WEST NILE VIRUS FOUND IN BOSTON AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT AND BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A day after state residents discovered the potentially
deadly West Nile virus had traveled up the coast to Massachusetts,
a second infected crow found Thursday had public officials saying
the mosquito-borne disease could spread statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Birds carrying the disease are often the first sign that the
virus may soon appear in mosquitoes and humans. While the birds
cannot transfer the disease to people, they do act as a reservoir:
Mosquitoes bite them, get the exotic encephalitis virus, and then
bite humans.
</P>
<P>
   The infected crows have been found in the suburban town of
Hopkinton and Boston's Jamaica Plain section.
</P>
<P>
   As in New York, where the virus mysteriously made its Western
Hemisphere debut by killing seven people last year, Massachusetts
officials were quick to announce expanded pesticide sprayings.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of the aerial spraying that caused controversy in
the Big Apple, public health officials said they would spray
pesticides from trucks in Boston. Similar spraying is expected to
begin or expand in the Hopkinton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who get West Nile virus don't have much in the way
of severe symptoms, but we are doing all this to prevent severe
disease in a small number of people,'' said Dr. Alfred DeMaria Jr.,
director of the state Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.
Officials have advised residents to wear long sleeves and pants
when outside between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most
active.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been no human cases reported this year, a
12-year-old Jamaica Plain girl was admitted to Boston Children's
Hospital Wednesday with symptoms similar to that of the West Nile
encephalitis virus. However, hospital and public health officials
stressed that her symptoms of fever and delirium could indicate a
range of illnesses. No other major hospital reported admitting a
patient with West Nile-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state officials said 70 mosquitoes from Jamaica
Plain's Willow Pond tested negative for the virus. Still, they said
they expected to find mosquitoes with the disease within days.
</P>
<P>
   The second infected bird, in Hopkinton, was first found
staggering across a road July 21. It died shortly after being
picked up by town animal-control officials. Tests confirmed that
the American crow had West Nile virus in its kidneys and brain. The
first infected crow was found near Willow Pond on the
Brookline-Jamaica Plain border on July 22. Birds pick up the
disease and usually die from it following an incubation period that
can last 10 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   Worried residents across Massachusetts called town and state
health officials to report seeing dead or sick birds. The virus can
live in a range of bird hosts, including chickens and hawks. After
a nationwide alert about the virus and recommendations from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that cities along the
East Coast test for its appearance, Massachusetts has tested 49
birds since Memorial Day. Thursday alone, state health authorities
received 20 more for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus, first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937, had its
first major outbreak in Egypt in 1950. While it popped up in Asia
and Europe, it never made it to the US until last year when it
surfaced in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No outbreaks have occurred this year, but mosquitoes carrying
the West Nile virus _ which can cause encephalitis in extreme cases
_ have been found in and around New York this summer, as well as in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who get the virus don't know they have it because
the symptoms mimic the flu. But the young, the elderly, or ailing
can become very ill and sometimes die.
</P>
<P>
   While the need to protect those people is high, many residents
also expressed concern about the health threat posed by pesticides
used to wipe out mosquito populations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, environmentalists filed a lawsuit recently in an
unsuccessful bid to prevent the spraying of Central Park. They
cited fears about the the dangers of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state is planning to use Resmethrin, a
synthetic form of a natural pesticide found in chrysanthemum
flowers. When exposed to sunlight, air or water, the pesticide
decomposes and reportedly kills 90 percent of mosquitoes that come
in contact with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously need to deal with the spread of this virus, but
in doing so we don't want to create a whole new public health
problem by exposing residents to these pesticides,'' said Matt
Wilson of Toxics Action Center, a nonprofit group that assists
community groups with public health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In high doses, Resmethrin can cause nausea and dizziness in
humans. In some extreme cases, it could cause convulsions, and
ultimately, death.
</P>
<P>
   Officials assure the public that the pesticides are safe _ and
in fact already use the product regularly for mosquito control in
many communities. Mosquito control projects across the state often
spray Resmethrin from trucks to kill adult mosquitoes. They also
use a bacteria-based larvicide they spray into stagnant pools of
water where mosquito larvae might hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Such methods are particularly important now because recent rains
have created thousands of stagnant pools where millions of
mosquitoes will breed in the next week to 10 days.

MEDICAL SCHOOLS ALLY TO STREAMLINE CLINICAL DRUG TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard University Medical School and four other top US medical
schools, worried that private industry is taking over too much of
human research on new medical treatments, have formed an alliance
promising drug companies faster approval and completion of critical
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Medical drugs are an exploding business. Pharmaceutical
companies spend $300 million to $500 million to develop a new drug,
in the hope that they will be first to discover a medication and
start selling it. The business is expected to become even more
competitive as scientists develop gene-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, speed in getting products to market is critical.
Drug companies have increasingly turned to for-profit clinical
research organizations, private doctors' offices, and small
community hospitals to recruit patients and run trials rather than
university medical centers, which have laborious approval
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph B. Martin, dean of the Harvard Medical School, said
officials at the five institutions believe that they can speed up
that process without jeopardizing the safety of the participants.
The federal agency that oversees human research has approved the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the five academic medical centers _
Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's
hospitals, Washington University School of Medicine, the University
of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, and Baylor College of
Medicine _ will run certain clinical trials jointly. They will
designate one institution as the lead reviewer, and that school's
Institutional Review Board will conduct a comprehensive review of
patient safety and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The other institutions will conduct abbreviated reviews and will
have access to the full review. Normally, drug companies must seek
full reviews and approval from IRBs at all academic medical centers
involved in a national clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly competing with studies that are being done
in the private sector,'' said Dr. Daniel Schuster, associate dean
of clinical research at Washington University in St. Louis. ``The
drug companies outsource these trials to clinical research
organizations and they decide where they can get the job done
fastest. If they can get it done in a private doctor's office more
quickly, that's where they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago academic medical centers conducted 90 percent
of the clinical trials paid for by drug companies, compared to 40
percent today, Schuster said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard wins less than 1 percent of the $20 billion to $25
billion that drug companies award in research grants each year,
said Dr. James Breitmeyer, president of the Harvard Clinical
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Harvard to be offering more cutting-edge medications
to Boston patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breitmeyer said the ``trials are getting done more often in
small storefront doctors' offices and small community hospitals and
solo practice settings. There's less bureaucracy but there's also
less intellectual scientific oversight and input.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic medical centers certainly want to win more research
dollars for their institutions, some of which are struggling
financially, but they also consider research one of their primary
missions.
</P>
<P>
   The five institutions plan to launch the project at Washington
University Sept. 15, when they will invite drug company executives
to meet medical school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster said this is the first time the National Institutes of
Health has allowed such a relationship between academic
institutions in different regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   He said that large private IRBs approve clinical trials within a
week, while academic medical centers typically require four to
eight weeks. While the centers involved in the partnership, called
the Multicenter Academic Clinical Research Organization, have tried
to reduce approval time to two to four weeks, Schuster does not
anticipate one-week turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that unsettling,'' he said. ``It's almost like a rubber
stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan S. Bachenheimer, chief executive of BBK Patient Recruitment
in Newton, said that the medical centers ``are doing a very smart
thing'' but that speed is not the only factor for drug companies
choosing where to conduct a clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Location, she said, depends on where the patients go. If a drug
company is testing a new cold medication, those patients will
probably be found in doctors' offices, not university hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a research revolution,'' she said. ``This is a huge
industry and it's looking for efficiencies.''

COMMENTARY: YASSER ARAFAT'S MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so it really comes down to this: Who is Yasser Arafat? Is he
Nelson Mandela, or is he Willie Nelson? That is, is he a man ready
for a historic compromise, or would he just prefer to sing the old
songs?
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that after a two-week diplomatic slumber
party at Camp David with Arafat, U.S. officials say they still
don't know. But this is the key question now.
</P>
<P>
   The reason President Clinton was so frustrated with Arafat at
Camp David was not because he refused to accept every aspect of
Ehud Barak's offer for how to share Jerusalem. No one could have,
or should have, expected that. The Palestinian-Muslim claim to
Jerusalem is authentic, deep-rooted and heartfelt. The reason the
Americans were frustrated with Arafat was that he played
rope-a-dope. He came with no compromise ideas of his own on
Jerusalem. He simply absorbed Barak's proposals and repeated
Palestinian mantras about recovering all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   What should Arafat have said? He should have told Barak that his
ideas for granting Palestinians an administrative presence in East
Jerusalem, autonomous control over the Arab neighborhoods there and
religious control over the Temple Mount were a huge leap forward
for an Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
   But, he should have added, they didn't go far enough. The
Palestinians needed three things: First, they must have not simply
an administrative presence but a sovereign presence in East
Jerusalem, over which they have full control and can fly their flag
_ even if it is just one square block. It could be at Orient House
or in the Muslim Quarter. Second, they must at least share
sovereignty with the Jewish people over the sacred space of the
Temple Mount, which is the site of both the ancient Jewish temple
and two of Islam's holiest mosques. And third, the Palestinians
must have direct access from that sovereign Palestinian presence to
both the mosques on the Temple Mount and to the Palestinian state
in the West Bank, so they don't have to go through Israeli
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Such a proposal would have been further than Barak was ready to
go, but it would have been a credible Palestinian counteroffer, and
it would have been the basis for a real negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Because we do know now who Ehud Barak is. ``Barak is engaged in
the most important historical event of the Zionist movement,''
remarked the Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal.
``Between the Mediterranean and the Jordan there are roughly 5
million Jews and 5 million Palestinian Arabs. You cannot have a
Jewish and democratic state without dividing this land, and those
who oppose that are dooming Israel to an apartheid state, which
might have secure borders, but might not be worth securing. Barak
is on a purely Zionist mission to bring Israel back into borders
where it can be Jewish, just, democratic _ and secure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Arafat seize on that with a serious counteroffer? One
view in the U.S. camp is that the Palestinians still don't know who
they want to be when they grow up. They still prefer to whine and
play the victim. Another view says, hold on, Arafat knows he has to
engage, but he needed to show his people he could say no before he
says yes.
</P>
<P>
   My own view is a mix. I believe Arafat presides over a
decentralized, disenfranchised and dysfunctional national movement
that, against all odds, has managed to survive Arab regimes that
wanted to control it and Israeli governments that wanted to destroy
it. He survived all these years by bobbing, weaving, straddling and
never making an irrevocable decision. But now he is at the moment
of truth. He must do something he has never done before: clearly
define not just what the Palestinians want, but what they also
believe the Jews are entitled to, and then split the difference and
take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   To do that he is going to have to rise above his personal
history and circumstances, and also enlist the backing of Egypt and
Saudi Arabia _ which represent the Muslim world, but which ran away
when Clinton asked them to help Arafat fashion and sell a
compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. Listen to Israel. Listen to the silence. It's
the Israeli silent majority already redrawing maps in their heads.
That is Barak's great achievement. But it has limits, and it will
be utterly wasted if Arafat and the Arabs can't muster the courage
to get their own people to do the same.

 &HT;    Evangelist taps financial, spiritual power
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few preachers can transform a talk on credit card debt
and mutual funds into a tent-revival-like sermon that leaves
thousands of women shouting in joy and waving their arms in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Bishop T.D. Jakes did Thursday at the
Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes' address marked the official opening of his three-day,
``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!'' conference, two different programs that
attracted tens of thousands of women to downtown Atlanta Thursday.
Thousands more _ perhaps a quarter-million people in all _ from
across Georgia and as far away as the Congo, Japan and Mexico are
expected to attend sessions today and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Jakes spoke about economic empowerment in the morning
and spiritual empowerment during an evening sermon at the Georgia
Dome. Yet for Jakes, who comes from a family of entrepreneurs, both
themes are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   God, Jakes thinks, wants women to be loosed economically as well
as spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virtuous woman in the Bible wasn't an Aunt Bee who baked
biscuits and waited for Andy to come home,'' Jakes said. ``She was
an entrepreneur and a landowner.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year that Jakes, pastor of a mega-church in
Dallas, the Potters House, has held a conference in Atlanta. But
this year he comes with a twist in his offerings, a ``Woman, Thou
Art Loosed Plus'' conference that focuses on economics.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Jakes also used his time here this week to
premiere a new play. Called ``Behind Closed Doors,'' the musical
drama explores issues of breast cancer and marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point where I had to calm myself down because I
felt like I was in a church service, not a play,'' said Dawn Baah,
35, who traveled from London to hear Jakes and see the premiere of
his play Tuesday night. ``I left the place a changed woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes wants more women to become changed as business people as
well. He said too many church members possess spiritual principles
but little business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I asked how many women in this room purchased a new outfit
within the last 30 days, hands would shoot up,'' Jakes said
Thursday during a morning session of his ``Plus'' conference at the
World Congress Center. ``But if I asked how many had a CD
(certificate of deposit) or a mutual fund, the numbers would
decline significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women, judging by the cheers, approve of Jakes emphasis on
economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spiritual part is fine but past that, life is life,'' said
Debra Zeilgler-Johnson, 44, from Kansas City, Mo. ``I gotta pay my
bills. I'm at a point where I need someone to take me to the next
level to show me what I need . . . He's there spiritually and
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes is a savvy businessman who has used the popularity of his
message to create a cottage industry that includes the ``Woman Thou
Art Loosed'' revival, a best-selling book of the same name, a
special-edition Bible and a CD, ``Sacred Love Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still remembers the days when he and his wife, Serita,
had their utility bills cut off for lack of funds and his struggle
to get his first book published. He had to empty his savings
account to self-publish the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have gone from welfare to Godfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the center of Jakes' message remains his appeal to women's
hearts, not their purse strings. During his week-long visit to
Atlanta, Jakes bounced from radio and television appearances,
greeted by crowds of woman who say he has changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Darleen Crockett, 40, waited three hours at a bookstore in
Underground Atlanta Tuesday for Jakes to sign his book. She was
deeply moved when the pastor waited for his wife in front of the
store, paused and then applauded as she entered building where fans
were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love how he loves his wife,'' Crockett said. ``Every woman
wants a man to love her like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, at times, sounds mystified that he has become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of his popularity can trace its roots to a study
group he held at his Texas church where he discussed such issues as
incest and rape. Within a couple of months, hundreds of women were
attending the weekly sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the bleeding hearts of so many people in the pews
and outside the church doors, I felt like a paramedic,'' Jakes
said. ``It was important that I get there at the scene of the
crime. I took the risk. I was greatly relieved that they ran to me

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A grand jury has declined to file criminal charges
against the undercover narcotics detective who fatally shot Patrick
M. Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, during a desperate,
two-minute brawl in March in front of a midtown Manhattan bar,
prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, said the
grand jury decided not to indict the detective, Anthony Vasquez,
after concluding that the shooting _ a single bullet fired from a
9-mm pistol, at a range so close that the barrel was touching
Dorismond's clothing _ was not intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors also heard evidence that Dorismond had thrown the
first punch as a dispute with three detectives escalated into
disorder, and that Dorismond had seized and was twisting Vasquez's
shooting hand when the gun fired, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the son of Haitian immigrants and the father of two
young daughters, was the fourth unarmed black man to die at the
hands of police during a 13-month period. His death created a
public uproar and became an issue in the race for the U.S. Senate
before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   It came just weeks after the acquittal of officers who had
killed another unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo, and Giuliani, who
called Dorismond no ``altar boy'' even as the investigation was
just starting, was widely criticized for allowing police officials
to release the dead man's juvenile criminal record and for failing
to meet with his family. The controversy intensified after
protesters clashed violently with police at Dorismond's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The case also brought scrutiny on the public risks inherent in
police buy-and-bust operations, in which teams of undercover
detectives randomly approach people on the street and try to buy
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, was not a drug dealer. He had completed a shift
as a 34th Street Partnership security guard an hour and a half
before he died. To police critics and to Dorismond's family, his
death was a symbol of a department whose aggressive tactics and
appetite for ever-climbing arrest statistics led detectives to draw
a young man into a scuffle that led to his killing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morgenthau's office exercises considerable control over the
grand jury process, including the evidence heard and the charges
considered, and he acknowledged the political tension surrounding
the case Thursday. But the district attorney said the jurors had
acted conscientiously and fairly after reviewing 42 exhibits and
hearing from 24 witnesses, including Vasquez, during a four-week
session.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the public to accept its decision. ``Some people may be
disappointed that this investigation has not resulted in an
indictment,'' he said. ``I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added: ``The grand jury is not a forum for the
expression of political views or the resolution of policy disputes.
To allow it to be used for those purposes would simply layer an
injustice upon a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, 30, could not be reached for comment Thursday night.
His lawyer, Philip Karasyk, issued a brief statement and then said
that Vasquez felt as if ``a tremendous weight has been lifted from
his and his family's shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no joy in this decision,'' he said. ``Only relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's mother, Marie Rose Dorismond, and his father, Andre
Dorismond, assailed the grand jury's decision Thursday at an angry
news conference with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Alternately sobbing and
shouting, his mother called on God and President Clinton for help
and suggested the shooting had racist overtones. The three
detectives involved in the drug sting were Hispanic. Dorismond was
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help me, God,'' she said. ``Why did you create me black? Look
at me, I'm suffering now.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that Morgenthau's summary of the
investigation suggested that the police had acted almost without
fault. ``It is pretty hard to read this report and find something
to criticize the police officers for,'' he said. ``I think they
were acting under a very, very difficult set of circumstances. I
think it is clear from the report, and the report says quite
clearly, that the aggressor was Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, speaking in a calm, almost restrained voice, offered
condolences to the Dorismond family and later said the shooting was
a tragedy for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great sympathy for his family,'' he said. ``But I also
have great sympathy for the police officers who were put through
what is a horrible experience, in which their jobs, their
liberties, their careers were put in jeopardy and they will
continue to be under question and review for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau's remarks Thursday, and a summary of the case for
Police Commissioner Howard Safir that prosecutors released to news
organizations, provided the most vivid picture to date of the
events that occurred shortly after midnight on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prosecutors' report, the commander of the
Midtown South Precinct had requested the help of narcotics
detectives after reviewing mounting evidence that the Bloods gang
was selling crack cocaine on Eighth Avenue between West 34th and
West 43rd Streets. And so for two nights, a team _ consisting of
Detectives Vasquez, Anderson Moran, and Julio Cruz _ was assigned
to the area. Moran posed as a drug buyer. His two peers served as
``ghosts,'' or backups.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight on March 16, Morgenthau said, Moran saw
Dorismond and a companion, Kevin Kaiser, standing in front of the
Wakamba Cocktail Lounge at 543 Eighth Ave. (Kaiser has said that
Dorismond was waiting for a taxi.) With his ghosts watching, the
detective approached Dorismond and asked him if he had any
``krills,'' street slang for crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter immediately turned hostile. Morgenthau said
witnesses testified that Dorismond argued with Moran, using foul
language, and advanced on him as the detective backed away. The
other two detectives came to Moran's side, Morgenthau said, and the
three men began to walk backward as Dorismond continued to approach
and his friend, Kaiser, tried to restrain him.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau described a flash point: Dorismond broke free from
his friend and punched Moran, he said, and the dispute descended
into chaos. ``Everyone was swinging fists, pushing and grabbing at
each other in a general melee or brawl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said Vasquez told investigators that he heard either
Dorismond or Kaiser yell ``gun'' or ``get the gun,'' and, believing
that the brawl was about turn into a gunfight, the detective yelled
``police,'' stepped forward and reached into his pants to withdraw
a concealed pistol.
</P>
<P>
   As he did so, Morgenthau said, Dorismond grabbed the detective's
right hand and the weapon and began twisting. The gun fired,
blasting a bullet into the left side of Dorismond's chest,
perforating his aorta and killing him within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, Morgenthau said, ``did not intentionally pull the
trigger, and in fact does not know how the discharge came about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's announcement means that Vasquez will not
face state criminal charges, the examination of the shooting is not
over, and he remains on modified duty, without a weapon, performing
police clerical work. Patrick E. Kelleher, the Police Department's
first deputy commissioner, said internal affairs officers would
review the evidence to see if he should face administrative
charges. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also investigating
the case for possible violations of federal criminal civil rights
laws.

 &HT;    Blacks sue Georgia Power Co.
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three employees of Georgia Power Co. sued the utility
Thursday claiming it fosters a ``pattern of discriminating against
African-Americans'' who work there and shows ``reckless
indifference'' to a racially hostile workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile racial
discrimination suits against major corporations in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Power workers, who seek class action status to
represent all 2,100 African-American employees, claim that
management of Georgia's largest utility company paid black
employees less and maintained a ``glass ceiling'' that
discriminated against them for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the lawsuit, Georgia Power President David
Ratcliffe addressed all 8,000-plus employees statewide via
closed-circuit television from the company's downtown Atlanta
headquarters Thursday. He said the company ``maintains a strong
policy of zero tolerance for racially or intolerant behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced the appointment of a Diversity Action Council,
co-chaired by an African-American board member, and promised to
``move expeditiously to address these concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take these concerns seriously,'' Ratcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the legal action expressed a willingness to
discuss settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In support of its claim of a hostile work environment, the
lawsuit alleges that Georgia Power management did nothing about the
display of a hangman's noose in a heavily traveled area at the
utility's operating headquarters in Cornelia between 1997 and
September 1999. A photograph depicting what appears to be a noose
hanging in a storeroom was attached to the lawsuit. A similar
allegation was made in a racial discrimination suit filed in May
against Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a hangman's noose has long been one of the most
chilling representations of racial harassment, two Georgia Power
vice presidents and several managers who were aware of it and had
even viewed the noose took no action to remove it,'' the lawsuit
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This example of grossly inappropriate behavior and offensive
conduct is just the tip of an iceberg. African-Americans
company-wide report incidents of racial harassment, including being
called (by a racial epithet) or being told in essence that 'blacks
are too dumb to be managers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Ratcliffe said the company during the
past two weeks had found two hangman's nooses at operations centers
in North Georgia, that had ``apparently been there for some time.''
They were taken down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is embarrassing and represents a very insensitive
action by our employees,'' he said. Ratcliffe vowed to be ``very
firm'' with any employees who were involved, but said he wants to
gather the facts before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's clear to me we need some more sensitivity training,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in Fulton County Superior Court, the 29-page lawsuit names
Georgia Power Co. and its parent Southern Co. as defendants. It was
filed by the same law firm that represents Coca-Cola employees in a
racial discrimination lawsuit against the Atlanta-based soft drink
company.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent discrimination lawsuits have named Home Depot and
Waffle House, both Atlanta companies. The companies have all denied
discriminating against employees and Coca-Cola has reached a
tentative settlement of one of two pending lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe, a 30-year Southern Co. veteran who took over the
presidency of Georgia Power 14 months ago, said the company began
an assessment of its employment practices two weeks ago when he
discovered employees had retained attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to meet with the employee group,'' he said. ``Their
response was that they would not meet with us without attorneys
present.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it became a discussion between the plaintiffs'
attorneys at Bondurant &AMP; Elmore and Georgia Power's law firm,
Troutman Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe appeared to be taken aback when he read the lawsuit
for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may hear or read some things about our company that are
not pleasant,'' Ratcliffe said in his five-minute talk to employees
Thursday afternoon. ``Don't overreact to those things.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he promised, ``if we have made mistakes, we will work hard
to correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe also announced that Juanita Baranco will co-chair with
him a diversity council that will recommend improvements in
employment practices. Baranco is chief executive of Atlanta-based
Baranco Automotive Group and one of Georgia Power's three
African-American board members.
</P>
<P>
   The three plaintiffs are Cornelius Cooper, a 28-year company
veteran now working as a lineman in Atlanta; Michael Edwards, a
13-year veteran who is a lineman; and Sarah Jean Harris, a 21-year
veteran who is a senior region support representative in the
engineering and operations department.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has been ``repeatedly subjected to offensive comments
about his race,'' the lawsuit says, citing specific examples.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Cooper and Edwards have been denied promotions
because of their race. And Harris, the only African-American in her
department, unfairly received lower performance evaluation scores
than her white counterparts and, as a result, lower compensation,
the suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe and other Georgia Power officials declined to discuss
personnel matters and plaintiffs' attorney Steven Rosenwasser said
his three clients were not available for comment beyond the claims
made in their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, African-Americans constituted 19.2
percent of Georgia Power's work force in December 1998, they
accounted for 22 of the company's ``higher-level positions,'' and
five of 150 foremen were black.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power said that as of Thursday, 1,793 of its 8,632
employees were African-American, 15 of 272 foremen were
African-American, 97 of 1,030 manager-supervisors are
African-American and three of 21 executives with vice presidential
rank or higher are black.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power officials clearly wanted to present a conciliatory
front Georgia Power already has a ``process in place'' to deal with
the charges and make changes, said spokesman Todd Terrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always open to settling the case,'' Ratcliffe said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenwasser said his clients also are open to settlement talks _
if Georgia Power is willing to agree to ``full compensation for
past wrongs'' and to independent monitoring of any reforms the
company makes and to ensure a non-discriminatory environment in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want employees to be at the mercy of the company that
has promised to reform its employment practices in the past but has
repeatedly failed to do so,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said he has no problem with reporting steps the
company takes. ``We're not a closed company,'' he said.

DR. FRANKENSTEIN TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SUV

 By GERALD C. MEYERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald C. Meyers , a former chairman and chief executive of
American Motors, is a professor at the University of Michigan
Business School. I feel like Dr. Frankenstein these days, having
pumped life into a corpse only to face the horror of its evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, as vice president for product development at
American Motors, I was handed the job of resuscitating the Jeep
brand _ soon after AMC bought it from the Kaiser Jeep Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I felt that Jeep was dead and that a struggling
second-tier automaker like AMC had no business taking on another
down-and-out carmaker, not even for a relatively cheap $70 million.
But given no choice, I decided to do my best.
</P>
<P>
   The first task was to update the vehicles. While the old
military Jeep was perfect for the battlefield _ featherweight and
engineered for parachuting from cargo planes, fording two-foot-deep
streams and vaulting the rocks of Iwo Jima _ it was not fit for
American highway use and was too sophisticated and costly to
produce for a commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   By the time AMC bought Jeep, a civilian version had been
designed, trading an all-aluminum, multifuel engine for a standard
gasoline motor and dropping an independent, fully articulated
suspension in favor of solid axles and leaf springs. It was larger,
wider and less nimble.
</P>
<P>
   But I knew it was also a loser unless something was done to give
it sex appeal. Fortunately, AMC was blessed with a great styling
team led by Richard A. Teague, a legend in auto design. We kept the
brand name but changed most of the components and the looks. More
reliable engines, styled steel wheels, stronger transmissions and
running gear were fundamental _ but not enough. The interiors
needed spice. So we added deep pile carpets and Levi's trim, as
well as roll bars that provided an element of safety but also
looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, the corpse began to stir. Sales
improved. Young people and pseudo-off-road drivers took notice.
Then it happened: the thing took on a life of its own. We couldn't
build enough.
</P>
<P>
   I was exultant. For the next decade, AMC had this market all to
itself. But then Ford Motor decided to chase us. The market
exploded, and such vehicles, which had already acquired the label
``sport utility,'' weren't just for adolescents and off-road nuts.
</P>
<P>
   So, to broaden our appeal, I decided to bring in a little
larger, totally enclosed Jeep to replace a Kaiser behemoth called
the Wagoneer. Because of two oil crises in the 1970s, however, it
had to be modest in girth. Thus the Jeep Cherokee was born; it was
immediately successful.
</P>
<P>
   I was elected president of American Motors in the late 1970s on
the strength of Jeep's success. Sales of our Rambler, Hornet and
Gremlin had long dried up, so the board encouraged me to drive
ahead with SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, things started to get out of hand. Everyone started
producing SUVs. Ford eventually produced the Explorer, wildly
popular but larger and heavier than anything in the Jeep line.
Chrysler, which would buy AMC from Renault, chased Ford with a
still larger unit, the Grand Cherokee. Then came the hulking
Expeditions and Excursions from Ford and the Suburban from General
Motors. These three-ton monsters are huge gas guzzlers. They sit on
pickup truck chassis, making no pretense otherwise, and are thought
to be a safety threat to drivers of regular passenger cars _ after
all, the laws of physics have not been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet suburban housewives, tired of bland station wagons and the
soccer-mom mediocrity of the ubiquitous minivans, continued to
switch to SUVs, enjoying the superiority of riding high above the
traffic. Thus the madness widened.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it all seemed to be OK Gasoline was cheaper than
bottled water, so who cared?
</P>
<P>
   OPEC had other ideas; low on cash, it cut oil supply again. Tree
huggers and Volvo lovers cheered, insisting that it was time to
dump our personal trucks anyway and to return to more sensible
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, we have not done so. Although some consumers have
grumbled over the cost of filling an SUVs tank, overall sales
remain brisk. There has been no significant revolution in what we
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I didn't intend it this way. Jeeps were supposed to
remain small, nimble, fuel-efficient, safe and lovable. They were
not designed to be road hogs or gas guzzlers. I'm sure the
overgrown monsters we drive now will not perish overnight. But
sales of the biggest of them are waning somewhat, and I take some
heart from Ford's plan, announced last week, to improve SUV fuel
efficiency. Eventually, smaller designs should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   I hope so. If not, maybe it would have been better to let Jeep's
corpse rest undisturbed.

   The five-year grant, to be announced formally in the next few

   The effort will mark the first time any organization has tried
to eliminate the mutating strains of the deadly disease in an
entire Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when health specialists and Western
governments, most notably the Clinton administration, have grown
increasingly concerned that sicknesses of the developing world are
spreading to the most privileged because of a huge jump in global
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world now has to figure out whether it can contain
outbreaks of multiple drug-resistant TB,'' said Bill Foege, a
senior adviser to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Foege said the foundation was impressed by the work of Partners
in Health and its founding doctors, Paul Farmer and Jim Kim, on
controlling drug-resistant TB in Peru. Foege said the hope is that
the ``new demonstration project can then be taken to its logical
conclusion and expanded to other countries around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who attended Harvard for only one year before dropping
out, has earmarked $1.9 billion for global health projects in the
last two years. The foundation hopes to spend about $550 million a
year on international health.
</P>
<P>
   For Partners in Health, which began in a tiny Cambridge, Mass.
office 13 years ago, the Gates's largesse will broaden their
influence among global health policy makers. The group has long
been led by Farmer, Kim and Boston philanthropist Thomas J. White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous step forward for us,'' said White, 80, who
has spent $3 million in recent years on fewer than 200
drug-resistant TB patients in Peru to prove that they _ and others
in poor countries _ could be cured. ``To go from $3 million to $45
million is pretty good. But what's really great is it means life
instead of death for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners in Health's mantra has been called an
``option-for-the-poor health care,'' an approach that addresses a
breadth of problems for the needy. The organization, which employs
more than 300 people, plans to continue current programs in Haiti,
the Chiapas region of Mexico and Roxbury on the theory that the
Gates money will cover costs for the Peru program.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, if it secures additional funding, Partners in Health
hopes to expand in areas of women's health, water protection,
surgical services, and pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of controlling tuberculosis will clearly take up
more of its focus now.
</P>
<P>
   TB, which kills more people than any other infectious disease,
is a bacterium with wings, spread by a sneeze or a cough. The bug
develops resistance to the most common anti-TB drugs when a person
takes only part of antibiotic regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Multidrug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB, has multiplied in recent
years, including in the former Soviet states, where prisons have
become breeding grounds for the disease due to lack of funds for TB
treatment. In Russia's prisons, 25 percent of all inmates have
drug-resistant TB. And 30 percent of all Russian prisoners,
including those with TB, are released every year.
</P>
<P>
   As in other countries, a chief worry in Russia is the meeting
ground of HIV/AIDS and drug-resistant TB, a cocktail that spikes
the death rate exponentially when a person's depleted immune system
cannot fight the aggressive TB bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get MDR-TB under control now, it will simply
continue to grow,'' said Kim, the grant's author and principal
investigator. ``Once HIV and MDR-TB meet each other in other areas,
as it has been in South Africa and other places, we are going to
have a problem of TB that will be unmanageable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peru program's goal is to treat every drug-resistant TB
patient. Partners in Health's sister organization in Peru, Socios
En Salud, will be the main executing arm of the grant. It will
train hundreds of local health workers on proper diagnosis and
administration of the TB drugs. It is a complex task, involving up
to two years of taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard doctors also will explore two separate avenues of
treatment in Peru with an eye toward exporting the program to other
nations: developing state-of-the-art therapies to diagnose the
resistance almost overnight; and exploring less technical ways of
treating the disease by learning more about how resistance
develops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Farmer and Kim decided to investigate drug-resistant TB
in Peru after one of their relief workers returned from there with
the bug and died. The group found an outbreak in the northern Lima
slum of Carabayllo and began to treat the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year later, the World Health Organization said in a
publication: ``In developing countries, people with
multidrug-resistant TB usually die, because effective treatment is
often impossible in poor settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners proved it was possible in Carabayllo, thanks to White's
pocketbook: He gave about $12,000 a patient per year, an almost
unheard of sum for treatment of the poor in the developing world.
Since then, due largely to the program's success, the price of
treating such patients has fallen dramatically, to $400 to $4,000
per patient, depending on the mix of antibiotics. Overall, such
medicines have fallen by 90 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he hoped that the new Peru program, which will also
include the WHO and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as subcontractors, an arrangement that was perhaps
unthinkable not so long ago. The Task Force for Child Survival and
Development of Atlanta will coordinate the coalition and develop a
global strategy to fight drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the treatment of MDR-TB much more
straightforward and standardized around the world,'' he said. ``In
the process, we will bring down the price of drugs, bring down the
price of diagnostics. . . . So instead of waiting two months for a
culture result to come back, which is way too much time, we hope to
utilize new technology to give us the answers in a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he said, ``the place to do this kind of research and
operation is a place where there are TB patients, a lot of TB
patients. We think Peru will be a good place to test new drugs, new
diagnostics and show under pressure, in a real live clinic, that we
can treat these patients.''

<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates's philanthropic foundation has
decided to make the largest private donation ever for fighting the
spread of tuberculosis, awarding a $44.7 million grant to a group
of Harvard doctors and medical scholars guided by a vision of
social justice to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year grant, to be announced formally in the next few
days, will go to Harvard Medical School's program in infectious
disease and social change. The program, an outgrowth of the
nonprofit Partners in Health group, will use the money to treat
drug-resistant TB in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will mark the first time any organization has tried

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Blaine Wilson's pep talk to Jason Gatson was meant
to comfort his training partner, but it actually underscored the
pressure facing gymnasts at the U.S. Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is in first place, Gatson 19th entering tonight's finals.
Only the top 14 will advance to the Olympic trials in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it's not over,'' said Wilson, who has a commanding
1.2-point lead over Sean Townsend. ``We still have six more events.
With people falling left and right, all he has to do is be in the
top 14. And a lot of these guys haven't seen a trials like Boston.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot more missed routines there.''
</P>
<P>
   The four gymnasts with the top combined scores from here (40
percent) and Boston (60 percent) will make the Olympic team, plus
two others selected by coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Gatson was leading at nationals last year when he blew out his
knee on his high-bar dismount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle he's here,'' said his coach Ron Brant, who
coaches at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.
``He was at the top and now has to fight back. It's tough in an
Olympic year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Thornton of Augusta is in 13th place, and trying not only to
hang on, but to improve his position. Thornton had a tough time on
his first event, parallel bars, but regrouped. In 1996, he barely
advanced to the Olympic trials, then performed well and placed
ninth. Thornton was so encouraged that he stuck around four more
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep improving,'' said Thornton, who also
trains with Wilson and Gatson. ``I'll use this to motivate me and
keep plugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a 1996 Olympian, said he felt a little tired, ``But I
wasn't overly tired. I got to the point where I got so relaxed that
I let a couple of things go, which I shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely don't want to give away tenths of points.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1999 World Championships, Wilson finished one-thousandth
of a point out of third place in the all-around.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he watched the scoreboard and knew that
two-time Olympian John Roethlisberger was only .4 behind after
three events.
</P>
<P>
   But Roethlisberger, who at age 30 would be one of the oldest
male gymnasts ever to compete for the U.S. team at the Olympics,
fell twice on floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed? That's the understatement of the night,'' said
Roethlisberger, who is fifth.

FOR PENTAGON, GOP CONVENTION IS CHANCE TO PUT ON A SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a policy prohibiting military involvement
in partisan politics, members of Congress and guests at the
Republican National Convention will have an exclusive viewing of
some of the Pentagon's latest hardware, including an aircraft that
the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney,
tried to kill when he was defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing what a spokesman on Thursday called ``a convenient
opportunity'' to display some of its latest equipment, the Pentagon
asked the armed services to ship _ at taxpayer expense _ weapons
and other equipment to the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for
what amounts to a three-day military trade show, beginning
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, the only Republican in
President Clinton's Cabinet, approved the display after receiving a
written request earlier this month from Rep. Curt Weldon, a
Republican from suburban Philadelphia and senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen did so, officials said, only after the Pentagon was
assured that the hardware _ and more than 150 service members
accompanying it _ would not be used for any political activities.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, the assistant secretary of defense for
legislative affairs, John K. Veroneau, sent Weldon a letter
outlining certain conditions: in short, no photo opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the display will be a centerpiece of a series of events
organized by Weldon for about 100 Republican colleagues and their
families, who will be staying in old Navy billets at the shipyard
during the convention at the First Union Center, less than a mile
away. Included in the festivities, closed to the public, will be a
``block party'' fund-raiser by Weldon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is awkward,'' said Charles Lewis, executive
director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit group in
Washington. ``All this sexy, multibillion-dollar hardware there to
impress delegates is very smarmy and probably inappropriate. If
there isn't a rule against this, it seems to me there ought to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's role has even raised hackles among some military
officers, who complained that, at best, it blurs the definition of
what constitutes political activity. ``To say this is not a
partisan event is borderline absurd,'' one officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the Pentagon complained that the cost would have to
come out of their own budgets, at a time they face spot shortages
of money for readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those misgivings, some of the services now appear to
regard the display as a chance to do a little lobbying of their
own. ``There's not a lot of enthusiasm for this,'' another official
said, ``but if they're ordered to do it, they want to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the aircraft to be displayed is the V-22 Osprey, which has
crashed three times in the past decade. It is a hybrid with rotors
that swivel so it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a
turboprop commuter plane. The Osprey has been beset by controversy
over cost and mission as well as safety, and Cheney waged a long
and unsuccessful battle against it when he was in the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the V-22, the Marines are sending an amphibious
vehicle and equipment for its chemical- and biological-attack
response teams. The Air Force plans to include an unmanned
surveillance aircraft, the Predator, as well as missiles and bombs
and story boards promoting its newest fighter, the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, not to be outdone, has mobilized a virtual armory of
equipment, including an Apache attack helicopter, its own unmanned
aircraft and its troubled theater missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania National Guard is contributing an M1-A1 tank,
an armored personnel carrier and two more helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Navy is sending only an aging Sea Sprite
helicopter from a nearby reserve unit, two surveillance vehicles
and a small riverine boat.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Thursday that it was too soon to put a
cost on moving all the equipment to Philadelphia, though the Air
Force estimated that its share would be at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, spent much of a news
conference Thursday defending the display. Bacon said that the
events at the shipyard were an opportunity to provide what amounted
to a briefing to lawmakers _ without mentioning lobbyists and other
influential Republicans who might happen by _ but maintained that
the display was not itself partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican
National Convention,'' he said. ``It's not adjacent _ it's not
right on the grounds where the convention is being held. It's
nearby, but not on the grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also noted that Rep. Robert A. Brady, a Democrat whose
district includes the shipyard, supported the request, though he
did not sign Weldon's request to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon's spokesman, Pete Peterson, said the congressman saw the
shipyard, which is in the process of being closed and turned over
for private development, as a convenient and secure location for
his colleagues during the convention. Weldon, he said, was also
eager to promote the shipyard's activities.
</P>
<P>
   So is Richard A. Goldbach, the chairman and chief executive of
Metro Machines, one of the largest military contractors at the
shipyard. His company is erecting a tent to highlight its work,
which includes ship rebuilding and demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure and simple a promotion,'' Goldbach said.

GOP, CITY OF PHILADELPHIA SEE DIFFERENT GOALS AT COMMON EVENT --
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With presidential running mates inspired by the
wide open spaces of the West, the Republican Party polished themes
for its national convention Thursday in a city that hopes to bury
its image as a tattered victim of urban decay in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized electricians, who plug Democrats in every political
argument, plugged in equipment at the convention site while wearing
savvy T-shirts. ``Republican . . . for a week,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP put some of the final touches on the schedule for its
four-day convention, which starts Monday and features the
nomination of Texas Gov. George W. Bush to succeed President
Clinton. For instance, party officials said retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the Persian Gulf War commander, will speak to the
convention Tuesday via a video signal from the decks of the
battleship USS New Jersey on the Delaware River nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 war, in which troops from the United States and other
nations expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait, is emerging as a
sub-theme of the convention. Wednesday, when voting by delegates is
expected to award Bush the presidential nomination, is the 10th
anniversary of Iraq's invasion of its neighbor nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, introduced this week as Bush's running mate, ran
the Pentagon as defense secretary during the Persian Gulf War,
which started six months after the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who was between Cheney and
Schwarzkopf in the military heirarchy as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, will also address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor's father, President Bush, reached the
height of his political popularity when he prosecuted the war
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The former president will
be honored Tuesday as one of the Republican Party's three living
past presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's campaign staff has prevailed on the party to
make the convention high-minded by muting the traditional insults
against Democrats, officials announced a convention feature that
will cast some sidelight onto Republican efforts to defeat Hillary
Rodham Clinton in New York's U.S. Senate election:
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Card, convention co-chairman and former secretary of
transportation, said Monday's emphasis on education issues will
include a speech by New York congressional candidate Joan Johnson.
She is seeking the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, who
is running for Senate against the first lady. If elected, Johnson
would be the first Republican black woman in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have talked about soaking up their conservatism
from the frontier culture of their childhood home towns. Bush, born
in Connecticut, lived in Midland, Texas, until he became a
teen-ager and moved to Houston. Nebraska-born Cheney grew up in
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   They will be adored and sent into political battle from a
convention in a contrasting environment _ Comcast-Spectacor First
Union Center, a sports arena in South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   In a city known for ethnic diversity, blue-collar living and
Democratic loyalty, South Philly is known as the zone for
Italian-American traditions and cheese-steak sandwiches _
delicacies that pack enough cholesterol to probably send Cheney, a
survivor of three heart attacks, running the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, known as the City of Brotherly Love, now calls
itself ``the city that loves you back.'' The metropolis, slightly
smaller than Houston in population, wants the convention glow to
obscure national images of its slums, formerly high unemployment
rate and infamous clashes between citizens and police. So cheery
greeters and promotional literature told GOP visitors and others
Thursday about the city's cultural amenities, the financial
rejuvenation of its downtown sector and the growth of its hotel
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Around the convention hall Thursday, however, the most often
heard phrase from local workers was a simple regionalism: ``Yo.''
</P>
<P>
   As delegates started streaming in for preliminary meetings and
receptions, downtown Philadelphia sported bunting, special lighting
and promotional signs Thursday. Workers applied fresh paint and
made repairs at the subway stop closes to the convention site,
which serves as a basketball and hockey arena.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolic of the city's effort to put on a fetching face, workers
atop a crane placed new letters spelling out First Union Center on
the side of the building Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention hall, the name of Comcast, a
communications and cable TV company that manages the arena, loomed
large. ``Welcome to Comcast Country,'' said a sign over the
convention podium. And QVC, the shopping channel owned by Comcast,
was setting up a mobile studio from which to hawk convention
souvenirs on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The podium, still under construction Thursday, features three
video screens framed by a mixture of curved, dark and light woods _
a clash of modern media and a retro, Ethan Allen furniture look.
While some workers projected a color test pattern onto the video
screens, others hoisted nets full of balloons up to the ceiling for
use in the convention-closing celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The arena will accommodate the 4,150 GOP delegates and
alternates, hundreds of VIPs and volunteers and some of the 15,000
news media personnel on hand.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive round of receptions and parties is on tap at many
sites throughout the city. Dick Clark, who started his American
Bandstand TV show here, will provide the entertainment at two
parties. Frankie Avalon, Chubby Checker and Bobby Rydell, native
Philadelphians all, will sing.
</P>
<P>
   Getting down to official business Thursday, the Republican
National Committee _ similar to a board of directors _ voted to
overhaul the way the GOP presidential nominee is picked starting in
2004. But the plan must be adopted by the party Rules Committee and
then a majority of delegates before it can take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The commitee endorsed a plan to junk the chock-a-block schedule
of primaries that Bush endured in the spring and substitute an
orderly schedule in which small states vote in a group and large
states vote last. The proposal, known as the Delaware Plan, might
undercut New Hampshire's traditional first-in-the-land primary.
Bush has not endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have scheduled myriad events, including marches,
rallies and a display at the Liberty Bell of thousands of shoes _ a
silent demonstration against gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the faction groups _ from gun safety advocates, and
abortion rights supporters to welfare and health cause supporters _
have formed into one coalition called the R2K Network.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers were setting up shop, bringing in food and water and
helping the 10,000 expected each day to find places to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group are from the same organizations that virtually
shut down Seattle during the World Trade Organization talks last
year. But most of their literature promotes nonviolent disruptions
and one spokesman said all the groups have talked since Seattle and
have promised no property destruction. But R2K member David Levy
said it doesn't mean that some demonstrators won't stray.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia police commissioner John Timoney reassured his
citizens and the rest of the nation Thursday that his department
was ready to handle whatever happened, adding he has been working
with all the groups to try to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney has continued to deny his officers will use tear gas
unless there is an extreme situation and then only if he or two
deputy commissioners give the OK first. His officers will carry
pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said no peaceful disruptions _ such as human blockades _
will automatically be doused with pepper spray, nor will arrests be
automatic for protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice it to say that when they (the officers) do react it
will be under the supervision of a sergeant, lieutenant or a
captain and then only in a team fashion,'' Timoney said.

GATES FOUNDATION GIVES $44.7B TO FIGHT TB 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates's philanthropic foundation has
decided to make the largest private donation ever for fighting the
spread of tuberculosis, awarding a $44.7 million grant to a group
of Harvard doctors and medical scholars guided by a vision of
social justice to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year grant, to be announced formally in the next few
days, will go to Harvard Medical School's program in infectious
disease and social change. The program, an outgrowth of the
nonprofit Partners in Health group, will use the money to treat
drug-resistant TB in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will mark the first time any organization has tried
to eliminate the mutating strains of the deadly disease in an
entire Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when health specialists and Western
governments, most notably the Clinton administration, have grown
increasingly concerned that sicknesses of the developing world are
spreading to the most privileged because of a huge jump in global
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world now has to figure out whether it can contain
outbreaks of multiple drug-resistant TB,'' said Bill Foege, a
senior adviser to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Foege said the foundation was impressed by the work of Partners
in Health and its founding doctors, Paul Farmer and Jim Kim, on
controlling drug-resistant TB in Peru. Foege said the hope is that
the ``new demonstration project can then be taken to its logical
conclusion and expanded to other countries around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who attended Harvard for only one year before dropping
out, has earmarked $1.9 billion for global health projects in the
last two years. The foundation hopes to spend about $550 million a
year on international health.
</P>
<P>
   For Partners in Health, which began in a tiny Cambridge, Mass.
office 13 years ago, the Gates's largesse will broaden their
influence among global health policy makers. The group has long
been led by Farmer, Kim and Boston philanthropist Thomas J. White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous step forward for us,'' said White, 80, who
has spent $3 million in recent years on fewer than 200
drug-resistant TB patients in Peru to prove that they _ and others
in poor countries _ could be cured. ``To go from $3 million to $45
million is pretty good. But what's really great is it means life
instead of death for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners in Health's mantra has been called an
``option-for-the-poor health care,'' an approach that addresses a
breadth of problems for the needy. The organization, which employs
more than 300 people, plans to continue current programs in Haiti,
the Chiapas region of Mexico and Roxbury on the theory that the
Gates money will cover costs for the Peru program.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, if it secures additional funding, Partners in Health
hopes to expand in areas of women's health, water protection,
surgical services, and pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of controlling tuberculosis will clearly take up
more of its focus now.
</P>
<P>
   TB, which kills more people than any other infectious disease,
is a bacterium with wings, spread by a sneeze or a cough. The bug
develops resistance to the most common anti-TB drugs when a person
takes only part of antibiotic regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Multidrug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB, has multiplied in recent
years, including in the former Soviet states, where prisons have
become breeding grounds for the disease due to lack of funds for TB
treatment. In Russia's prisons, 25 percent of all inmates have
drug-resistant TB. And 30 percent of all Russian prisoners,
including those with TB, are released every year.
</P>
<P>
   As in other countries, a chief worry in Russia is the meeting
ground of HIV/AIDS and drug-resistant TB, a cocktail that spikes
the death rate exponentially when a person's depleted immune system
cannot fight the aggressive TB bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get MDR-TB under control now, it will simply
continue to grow,'' said Kim, the grant's author and principal
investigator. ``Once HIV and MDR-TB meet each other in other areas,
as it has been in South Africa and other places, we are going to
have a problem of TB that will be unmanageable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peru program's goal is to treat every drug-resistant TB
patient. Partners in Health's sister organization in Peru, Socios
En Salud, will be the main executing arm of the grant. It will
train hundreds of local health workers on proper diagnosis and
administration of the TB drugs. It is a complex task, involving up
to two years of taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard doctors also will explore two separate avenues of
treatment in Peru with an eye toward exporting the program to other
nations: developing state-of-the-art therapies to diagnose the
resistance almost overnight; and exploring less technical ways of
treating the disease by learning more about how resistance
develops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Farmer and Kim decided to investigate drug-resistant TB
in Peru after one of their relief workers returned from there with
the bug and died. The group found an outbreak in the northern Lima
slum of Carabayllo and began to treat the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year later, the World Health Organization said in a
publication: ``In developing countries, people with
multidrug-resistant TB usually die, because effective treatment is
often impossible in poor settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners proved it was possible in Carabayllo, thanks to White's
pocketbook: He gave about $12,000 a patient per year, an almost
unheard of sum for treatment of the poor in the developing world.
Since then, due largely to the program's success, the price of
treating such patients has fallen dramatically, to $400 to $4,000
per patient, depending on the mix of antibiotics. Overall, such
medicines have fallen by 90 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he hoped that the new Peru program, which will also
include the WHO and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as subcontractors, an arrangement that was perhaps
unthinkable not so long ago. The Task Force for Child Survival and
Development of Atlanta will coordinate the coalition and develop a
global strategy to fight drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the treatment of MDR-TB much more
straightforward and standardized around the world,'' he said. ``In
the process, we will bring down the price of drugs, bring down the
price of diagnostics. . . . So instead of waiting two months for a
culture result to come back, which is way too much time, we hope to
utilize new technology to give us the answers in a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he said, ``the place to do this kind of research and
operation is a place where there are TB patients, a lot of TB
patients. We think Peru will be a good place to test new drugs, new
diagnostics and show under pressure, in a real live clinic, that we
can treat these patients.''

 &HT;    Fiery crash kills 1, shuts Florida Turnpike
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A gasoline tanker driver who authorities say
may have dozed at the wheel Thursday morning crashed the truck,
then tried to crawl out but got only a few feet before he was
engulfed in 2,000-degree flames.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker, containing 8,900 gallons of gasoline, burned for
more than two hours, shutting down Florida's Turnpike west of Boca
Raton at the heart of rush hour and delaying or rerouting tens of
thousands of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Wayne Baynard, 39, of suburban Fort Lauderdale, who'd
been delivering gasoline since about 1 a.m. Thursday, was killed
about 6:20 a.m., the Florida Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the best we can under the circumstances,''
Baynard's wife, Elaine, said Thursday evening from her home.
Baynard had two daughters, 22 and 15, a son, 13, and a 4-year-old
grandson, his wife said. She said the danger of hauling gasoline
was often on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like it, but he felt comfortable with his job,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the how the accident occurred, according to a Highway
Patrol report and FHP Lt. Sammie Thomas:
</P>
<P>
   Baynard was northbound on the turnpike when his Kenan Transport
truck drifted into the left lane, then veered sharply into the
right lane. The 2000 Mack truck struck the left rear panel of a
white 2000 Dodge pickup parked on the right shoulder. Alan Keith
Fox, 38, of Coral Springs had just climbed back into the truck
after fixing a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup, its rear smashed, flew through the air, landing
about 20 feet away, while Baynard's tanker slid over on its side
and across the shoulder, coming to rest against two trees.
</P>
<P>
   Baynard's body was found about five feet from the cab; Thomas
said authorities surmise he survived the crash and tried to crawl
away, only to be consumed by the fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tallon, an operations manager for the Tru-Green land-care
firm, came across the wreck seconds later. He pulled his 2000 Ford
pickup between the two vehicles and ran to the tanker. He heard the
engine racing and tried to find the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``the thing just ignited. It sparked from
under the cab first. As soon as I saw the spark, I had to run
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallon, 51, said he was less than 10 feet away when he heard ``a
couple of small pops. There was fuel all over the ground. In a
couple of minutes, it was in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Tallon's truck; the fire melted its front.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was eerily familiar for Tallon; several years ago
the exact same thing happened to him in Ohio. There he also was
unable to save the driver from a fiery death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel kind of helpless,'' he said. ``You try to help
somebody. But when I saw the fire, I was alarmed for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   About 27 Palm Beach County firefighters and a dozen of their
vehicles were on the scene in minutes, but were driven back by the
flames, estimated at 2,000 degrees at their heart and 200 degrees
even 100 yards away. District chief Richard Lounsbury said
firefighters decided to let the fire burn, because it couldn't do
much more damage than it already had, and putting it out might just
make it spark up again unexpectedly. Also, firefighters believed
burning off the gasoline would do less environmental damage than
extinguishing the fire and letting the unburned gas soak into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
came to the scene to test the ground. Firefighters also worried
about a natural gas line directly under the tanker, but said it was
three feet underground and well insulated and they decided it was
not in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was finally doused about 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 a.m., firefighters were still spraying foam on the
smoldering wreck. The tanker, valued by the highway patrol at
$70,000, lay in two pieces between the two now-scorched trees.
</P>
<P>
   Baynard had been a trucker for 10 years and worked for Kenan
Transport for six years, his wife said. She said his assignment was
to deliver gasoline to individual service stations starting about 1
a.m. By 6 a.m. he would have delivered his third or fourth load,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Transportation records show Baynard has not
been involved in any accidents during the past year and his
employer has a good overall safety record, DOT Lt. Kenny Morris
said.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Little more than two weeks ago, Dick Cheney
visited Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee in his office on Capitol Hill,
and Frist made his pitch, explaining why his experience as a heart
surgeon who had managed life-and-death situations made him the
right man to accompany Gov. George W. Bush along the inevitably
rocky, tense road to Election Day and perhaps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, listened intently. It was his job to supervise the Texas
governor's hunt for a running mate, and he had arranged to meet
Frist.
</P>
<P>
   Within several days, Bush flew to the Northeast and met twice
with Gov. George Pataki of New York, discussing a possible place
for Pataki on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   For all this tantalizing activity, it now appears that Cheney
had at the time already emerged as a leading candidate _ and
perhaps the leading candidate _ for the slot he had been assigned
to help fill. Cheney and Bush had discussed the possibility July 3
at Bush's ranch near Crawford, about 90 miles of here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheney's own candidacy was moving along a track so secret
that some of the other politicians on the list of seemingly serious
prospects had no idea that Bush was settling on Cheney until they
learned it from newspaper and television reports less than 72 hours
before Bush formally announced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans who discussed the vice-presidential
selection with Bush over the past two weeks, among them Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, said that the Texas governor had not let on
that he was considering the head of his search committee for the
post. He also did not inquire about how such a selection might
play, even as he reviewed with them the qualifications of other
potential candidates on his list.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the final days, when Cheney's selection was almost
assured, the vacuum allowed what turned out to be entirely
unfounded reports _ that Colin Powell and John McCain had turned up
as last-minute additions to Bush's short list of candidates _ to
gain widespread coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is an immensely respected political veteran, and his
selection elicited praise from many Republicans. But the unusual
way in which the former defense secretary arrived at Bush's side at
a news conference here on Tuesday to announce the vice-presidential
selection has stirred concern among some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They have noted with alarm the attacks Democrats were able to
quickly muster on Cheney's conservative voting record in Congress,
and questioned whether the man in charge of screening the other
candidates for the job could possibly have received as thorough a
screening himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they vet?'' a senior Republican strategist with
experience in national campaigns asked Thursday. ``That he went to
college? They really got their ears pinned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Cheney's ties to former President George Bush have
provoked renewed speculation about the influence of Bush's father
on his son's presidential campaign. In a telephone interview
Thursday that represented his first public comments on the search
process, President Bush said: ``What I see emerging is that the old
guy drove the choice. That is absolutely inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that he spoke regularly with his son about
the search and gave his opinions on various candidates, including
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was asked if he spoke directly to Cheney and urged
him to think about taking the job, Bush said, ``I cannot reveal
whether I did or didn't. Not wanting to obfuscate, but put this
down to obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please respect my age _ 76,'' he continued. ``I'm forgetful.''
Asked if that meant that he had forgotten whether he spoke with
Cheney, his response suggested that the two men had talked, perhaps
because Cheney was soliciting opinions about vice presidential
contenders and the former president knew many of these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into what I talked to Dick Cheney or
anybody else about,'' President Bush said. ``You've got to put it
in the context of what Dick Cheney was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his son's advisers, the review of Cheney's
credentials and background materials was conducted somewhat outside
of the process that Cheney had established for the rest of the
field, and it proceeded at a much speedier pace. Within minutes
after Cheney's selection was announced on Tuesday, Democrats
produced a trove of extremely conservative votes from Cheney's
decade in Congress, and the barrage of questions about his record
that hit Cheney and the Bush campaign seemed to take them at least
partly by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
Thursday about several votes that he cast in opposition to gun
control, Cheney said, ``Well, I'd have to go back and dig into that
in detail.'' In a previous interview on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
Cheney seemed a bit surprised by similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and his aides have declined to provide any
more than rudimentary details about the vetting of vice
presidential prospects, including Cheney, but said that all of them
had been carefully noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I knew his votes,'' Bush said during a brief news
conference at the governor's mansion here Thursday. ``But I also
know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who
all they do is spend time tearing people down. And they're going to
give it their level best trying to tear Dick Cheney down, but
they're not going to be able to do so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that most Americans already knew and
respected Cheney as a result of his role as defense secretary
during the Persian Gulf War. ``Secretary Cheney brought people
together and helped to win a war, which stands in stark contrast
with Vice President Al Gore, who tens to divide people to create
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his aides, Bush declined to be interviewed for this
article. Cheney did not respond to several requests for an
interview about the search process that were made through Bush's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with Republicans who spoke with Cheney and Bush
these past few weeks, including a number of men who were told they
were on the short list of potential vice presidential candidates,
suggest that they underwent a process that was different then the
one Cheney endured. It is these differences that account for the
murmurs of concern among some Republicans who have watched Cheney's
first few turbulent days as a candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney took charge of reviewing financial histories and
interviewing candidates, Bush himself attended to that chore in
Cheney's case. While Cheney researched the voting records of the
other vice presidential prospects, the task of assessing Cheney's
political past fell to Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager.
(Allbaugh also did not return a call for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates began submitting their voluminous paper
work in mid-May, in some cases shipping boxes of documents to
Cheney, the examination of Cheney apparently began little more than
a week before Bush called him and offered him the job.
</P>
<P>
   And while at least 11 Republicans filled out an extraordinarily
detailed, 83-question form, including inquiries ranging from
plagiarism to recreational drug use, Bush's senior advisers were
unable to say if Cheney had taken the same formal step, though they
noted that Cheney's background had been reviewed when he was named
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``Secretary Cheney told
me he subjected himself to the same kind of scrutiny,'' Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But unexplained oddities about the vetting of Cheney lingered.
According to one Republican official, the name of his daughter, Liz
Cheney, a lawyer, was on the return address of the materials that
another candidate received, and she helped place calls late last
week to round up the weekend phone numbers of other vice
presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Liz Cheney's possible role in helping to screen
candidates, including her father, Hughes said that except for Dick
Cheney, Bush and Allbaugh, ``I am not able to discuss others who
were involved in the vetting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said on ``Good Morning America'' that there was no
cause for concern about the unusual way in which he came to be
selected. Referring to Bush, he said: ``The fact of the matter is
that we spent a lot of time _ and again, remember my original
advice to him was, you know, we're going to find you a great
candidate, but I'd rather not be a candidate myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we went through the process in terms of talking about
my health and my record and my business career and so forth, we
reviewed all those things between the two of us as we went forward
and before we made the decision, before he made the decision that
he wanted me to be a candidate,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore has seemed
genuinely invigorated by the news of Cheney's selection. Aides to
the vice president were churning out reams of documents about
Cheney's legislative background literally from the moment Bush
concluded the formal announcement of Cheney's selection.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of what is arguably the most important political
decision Bush has made in his presidential campaign to date may
never be known. The lack of information has prompted questions
among some some Republicans about whether many of the politicians
whose names were publicly floated as possible running mates for
Bush were ever in serious contention.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said in an interview that he had told aides on July 5 that
he did not want to be considered for the race; nonetheless, Bush
himself continued to encourage speculation that he was considering
Ridge when he campaigned with the Pennsylvania governor in
Pittsburgh a week later. Similarly, by the time Bush met with
Pataki on July 14 _ an encounter that his aides readily confirmed _
Cheney, who has a history of heart attacks, had completed a medical
examination in New York and reported to Bush that he had been given
a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ridge and Pataki are supporters of abortion rights, unlike
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who is a staunch opponent of abortion, had been pitching
in with the governor's presidential campaign from the beginning.
Last year, he helped Bush assemble the team of foreign policy
advisers for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was natural that in mid-March, after Bush
effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, he
asked Cheney if he wanted to be considered as a possible running
mate. Cheney said no, but, weeks later, agreed to supervise the
search process.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, hundreds of letters were sent to Republican
officials to get their advice. At least 11 prospective candidates
received questionnaires and requests for documents. There was no
hint yet that Cheney's professed resistance to considering the job
was softening, Bush's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 27, just six days before Cheney visited Bush's ranch
and indicated a possible willingness to be Bush's running mate, his
name popped up during a gathering of former members of his father's
presidential administration at the Bush family compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine. Those present included President Bush; his
former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and his former
director of presidential personnel, Chase Untermeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer recalled that as these men and others sat around a
table on the back porch, Bush asked in a lighthearted manner who
they thought should be his son's vice presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost in the sense of a parlor game, as if he were
asking, ``Who do you think will win the Masters?''' Untermeyer said
in one of two telephone interviews this week. He said the name that
came up most often was Ridge's.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Untermeyer said, someone brought up Cheney's
name, and someone else said he was not interested. According to
Untermeyer, Scowcroft then said that Cheney had recently indicated
to him that he might be willing to take the job after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression was that President Bush was very interested to
hear that and took it aboard as if it was an important fact to
know,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scowcroft and President Bush both made telephone calls to a
reporter Thursday to dispute the accuracy of that account.
Scowcroft said that before the Kennebunkport meeting, he had run
into Cheney and teased him about being the perfect vice
presidential prospect. Scowcroft said that he merely shared that
story with President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush said that he did not press the idea of Cheney on
his son. ``Am I high on Cheney?,'' the former president said.
``Absolutely. Was I high on others? Absolutely. Did I talk to
George when he called to go over stuff? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Less then a week later, Bush revisited Cheney's initial
objections with him at the ranch, and Cheney began to budge.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11th, Hughes said, he got his medical examination. On
July 15 he and Bush informed Bush's senior advisers that he was in
the running, and his vetting began, according to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days later, the job was his.

`THE HAMMER' HAMMERS MILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In front of a bunch of entertainment media writers recently in
Pasadena, Calif., new ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Dennis
Miller quipped:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to go right now. I've got two weeks and I'm
going to use them. I'm going to load myself up with statistics and
information, then try to forget about them and put it all on a
deeper level.''
</P>
<P>
   That, by the way, is a joke, although many in that group didn't
grasp it.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, your two weeks are up, cha cha.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's otherwise meaningless exhibition exercise _ the Hall of
Fame Game between San Francisco and New England in Canton, Ohio _
signals both the beginning of pro football on TV this season (Arena
League doesn't count) and an immediate spotlight on Don Ohlmeyer's
hiring skills.
</P>
<P>
   Will Miller's sports-broadcasting debut be an immediate hit or
will he become the next Fred ``The Hammer'' Williamson?
</P>
<P>
   Which makes us wonder. ... What does the one-time ``MNF''
analyst _ who lasted the 1974 exhibition slate and just two
regular-season games before he was canned for pulling Howard
Cosell's toupee off his head on camera _ think about this latest
attempt to bring the glory of Monday nights back to television?
</P>
<P>
   On his new Web site (www.fredwilliamsondirect.com), recently
launched by Santa Monica, Calif.-based Athletic Direct as part of
their ``legends'' Internet home pages, ``The Hammer'' nails home a
few points of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange bedfellow,'' Williamson writes about Miller and
``MNF.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(I think they went after a comedian because) they failed at
everything else and decided to try something new. They failed so
bad that they had to bring back (producer) Don Ohlmeyer ... and his
first job was to do something questionable. It'll tell itself in
the first two games and we'll know right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the fans should be a little insulted (by Miller's
hiring). I think that you should bring people to the forefront that
have not only some knowledge of the game but also some experience
in the game. Bringing Dan Fouts was a good thing. He doesn't give
you too much information and doesn't make it seem like you are
watching radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of names up for the position that I didn't
really like. I mean, go after some coaches or players. Go after
somebody that has played the game. What can Dennis Miller bring to
the table except something funny? That's not why we watch `Monday
Night Football.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he is funny, but if
you are going to question that, then he doesn't have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, a defensive back with Pittsburgh, Oakland and Kansas
City in his eight-year career that ended in the late '60s, also
reveals that the only reason he took the ``MNF'' job was the
network offered him a three-picture deal to produce, direct and
star in their ``Movie of the Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone ought to check Miller's contract. And Al Michaels'
hairpiece.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMERALL'S SOMERSAULT: The only thing kinda certain about Pat
Summerall's future with Fox Sports is that he signed a one-year
contract extension through the 2001 season, which includes the 2002
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's retiring after that, even he's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   Which only slightly contradicts a Fox press release and hastily
called press conference Monday in Century City to announce that
Summerall's ``remarkable and legendary NFL broadcasting career ...
will come to an end with Fox's telecast of Super Bowl XXXVI in
January 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall said the only real news involved the fact that would
be his 50th year in pro football (10 as a player, 40 as a
broadcaster) and doing his 16th Super Bowl (eighth with John
Madden) would be ``a perfect way to cap it.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect way to cap it? How about retiring 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, ELFI? NBC's tape-delayed highlights from
this weekends' U.S. Gymnastics Championships in St. Louis (Saturday
at 8 p.m. PDT, Sunday at 7 p.m. PDT) gives Vanessa Atler of Canyon
Country, Calif., a chance for some prime TV exposure before the
U.S. Olympic team is determined by coach Bela Karyoli next month
following the trials in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   NBC gymnastics analyst Elfi Schlegel, speaking by phone Thursday
from the meet, says no one is a shoo-in for the women's six spots
on the U.S. team going to Sydney, but ``if you asked my
professional opinion, yes, Vanessa's too talented to not be on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her gymnastics will be rewarded if she shows that powerful
side in her. I'm sure that will be appreciated. She's an athlete
that makes you sit up and go, `Wow, that's pretty awesome.' I
marvel at her athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's on a comeback and couldn't pick a better time to do it.
So far, she's looked great.''
</P>
<P>
   STUFF WE REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW: On Thursday's episode of
ESPN's ``Great Outdoor Games,'' chances are you missed watching a
quartet of Border collies shatter the 16-second mark _ 15.98 _ in
the sporting dog ``flyball'' event.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   And just so you know before Saturday's coverage of the retriever
trials, ESPN points out in a press release that Barry Lyons of
Pineville, La., had to make a late substitution with his entry.
``Sheet'' was sent in as a replacement for ``Dallas,'' who couldn't
compete.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Two weeks before the event, she went into heat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- Remarkably, the Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers are the top
choice of both Turner and NBC to start their coverage of the NBA
starting next season. On opening night, which falls on Halloween,
the Lakers-Blazers have a date on TBS (after it shows the
76ers-Knicks). On NBC's opener, the traditional Christmas Day
doubleheader, it's again the Lakers-Blazers in the back end (after
the Pacers face the Magic). As for regular-season telecasts, TNT
has 52 games, NBC has 33 and TBS has 28. The Lakers make 11
appearances on NBC, plus 15 on either TNT or TBS. The Clippers?
They have one national exposure Dec. 20 vs. Minnesota on TNT. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- A big, black beard hiding the baby face of ESPN ``SportsCenter''
anchor Bob Ley. Takes some intestinal fortitude to sprout one of
them things in the middle of a humid Bristol, Conn., summer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
-- Monday marks the fifth anniversary of Disney announcing the
acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC (which includes ABC Sports and
ESPN) for $19 billion. And it's still a small world after all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The reputation of KCOP Channel 13 sportscaster Michelle Bonner. Is
she really a witch to work with or are the station cameramen just a
buncha oversensitive, unprofessional crybabies? The ongoing drama
has taken form at Ron Fineman's Web site ``On the Record''
(www.ronfineman.com). Two weeks ago, Fineman, a local radio
reporter who critiques the media, ran an item about an unnamed
source who accused Bonner of being demeaning and difficult to work
with. Last week, Bonner, who arrived at KCOP from Houston last
summer, responded by saying ```demeaning' is probably not the right
word,'' that ``in all my experiences in the business, I have never
worked with so many that don't seem to want to work'' and ``I'm not
about to change my work ethic to win a popularity contest.'' So
this week, two former KCOP cameramen had equally pointed responses.
One, Steve Field, wondered ``how confused you must be in that
pretty, bleached blonde head of yours to write such complete crap
about the shortcomings of professionals whom you still must work
with.'' And as for the word ``demeaning,'' ``you are often so rude
and curt in your manner, I would upgrade your snottiness to
`abusive','' wrote Field, who mentions that he won three local Emmy
awards before he left the station as a freelancer. Fineman has
asked for some pro-Bonner responses to run next week and try to
balance out this saga. Don't hold your breath. &QL;

CITY ZIP SHOWS HE ISN'T CHEAP ON SPEED
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., _ Before they even lined up for the 87th
running of the Sanford Stakes, Linda Rice was spotting D. Wayne
Lukas $1,941,000 and 13 years in experience. The colt she trains,
City Zip, was purchased for $9,000 last year as a yearling. His
colt, Yonaguska, was picked up for $1.9 million seven months ago as
a 2-year-old. Rice had a handful of important stakes races on her
resume; he had 13 Triple Crown victories and 20 national champions
on his.
</P>
<P>
   But it took only 1:10 3/5 of horse racing _ the time City Zip
clocked to win his second stakes race _ for Rice to show that
inexpensive does not mean slow and that inexperience is erased one
heat at a time. But up until the final yards of the six-furlong
sprint, Rice and City Zip were spotting Lukas and Yonaguska
lengths, too.
</P>
<P>
   After City Zip dueled the long shot Dancing Missile in a
blistering opening quarter mile in 21.03 seconds, Jose Santos put
the brakes on Rice's colt in such a dramatic way that the
36-year-old trainer thought they were out of the race. ``I was
nervous,'' Rice said. ``I thought we were in trouble, and it might
cost us the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But Santos, who was aboard City Zip 24 days ago in his Tremont
victory at Belmont, was confident that he knew his colt. ``Having
the rail forced me to use him on the pace early,'' Santos said.
``Moving toward the far turn, I decided to give him a little break
and took back.''
</P>
<P>
   The grinding down of gears allowed Yonaguska and Jerry Bailey to
gun wide around the turn and take a two-length lead. It looked like
enough for the undefeated son of Cherokee Run to grind down his
bargain basement rival just as he had done to City Zip in the Flash
Stakes last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I moved too soon,'' Bailey said. ``That middle move
tired him out. He was flat in the last furlong.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos, however, had plenty of run remaining in his horse. He
angled City Zip outside in the stretch and urged him with staccato
left-handed whips past the 3-5 favorite to the throaty delight of
the crowd of 15,668.
</P>
<P>
   When City Zip crossed the finish line a three-and-a-half-length
winner, his owners, Carl Bowling and Chuck Thompson, had won
$65,220 of the $108,700 purse, his backers had collected $8.40 on a
$2 bet and Rice had executed a giant upset in the Grade II race.
</P>
<P>
   Why had City Zip barely attracted cash in the sales ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of imperfections,'' Rice said. ``You can
criticize his appearance, but you can't be critical of him as a
race horse.''
</P>
<P>
   She is very likely to face Yonaguska in the Hopeful on Sept. 2.
Lukas, the Hall of Fame trainer, took the loss in stride. ``I think
we compromised our chances with the big middle move,'' he said.
``But hey, that is why we run them.''

TEXAS CONSERVATIVE LEADER CRITICIZES KOLBE'S ROLE AT CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By KAREN BROOKS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leader of one of Texas's most conservative Christian groups
criticized national Republican party officials on Thursday for
inviting a homosexual congressman to speak at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia next week.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Texas Gov. George Bush, who is expected to win
the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona
Rep. Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his
scheduled speech on free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, president of the Eagle Forum of Texas and a member
of the national party's platform committee, said the decision to
invite Kolbe directly contradicts the ``pro-family'' plank of the
GOP platform, which does not uphold the rights of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Adams stopped short of pulling her support from Bush, saying
``I'm not making any threats like that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``this is a quota. ... This is being done to
pander to the homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe is scheduled to address the convention about free trade
issues for three minutes on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay conservative
group, it will be the first time a homosexual man has spoken at the
GOP's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Adams sent an e-mail to about 500 people on Thursday _ delegates
and others _ from Philadelphia, where she is meeting with the
platform committee in preparation for next week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is crying,'' Adams wrote. ``I need your prayers for a
response that proclaims God-fearing wisdom. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypocritical to have that plank, then invite an open
homosexual to address our convention just because he's
homosexual,'' she wrote, referring to the pro-family plank in the
GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
   A Kolbe spokeswoman said she had not seen the letter and
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said the Congressman's sexual orientation ``is
not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that he'll be talking about the importance of
free trade and opening markets to American products and
producers,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
``Congressman Kolbe is a leader in promoting and encouraging free
and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   State party leaders agreed, saying Kolbe's sexual orientation is
``a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would respectfully disagree'' with Adams' characterization,
said Texas state party spokesman Robert Black. ``It appears that
Congressman Kolbe has decided that the broad issues that all
Republicans agree upon is more important than his homoseuxal rights
agenda, and that's why he has decided to speak at the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was criticized by Christian groups earlier this year after
meeting with Log Cabin Republicans and saying he welcomed them in
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Adams suggested the party invite conservative Alan Keyes, who
lost his bid for the nomination early in the primary season, to
speak on moral issues ``to save face with all the families across
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The epitome of that ability as an orator on moral and social
issues is Alan Keyes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes spokeswoman Connie Hair said his phone lines were down at
his home and he could not be reached for comment.

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SAY NEGOTIATIONS WILL RESUME NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 4th and 5th grafs to note that Barak's meeting in Egypt has
been postponed)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Amid a flurry of political and diplomatic moves on
both sides, Israel and the Palestinians made plain on Thursday that
they are eager to put the failed Camp David talks behind them and
move forward with a renewed peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides confirmed that negotiators would meet on Sunday at
the border of the Gaza Strip, and said that ideas floated at Camp
David by President Clinton _ including proposals that the
Palestinians rejected on the future of East Jerusalem _ have
carried the peace process further than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after completing their long flights home,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, laid out new travel plans suggesting that both
believe that some form of agreement _ perhaps only partial,
officials said, and possibly excluding the deal-breaking issue of
Jerusalem _ may yet be possible in the weeks and months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hectic round of consultations between Israeli
ministers and opposition leaders, suggesting that Barak's
beleaguered coalition government will survive a series of
parliamentary votes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was to fly to Egypt on Friday to meet with President Hosni
Mubarak, but later on Thursday he delayed that trip indefinitely;
his office cited scheduling difficulties. Arafat had stopped in
Alexandria on his way back from Camp David on Wednesday to brief
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian leader, a key player in Middle East peace moves for
two decades, is seen by both sides as crucial to the shape of any
eventual agreement _ especially on Jerusalem, the issue on which
the Camp David negotiations reportedly foundered on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, announced he would leave before the
weekend for a whistle-stop tour that will include talks with
President Jacques Chirac of France, long regarded as one of the
Western nations most sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and on
to meetings with a succession of unspecified Arab leaders. Arafat
has usually made such tours in the wake of major negotiating
sessions, but with the issue of Jerusalem now squarely on the
table, these briefings were certain to be more critical and
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the various trips and meetings reflected a sense that
something substantial, even historic, had occurred even though
Barak and Arafat came down out of Camp David seemingly
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, commentators said, the decision to return so rapidly
to the negotiating table reflected a recognition that the talks, in
particular the American ideas for a settlement in Jerusalem, have
swept the historic rivals into new political terrain that they must
now explore, and from which neither can easily retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The plan put forward by Clinton, as outlined by Israeli and
Palestinian officials who have spoken with reporters here, would
have established a complex mosaic of jurisdictions in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead Sher, one of Barak's top aides at Camp David, said the
president had proposed that Arafat have a presidential office in
the Muslim quarter of the walled Old City of Jerusalem, a move that
according to Israeli commentators would allow the Palestinians to
claim that they had fulfilled their pledge to establish the capital
of their new state in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israeli officials said that the American proposals had
provided for some of East Jerusalem's Arab quarters annexed to
other Palestinian territories outside the city and expanded to
establish a new city to be known as Al Quds, the historic Arabic
name for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, these officials said, the Palestinians would have
been given vaguely defined authority, short of sovereignty, over
the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City, control of the
Dome of the Rock and other Muslim holy places, and a new bridge
allowing Palestinians unhindered access to the Muslim holy places
from areas under their control to the east of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sher told Israel radio that the talks with Clinton opened a new
horizon in the peace effort, even if the Jerusalem proposals were
rejected by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that definitely yes, it's possible to finish the
conflict and reach a reasonable settlement in not too long a time
as long as there is talk between the sides,'' Sher said.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a senior Arafat aide at Camp David who has taken a
positive stance from the day the talks concluded, confirmed that he
would meet with Oded Eran, a senior Israeli negotiator, to renew
peace talks on Sunday at Erez, on the border between Israel and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating remarks that he made Wednesday on the ABC News program
``Nightline,'' Erekat told reporters in the West Bank city of
Jericho that ``many taboo subjects'' had been discussed at Camp
David for the first time, including Jerusalem, and that the two
sides were now ``closer than ever'' to ending their 52-year-old
conflict. ``I don't think our negotiations will ever be the same
after Camp David,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Erez meeting will follow one held there on Wednesday between
Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, and Tayeb Abdel
Rahim, a senior aide to Arafat, at which the two men discussed
joint efforts to prevent outbreaks of violence by Israelis or
Palestinians discontented by the events at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, officials pointed to the Wednesday talks as a
mark of how far the peace effort has come since the days when
orchestration of violent protests was a ready tactic for
Palestinian officials seeking to wring concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, a top Arafat official on the West Bank, told
reporters that neither side could gain from violence. ``We must
keep things quiet and wait until September,'' he said, referring to
the Sept. 13 date Arafat has set as the deadline for unilaterally
declaring an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The change of mood was not without its darker notes. Both Barak
and Arafat, in statements and through aides, continued to stake out
what in the parlance of the region are known as ``red lines'' _ the
limits of what the two sides publicly claim they can accept in any
final settlement on Jerusalem, on Jewish settlements, on the return
of Palestinian refugees and on other issues that have been left
unresolved in the stuttering process that began with the Oslo
agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for example, continued to insist at a sparsely attended
ally in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah on the West
Bank that ``there is not one among us who can give up a grain of
soil of noble Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Barak, since returning home, has been emphasizing
that Israel, by accepting key parts of the Clinton plan involving
Jerusalem, has escaped ever having to compromise sovereignty over
the city in any comprehensive way, and, in addition, has
established the principle of Israeli sovereignty over most of the
145 Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak's immediate challenge was to shore up his political
position at home, and the signs as he prepared for his journey to
Egypt were that his fractious, 14-month-old government would
survive a battery of three no-confidence votes in the Parliament on
Monday, as well as a separate vote on Wednesday in which opposition
groups will seek the dissolution of the parliament and a new
election.
</P>
<P>
   Head counts of voting intentions among more than a dozen
political parties and factions, combined with intensive new
contacts between Barak and two coalition parties that left the
government on the eve of the Camp David talks _ the religious Shas
party and the left-wing Meretz party _ suggested that Barak's
coalition, led by his One Israel movement, would survive by at
least a narrow majority.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, the parliament will adjourn for its summer
recess, giving Barak, if he survives, a respite from the constant
political challenges. Barak is also likely to elude an option that
some conservatives in the ruling coalition have urged on him in the
wake of the Camp David talks, the formation of a ``national unity
government'' with Likud, the right-wing opposition party led by
Ariel Sharon. That option appeared to be as good as dead on
Thursday after leading officials of One Israel and Likud pronounced
it unacceptable because of the harshly opposed stands the two
parties have taken on the peace effort.

KAZAKHSTAN IS SUSPECTED IN $100 MILLION OF OIL BRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland _ The Swiss authorities have blocked
Kazakhstan's government from access to bank accounts holding
roughly $100 million that they suspect Western oil companies may
have been used to bribe senior Kazakh officials, according to
officials with knowledge of the action.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss froze the accounts, the officials say, but Thursday
today a Swiss court lifted the blocking order on some accounts,
lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the court did not open the accounts to Kazakhstan,
because they remain subject to separate orders issued at the
request of the American law enforcement authorities, who have begun
their own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Kazakh government had petitioned the courts to remove the
freeze. Investigating magistrates in Geneva froze the accounts
between June and October of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The banks involved include Credit Agricole Indosuez, the Swiss
affiliate of a French bank, and Banque Pictet, a Geneva private
bank. One of largest accounts at the Banque Pictet held about $84
million that was unfrozen by the Swiss judicial order, but remained
off-limits to the Kazakh government because of the U.S. request,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the accounts were available for the benefit of the
Kazakh president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, as well as other officials
and members of their families, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that ``several dozen'' Kazakhstan accounts
had been turned up by the investigation, though most were accounts
of the Kazakh government and could not be frozen, and that fewer
than 10 were personal accounts of Kazakh officials or family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss officials said signers to some of the accounts
included James H. Giffen, a New York consultant for oil and other
trade deals in various regions of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Giffen, Mark J. MacDougal, said Thursday that the
allegations of wrongdoing were undercut by Thursday's Swiss
judicial order.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rulings by a court that has actually studied the
evidence confirms that funds owned by the Republic of Kazakhstan
have been wrongfully seized by Swiss authorities,'' MacDougal
said.``We hope that this is a first step in correcting the false
accusations directed toward the republic and Jim Giffen.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the U.S. Justice Department said it had asked the Swiss
for assistance in investigating the financial activities of Giffen,
who has been an important adviser to Nazarbayev.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Swiss authorities said a Geneva investigating magistrate,
Daniel Devaud, notified the Justice Department in January of
suspicions that the accounts were financed by U.S. and European oil
companies as bribes to Kazakh officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion, they said, was based at least partly on a pattern
of clandestine and circuitous routes by which the money came to
Switzerland, including foundations in Liechtenstein and shell
companies in Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials said that bank records showed that deposits had
been made by U.S. and European oil companies, and that they had
notified the Justice Department because of the likelihood that the
payments could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss officials said investigators in Geneva had identified
four large transactions, two of them involving U.S. companies, and
two others involving European oil companies they declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts were frozen after the Kazakh government asked the
Belgian authorities last year to investigate the assets in Belgium
of a political opponent of Nazarbayev, former Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin. In May the Belgians asked the Swiss for help
with their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials said account documents indicated that the money
in the Swiss accounts had been available for the benefit of
Nazarbayev, Kazhegeldin, 48, and Nurlan Balgimbayev, 52,
Kazhegeldin's successor as prime minister and now the top official
at Kazakhstan's state oil company.
</P>
<P>
   A June 12 Justice Department document identifies Giffen and his
Mercator Corp. of New York as being under investigation on
suspicion of improperly funneling to Kazakh officials money from
Phillips Petroleum Co.; the former Mobil Corp., now Exxon Mobil;
and the former Amoco Corp., now BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has said the oil companies are not a
subject of the inquiry. Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco have said they are
cooperating. Phillips has declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company officials have said they believe that the payments
were at least in part standard payments to governments for oil
contracts. The Russian news agency Interfax has quoted Balgimbayev
as saying: ``I am clean. I guarantee it.''

PLAYING FOR (POLITICAL) TIME ON CHINA TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Commerce Secretary William Daley laid down the
Clinton administration's strategy this past spring for forcing the
China trade bill through a reluctant Congress, he insisted
repeatedly that, win or lose, Congress had to vote before the
summer political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't want to be debating China during the heat of
the fall campaign,'' Daley said at the time. ``You do that and all
bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Daley has left the administration to head Al Gore's
presidential campaign and the China trade bill, having cleared the
House in May with seemingly unstoppable momentum, has become tied
up in the Senate's arcane maneuvering on the budget, efforts to
punish China for weapons proliferation, and general procedural
gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will adjourn on Friday for the summer having barely
begun to debate, much less vote, on the measure that Clinton
repeatedly called a national security priority and his top
remaining legislative goal.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Clinton administration and the Senate leadership expect
the bill to pass. The Senate voted 86-12 Thursday afternoon to open
a debate on China trade, overcoming a procedural hurdle to schedule
full consideration of the measure in early September. Nearly 70
senators are thought to support the bill itself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fears Daley expressed last spring over the fate of the
China bill have come true: It has become a political football, held
hostage while the White House and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
clashed over annual appropriations bills and while Democrats
focused on unrelated legislative goals. Meanwhile, the political
needs of the Gore campaign sidelined Daley from the White House
lobbying campaign to pass the trade bill, leaving Steven Richetti,
a less prominent political hand, in charge of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients' bill of rights is simply not an important matter
compared to the possibility of nuclear stand-off in Asia,'' said
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who has argued that the United
States could face a military confrontation with China if Congress
fails to approve permanent trade ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We _ and I mean the Democrats, the White House and the
Republicans _ simply do not recognize the weight of this matter,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that China remains one of
Clinton's foremost priorities. But since the bill passed the House,
the president and many of his top aides have been focused on other
issues that will shape his legacy, including brokering a Middle
East peace accord, rejecting Republican tax-cut initiatives and,
perhaps most of all, helping Gore become president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allowed Daley, who headed the aggressive lobbying effort
on behalf of the China bill from January to June, to resign to take
over Gore's lagging campaign. Richetti, the deputy White House
chief of staff who was Daley's partner in shepherding the China
bill through the House, was left to see it through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Richetti said the prospects for passage were good in September,
despite earlier concerns that Democrats might have a hard time
voting for a trade measure staunchly opposed by labor so soon
before a tight election. He urged Lott to stop using the China bill
as a legislative negotiating lever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is wide bipartisan support for this,'' Richetti said.
``It's far too important a national security and economic issue to
be used as a bargaining chip for other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Few fault Richetti's political skills or his attention to the
China trade issue. But several senators and business lobbyists who
support the China trade bill said Daley has been missed.
</P>
<P>
   Widely considered Clinton's best political strategist, Daley has
a no-nonsense style and, among Clinton administration officials, a
rare track record of working successfully with the Republican-led
Congress. He also demanded _ and was granted _ broad influence over
Clinton's schedule, arranging many public and private events to
show that the president had no higher priority than China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense of urgency in the House and then we lost it _
Daley leaving, the president had some other things, you had the
appropriations bills,'' said Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. ``We need to get that urgency back.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while there is plenty of support for the measure in
the Senate, it will now be subject to intense political pressures
and a crowded legislative calendar in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official described the view that
Daley's departure signaled a downshift on the China bill as
``totally false.'' The official argued that the stall in the Senate
began even before Daley left and that the strategy put in place by
Daley and Richetti for dealing with those delays remained.
</P>
<P>
   They and several Senate Democrats put the blame squarely on the
Republican caucus and Lott, who exercises almost complete control
of the Senate's daily agenda. Despite overwhelming support from
their core constituency _ business _ Lott repeatedly refused to
schedule a firm date for a vote in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see the China vote as a tough one for Democrats
because it requires they offend core labor and environmental
constituencies, making a September vote politically appealing. ``I
think it's clear that the Republicans want to make it as difficult
as possible on the Democrats,'' said Tom Daschle, the Senate
minority leader.

IN VIETNAM, A NEW, BUDDING LANDSCAPE FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Just a few weeks ago, foreign executives here
looked at Vietnam and saw a Communist backwater dabbling
halfheartedly in free enterprise and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they see a budding market in a country that has signed an
agreement granting the United States, a former enemy, access to
almost every aspect of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The change is largely due to that trade agreement, signed by
Washington and Hanoi officials nearly two weeks ago. Lawyers,
economists and business people are only beginning to make sense of
the new accord, a densely worded volume of diplomatic and legal
language. The consensus is that the agreement is the most
significant business development here since the country reopened to
foreign investment almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has changed the landscape completely,'' said Nigel Russell,
a lawyer who has worked for seven years in Vietnam advising
American and other foreign clients for Phillips Fox, an Australian
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, subject to approval by Congress, would give
Vietnam the same ``most-favored nation'' status of low tariffs that
China enjoyed subject to annual reviews by Congress until it
secured permanent status this year. In return for gradually opening
its economy further to U.S. investment and exports, Vietnam
immediately gains improved access for its products in American
markets, with the average tariff on goods from Vietnam falling to 3
percent from almost 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very comprehensive agreement that will open a lot of
doors to U.S. business in Vietnam,'' said Frederick Burke, a lawyer
at Baker &AMP; Mackenzie at a briefing to the American Chamber of
Commerce here. The agreement also represents ``dramatic progress
for Vietnam in its integration into the global economic
community,'' he told the more than 100 people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   That said, few people here are under the illusion that change
will come easily or that it will quickly reverse a recent exodus by
disenchanted foreign investors. Much will still depend on the
political will of Vietnam's elderly Communist rulers to enforce the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation is going to be a serious question,'' said
Anthony Salzman, who sells Caterpillar products in Vietnam. ``As an
American businessman, I'll be looking at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been experimenting with what it calls
``market-oriented'' reform since 1987. Since President Clinton
lifted the trade embargo in 1994, American companies have been
trying with mixed success to participate in that experiment, but it
took almost five years for the two nations to reach an agreement
formalizing terms for a trade and investment agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the agreement on Vietnam's economy would
be relatively small. The World Bank estimates that Vietnamese
exports to the United States would rise to $768 million a year,
compared with $504 million last year. Even in an economy as small
as Vietnam's, that would raise average incomes by less than 1
percent, the bank estimates. ``The real economic impact is not as
great as people expect,'' said Dinh Tuan Viet, an economist at the
World Bank's office here.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate beneficiaries are foreign textile and apparel
manufacturers with plants here, such as Nike and the lingerie maker
Triumph. U.S. tariffs on bras and underpants, for example, would
drop to zero from about 60 percent, contributing to what the World
Bank estimates would be a 1,500 percent increase in Vietnamese
clothing exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vietnamese workers would earn the wages from such a
boom, the country does not supply the raw materials for such
exports and so the broad economy would reap relatively little
economic benefit, says Viet at the World Bank. A greater benefit to
the economy, he said, would come from cuts in tariffs on processed
food, especially fish and shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
   More profound are the changes the agreement makes to Vietnam's
rules on foreign investment. Economists say these will not only
force the country to adopt international norms on accounting and
corporate governance, but accelerate economic reforms already under
way, especially the transfer of state-owned industry to
individuals. Last week, for instance, Vietnam opened a long-awaited
stock exchange in the hope of mobilizing private capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up the economy to a whole series of competitive
forces,'' said Wong Yit Fan, regional economist at Standard
Chartered Bank in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. companies looking at Vietnam's market of 77 million
people, the agreement offers important concessions. It phases out
quotas on a range of American products from meat to motorcycles and
gradually cuts tariffs on everything from Maybelline mascara to
Motorola mobile phones. It establishes the right of U.S. accounting
and law firms to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in Vietnam and
over time opens the country to U.S. banks, insurers and health-care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also protects intellectual property rights,
including software and semiconductor designs, and prohibits Vietnam
from applying different product standards on U.S. importers or from
charging foreign business higher fees for telephone calls,
utilities and air fares. Perhaps most tellingly, it seeks to
eliminate the regulatory caprice that is the subject of so many
foreign investor complaints. The agreement would oblige Vietnam to
end arbitrary application of rules on foreign companies. Any rules
would have to be promulgated well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Burke at Baker &AMP; Mackenzie said the agreement's significance was
amplified by nondiscrimination clauses in Vietnam's trade
agreements with other nations. That means companies from China,
Europe and Japan would also benefit from the new terms.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the agreement stops short in many areas. Vietnam
retained restrictions on trade in economically critical products
like oil, rice and gold, as well as politically sensitive products
such as publications and films.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also appears to do little to improve Vietnam's
Internet infrastructure. It mimics China's limits on foreign
involvement in telecommunications and does little to promote flows
of venture capital to fund the kind of high-technology start-ups
other developing nations have deemed crucial to taking part in the
so-called new economy.

2 GROUPS ASK JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE PARTIES' ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two advocacy groups called on the Justice
Department today to investigate whether the Democratic and
Republican parties were violating federal election laws by using
large unregulated political donations to pay for TV commercials
promoting the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the nonpartisan groups, Common Cause and Democracy
21, asked Attorney General Janet Reno to consider again an issue
that was at the center of a prolonged and bitter controversy among
law enforcement officials over accusations of improper use of
campaign donations in the 1996 presidential campaign. Four years
ago, Common Cause challenged the legality of millions of dollars
used for similar advertising, charging that the commercials
promoted specific candidates, not party issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although some lawyers and officials at the Justice Department
and the Federal Election commission agreed, neither agency took
action. The two advocacy groups also asked the election commission
today to review the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are advertisements that have been running in at least
15 states for more than a month and are paid for with ``soft
money'' _ donations made to political parties without limits as
long as the money is used for party building activity. Under the
law, advertisements for candidates are supposed to be paid with
``hard'' or ``federal'' money _ that is, donations limited by law
and matched by federal money.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a
former Massachusetts attorney general, and Fred Wertheimer, the
president of Democracy 21, contended in their letter that the
advertisements they opposed violated election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore and Bush soft money ads are clearly campaign ads
designed and intended to promote the presidential candidates, are
created by members of the presidential campaigns, are targeted to
run in key presidential battleground states, are indistinguishable
from other presidential campaign ads and are without question `for
the purpose of influencing' the presidential campaigns,'' the
letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, ``for the purpose of influencing'' is from the
Federal Election Campaign Act, which requires that advertisements
with such a purpose be paid for with regulated money.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements cited by Harshbarger and Wertheimer are, in
fact, paid for both with hard and soft money, spokesmen for each
party said. The Democratic National Committee and the Republican
National Committee defended the advertisements, noting that none
explicitly called for the viewer to vote for Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations of Harshbarger and Wertheimer advocate the
overhaul of federal election laws. The men estimated that if the
Justice Department and the election commission did not act, ``as
much as $100 million in illegal funds will be raised and spent in
the 2000 presidential election.''
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause filed an almost identical complaint in 1996 about
the campaigns of President Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole, and
the result was a battle lasting years in the Justice Department
over whether to investigate the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Reno opened a preliminary investigation in September 1998 to
determine whether she should seek the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate at least the Clinton part of the accusation.
Dole was not covered under the independent counsel law, which has
since expired and had applied solely to actions by officials in the
same administration as the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Louis B. Freeh, the director of the FBI, and many of his
assistants vigorously contended that the accusations required an
independent investigation, according to memorandums that were later
disclosed. Charles LaBella, the head of the Justice Department's
task force, also believed that the Common Cause complaint had
merit, according to other memorandums addressed to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Reno sided with other Justice Department officials
who said that Clinton and Dole could not be shown to have broken
any laws because each acted on the advice of his lawyers that the
so-called issue advertisements were legal. The advice was based on
the fact that none contained what courts had called ``the magic
words'' that defined a campaign advertisement, such as language
urging viewers to ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' a specific
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The elections commission deadlocked 3 to 3 this February on
whether to go forward with enforcement action against the Clinton
re-election committee.

TEAMSTER WHO DEALS WITH MOVIE STUDIOS SAID TARGET OF US PROBE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury investigating alleged extortion of
Hollywood movie makers by local Teamsters is probing the activities
of the Teamster official who negotiates contracts with studios that
film around New England, according to sources familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 25 Organizer Louis DiGiampaolo, who accompanied
Governor Paul Cellucci on trade missions to Hollywood last year and
in 1997 to try to convince studio heads to film in Massachusetts,
is a focus of the federal investigation, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into whether DiGiampaolo, 48, of
Tewksbury, has threatened to shut down film productions unless they
did business with Local 25, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   One movie executive told the Globe that DiGiampaolo has
intimidated television commercial producers by ordering them to
hire Teamsters when they shoot around Boston, even though
traditionally they're not required by contract to hire union
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bruce Singal, who represents DiGiampaolo in the federal
investigation, said DiGiampaolo denies claims that he's tried to
force people to hire Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely not a target of any investigation based on
what we've been informed,'' Singal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported Tuesday that Teamsters Local 25 President
George Cashman, who also accompanied Cellucci on the Hollywood
trips and serves on the Massachusetts Port Authority board of
directors, is under scrutiny by federal investigators, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that James
Flynn, Local 25's transportation coordinator, has forced filmmakers
to hire a company he controls that rents wardrobe trailers and
leases other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Wednesday that he would speak to Cashman about the
investigation and acknowledged to reporters that he knows of the
complaints from movie studios about Local 25, having mediated some
of the disputes. There was no word from Cellucci's office on
whether the conversation took place.
</P>
<P>
   A group of executives who produce television commercials also
complained to Cellucci in 1996 that the Teamsters were trying to
shut down their sets because they were refusing to hire Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci told the executives, according to one who attended the
meeting, that he was willing to mediate a compromise between them
and Cashman but they turned down the offer believing that it could
lead to their having to negotiate a contract with the Teamsters.
``We were looking for the governor to put his foot down with
Cashman, but he was unwilling to do that,'' the executive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Alvin F. Pouissant, a Harvard Medical School
professor and child psychiatrist, says a Teamster official
``threatened'' to shut down the filming of a public broadcast
special unless a Teamster driver was added to the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Pouissant said that the Teamster, whose name he could not
recall, believed that the special was one in a series of
productions that was being funded with millions of dollars in
funds. Pouissant said he repeated to the Teamster that the budget
for the show, ``Willoughby's Wonders,'' which was to help teach
coping skills to children, was $650,000, and all the money had come
from government grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't believe me. He kept threatening that they would put
up a picket line and shut down the production unless we hired a
Teamster driver,'' Pouissant recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Pouissant asked if he could hire a Teamster at a reduced
rate, the official said no, Pouissant said. The meeting broke up
with the official promising to take the matter up with his
superiors at Local 25. Later that day, the official called
Pouissant and told him that the union would allow the production to
proceed without a Teamster driver.
</P>
<P>
   The production won a New England Emmy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a federal grand jury in Boston subpoenaed records from
Teamsters Local 25, located in Charlestown, detailing the union's
contracts with filmmakers of such hits as ``The Perfect Storm,''
``The Cider House Rules,'' ``Message in a Bottle,'' and ``Good Will
Hunting''.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents from the US Department of Labor,
Division of Labor and Racketeering, raided the Weymouth home of
James P. Flynn, the union's transportation coordinator on many
Hollywood hits shot locally.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into allegations that Flynn forced
filmmakers to hire Location Connection, a company controlled by
Flynn that provides wardrobe trailers and sublets other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in 1989 by Flynn and other investors,
including convicted Charlestown bank robber William Sheehan, who is
now deceased, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has long had ties to organized crime. He was acquitted in
1986 of the gangland slayings four years earlier of Michael Donahue
and Brian Halloran, who had been cooperating against gangster James
``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has caused some dissension within Local 25 by allegedly
hand-picking his friends to work on movies filming locally, a
lucrative assignment that brings a driver $2,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Former Middlesex Sheriff John McGonigle, who was convicted of
extortion in 1995 for taking cash from underlings, was welcomed
into Local 25 after serving a 57-month prison term and recently
landed a job on the set of ``What's the Worst That Could Happen''
with Flynn's help, sources said.

COMMENTARY: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time's up, people. We've got political conventions coming, with
running mates, protesters _ all the stuff you need to hold an
actual presidential election. No more pretending this campaign
isn't really happening. Duty calls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months Al Gore has been campaigning like
crazy, unfazed by your inattention. His current message is that
George W. Bush would turn the country into another Texas, a place
Gore has been depicting as a sort of Burkina Faso with oil rigs.
This pitch might work slightly better if Gore himself had not spent
so many years as No. 2 to the former governor of Arkansas. But the
Democratic National Committee lent a hand the other day, somberly
issuing a traveler's warning that urged visitors to the Lone Star
State to update their immunization shots. Meanwhile, Bush has been
proceeding at a more leisurely pace _ being inclusive, bonding with
Dick Cheney and building his dream ranch house. This is going to be
the only presidential candidate in history who spends the campaign
working on his retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, Bill Clinton gave a radio interview in which
he responded to a question on what the last eight years had done to
his marriage with the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think it's been good for ours because I got to live
above the store. ... There's a swimming pool here, and Hillary and
I spent a lot of happy days out there just talking and reading. ...
We've probably had more time together in our time here that at any
point in our marriage. ... It's been wonderful for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else has occurred that was anywhere near that amazing.
However, these are some runner-up memorable moments:
</P>
<P>
   May 15 _ Reacting to criticism that Al Gore's campaign is
adrift, Tony Coelho tells The New York Times: ``When people say
`Maybe you've lost some traction,' they have no idea what we're
doing. ... Just watch us. Watch us go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   May 31 _ George W. Bush irritably tells a TV interviewer he has
read ``a lot more books than you give me credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   June 3 _ Nothing much happens in the presidential race, but over
in England, Queen Elizabeth invites Prince Charles' mistress to a
garden party.
</P>
<P>
   June 5 _ The New York state Republican Party sends out a
fund-raising letter calling Hillary Rodham Clinton ``a brash and
bombastic, devious and dangerous, selfish and self-promoting
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   June 6 _ Boosting his friend George W. Bush to reporters, Gov.
Gary Johnson of New Mexico recalls a conversation they had at a
conference on state government. ``George turns to me and says,
`What are they talking about?' I said, `I don't know.' He said,
`You don't know a thing, do you?' And I said, `Not one thing.' He
said, `Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived.''
</P>
<P>
   June 14 _ Not to be outdone in humanizing the presidential
candidate of his choice, Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat,
tells reporters that Al Gore is ``not only a great person, but he's
very funny. ... He is always picking up the phone to check on his
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   June 15 _ Pat Buchanan, Reform Party presidential hopeful,
campaigns in New York, attempting to broaden his base with a speech
opposing the U.N. war crimes tribunal. He also blames Hillary
Clinton for the recent sexual assaults in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   June 16 _ Tony ``Watch us go forward'' Coelho resigns.
</P>
<P>
   June 18 _ The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, tells a TV
interviewer that ``the House deserves a lot of credit for passing a
bill overwhelmingly, bipartisanly, to eliminate the death penalty.
We're going to bring that up in the Senate.'' Further questioning
reveals that the death penalty he has in mind is the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   June 28 _ Asked if the scandals in his administration are
hurting Gore's campaign, President Clinton says, ``a whole bunch of
this stuff was just garbage,'' and reminds reporters that the only
thing the vice president was ``implicated in is this
campaign-finance thing.''
</P>
<P>
   July 19 _ New York Republicans send out a new letter, accusing
Hillary Clinton of being ``ambitious, ruthless, scheming,
calculating, manipulative'' and ``an angry woman.''
</P>
<P>
   July 20 _ Al Gore accepts an invitation to debate George W. Bush
on the David Letterman show. ``We think this will pretty much
decide the election,'' says the show's executive producer.

COMMENTARY: YASSER ARAFAT'S MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (REPEATING for all needing.)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so it really comes down to this: Who is Yasser Arafat? Is he
Nelson Mandela, or is he Willie Nelson? That is, is he a man ready
for a historic compromise, or would he just prefer to sing the old
songs?
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that after a two-week diplomatic slumber
party at Camp David with Arafat, U.S. officials say they still
don't know. But this is the key question now.
</P>
<P>
   The reason President Clinton was so frustrated with Arafat at
Camp David was not because he refused to accept every aspect of
Ehud Barak's offer for how to share Jerusalem. No one could have,
or should have, expected that. The Palestinian-Muslim claim to
Jerusalem is authentic, deep-rooted and heartfelt. The reason the
Americans were frustrated with Arafat was that he played
rope-a-dope. He came with no compromise ideas of his own on
Jerusalem. He simply absorbed Barak's proposals and repeated
Palestinian mantras about recovering all of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   What should Arafat have said? He should have told Barak that his
ideas for granting Palestinians an administrative presence in East
Jerusalem, autonomous control over the Arab neighborhoods there and
religious control over the Temple Mount were a huge leap forward
for an Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
   But, he should have added, they didn't go far enough. The
Palestinians needed three things: First, they must have not simply
an administrative presence but a sovereign presence in East
Jerusalem, over which they have full control and can fly their flag
_ even if it is just one square block. It could be at Orient House
or in the Muslim Quarter. Second, they must at least share
sovereignty with the Jewish people over the sacred space of the
Temple Mount, which is the site of both the ancient Jewish temple
and two of Islam's holiest mosques. And third, the Palestinians
must have direct access from that sovereign Palestinian presence to
both the mosques on the Temple Mount and to the Palestinian state
in the West Bank, so they don't have to go through Israeli
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Such a proposal would have been further than Barak was ready to
go, but it would have been a credible Palestinian counteroffer, and
it would have been the basis for a real negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Because we do know now who Ehud Barak is. ``Barak is engaged in
the most important historical event of the Zionist movement,''
remarked the Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal.
``Between the Mediterranean and the Jordan there are roughly 5
million Jews and 5 million Palestinian Arabs. You cannot have a
Jewish and democratic state without dividing this land, and those
who oppose that are dooming Israel to an apartheid state, which
might have secure borders, but might not be worth securing. Barak
is on a purely Zionist mission to bring Israel back into borders
where it can be Jewish, just, democratic _ and secure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Arafat seize on that with a serious counteroffer? One
view in the U.S. camp is that the Palestinians still don't know who
they want to be when they grow up. They still prefer to whine and
play the victim. Another view says, hold on, Arafat knows he has to
engage, but he needed to show his people he could say no before he
says yes.
</P>
<P>
   My own view is a mix. I believe Arafat presides over a
decentralized, disenfranchised and dysfunctional national movement
that, against all odds, has managed to survive Arab regimes that
wanted to control it and Israeli governments that wanted to destroy
it. He survived all these years by bobbing, weaving, straddling and
never making an irrevocable decision. But now he is at the moment
of truth. He must do something he has never done before: clearly
define not just what the Palestinians want, but what they also
believe the Jews are entitled to, and then split the difference and
take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   To do that he is going to have to rise above his personal
history and circumstances, and also enlist the backing of Egypt and
Saudi Arabia _ which represent the Muslim world, but which ran away
when Clinton asked them to help Arafat fashion and sell a
compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. Listen to Israel. Listen to the silence. It's
the Israeli silent majority already redrawing maps in their heads.
That is Barak's great achievement. But it has limits, and it will
be utterly wasted if Arafat and the Arabs can't muster the courage
to get their own people to do the same.
</P>

ROSE'S FENWAY DREAM FADES AS HE HEADS FOR THE ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It could just as easily have been three years
ago, when Montreal general manager Jim Beattie was planning to
trade Pedro Martinez to the Red Sox and had his pick of the top two
Sox pitching prospects, Carl Pavano or Brian Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie chose Pavano, and Rose still had intact his dream of
pitching for the Olde Towne Team he'd grown up cheering for in
South Dartmouth, Mass. But while Rose, whose favorite player as a
kid was Roger Clemens, made it to Fenway Park, making his
big-league debut at the age of 21 before friends and family, it
turns out his term on Yawkey Way was short-lived, too.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Rose pitches in the big leagues _ and that could
be as soon as Sunday in Milwaukee _ it will be for the Colorado
Rockies, who acquired Rose and John Wasdin, along with second
baseman Jeff Frye and another local boy, Walpole's Jeff Taglienti,
in a seven-player deal Thursday in which the Sox received Cuban
defector Rolando Arrojo and infielder Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had some grand moments for the Sox, most notably when he
beat the Yankees twice in a span of six days last May, but the down
times outnumbered the good for the 24-year-old righthander, who had
elbow problems, clashed with the front office and pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan, and spent parts of each the last four seasons in
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was home in Dartmouth when he received a call informing him
of the trade. He later spoke with Rockies general manager Dan
O'Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty startled and a little anxious,'' Rose said by
phone. ``This is a chance to get back to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan O'Dowd told me I was the guy they were really looking for
in the deal, and that they're excited I'm going over there. He
basically told me not to be scared about the ballpark and just use
my pitches. I'm just looking forward to pitching in the big leagues
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies had wanted Rose to pitch Saturday, taking Arrojo's
spot in the rotation, but he just pitched Tuesday in Pawtucket, so
he'll likely be bumped back to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reflect on his time with the Sox, and whether he felt
the club had lost confidence in him, Rose said: ``I basically can't
answer that question now. I'm still a little startled about the
trade. One day maybe I'll sit down and talk about it. But I've been
advised by my agent, Jack Toffey, not to say anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   Toffey was a classmate of O'Dowd's at Rollins College. ``He's
sad he's leaving New England and the Red Sox,'' Toffey said, ``but
I think of change of scenery may be good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Rose had some conflicts over the condition of his
elbow two years ago, when the team refused to pick up the tab when
Rose sought a second opinion from another doctor. Then last summer
in Chicago, after Rose failed to cover first base, Kerrigan was
quoted as saying Rose had ``embarrassed'' the entire team on
national television and had him at the ballpark early the next day
for fielding drills.

   VARIOUS ARTISTS: ``Heroes &AMP; Villains: Music Inspired by the
Powerpuff Girls'' (Rhino/Cartoon Net).
</P>
<P>
   Those mutant X-Men are confronting all comers at the box office,
but there are champions much tougher than that movie's confused
adolescent, Rogue. The Powerpuff Girls, created by Craig McCracken
for the Cartoon Network, give young viewers a taste of unequivocal
female punch. Buttercup, Bubbles and Blossom talk like the
Chipmunks, chew gum, think fast and defeat baddies like the monkey
Mojo Jojo without mussing the bows in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   The show's hip kiddie feminism appeals to underground rockers.
For ``Heroes &AMP; Villains'' 11 bands united to create a Powerpuff
Girls episode in the recording studio. Better than just another
soundtrack, this disc boasts pert originals by Apples in Stereo,
Shonen Knife, Bis, Frank Black, Cornelius and others, linked to
tell a typical Powerpuff tale of chaos, bravado and ultimate
triumph. The precocious sound these bands cultivate has never had a
more appropriate niche. The Powerpuff Girls are a godsend to cute
pop bands, and to prepubescents everywhere.

TEAMSTER WHO DEALS WITH MOVIE STUDIOS SAID TARGET OF US PROBE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury investigating alleged extortion of
Hollywood movie makers by local Teamsters is probing the activities
of the Teamster official who negotiates contracts with studios that
film around New England, according to sources familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 25 Organizer Louis DiGiampaolo, who accompanied
Governor Paul Cellucci on trade missions to Hollywood last year and
in 1997 to try to convince studio heads to film in Massachusetts,
is a focus of the federal investigation, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into whether DiGiampaolo, 48, of
Tewksbury, has threatened to shut down film productions unless they
did business with Local 25, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   One movie executive told the Globe that DiGiampaolo has
intimidated television commercial producers by ordering them to
hire Teamsters when they shoot around Boston, even though
traditionally they're not required by contract to hire union
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bruce Singal, who represents DiGiampaolo in the federal
investigation, said DiGiampaolo denies claims that he's tried to
force people to hire Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely not a target of any investigation based on
what we've been informed,'' Singal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported Tuesday that Teamsters Local 25 President
George Cashman, who also accompanied Cellucci on the Hollywood
trips and serves on the Massachusetts Port Authority board of
directors, is under scrutiny by federal investigators, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is investigating allegations that James
Flynn, Local 25's transportation coordinator, has forced filmmakers
to hire a company he controls that rents wardrobe trailers and
leases other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Wednesday that he would speak to Cashman about the
investigation and acknowledged to reporters that he knows of the
complaints from movie studios about Local 25, having mediated some
of the disputes. There was no word from Cellucci's office on
whether the conversation took place.
</P>
<P>
   A group of executives who produce television commercials also
complained to Cellucci in 1996 that the Teamsters were trying to
shut down their sets because they were refusing to hire Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci told the executives, according to one who attended the
meeting, that he was willing to mediate a compromise between them
and Cashman but they turned down the offer believing that it could
lead to their having to negotiate a contract with the Teamsters.
``We were looking for the governor to put his foot down with
Cashman, but he was unwilling to do that,'' the executive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Alvin F. Pouissant, a Harvard Medical School
professor and child psychiatrist, says a Teamster official
``threatened'' to shut down the filming of a public broadcast
special unless a Teamster driver was added to the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Pouissant said that the Teamster, whose name he could not
recall, believed that the special was one in a series of
productions that was being funded with millions of dollars in
funds. Pouissant said he repeated to the Teamster that the budget
for the show, ``Willoughby's Wonders,'' which was to help teach
coping skills to children, was $650,000, and all the money had come
from government grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't believe me. He kept threatening that they would put
up a picket line and shut down the production unless we hired a
Teamster driver,'' Pouissant recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Pouissant asked if he could hire a Teamster at a reduced
rate, the official said no, Pouissant said. The meeting broke up
with the official promising to take the matter up with his
superiors at Local 25. Later that day, the official called
Pouissant and told him that the union would allow the production to
proceed without a Teamster driver.
</P>
<P>
   The production won a New England Emmy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a federal grand jury in Boston subpoenaed records from
Teamsters Local 25, located in Charlestown, detailing the union's
contracts with filmmakers of such hits as ``The Perfect Storm,''
``The Cider House Rules,'' ``Message in a Bottle,'' and ``Good Will
Hunting''.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents from the US Department of Labor,
Division of Labor and Racketeering, raided the Weymouth home of
James P. Flynn, the union's transportation coordinator on many
Hollywood hits shot locally.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into allegations that Flynn forced
filmmakers to hire Location Connection, a company controlled by
Flynn that provides wardrobe trailers and sublets other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in 1989 by Flynn and other investors,
including convicted Charlestown bank robber William Sheehan, who is
now deceased, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has long had ties to organized crime. He was acquitted in
1986 of the gangland slayings four years earlier of Michael Donahue
and Brian Halloran, who had been cooperating against gangster James
``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has caused some dissension within Local 25 by allegedly
hand-picking his friends to work on movies filming locally, a
lucrative assignment that brings a driver $2,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Former Middlesex Sheriff John McGonigle, who was convicted of
extortion in 1995 for taking cash from underlings, was welcomed
into Local 25 after serving a 57-month prison term and recently
landed a job on the set of ``What's the Worst That Could Happen''
with Flynn's help, sources said.

FRYE ROCKS THE BOAT, SO NOW HE'S A ROCKIE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Large and small, old and young, veteran and
rookie. Let the word go forth to all who would work for the Boston
American League baseball club: Speak out and you are gone. Like
deposed leaders in the old Soviet Union, you are easily erased.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had been looking to dump Jeff Frye's contract for a
couple of years and his loss on the field is not a huge deal. But
can it be total coincidence that Frye was traded four days after
ripping Dan Duquette (over the Duke's treatment of Mike Staley)?
And is it really a good baseball/business decision when you unload
a 33-year-old infielder who's finishing a $2.5 million contract in
exchange for a 32-year-old guy who'll get $6.5 million next year?
</P>
<P>
   Either this guy Mike Lansing can really play, or the Duke was
really stung by Frye's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette must have majored in Machiavelli at Amherst. His
corporate mission statement dissent policy calls for zero
tolerance. Only yes-men need apply. Rock the boat and they'll start
fitting you for a body bag. Ask Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, Jose
Canseco, Mike Greenwell, Kevin Kennedy, Jim Leyritz, Butch Henry,
Flash Gordon, Luke Wrenn, Bob Schaefer, Mike Rizzo, Bill Madlock,
Gerald Perry, Steve August, Johnny Pesky, Sam Mele, Frank Malzone,
Jim Samia.
</P>
<P>
   Sox players knew something was coming down Thursday afternoon.
Tim Wakefield sat at a table in the clubhouse with Rich Garces and
said, ``I hear we made a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield listed the names. He had the principals down almost
perfectly. A few minutes later, the Sox bus arrived and Frye walked
into the clubhouse. He already knew. He had a brief meeting with
Sox manager Jimy Williams, then collected his bats and spoke with
Sox traveling secretary Jack McCormick about securing a flight to
Milwaukee. The Rockies play at County Stadium Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A procession of teammates went to Frye's locker. Hugs all
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be taking any of my bats,'' said Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha, they're all corked anyway,'' teased Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Frye had never been traded. Any regrets about popping off
against the Duke?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Sometimes you have to speak up. Every man in
this clubhouse appreciates what I did for Mike Stanley.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he think he was traded because of his rant?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``It's close to the trading deadline.
Teams are trying to make some moves. You'd have to ask Dan (we
would, but it's clear by now that Duquette doesn't care to give
fans any sincere answers). I'm probably the one that burned the
bridge, but these things happen sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Any advice for a young Boston player who wants to stick around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you should conform and bite your tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox players know the score. Darren Lewis knows. Rod Beck knows.
Tim Wakefield knows. They know and they are concerned with the loss
of solid citizens who have helped the team in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders Nomar and Pedro Martinez were asked if they had any
concerns about Duquette trading Frye or other players for reasons
other than ``baseball decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said Nomar. ``You don't know what's in the
works. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro said, ``This is part of baseball. You have to realize the
business part of baseball is larger than the game. We love the
game. They (management) don't. And that's the way it's supposed to
be. I'm an oldie now. I realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Business or bad blood, the timing of this trade left Williams
with only three bench players. That's right. Three. The Sox are
carrying 11 pitchers. Add nine players in the lineup and you get to
20. That should leave five pinch hitters, but Frye was flying to
Milwaukee and Jurassic Carl Everett (who this week issued the most
phony apology since Bobby Knight) was serving the third game of his
10-game suspension. The good news was that the immortal Izzy
Alcantara was batting cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball trades go, this might be a good one. We're going to
miss Frye's presence and life on Lansdowne certainly won't be the
same without Johnny ``Way Back'' Wasdin. The mind boggles at the
thought of the homers Way Back could surrender in the rarified air
of Colorado. As for Brian Rose, he never showed he was anything
more than a Triple A pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing can hit a little. Rolando Arrojo is the Sox' first Cuban
righty since Luis Tiant, and that one worked out pretty well. Rich
Croushore is no relation to Austin Croshere, coveted by the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Lansing, Arrojo, Ed Sprague, and Bernard Gilkey don't
offset Denny Neagle and David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Duke's not done. There could be another
trade. Some other Sox player might pop off between now and the
trading deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Little more than two weeks ago, Dick Cheney
visited Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee in his office on Capitol Hill,
and Frist made his pitch, explaining why his experience as a heart
surgeon who had managed life-and-death situations made him the
right man to accompany Gov. George W. Bush along the inevitably
rocky, tense road to Election Day and perhaps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney apeared to listen intently. It was his job to supervise
the Texas governor's hunt for a running mate, and he had arranged
to meet Frist.
</P>
<P>
   Within several days, Bush flew to the Northeast and met twice
with Gov. George Pataki of New York, discussing a possible place
for Pataki on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   For all this tantalizing activity, it now appears that Cheney
had at the time already emerged as a leading candidate _ and
perhaps the leading candidate _ for the slot he had been assigned
to help fill. Cheney and Bush had discussed the possibility July 3
at Bush's ranch near Crawford, about 90 miles northeast of here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheney's own candidacy was moving along a track so secret
that some of the other politicians on the list of seemingly serious
prospects had no idea that Bush was settling on Cheney until they
learned it from newspaper and television reports less than 72 hours
before Bush formally announced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans who discussed the vice-presidential
selection with Bush over the past two weeks, among them Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, said that the Texas governor had not let on
that he was considering the head of his search committee for the
post. He also did not inquire about how such a selection might
play, even as he reviewed with them the qualifications of other
potential candidates on his list.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the final days, when Cheney's selection was almost
assured, the vacuum allowed what turned out to be entirely
unfounded reports _ that Colin Powell and John McCain had turned up
as last-minute additions to Bush's short list of candidates _ to
gain widespread coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is an immensely respected political veteran, and his
selection elicited praise from many Republicans. But the unusual
way in which the former defense secretary arrived at Bush's side at
a news conference here on Tuesday to announce the vice-presidential
selection has stirred concern among some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They have noted with alarm the attacks Democrats were able to
quickly muster on Cheney's conservative voting record in Congress,
and questioned whether the man in charge of screening the other
candidates for the job could possibly have received as thorough a
screening himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they vet?'' a senior Republican strategist with
experience in national campaigns asked Thursday. ``That he went to
college? They really got their ears pinned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Cheney's ties to former President George Bush have
provoked renewed speculation about the influence of Bush's father
on his son's presidential campaign. In a telephone interview
Thursday that represented his first public comments on the search
process, President Bush said: ``What I see emerging is that the old
guy drove the choice. That is absolutely inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that he spoke regularly with his son about
the search and gave his opinions on various candidates, including
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was asked if he spoke directly to Cheney and urged
him to think about taking the job, Bush said, ``I cannot reveal
whether I did or didn't. Not wanting to obfuscate, but put this
down to obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please respect my age _ 76,'' he continued. ``I'm forgetful.''
Asked if that meant that he had forgotten whether he spoke with
Cheney, his response suggested that the two men had talked, perhaps
because Cheney was soliciting opinions about vice presidential
contenders and the former president knew many of these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into what I talked to Dick Cheney or
anybody else about,'' President Bush said. ``You've got to put it
in the context of what Dick Cheney was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his son's advisers, the review of Cheney's
credentials and background materials was conducted somewhat outside
of the process that Cheney had established for the rest of the
field, and it proceeded at a much speedier pace. Within minutes
after Cheney's selection was announced on Tuesday, Democrats
produced a trove of extremely conservative votes from Cheney's
decade in Congress, and the barrage of questions about his record
that hit Cheney and the Bush campaign seemed to take them at least
partly by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
Thursday about several votes that he cast in opposition to gun
control, Cheney said, ``Well, I'd have to go back and dig into that
in detail.'' In a previous interview on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
Cheney seemed a bit surprised by similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and his aides have declined to provide any
more than rudimentary details about the vetting of vice
presidential prospects, including Cheney, but said that all of them
had been carefully noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I knew his votes,'' Bush said during a brief news
conference at the governor's mansion here Thursday. ``But I also
know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who
all they do is spend time tearing people down. And they're going to
give it their level best trying to tear Dick Cheney down, but
they're not going to be able to do so.''

U.S.'S GAMBILL ON THE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Surrendering 16 aces in two tennis sets means you
better be doing a lot of other things right if you want to win the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jan-Michael Gambill. He had all kinds of trouble
handling Laurence Tieleman's big serves Thursday in a second-round
Mercedes-Benz Cup match, but Gambill prevailed 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 to
advance to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurence was just serving up bombs. I never saw him hit that
well,'' said Gambill, 23, of Spokane, Wash. ``It was a good thing I
was able to stay tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tieleman's serves were his best weapon, but they turned on him
too; he committed five double faults, the most important an
ill-timed foot fault when he was leading 2-0 in the first-set
tiebreaker. Gambill went on to win seven of the next eight points
to steal the set.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum means a lot in tennis. Gambill promptly broke service
in the first game of the second set to grease the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling a bit frustrated after the double fault in
overtime and I think I was still thinking about it for the rest of
the day,'' said Tieleman, 27, of Belgium, making his first Los
Angeles appearance. ``It was all downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Gambill has made the final eight in Los
Angeles. It would have been a shame for him to bow out any earlier,
considering he was coming off a quarterfinal appearance at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill has a relatively easy path to Sunday's final. With
third-seeded Marcelo Rios out of the picture after being defaulted
Wednesday for cussing out an official, and with Andre Agassi having
withdrawn (back injury), No.8 Arnaud Clement is the only seeded
player between Gambill and the final.
</P>
<P>
   He'll play Australian Jason Stoltenberg, a straight-sets winner
over Goichi Motomura on Thursday, in the quarterfinals today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of guy who looks ahead,'' Gambill said. ``All
I care about is who I'm playing next. I honestly don't even look at
the pairings. I'm superstitious that way. It's part of my
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill's name might not be familiar _ yet _ to casual fans, but
he's a star on the rise. Last year he was the youngest American in
the top 100 for the second consecutive year, posting victories over
Pete Sampras and Agassi along the way. Gambill's poster-boy good
looks certainly won't hurt his cause, either.
</P>
<P>
   He's earned just over $1 million and he's hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely very important for me to just play solid and
be consistent,'' said Gambill, ranked No.32 on the ATP Tour. ''I've
got a very busy schedule over the next four months with just one
week off. That's why I'm not playing in the Olympics. I would have
loved to do it and it was a very difficult decision not to, but I
want to break into the Top 20.'' &QL;

 AUSTIN, Texas: do so.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that most Americans already knew and
respected Cheney as a result of his role as defense secretary
during the Persian Gulf War. ``Secretary Cheney brought people
together and helped to win a war, which stands in stark contrast
with Vice President Al Gore, who tens to divide people to create
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his aides, Bush declined to be interviewed for this
article. Cheney did not respond to several requests for an
interview about the search process that were made through Bush's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with Republicans who spoke with Cheney and Bush
these past few weeks, including a number of men who were told they
were on the short list of potential vice presidential candidates,
suggest that they underwent a process that was different then the
one Cheney endured. It is these differences that account for the
murmurs of concern among some Republicans who have watched Cheney's
first few turbulent days as a candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney took charge of reviewing financial histories and
interviewing candidates, Bush himself attended to that chore in
Cheney's case. While Cheney researched the voting records of the
other vice presidential prospects, the task of assessing Cheney's
political past fell to Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager.
(Allbaugh also did not return a call for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates began submitting their voluminous paper
work in mid-May, in some cases shipping boxes of documents to
Cheney, the examination of Cheney apparently began little more than
a week before Bush called him and offered him the job.
</P>
<P>
   And while at least 11 Republicans filled out an extraordinarily
detailed, 83-question form, including inquiries ranging from
plagiarism to recreational drug use, Bush's senior advisers were
unable to say if Cheney had taken the same formal step, though they
noted that Cheney's background had been reviewed when he was named
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``Secretary Cheney told
me he subjected himself to the same kind of scrutiny,'' Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But unexplained oddities about the vetting of Cheney lingered.
According to one Republican official, the name of his daughter,
Elizabeth Cheney, a lawyer, was on the return address of the
materials that another candidate received, and she helped place
calls late last week to round up the weekend phone numbers of other
vice presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Elizabeth Cheney's possible role in helping to
screen candidates, including her father, Hughes said that except
for Dick Cheney, Bush and Allbaugh, ``I am not able to discuss
others who were involved in the vetting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said on ``Good Morning America'' that there was no
cause for concern about the unusual way in which he came to be
selected. Referring to Bush, he said: ``The fact of the matter is
that we spent a lot of time _ and again, remember my original
advice to him was, you know, we're going to find you a great
candidate, but I'd rather not be a candidate myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we went through the process in terms of talking about
my health and my record and my business career and so forth, we
reviewed all those things between the two of us as we went forward
and before we made the decision, before he made the decision that
he wanted me to be a candidate,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore has seemed
genuinely invigorated by the news of Cheney's selection. Aides to
the vice president were churning out reams of documents about
Cheney's legislative background literally from the moment Bush
concluded the formal announcement of Cheney's selection.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of what is arguably the most important political
decision Bush has made in his presidential campaign to date may
never be known. The lack of information has prompted questions
among some some Republicans about whether many of the politicians
whose names were publicly floated as possible running mates for
Bush were ever in serious contention.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said in an interview that he had told aides on July 5 that
he did not want to be considered for the race; nonetheless, Bush
himself continued to encourage speculation that he was considering
Ridge when he campaigned with the Pennsylvania governor in
Pittsburgh a week later. Similarly, by the time Bush met with
Pataki on July 14 _ an encounter that his aides readily confirmed _
Cheney, who has a history of heart attacks, had completed a medical
examination in New York and reported to Bush that he had been given
a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ridge and Pataki are supporters of abortion rights, unlike
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who is a staunch opponent of abortion, had been pitching
in with the governor's presidential campaign from the beginning.
Last year, he helped Bush assemble the team of foreign policy
advisers for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was natural that in mid-March, after Bush
effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, he
asked Cheney if he wanted to be considered as a possible running
mate. Cheney said no, but, weeks later, agreed to supervise the
search process.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, hundreds of letters were sent to Republican
officials to get their advice. At least 11 prospective candidates
received questionnaires and requests for documents. There was no
hint yet that Cheney's professed resistance to considering the job
was softening, Bush's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 27, just six days before Cheney visited Bush's ranch
and indicated a possible willingness to be Bush's running mate, his
name popped up during a gathering of former members of his father's
presidential administration at the Bush family compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine. Those present included President Bush; his
former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and his former
director of presidential personnel, Chase Untermeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer recalled that as these men and others sat around a
table on the back porch, Bush asked in a lighthearted manner who
they thought should be his son's vice presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost in the sense of a parlor game, as if he were
asking, ``Who do you think will win the Masters?''' Untermeyer said
in one of two telephone interviews this week. He said the name that
came up most often was Ridge's.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Untermeyer said, someone brought up Cheney's
name, and someone else said he was not interested. According to
Untermeyer, Scowcroft then said that Cheney had recently indicated
to him that he might be willing to take the job after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression was that President Bush was very interested to
hear that and took it aboard as if it was an important fact to
know,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scowcroft and President Bush both made telephone calls to a
reporter Thursday to dispute the accuracy of that account.
Scowcroft said that before the Kennebunkport meeting, he had run
into Cheney and teased him about being the perfect vice
presidential prospect. Scowcroft said that he merely shared that
story with President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush said that he did not press the idea of Cheney on
his son. ``Am I high on Cheney?,'' the former president said.
``Absolutely. Was I high on others? Absolutely. Did I talk to
George when he called to go over stuff? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Less then a week later, Bush revisited Cheney's initial
objections with him at the ranch, and Cheney began to budge.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11th, Hughes said, he got his medical examination. On
July 15 he and Bush informed Bush's senior advisers that he was in
the running, and his vetting began, according to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days later, the job was his.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam _ Just a few weeks ago, foreign executives here
looked at Vietnam and saw a Communist backwater dabbling
halfheartedly in free enterprise and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they see a budding market in a country that has signed an
agreement granting the United States, a former enemy, access to
almost every aspect of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The change is largely due to that trade agreement, signed by
Washington and Hanoi officials nearly two weeks ago. Lawyers,
economists and business people are only beginning to make sense of
the new accord, a densely worded volume of diplomatic and legal
language. The consensus is that the agreement is the most
significant business development here since the country reopened to
foreign investment almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has changed the landscape completely,'' said Nigel Russell,
a lawyer who has worked for seven years in Vietnam advising
American and other foreign clients for Phillips Fox, an Australian
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, subject to approval by Congress, would give
Vietnam the same ``most-favored nation'' status of low tariffs that
China enjoyed subject to annual reviews by Congress until it
secured permanent status this year. In return for gradually opening
its economy further to U.S. investment and exports, Vietnam
immediately gains improved access for its products in American
markets, with the average tariff on goods from Vietnam falling to 3
percent from almost 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very comprehensive agreement that will open a lot of
doors to U.S. business in Vietnam,'' said Frederick Burke, a lawyer
at Baker &AMP; Mackenzie at a briefing to the American Chamber of
Commerce here. The agreement also represents ``dramatic progress
for Vietnam in its integration into the global economic
community,'' he told the more than 100 people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   That said, few people here are under the illusion that change
will come easily or that it will quickly reverse a recent exodus by
disenchanted foreign investors. Much will still depend on the
political will of Vietnam's elderly Communist rulers to enforce the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation is going to be a serious question,'' said
Anthony Salzman, who sells Caterpillar products in Vietnam. ``As an
American businessman, I'll be looking at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been experimenting with what it calls
``market-oriented'' reform since 1987. Since President Clinton
lifted the trade embargo in 1994, American companies have been
trying with mixed success to participate in that experiment, but it
took almost five years for the two nations to reach an agreement
formalizing terms for a trade and investment agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the agreement on Vietnam's economy would
be relatively small. The World Bank estimates that Vietnamese
exports to the United States would rise to $768 million a year,
compared with $504 million last year. Even in an economy as small
as Vietnam's, that would raise average incomes by less than 1
percent, the bank estimates. ``The real economic impact is not as
great as people expect,'' said Dinh Tuan Viet, an economist at the
World Bank's office here.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate beneficiaries are foreign textile and apparel
manufacturers with plants here, such as Nike and the lingerie maker
Triumph. U.S. tariffs on bras and underpants, for example, would
drop to zero from about 60 percent, contributing to what the World
Bank estimates would be a 1,500 percent increase in Vietnamese
clothing exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vietnamese workers would earn the wages from such a
boom, the country does not supply the raw materials for such
exports and so the broad economy would reap relatively little
economic benefit, says Viet at the World Bank. A greater benefit to
the economy, he said, would come from cuts in tariffs on processed
food, especially fish and shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
   More profound are the changes the agreement makes to Vietnam's
rules on foreign investment. Economists say these will not only
force the country to adopt international norms on accounting and
corporate governance, but accelerate economic reforms already under
way, especially the transfer of state-owned industry to
individuals. Last week, for instance, Vietnam opened a long-awaited
stock exchange in the hope of mobilizing private capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up the economy to a whole series of competitive
forces,'' said Wong Yit Fan, regional economist at Standard
Chartered Bank in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. companies looking at Vietnam's market of 77 million
people, the agreement offers important concessions. It phases out
quotas on a range of American products from meat to motorcycles and
gradually cuts tariffs on everything from Maybelline mascara to
Motorola mobile phones. It establishes the right of U.S. accounting
and law firms to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in Vietnam and
over time opens the country to U.S. banks, insurers and health-care
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also protects intellectual property rights,
including software and semiconductor designs, and prohibits Vietnam
from applying different product standards on U.S. importers or from
charging foreign business higher fees for telephone calls,
utilities and air fares. Perhaps most tellingly, it seeks to
eliminate the regulatory caprice that is the subject of so many
foreign investor complaints. The agreement would oblige Vietnam to
end arbitrary application of rules on foreign companies. Any rules
would have to be promulgated well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Burke at Baker &AMP; Mackenzie said the agreement's significance was
amplified by nondiscrimination clauses in Vietnam's trade
agreements with other nations. That means companies from China,
Europe and Japan would also benefit from the new terms.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the agreement stops short in many areas. Vietnam
retained restrictions on trade in economically critical products
like oil, rice and gold, as well as politically sensitive products
such as publications and films.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also appears to do little to improve Vietnam's
Internet infrastructure. It mimics China's limits on foreign
involvement in telecommunications and does little to promote flows
of venture capital to fund the kind of high-technology start-ups
other developing nations have deemed crucial to taking part in the
so-called new economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Case and Gerald Levin came to Washington on
Thursday to defend the proposed merger of America Online and Time
Warner Inc. against a rising tide of criticism that the new
colossus would be so anti-competitive that it would need to be
reined in by regulators even before its creation.
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, Case, chairman and chief executive of
AOL, and Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, vowed to keep their
cable, broadcast and Internet systems open to rivals, and said it
would be against their business interests to discriminate against
other companies that relied on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been suggested that a combined AOL Time Warner might
somehow favor our content over that of competitors,'' Case said.
``Let me be very clear: AOL has never done anything like that, and
we never would _ because it would diminish our members' online
experience. For the same reasons, a combined AOL Time Warner would
build on our companies' demonstrated commitment to open access.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics and some commissioners suggested restrictions might
be necessary to force the company to honor its commitments. They
also noted that neither Case nor Levin would say precisely when
they would open AOL's instant messaging service to competing
systems, or when Time Warner would begin offering rival Internet
service providers access to its cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Levin were the lead witnesses in a five-hour hearing
this afternoon at the Federal Communications Commission that
offered the first glimpse of the thinking at the agency's highest
ranks. The commissioners' questions and comments appeared to
confirm the conventional wisdom that the deal would not be blocked,
although it appeared possible that significant conditions would be
imposed to prevent the new company from shutting out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Executives on both sides of the debate agree that its outcome
will shape the Internet landscape and its regulation for years to
come, laying down broad principles about Washington's role in
assuring that the marketplace remains both open and innovative.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer groups, along with the Walt Disney Co. , NBC and a
host of Internet service providers and telephone companies, have
raised concerns about the deal, coming in the midst of a digital
revolution that is slowly blurring the lines between telephones,
televisions and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the convergence of these technologies makes it
dangerous to put too much control of the market in the hands of AOL
and Time Warner, which could give it the ability to shut the rivals
out of the developing areas like interactive television, instant
messaging and digital telephony services, and could slow Internet
connections between rival content providers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Critic after critic told the commissioners that there was no
reason for the government to trust promises by Case and Levin to
keep their system open. The critics reminded the commissioners that
America Online's instant messaging system does not work with
competing systems and that Time Warner had shut ABC off its cable
television systems earlier this year in the middle of a commercial
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What remains is for their promises and policies to be refined
and codified as conditions to approving the deal,'' said William
Reddersen, executive vice president of BellSouth, which offers its
own high-speed Internet alternative over telephone lines. ``They
are saying trust me, in an area where they have not allowed their
systems to always be open in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney, another rival, has complained that AOL's 23 million
subscribers ``spend 85 percent of their time within its `walled
garden' rather than the Internet at large.'' That, Disney says,
demonstrates ``the extent of AOL's power and the ability to exclude
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, dismissed
Disney's complaints as nothing more than ``a series of business
disputes that are being dressed up to be policy disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's money, that's what this is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some commissioners suggested that they were uncomfortable
imposing regulations on a marketplace that was developing so
rapidly and unpredictably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are faced with a merger that is born from a revolution that
is in its infancy, and the merger's great promise and possible
dangers rest principally in the future _ a future that changes
rapidly and often unpredictably,'' said Commissioner Michael
Powell. ``It is very difficult to grasp the effect of this
combination on consumers in markets that have barely emerged, or
have yet to be created even.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prevailing view among lobbyists and government
officials is that it is far more likely that the Federal Trade
Commission, which is also reviewing the deal, will impose more
stringent conditions than the FCC But the trade commission's
authority is limited to interpreting antitrust laws and court cases
that give it less leeway than the communications commission,
particularly in cases involving so-called vertical integration
between a producer and distributor. The FCC, by contrast, has the
authority to do virtually anything it wants under federal
telecommunications law, which allows commissioners to approve the
deal if it serves a nebulous standard of promoting the ``public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few of the commissioners at the FCC expressed some
concerns about the implications of a merger that combines the
world's largest Internet service company with the world's largest
media and entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposed merger is not only one of the largest in United
States history, but combines the control of conduit and content in
an unprecedented fashion, implicating issues that are at the core
of our democracy,'' said Gloria Tristani. ``It raises the specter
of barriers to the free flow in the marketplace of ideas that has
been the essence of our democracy. If the shelves in the
marketplace of ideas are stocked by too few hands, a kind of
digital imperialism may replace a well-informed citizenry.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KID PITCHER WON'T FORGET HIS DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see BBN-METS-EXPOS) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In two months, nobody will remember this weird game
except for Grant Roberts. Played partly in a soft mist, the game
will recede into the mists of memory except for the kid pitcher who
made his major league debut, quickly and erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ultimately happens with the Mets this season, they will
obsess on games in late September, when every hit, every error,
will receive, by definition, bonus frequent-flyer miles of terror.
By then, even the Mets' players will probably have forgotten
Thursday's noon game in the odd Walesian chill of July.
</P>
<P>
   Players kept leaving the field with blood dripping from them.
Four different Mets wound up patrolling right field. And somehow
the Mets managed to come back to win, 9-8, in the first game of a
doubleheader against the Montreal Expos, and they won the second
game, too, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid memories of the first game will belong to
Roberts, age 22, who was called up to start because the Mets were
in a pitching crunch. His term with the club was scheduled to be
about as short as it could get: one game, in and out.
</P>
<P>
   This is his sixth season in professional baseball. A 5-5
won-lost record this year makes him something less than a pheenom.
But the Mets needed some innings, so here he was.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts arrived in New York at 12:30 a.m. Thursday. By his own
admission, he ``didn't sleep too well.'' Asked to be more specific,
he said, ``Just about minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody had left him a note telling him to report to Shea
Stadium at 9 a.m., which was fine with him, considering he wasn't
sleeping anyway. When he got to the clubhouse, nobody was there.
Wednesday's drenching rain had canceled a pregame practice, so he
had some more quality time by himself.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the majority of the patrons were day campers, clusters
of blue T-shirts and green T-shirts and yellow T-shirts, who had
arrived on clunky yellow school buses. The campers were far less
likely to shower venom on any errant Mets than the firewater-fueled
alleged adults on your normal, rabid night game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the big leagues. In his warm-ups, Roberts got the
impression the mound was somehow flatter than the one at Norfolk.
For whatever reason, Roberts walked the first batter, and then he
walked the second batter. Then he saw Bobby Valentine, the manager,
trotting out for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts did not know Valentine rarely visits the mound,
preferring to leave those machinations to his pitching coach. But
Valentine said Dave Wallace, the coach, had informed him that ``he
had done everything he could in the bullpen,'' so Valentine felt it
was incumbent on him to try to soothe the young pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I looked real good in my uniform,'' Roberts
recalled later, a bemused smirk indicating he knew Valentine had
made a nice try.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also told Roberts that the mound was fine. The manager
did a lot of gesticulating, as if the two of them were sitting
around a coffee bar debating the meaning of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it was, it didn't work,'' Valentine admitted later.
</P>
<P>
   Now came the carnage. The third batter whacked a hard single
that bounced off the wet grass and hit a hydroplaning Derek Bell
smack on the chin, drawing blood. Bell trudged out of the game via
the bullpen. Bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero, batting a mere .355, lashed a line drive to
third, but Jose Vidro, hitting a sizzling .358, cleared the bases
with a double. By the time the young man left in the second inning,
he would hold an earned run average of 40.50 for his major league
career, all four outs of it. ``Maybe I was choking the ball,''
Roberts conceded later.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he had plenty of company in the clubhouse. There
was Bell with three new stitches in his chin. Soon there was also
Melvin Mora, out of the game with blood dripping from a split nail
on his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were down, 7-2, and a few players told Roberts to pay
attention, that they were going to win this game. He was not about
to dispute them. When they tied the score, the players told Roberts
that he had ``slipped the big tuna hook, that I wasn't just a
little trout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably deserved an `L,''' Roberts said, referring to a
loss. ``But I'm glad the team won.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first game, Roberts was ready to go back to Norfolk.
The Mets were activating their utility infielder Kurt Abbott and
needed a space on the roster. ``I don't think they saw the real
Grant Roberts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he is back here in September, the campers will be in school
and the games will seem so much more vital. &QL;

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ricky Williams is using reverse logic. The
way he sees it, a pass-oriented offense will help the Red Raiders'
running game.
</P>
<P>
   New Texas Tech coach Mike Leach, the architect of pass-happy
offenses at Oklahoma and Kentucky, will have the Red Raiders
throwing the ball 60 to 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new offense will benefit me in varied ways,'' the
Texas Tech senior running back said yesterday at the league's
annual preseason media meeting. ``I think I'll be able to make
longer runs, have less carries and the field will be more open for
me because the defense will be spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Williams rushed for 1,582 yards and averaged nearly 30
carries a game. In two seasons at Tech, he has 28 receptions. The
carries are expected to go down while the receptions should
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Leach has rarely had a running back such as Williams, whose 1999
season was derailed by a knee injury, to complement his passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a runner like Ricky, someone capable of gaining 1,000
yards, will be huge for this offense,'' said Leach, who makes his
head coaching debut Aug. 26 against New Mexico in Lubbock. ``We'll
get Ricky the ball as much as possible, but instead of handing it
to him so much we'll throw it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career it's been Ricky can just run the football and
nothing else,'' Williams, 5-foot-9 and 195 pounds, said. ``I've
wanted to be an in-between back, somebody who can run and catch.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans on doing a lot of both. His goal is to total 1,000
yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't count Ricky Williams out on anything,'' Leach said.
 &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Arrowhead Stadium officials estimate they have sold 35,000 of
their 60,000 ticket allotment for the Big 12 championship game Dec.
2 in Kansas City. Tickets are being sold to only Kansas City Chiefs
season ticket holders, but general public ticket sales will start
sometime in September.
</P>
<P>
   A media poll for the Big 12 Conference race predicts the
following order of finish: North _ Nebraska, Kansas State,
Colorado, Kansas, Iowa State and Missouri. South _ Texas, Oklahoma,
Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and Baylor. Nebraska was
picked to defeat Texas in the Big 12 title game.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A sheepish grin spread across the face of
Nebraska football coach Frank Solich yesterday as he feigned
confusion about a sudden reversal in the way elite teams are
judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard that defense wins championships. But I'm not
hearing that this year, with all we have back on offense,'' said
Solich, whose squad has been pegged, along with Florida State, as
the co-favorites to win college football's national championship
for the 2000 season. ``It seems like all the hype about us has
completely reversed itself since last year.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. The Nebraska team that finished last year
ranked third in the final Associated Press poll got there with a
stifling defense and survived a school-record 49 fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   With six defensive starters lost to graduation, it's the offense
that produced 469 yards _ with just one turnover _ in a 31-21 romp
over Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl that has caught the imagination
of preseason prognosticators. The Cornhuskers return nine offensive
starters, including quarterback Eric Crouch, the top two tailbacks
and four of five offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Even with last year's turnover problems, Nebraska averaged 34.3
points per game. That has proved to be sufficient to earn the
'Huskers a preseason nod as eventual national champions from
``Preview Sports'' and ``Texas Football'' magazines, among others.
The first AP college football poll will not be released until Aug.
5. But Crouch said during yesterday's Big 12 media day that such
faith in a once fumble-prone offense is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that most ratings that have us No. 1 or No. 2. But
I think we expect more of ourselves than anyone else could,'' said
Crouch, a junior who rushed for 889 yards and 16 touchdowns last
season. ``This year, we have much better leadership. Everyone is
focusing on each other and not themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Crouch stands as the personification of the turnaround.
After being told during 1999 fall drills that he would not start,
Crouch left the team. He returned three days later after meeting
with Solich. Eventually, he regained the starting spot, then
received all-conference recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch showed his supportive side yesterday, saying he believes
Nebraska's rebuilt defense will be strong enough to make a
national-title run because the Cornhuskers have ``a lot of great
players'' capable of filling the vacancies. Carlos Polk, an
all-conference middle linebacker, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, I don't feel like we have any questions,'' said
Polk, the team's top returning tackler (83 tackles, 6.5 sacks).
``We're flattered to be the preseason No. 1, but we want to be the
postseason No. 1. If we play as hard as we can and leave it all on
the field, a national championship can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect the Cornhuskers to receive unbridled praise
from rivals despite being a unanimous pick of league coaches to win
the Big 12 North Division. Colorado coach Gary Barnett said
yesterday that the talent gap between Nebraska and their conference
brethren is thinner than outsiders realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are overwhelming favorites,'' Barnett said.
``With 85 scholarships \Rper school\S ... in this conference, you
won't see anybody overwhelm anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the message Solich attempted to convey yesterday while
deflecting speculation that his offense should average more than 40
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything along the lines of trying to project this football
team as the best in our conference or one of the best in the nation
is premature,'' Solich said. ``When you go through the Big 12, you
play your share of tough teams. You can't count anything in terms
of national championships until you get into the season and see how
things go with injuries and how things unfold. You essentially have
the chance to lose a game every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Solich said he's comfortable with the heightened
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way, as a head coach, to control what the
expectations are,'' Solich said. ``There is a lot of optimism about
this team and the players are confident. That's a good thing. When
you have that, the expectations will be there.''

   The Stars are taking baby steps toward bringing defenseman Dave
Manson back into the fold by slightly increasing their offer to the
33-year-old unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made an offer that David and I will consider,''
Manson's agent Don Meehan said yesterday. Meehan said he will talk
with Manson today and then get back to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Before Manson became an unrestricted free agent July 1, he
rejected the Stars' offer of $500,000 per season for one or two
seasons. Manson was paid $1.65 million last season and is looking
for a team where he could fit in as a top-four defenseman. Manson
would play as a third-pair defenseman with the Stars.
\Nsubheds:Network schedule ESPN and ESPN2 released their NHL
television schedules yesterday for the 2000-01 season. The networks
will carry 124 regular-season games, 27 on ESPN and 97 on ESPN2.
The Stars will make a total of 16 appearances, beginning Oct. 4 at
Reunion Arena against Colorado on an exclusive ESPN telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars visit the New Jersey Devils for an ESPN telecast Dec.
20, and ESPN2 will televise the Devils' only trip to Texas on Jan.
24. The Stars play eight times on ESPN, including another matchup
against Colorado (March 11), two games against St. Louis (Feb. 11,
March 25), and a meeting against Detroit (Feb. 18).
\Nsubheds:Rookie camp The Stars are scheduled to hold a rookie camp
Aug. 10-20 at Dr Pepper StarCenter in Irving. Most of the club's
young talent from it's minor-league affiliate, the Michigan
K-Wings, will be in attendance, plus the Stars' 2000 first-round
draft pick Steve Ott. \Nsubheds:Pro scout hired The Stars named
Paul McIntosh as the club's new professional scout yesterday.
McIntosh most recently served as vice president of hockey
operations (1998-2000) as well as general manager (1996-97) for the
London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. In 1998, McIntosh was
named the OHL and Canadian Hockey League Executive of the Year.

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By TIM PRICE c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram When Gold Nugget pulled a 16-1 upset in the
$250,000 Dallas Turf Cup six weeks ago at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie, owner Leland Cook got so excited about his horse that he
gave his cowboy hat the Frisbee treatment and let it fly from his
seat five floors up in the grandstand.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He got his hat back, but the people in Southern California might
think Cook still has lost his top when he shows up with Gold Nugget
and runs him in the $400,000 Eddie Read Handicap on Sunday at Del
Mar. Gold Nugget might have won a nice race in his own back yard at
Lone Star, but traveling to the West Coast and running in a Grade I
race like the Eddie Read is a totally different environment.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook, a Corsicana resident who owns Gold Nugget along with
his wife, Sue, isn't naive. He has secured the riding services of
jockey Alex Solis for this trip to California, and he has
videotaped races turned in by some of the horses he expects to run
against in the Eddie Read. So, he has a handle on what might be
ahead at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a light field,'' Cook said, ``as far as numbers go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only six or seven are in there against us. But all of them are
top-notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch is right, for the field should include Dark
Moondancer, Ladies Din, Falcon Flight, Sunshine Street and Chester
House. All of those horses have won stakes races in Southern
California or Europe in the past year, and all of them mark a big
improvement over the last group of Southern California horses Gold
Nugget raced against.
</P>
<P>
   That came in the Dallas Turf Cup, when Gold Nugget beat Southern
California shippers Northern Quest, Army Of One and Self Feeder.
Northern Quest hasn't competed since the Lone Star race. But Army
Of One and Self Feeder have come back, and their performances make
the Dallas Turf Cup look anything other than a key race.
</P>
<P>
   Army Of One ran fifth in an optional $100,000 claimer at
Hollywood. Self Feeder finished fourth, 81/2 lengths back, in the
Grade II Sunset Handicap. But he had finished second in a Grade I
before he left for Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those horses had something taken out of them by the Texas
heat. But that doesn't explain why Sultry Substitute ran a game
second in the Grade II Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park after
running third in the Grade III Lone Star Park Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Dallas Turf Cup, this field likely won't let Gold
Nugget get away to an easy lead. Both Sunshine Street and Dark
Moondancer ran on the lead or close to it when Dark Moondancer won
the American Handicap at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it can be done. A horse named Caherdaniel won a
minor-stakes race at Retama Park, then was shipped to Del Mar for
his next start in the How Now Stakes, which he won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse, just about every time we've stepped him up against
competition, he's answered the call,'' Cook said. ``He deserves
this chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Gold Nugget does come through?
</P>
<P>
   ``I may never find my hat again,'' Cook said, ``I'd throw it so
far and high.''
\Nsubheds:LATE SCRATCHES... \Nsubheds:Getting on track The
adjusting of the dirt main track racing surface will continue for
at least another year at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie. Lone Star
general manager Steve Sexton confirmed this week that track
management met with trainers before the end of the thoroughbred
season to plan changes to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star added about 500 cubic yards of pine-tree mulch to the
track last year and added another 1,500 cubic yards this year, but
trainers still noticed ``impact-type soreness'' with their horses,
said Texas Horsemen's Partnership executive director Tommy
Azopardi.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said Lone Star has a goal of having the new materials
onto the track before the start of the quarter horse season Sept.
21, but it might have to wait until after the 11-week season.
\Nsubheds:Significant victory The quarter horse season at Lone Star
is 55 days away, and one of the standout horses expected to race
this year in Grand Prairie is getting into form. Significant Speed,
who qualified last year to the Dash For Cash Futurity at Lone Star,
won the $152,911 Rainbow Derby last week at Ruidoso Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The win was big for the filly because she often lost her races
in the late stages last year. She led the All American Futurity
last year until A Delightful Dasher and Chicks Call Me collared
her. But in the Rainbow, A Delightful Dasher was fourth and Chicks
Call Me was even further back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran a giant race,'' said Weatherford resident Gus Barakis,
who owns Significant Speed. ``This year she's matured a lot. She's
just mentally tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Barakis said Significant Speed, trained by Sleepy Gilbreath and
ridden by Roy Baldillez, is scheduled to race next in the trials
for the All American Derby on Aug. 18. Her ultimate goal is the
Texas Classic Derby in November at Lone Star. \Nsubheds:Final
workout Gold Nugget, the Texas-bred champion turf horse at the
recently completed Lone Star thoroughbred season, got in his final
bit of work before his scheduled appearance at the Grade I Eddie
Read Handicap on Sunday at Del Mar. He covered five furlongs on the
main track in 593/5 seconds and galloped out another quarter mile
for a total time of 1:13.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Randy Mayfield said the colt made the trip Tuesday to
the San Diego area in good shape. He's being stabled at the barn of
Keith Desormeaux, who finished seventh in the trainer standings at
Lone Star and who has stalls at Del Mar.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON ... Heritage Of Gold faces key rematch at
Saratoga There was a time not too long ago when a rematch between
Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness Stakes winner
Red Bullet looked to be the best thing since the hype preceding the
heavyweight boxing rematch between Lennox Lewis and Evander
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the second fight turned out to be blah. And Pegasus-Bullet
II won't even happen as long as Pegasus gets closer to his
syndicated breeding season, and as long as the Bullet continues to
develop ulcers in his digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   A more than suitable replacement should come Sunday at Saratoga.
Heritage Of Gold vs. Beautiful Pleasure will be the rematch of the
year if both face each other as expected in the Grade I Go For Wand
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Of Gold, last year's Horse of the Year at Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie's thoroughbred season, was hardly noticed
when she ran third to Beautiful Pleasure in the Breeders' Cup
Distaff in November. But she drilled Beautiful Pleasure in the
Grade I Apple Blossom Stakes in April at Oaklawn Park.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Of Gold had the benefit of a race over the track a
month earlier at Oaklawn. But it was Beautiful Pleasure's season
debut, highly evident when she missed the start of the Apple
Blossom and gave away at least two lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Amoss, who trains Heritage Of Gold, knows there is no way
Beautiful Pleasure will blow a similar race again. Although
Heritage Of Gold has won two races at Churchill Downs since the
Apple Blossom, Beautiful Pleasure regained her championship form
when she won her starts in the Grade II Shuvee Handicap and Grade I
Hempstead Handicap at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I watched her race in the Hempstead, I knew we couldn't
make any mistakes in Heritage Of Gold's training,'' Amoss said.
``It still may not be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoss said Heritage Of Gold is scheduled to make two undisclosed
starts before she returns to Churchill for the Breeders' Cup on
Nov. 4.

CHENEY SLIPS IN EXPLAINING A VOTE ON FREEING MANDELA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he made the rounds of the television talk shows
Thursday morning, Dick Cheney confidently defended his votes in the
1980s against gun control, abortion rights and education spending,
but he slipped when he tried to justify his opposition to an
obscure resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release
Nelson Mandela from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately pounced on the issue and vowed to use it
against the Republican ticket in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Today'' show, Cheney, the expected Republican vice
presidential nominee, said his vote was based on a disagreement
over whether economic sanctions against South Africa were the best
way to end apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate that we had at the time had to do with how we could
best pursue our policies in South Africa,'' Cheney said. ``Nobody
supported apartheid. We were all against it. But there was a big
debate over the best leverage we could use to get Nelson Mandela
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``One school of thought said that there should be sanctions
imposed on South Africa, that American companies should be
prohibited from operating in South Africa, that there shouldn't be
any trade with South Africa. The other school of thought said,
`Wait a minute,' that, in fact, the only good jobs that were
available to black South Africans were with American firms. If you
wanted a company that was going to provide opportunities and not
discriminate, you had to go to American firms, and the people that
would be hurt if we forced American firms out of South Africa were
those very people we were trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney then said, ``This notion that somehow I was opposed to
freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical Al Gore distortion of a record
_ a point he's trying to make because he doesn't want to talk about
real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over sanctions was a big issue in Congress in
1986, and Cheney's description of the two sides was accurate.
Before the year was out, Congress overrode President Ronald
Reagan's veto of a bill that imposed sanctions, the first time
Reagan had been rebuffed like that on a foreign-policy matter.
Cheney supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of sanctions never came up in the debate on the
Mandela resolution. The opposition to it was based on the belief of
the right wing of the Republican Party in the House that the
African National Congress, Mandela's party and the leading
political voice against apartheid, was dominated by communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resolution is potentially a step toward a communist
dictatorship in South Africa,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., not
yet a member of the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said: ``Let us look at the ANC and see
what it consists of exactly. Nineteen of the 30 members of the ANC
are known members of the South African Communist Party, and we
believe as many as 26.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists said Thursday they expected to use the
Mandela vote against the Republicans this fall, particularly in
commercials on radio stations popular with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush has now said to the African-American community,
`I give you my person, my candidate for vice president, and my
person said no to Nelson Mandela when he was in prison,''' said
Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, co-chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., the chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, said, ``I think at least Cheney ought to apologize to
President Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 resolution was nonbinding. It expressed the sense of
the House that Reagan should encourage the white government of
South Africa to release Mandela and other political prisoners, to
recognize the ANC as the political representative of South African
blacks and to begin negotiations that could lead to a settlement
with the black majority.
</P>
<P>
   It was offered by Democrats mostly to goad Republicans into
casting a vote that could embarrass them in an election year. It
came up under rules that prohibited amendments and required a
two-thirds majority for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The House debated it for less than an hour, and it was defeated,
245-177, shy of the 282 votes needed for a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   On the vote, 215 Democrats and 30 Republicans were in favor; 32
Democrats and 145 Republicans, including Cheney, were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the fourth-ranking member of the Republican leadership
at the time, did not speak in the debate.

<P>
   Bud Selig is an intelligent, reasonable man. When the baseball
commissioner clearly and passionately talks about the problems
facing the sport, he makes a great deal of sense.
</P>
<P>
   Economic disparity between clubs is a serious issue, and
something must be done. The recommendations of the panel on
baseball economics make sense. Put a 50 percent tax on payrolls
above $84 million to rein in the free spenders like the Yankees.
Increase the sharing of local revenues to help out teams like the
Expos and the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes sense after a conversation with the commissioner.
Only a professional cynic wouldn't see the problems and acknowledge
the solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, of course, has a professional cynic. It's called the
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   The union's response to the economic panel's report and
recommendations has been low key, but there have been enough hints
dropped to indicate that the players are not in total agreement
about either the problem or the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which wasn't pleased that it had no representation on
the panel, is skeptical about the claims that 27 of the 30 clubs
lost money in the five-year period from 1995-99, or at least why
the losses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be one enormous failure in the discussion,''
union chief Donald Fehr told Bloomberg News. ``You're looking at a
time period that began during or immediately after the strike. The
problems of many clubs may have been exacerbated or in some cases
occasioned by the labor dispute _ which was forced by the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly possible to debate whether the owners or the
players were most responsible for the 1994 strike that wiped out
the World Series, but one thing is inarguable. The dispute was
caused by the owners' insistence on a salary cap to close the
gaping chasm between the payrolls of the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   There's no talk of a salary cap this time, but the 50 percent
tax on payrolls above $84 million could have a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also suggested that clubs not receive a greater share
of revenue sharing unless they meet a minimum payroll of $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   A payroll range of roughly $40 million to $84 million might be
good for competitive balance, but anything that acts like a salary
cap will be met with hostility by the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they come out and say it's a salary cap or whether
they try to disguise it as something else, I know right now that's
not going to happen,'' said Rangers pitcher Rick Helling, a member
of the union board. ``We've looked at it every way you can look at
it, and it's not in the best interests of baseball from the
players' standpoint or the owners' standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The union also is extremely skeptical about the accounting
methods that show clubs continue to lose money every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see teams building new stadiums left and right, and you
see owners paying big franchise fees, and you wonder why would
anyone pay $200 million so they can lose $20 million every year,''
Helling said. ``These are smart businessmen, and they're not going
to give money away year after year like they claim they do.
Economically, it doesn't make any sense and yet every owner comes
out and claims they're losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Players Association does agree with some of the things
brought out in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely some positives there to it,'' Helling said.
``We've known since the last deal that revenue sharing was
something that needed to be fixed. I don't think it was or ever
will be a positive if the bigger-market teams are paying the
smaller-market teams and they're just putting it in their pockets.
We need to figure out some way to where they're using that to help
build their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the union doesn't have a view of Selig as a
reasonable man with common-sense solutions. And that doesn't bode
well for a peaceful resolution when it comes time to bargain for a
new collective bargaining agreement for the 2002 season.

 &HT;    A rebuilt Sanks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Two years ago, when his heart was about the only
thing heavier than his thighs, Georgia running back Jasper Sanks
nearly walked away from football.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1998 freshman season that included only 10 carries in
two games, Sanks says he was ready to leave Georgia. He had arrived
in Athens with enormous expectations, but he failed to live up to
them because of his bulging waistline and an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about quitting,'' Sanks said. ``I just thought maybe
it wasn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't worth it when he wasn't playing. Weeks before the 1998
Peach Bowl, Sanks said Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan told him that he
wouldn't play in the game because he had not earned the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everybody was against me,'' Sanks said.
``Everybody was asking me, `How much do you weigh?' It was
embarrassing. I blame myself. I didn't prepare myself at all. I was
lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   `I TOOK A LOT OF THINGS FOR GRANTED'
</P>
<P>
   Sanks considered transferring to a smaller school but decided he
couldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of things for granted,'' he said. ``I was reading
all the magazines and listening to what people were saying about
me, about how good I was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that because of what I did in high school, I should
have been out there. I wasn't working. Every time my name came up,
they were saying, `Sanks is a bust. He's a bust.' It was like my
name was forgotten or buried.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from his career at Carver High School in
Columbus, where Sanks was named a Parade All-American as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``All freshmen think about going home or transferring at some
point,'' said his father, Joecephus Sanks. ``He was just going
through that phase. I tried to explain to him coming out of high
school that a lot was expected of him but that he just needed to
set his own goals. He had a typical freshman year, and I think it
might have affected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of Sanks' freshman season, Joe Tereshinski, the
program's assistant strength-and-conditioning coach, took the
player under his wing. They started working out together before the
1998 Peach Bowl, and then resumed the workouts after Sanks
underwent surgery for a hernia in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks lost about eight pounds before last season and emerged as
the Bulldogs' starting running back. Even though he was still
overweight and had shoulder problems, Sanks rushed for 896 yards,
the school's second-highest total in seven seasons. He ran for more
than 100 yards in three consecutive games, including a 156-yard
effort against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still disappointed last year,'' Sanks said. ``I wasn't
running with any confidence, and I was running timid. I was
worrying about making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   MISTAKES ACT AS MOTIVATOR
</P>
<P>
   His sophomore season probably will be remembered most for two
critical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Against fifth-ranked Florida, the Bulldogs trailed 16-14 in the
fourth quarter. Georgia drove deep into Florida territory, but
Sanks fumbled, and the Gators recovered at the 16-yard line.
Florida scored to take a 23-14 lead, and later added another
touchdown for a 30-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month later, Sanks was the victim of a controversial
call in the Bulldogs' 51-48 overtime loss at Georgia Tech. With
nine seconds left in regulation, officials ruled that Sanks fumbled
at Tech's 2-yard line, even though replays showed that he was down
before the ball came loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two fumbles really tore me apart,'' Sanks said. ``I play
those two games over and over in my head every day. Not a day goes
by that I don't think about those fumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dwelling on the mistakes, Sanks says, he is using
them as motivation. He spent more than a month this summer working
with a personal trainer in Atlanta, swimming and sprinting to
improve his speed. He returned to Athens in early June to
participate in the team's voluntary conditioning program, and he is
taking Taibo classes to improve his flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   WORKOUT PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week, Sanks runs at 6:30 a.m. He lifts weights at 11
a.m., and then runs again with his offensive linemen at 3 p.m. An
hour later, he runs passing routes with quarterbacks, receivers and
other running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper has worked really hard in the offseason,'' Donnan said.
``I think he understands what his kind of ability is. He is
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work seems to be paying off. Sanks has lost nearly 20
pounds since his freshman year and now weighs 218. His body-fat
percentage has dropped from 13 percent to 4 percent, and he has
shaved nearly two-tenths of a seconds off his 40-yard dash time,
from 4.67 to 4.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stopped feeling sorry for myself,'' Sanks said. ``I'm a
totally different person now as far as my work ethic. I grew up and
matured. I got serious.''
</P>
<P>
   EAGER AND READY TO GO
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have noticed. When preseason camp opens next
month, Sanks will battle redshirt freshman Bruce Thornton and
newcomers Albert Hollis and Musa Smith for the starting job. It is
Sanks' job to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said Jasper was slacking off last year and
that his focus wasn't there,'' Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter
said. ``But Jasper's been the same person the past three years. I
think the expectations were so high when he came in that we
expected Jasper to be the next Herschel Walker. That's the status
he was given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a difficult time handling that,'' Carter said.
``We've talked a lot the last several months. He knows that he's
made mistakes, and he's owned up to them. But Jasper has worked
hard since he's been here. He's going to blow them away this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sanks watched the Baltimore Ravens choose former
Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis with the fifth pick of the NFL
Draft. Sanks and Lewis, a former Douglass High School star, were
considered the state's top two college prospects in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a freshman All-American for the Vols in 1997, while
Sanks spent the year at Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia,
after he failed to qualify academically at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Jamal in the draft really motivated me,'' Sanks said.
``Despite the rivalry people tried to make out between us, I always
respected him. He was determined and stayed focused, and all of it
paid off for him in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Jamal's situation and contrast it with mine. He got
his chances early in his career. I'm going to get my chances later.
I can't wait to put the pads on again. I haven't felt this good
since high school. I'm hungry again.''

DESIGN NOTEBOOK: THE RADICAL RANCH PITCHES ITS TENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In the arc of a flashlight beam, Patrick McCue held up
a lump of caliche, a crusty calcium-rich soil, and set it against
the rough-edged earthen wall of his new house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we were, stumbling to get this stuff out of the way, and
we ended up making the house to look just like it,'' he said.
McCue, 40, a captain in the Phoenix Fire Department, whose fiery
red hair blends seamlessly into his sunburnt face, kicked a few
rocks out of the spot of light and set down a metal kitchen chair
for his wife, Marika, 37, who is a fire captain herself.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 10 p.m. and 100 degrees in the quiet neighborhood
sprawling around the base of Squaw Mountain, a jagged landmark. A
full moon was rising over a distant ridge. The only other light was
a sizzling spray of sparks bouncing off metal being welded nearby.
</P>
<P>
   After two grueling years of construction, day and night, the
McCue house is nearing completion on a work cycle squeezed between
shifts: 24 hours at the firehouse, followed by 48 hours on the
building site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done nothing social, we don't celebrate birthdays, our
families are upset with us, but who else is going to do the work?''
McCue said, shrugging broad swimmer's shoulders. ``It's a matter of
`Let's dig in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Five volunteers _ fellow firefighters and an architecture
student from Arizona State University _ were picking up tools and
tossing leftover Chuy's tacos in the trash, finishing, by hand and
in their off-duty hours, a radical work of residential
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The four-room, 2,400-square-foot McCue house is made from 75
percent salvaged material, including trusses rejected from a
ballpark, high-quality but scratched glass donated by a
house-building friend and surplus steel picked up at junkyards. The
walls are of poured earth, and the roof is a polyvinyl tent fabric,
hovering, lightweight and taut as a spider web. This is the first
American home to use tensile fabric in a starring role, according
to Ferrari, the French manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when architectural zing often comes with the ring of a
multimillion-dollar price tag, the McCue house shows that those of
modest means can still innovate. The desert's vistas have
challenged architectural pioneers for much of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The house was designed by Marwan Al-Sayed, an architect born in
Baghdad, with Mies Grybaitis, a glass artist. Curators at the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York selected the
project while it was still in germination for inclusion in ``Design
Culture Now,'' an exhibition of groundbreaking work that is running
through Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with the sensuous quality of the house,'' said
Donald Albrecht, a curator. ``There are those adobelike walls of
the desert. Then the super-duper modern roof system. It's like
transplanting the ancient desert architecture of one culture and
adding it to the modern desert architecture of another.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has cost the couple more than the $300,000 they
budgeted to build their house, which they have scrappily financed
with short-term construction loans and a lot of overtime. And no
small human cost.
</P>
<P>
   If the house inspired design aficionados while still on paper,
it brought about more than a few extraordinary feats of communal
devotion at the site itself. Friends with no particular attraction
to avant-garde architecture quickly realized that this house was
going to be special. And they wanted to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the firefighters, the labor force included Terry
McCue, McCue's brother, who has done much of the welding. After an
accident on the site partly severed ligaments, tendons and nerves
in his wrist, he lost sensation in his hand but continues to work.
``If we could have escaped that, we would have been home free,''
McCue said, still shaken.
</P>
<P>
   McCue's mother is sewing translucent fabric to be used in place
of glass or paneling for the few interior doors _ more like shades,
really _ in the mostly open-plan house. His father has been
recording the project in photos for a book.
</P>
<P>
   For an experimental house, it is shaped simply: part monumental
earthwork, part railroad flat. Its rectangular mass _ 25 feet wide
and 100 feet long _ straddles the bed of a dried-out creek, or
wash, which can fill during a severe summer thunderstorm. The
18-inch-thick walls render the house solidly earthbound, while the
silvery two-ply tent roof sweeps as high as 14 feet overhead _ a
permanent cloud, tethered by rope and steel, giving luminous shade
to the interior. By day, the temperature drops _ if not
precipitously, at least notably _ as one steps out of the broiling
sunlight into the ever so slightly blue-tinged spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to reduce things to their purest level,'' said
Al-Sayed, 38, who received an architecture degree at Columbia
University and studied desert culture in the Sahara on a traveling
fellowship. ``Coming from the culture that I do, I'm especially
interested in issues of the earth and the sky and how to bring them
into the architecture. It's a different relationship to the
out-of-doors than you find in the classic American house, which is
a lot more internally oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan was to make a house of substantial mass that was
flooded with light, and he drew inspiration from a line in an
Egyptian film he recalled: ``Mamam, Mamam, the moon is at the door.
Should I let her in or shut the door?''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sayed has given the house a name, the House of Earth and
Light, and Grybaitis, his collaborator and fiancee, has cast that
name into a green-glass illuminated cornerstone at the front of the
house. Although Al-Sayed spent more than 10 years in the New York
office of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien and was the project
architect for their expansion of the Phoenix Museum of Art, this
will be his first solo building.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going out on a limb with this house,'' said
Grybaitis, 32, who came to the United States from Australia four
years ago. ``In terms of our career, it was either going to be the
end or it was going to be the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the irrepressible McCues, the project was a response to
their frustration with the stiflingly standardized development
common in Phoenix. Indeed, seen from an airplane flying over the
flat-as-a-frying-pan landscape, many residential lots look more
like hotdog buns on a tray than houses. The McCues used to live in
one such ranchburger. And no sooner had they finished four years of
renovating it than McCue started saying to himself: ``Is this all
there is? I'm not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple promptly sold the house and used the money to buy
land in Alta Vista, a small, iconoclastic neighborhood just east of
the golf course of the famed Biltmore Hotel, partly designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright. The neighborhood had its own architectural
pedigree, with three Wright houses, including a burned-out ruin
left standing, along with recent construction by Williams and
Tsien, and a copper-finned, drum-shape home by Will Bruder, also of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this neighborhood could accommodate something
different,'' said McCue, who is also an inventor and metal artist.
``And that anything we built wouldn't stick out like a sore
thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sayed met the McCues just about when he and Grybaitis decided
they had had enough of Phoenix. Al-Sayed had arrived in 1994 to
work on the museum. When the project was completed, he headed back
to New York, where an apartment he had renovated caused a stir,
centered on a sun court in the middle of its living room. It was a
glass canyon open to rain, snow and, probably, falling ash from
trash-burning. Then they met the McCues.
</P>
<P>
   It might be said that Al-Sayed's inspiration for the house was a
telephone pole. ``There are few bus shelters in Phoenix,'' the
architect said. ``And I started noticing how people would line up
in the shade of a telephone pole just to get out of the sun. Shade
is like water here. It's a precious commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   His idea was to design a house that took advantage of the
extraordinary light in Phoenix, while shading the inhabitants from
light's harsher effects. Thus, the tent, a roofing material that
had already proved itself viable in places like Denver
International Airport and the Haj Terminal of the King Abdul Aziz
International Airport in Jidda, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sayed came up with a layered system: the top skin of
fire-resistant polyvinyl material would deflect more than 80
percent of the radiant heat; a second skin of coated polyvinyl is
waterproof. When cleaning time comes, this firefighting couple will
just pull out the power hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, none of this technology was even available,''
said Al-Sayed, who even in the biblical heat of Phoenix was layered
in a long-sleeved shirt and an undershirt (a self-insulating trick
that his father taught him after years of working in Saudi Arabia).
</P>
<P>
   A soft light pierces the roof, making it possible to see the
shadows of birds and planes as they fly overhead. McCue and his
brother made the trusses from salvage recovered for $300 from
Phoenix's Bank One ballpark, with its high-tech retractable dome.
</P>
<P>
   If the roof aspires to near-weightlessness, the thick walls go
for bold monumentality. Originally, the architect considered the
ancient technique of rammed earth, but rejected it as too
labor-intensive and cavelike. He settled on poured earth, laced
with his own recipe of cement plus soil, which is sloughed into
wooden molds. It is an unforgiving medium and requires huge
forethought: every window and door opening, plumbing and electrical
passage, even the placement of switch plates, had to be determined
before the house was cast as a solid piece of earth.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the designers have made something surreal out of the
everyday. Al-Sayed counts Federico Fellini as an inspiration. What
could be more contradictory than fortress walls, a gossamer roof
and cast glass? But they all mesh seamlessly. The entry door is
more than eight feet tall, made of bottle-green glass cast by
Grybaitis, using a section of street grating as her mold.
</P>
<P>
   The entire slot-shape house is exposed upon entry, with the
living room off to the left. There, the solid masonry gives way to
wide glass windows on both sides, offering views, partly obscured
by the hilly terrain and Squaw Mountain. (Imagine Philip Johnson's
glass house, circa 1000 B.C.) To the right, the bedroom is partly
concealed by a glass container, which serves as a walk-in closet.
</P>
<P>
   The house is positioned with its narrow end facing west, to
minimize the full brunt of the sun. A six-foot overhang of roof
fabric shades the south side, lest the living room turn into a
sauna. A swimming pool for McCue, who races competitively, will lap
the exterior wall of their bedroom, an idea Al-Sayed borrowed from
a Moroccan hotel that was once a sultan's palace. He has included a
slot window at the foot of the bed for pool gazing.
</P>
<P>
   Between the open living room and the bedroom is a study, more
like a conversation pit, sunk into the concrete, with a low window
for peering out at the desert floor. Bookcases were molded directly
into the earthen walls.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced to haiku simplicity, the house nevertheless has endless
complexity and engrossing nuance, from its steel toggle light
switches, reminiscent of the early houses of Le Corbusier and other
modern pioneers, to the constantly fluctuating shadows of trusses,
which mark the passage of the day like sundials.
</P>
<P>
   At twilight, even those massive walls seem to prickle with
light: McCue has cut 300 discs of glass to fit deftly into the
holes left by dowels during the casting. Grybaitis taught her how
to use a glass drill.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot evening last week, McCue, one of the first women to
become a firefighter in Phoenix, was eager to move in at last.
``We've got to get it done,'' she said. They have been living with
their yellow Labrador in a horse trailer parked on the site. ``Some
nights, my ankles are hurting, my knuckles are dragging in the
dirt, and I think I can't do this any longer. But somehow we do
keep pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   When she and her husband finally move into their house, in two
weeks, there is no doubt how she will respond when the moon comes
calling. She will welcome it through the open glass door, the
windows, the pierced walls _ and most especially through the
diaphanous sheltering roof.

 &HT;    Miller steps up to seat in Senate
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pledging to serve with the same bipartisan spirit
as his predecessor, former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller ascended
Thursday to a Senate seat he had first pursued 20 years ago, nearly
wrecking his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 68-year-old Democrat, becomes the 62nd senator from
Georgia. He succeeds Paul Coverdell, a leading light of the
Republican Party, who died in office July 18 after a massive
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Although the day belonged to Miller, Coverdell's absence hung
heavy in the Senate chamber. Colleagues continued their outpouring
of sorrow in speeches before the swearing-in, and Miller used his
brief remarks to pay tribute to the man with whom he once served in
the Georgia state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, I am a different man from Paul Coverdell,''
Miller said in his North Georgia twang. ``I have rarely been
accused of giving soft answers. And in my day, I suppose, I have
uttered more than my share of grievous words that have stirred up
anger. But I also have a commitment to getting things done for my
state and our nation, and a commitment to work with anyone
regardless of party who shares that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Coverdell had a powerful faith in bipartisan progress,''
Miller continued, ``and I intend to keep that faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Miller cast his first Senate vote _ for the Department of
Defense appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Miller remained without any Republican challengers Thursday, and
U.S. Rep. Bob Barr announced he will not challenge the former
governor.
</P>
<P>
   With Barr's announcement, all but one of Georgia's eight
Republican congressmen have indicated they will not run in November
for the remaining four years of the term to which Coverdell was
elected. The eighth representative, Jack Kingston of Savannah, is
said to be leaning against a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was considered among the most likely to jump into the race
because he has the largest campaign account among the so-called G-8
Republicans, and he faces a potentially difficult battle to retain
his House seat in 2002 after re-districting.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Georgia congressional delegation, former Republican
Sen. Mack Mattingly remained coy about whether he would enter the
race. Reached at his home on St. Simons Island, Mattingly said he
would make a decision by next Friday, when qualifying ends.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate mentioned among Republicans is Lewis
Jordan, former chief executive officer of ValuJet, now flying as
AirTran. Party officials like the fact that Jordan is wealthy
enough to help finance his campaign. Jordan has made no
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Any GOP candidate who waits until the last day of qualifying
would miss a golden opportunity by not declaring before next week's
Republican National Convention, which starts Monday. The
conventions are generally a great place to raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the newly appointed senator, will serve less than four
months before the Nov. 7 special election.
</P>
<P>
   He wasted little time preparing for that contest. Thursday
morning, before his swearing-in, he held a fund-raiser at a
Washington hotel that attracted much of the K Street lobbying
community.
</P>
<P>
   Several major Georgia companies, including Coca-Cola, Southern
Co. and AFLAC, were represented, along with a number of Democratic
senators, according to Georgia lawyer Keith Mason, a longtime
Miller adviser. The event raised about $200,000, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred it the way I used to do it, when I ran
a statewide race for $175,000 in 1974, by just going around and
seeing folks in courthouses and county squares,'' said Miller.
``But that has become part of it. If that is the price that one has
to pay, I'll do what I need to do to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller moved swiftly to put a campaign team in place, retaining
Tim Phillips, who ran Sen. Max Cleland's successful Senate race in
1996, to manage his campaign. Miller also brought in Charlie
Harman, former Sen. Sam Nunn's administrative assistant, to manage
his Senate transition team.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, who along with James Carville engineered President
Clinton's 1992 election, wrote the outline of Miller's first Senate
speech. Both Carville and Begala will serve as informal advisers to
the campaign, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 of the 100 members of the Senate were present when
Miller, wearing a dark blue suit and a red tie, entered the chamber
for the swearing-in ceremony. Clutching a tan Bible given to him by
former Gov. Joe Frank Harris when Miller was sworn in as governor
in 1991, Miller was escorted to the dais by Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), the Senate president pro tem,
administered the oath at 11:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Miller received a standing ovation afterward, and senators from
both parties lined up to congratulate him. Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) pinned a gold insignia representing the Senate
onto Miller's lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) then took the floor to
welcome their newest member.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that we have heavy hearts still for our friend,
Senator Paul Coverdell,'' Lott said. ``But we appreciate the way in
which he has approached this position already. He is one of our
colleagues. He's a senator. We welcome him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's arrival tips the balance the power a tad, giving the
Democrats 46 senators to the GOP's 54. If Miller were to win
election in November and the Democrats managed to net five more
seats, they would hold the majority in the upper legislative
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's rise to the Senate brings his political career full
circle. In 1980, an upstart Miller challenged the Democratic
establishment in Georgia and took on Sen. Herman Talmadge in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a bitter, divisive contest, Miller spent the next 10
years rehabilitating his career before being elected governor in
1990. In floor remarks, Daschle hailed Miller as the elder
statesman of Georgia politics, chronicling a career that began in
1960 when he was elected to the state Senate and _ until this week
_ appeared to have ended when he left the governor's office in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   After his swearing-in, Miller said he hadn't had time to reflect
on the twists and turns of his political career. ``Twenty years is
a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he would make no policy statements until he had time
to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the new kid on the block and I understand that,'' Miller
said. ``You also know, if you know anything about me, that I will
come up with some ideas, and that I will make some decisions, and I
will not be a shrinking violet.''

 &HT;    Get a load of Napster quickly
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Juan Uribe wasn't caught napping.
</P>
<P>
   He was online, of course, when he electronically got the news
from cnn.com that a federal judge was ordering Napster Inc. to shut
down its Web site that has spawned millions of music trades on the
Internet. Deadline: midnight today.
</P>
<P>
   The next address Uribe typed in was ``www.napster.com'' _ and
there he stayed for about the next five hours, getting a steady
stream of complimentary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out immediately and we said, 'We've got to get on,
we've got to get on, we've got to get all that we can right now,'''
said Uribe. In all, Uribe said he downloaded about 75 songs, from
hip-hop artist Jay-Z to Colombian musician Carlos Vives, in
anticipation of a possible Napster shutdown. Not bad, said Uribe,
who was at work as a computer systems engineer in Fort Lauderdale
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed us to get a lot of stuff for free,'' he said of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   A judge hearing a lawsuit filed by the recording industry
granted an injunction Wednesday that would effectively shut down
Napster Friday night for infringing on copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's lawyers asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
stay the order, arguing that the decision would bring down the
company and force it to lay off its 40 employees within days.
</P>
<P>
   Local punk-rockers, folk-lovers, classic-rock buffs _ they all
sounded off about the judge's ruling and the future of music, and
they got in some last-minute downloading as Napster's hours quickly
dwindled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site
and to download their own tunes _ for nothing. Users can also share
music tastes with each other in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The site had increased traffic Thursday, but no specific numbers
were available and no system problems were reported, said Tracy
Mlakar, spokeswoman for San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 70 million people were expected to be using Napster
by year's end unless the service is halted, U.S. District Judge
Marilyn Hall Patel said the San Mateo, Calif.-based company was
encouraging ``wholesale infringing'' against industry copyrights
and would likely lose at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America sued Napster in
December, accusing it of creating a musical black market online.
The association estimates that song-swapping via Napster by an
estimated 20 million people worldwide has cost the music industry
more than $300 million in lost sales. The heavy metal band
Metallica also sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're elated,'' Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said. ``Sharing
is such a warm, cuddly, friendly word . . . this is not sharing,
it's duplicating.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder Shawn Fanning, who started Napster (his nickname in high
school, a reference to his ``nappy'' frizzy hair) last year while a
student at Northeastern University in Boston, said in a short
Webcast, ``We will keep fighting for Napster and for your right to
share music over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a real drag to 15-year-old Jamie Warren. Now, he
said, how's he going to promote his band, Benjamin Distasteful and
the Wumberlogs? He'd hoped some free samples on Napster, a
high-profile venue, could give the band a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metallica started this whole stupid thing and complaining, but
they have millions of dollars so I don't know why they have to
complain about it,'' Warren said. He said he'd downloaded several
songs by Thursday afternoon since hearing the news, and he planned
on getting a few more before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Napster gives him access to hard-to-find songs you can't get
from the radio or many record stores. Like music from The Misfits
and Discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll use other sites that offer downloads, but he said
he'd gotten used to Napster and was hesitant to turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the music industry locally said it was
fruitless to try to stop the downloading of music, pointing to
other sites like gnutella.wego.com and scour.com, which offer
similar services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie was already out of the bottle anyway,'' said Steve
Rullman, 32, who runs a locally based Web site _ thehoneycomb.com _
that lets users to listen to new bands of all types.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, Gnutella's file-sharing was down because of
``unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision,''
according to the Web site. The Napster site was especially
susceptible to a court ruling because the songs are listed on the
site, unlike some other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Area record vendors said the online downloading could actually
help business by exposing listeners to music they otherwise
wouldn't be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study of more than 2,200 online music fans by New
York-based Jupiter Communications suggests that users of
music-sharing programs are 45 percent more likely to increase their
music purchasing than fans who aren't trading digital bootlegs
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps promote the band,'' said a manager at Downtown Books
and CDs in Lake Worth, who goes by the name Kenny 5. ``They like
the song (after hearing it online), they go out and buy the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Pruszynski, 32, who owns Music-X-Change in Jupiter,
said that may be true for the near future only.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to look ahead, say, another five to ten years,'' he
said, ``I would say the smart bet would be to get out of this
business.''

SOX MAKE SOME NOISE WITH DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Mass. _ Taking advantage of the Colorado Rockies'
tumble from first to fourth place in three weeks, Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette Thursday swooped in and acquired righthander
Rolando Arrojo and second baseman Mike Lansing for pitchers Brian
Rose and John Wasdin, minor league pitcher Jeff Taglienti, and
outspoken second baseman Jeff Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, a 32-year-old Cuban defector whose reported age was
greeted with great skepticism by Duquette when he first arrived
here and signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, is expected to
arrive here sometime Friday and make his first start for the Sox
Sunday against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acquired him to stabilize our pitching and help us down the
stretch,'' Duquette said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that he'll follow in the footsteps of the last
great Cuban pitcher we had here _ El Tiante,'' Duquette said,
referring to Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo has had nowhere near the success Tiant enjoyed in the big
leagues. He won 14 games for the Devil Rays in 1998, slipped to
seven wins last season, when he had shoulder tendinitis, and was
5-9 (6.04 earned run average) for the Rockies this season. But,
like Tiant, Arrojo throws the ball from a half-dozen angles, and
when he's right, his slider can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette succeeded in outbidding the Cleveland Indians for
Arrojo's services.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not certain when Lansing, 32, will report. An
infielder who originally came up as a shortstop with the Montreal
Expos and has played primarily second base in the big leagues,
Lansing told Colorado reporters he was in ``shock'' about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing also has played sparingly at third base, leading to
speculation he could be used there by the Sox, who also have Jose
Offerman at second. Jimy Williams said that decision will be made
after Lansing arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing has another year on his contract for $6 million, plus a
$1.25 million buyout if his option is not picked up in 2002. The
Rockies will be paying part of Lansing's remaining salary this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lansing reminds me a lot of John Valentin,'' Duquette said,
referring to the Sox third baseman out for the season after
rupturing his patellar tendon. ``He hits a lot of doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansing has twice hit 40 or more doubles in a season. The
Rockies acquired Lansing from the Expos on Nov. 18, 1997, the same
day Duquette made his deal with the Expos for Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication how this deal might impact the Sox'
talks with the Phillies about first baseman Rico Brogna. The
Cardinals, with Mark McGwire expressing concern that he may miss
the rest of the season because of patellar tendinitis, have shown
some interest in acquiring Brogna on a ``rental'' basis for the
rest of this season. Brogna is eligible to become a free agent
after his $4.2 million contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   But talks between the Sox and Phillies intensified this week,
when the Phillies agreed to pay $500,000 of the $1.35 million left
on Brogna's salary. Among the players the Phillies are interested
in is infielder-outfielder Donnie Sadler, who interestingly did not
start in Pawtucket's game Thursday, though he entered as a
defensive replacement later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking to other clubs,'' said Duquette, who has
until Monday at midnight to make another trade, though waiver deals
are always possible after that date.
</P>
<P>
   The trade of Frye comes just four days after the second baseman
ripped Duquette for releasing popular veteran and team leader Mike
Stanley. Frye had missed essentially all of the last two seasons
after tearing the ACL in his knee during a spring-training rundown
drill in 1998, and had additional knee surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a coincidence that it happened shortly
after I spoke up about the general manager or it just so happens
it's the trading deadline,'' Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   He said emphatically that he had no no regets about speaking
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business,'' he said. ``I have to go to my new team, and
go do what I can do, play hard, and try to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye left here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last year of my contract, I think everybdoy pretty
much figured I wouldn't be back in Boston next year,'' he said.
``From that aspect, it gives me a fresh start. I'm not ready to
stop playing.''

TESTING OF CONDEMNED VERMONT SHEEP IS EXAMINED IN COURT HEARING

   BOSTON _ A judge in Brattleboro, Vt. listened to expert
testimony on the science behind the federal government's decision
to kill 350 Vermont sheep suspected of carrying a disease similar
to mad-cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J. Garvan Murtha of Federal District Court, did not make a
ruling, saying only that he would issue a written decision soon on
whether the Agriculture Department could seize and slaughter the
sheep over their owners' objections.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha listened to a full day of testimony on the tests that led
the government to announce that the sheep could be infected and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Two experts on the pathology of mad-cow disease testified on
behalf of the sheep owners, saying they thought the test, a Western
blot, should be redone because it did not include the proper
controls and because its results were less than conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, said one of the experts, Shu Chen, an assistant
professor of pathology at Case Western Reserve University, ``I
would conclude this test needs to be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen suggested that improved methods and another laboratory be
used to confirm the results.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Rubenstein of the New York State Institute for Basic
Research, who ran the test, stood by his results.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two flocks of dairy sheep brought to Vermont from
Belgium in the mid-1990s. The owners, Larry and Linda Faillace and
Houghton Freeman, say the sheep were never exposed to contaminated
feed and could not be carrying say the sheep were never exposed to
contaminated feed and could not be carrying mad-cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has sown fear in Europe, killing dozens of humans
and tens of thousands of cows. American agricultural authorities
have said they want to err on the side of caution. They have kept
the Belgian sheep under quarantine for two years. When tests
earlier this month on four sheep from Freeman's flock showed signs
of a disorder related to mad-cow disease, they quickly issued an
order to kill all the sheep.

CORNING AND NORTEL DECIDE NOT TO COMBINE OPTIC UNITS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ontario)  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corning Inc. and Nortel Networks ended talks Thursday that would
have combined their fiber optic operations.
</P>
<P>
   If a merger had been completed, it would have given Corning
Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, a
relatively full line of the lasers and other components used in
making communications and data networks. Corning had been
negotiating to do so by acquiring Nortel Networks' fiber optics
unit, which would have vaulted Corning into a strong No. 2 position
behind JDS Uniphase as a supplier of such goods.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would also have helped Nortel Networks, , the largest
manufacturer of optical communications networks, pursue its policy
of outsourcing most component manufacturing in order to concentrate
on system design.
</P>
<P>
   For all the strategic sense the deal made though, the numbers
just did not add up. Nortel said Monday that its fiber optic
component, , which sells most of its parts to the company's own
businesses, have a sales value of $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Following JDS Uniphase's recent agreement to acquire SDL,
another optical component company, for $41 billion, the market
value of Nortel's component operations soared to more than $100
billion, more than Corning's total stock market value.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to put the businesses together without Nortel
ending up controlling a majority of Corning's stock _ at least 57
percent by some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel could have accepted nonvoting stock shares or a variety
of other governance restrictions that would have given Corning room
to operate independently, but no acceptable approaches emerged in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, analysts said, it was unlikely that the two
companies could convince Wall Street or others in the industry that
Nortel would not be in control. That raised the specter of other
major equipment purchasers, like Lucent Technologies, Nortel's
biggest rival, cutting back on their business with Corning in order
to avoid helping Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a written statement saying that Corning remained
committed to expanding its optical offerings, Roger Ackerman,
Corning's chairman and chief executive, pointedly concluded that
``our core value of independence'' was ``central to this
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Corning's independence was not the only hurdle. The price of
acquiring Nortel's components business would have led to near-term
declines in Corning earnings. After the announcement that the talks
had collapsed, relieved investors initially sent Corning shares up
as high as $275 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 6.6 percent from
Wednesday's close of $258. But shares later fell, closing down
$9.375, to $248.75.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel declined to comment on why the talks had ended. But John
Roth, president and chief executive of the Toronto-based
telecommunications giant, said that Corning would remain a key
strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nortel fell $5.50 Thursday, to $78.50 in trading on
the Big Board.

<P>
   TUNING OUT THE NEWS MEDIA
</P>
<P>
   Journalists' coverage of the characters of the presidential
contenders has has had little effect on voters' perception of the
characters of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush,
according to a study released Thursday. The study's authors at the
Project for Excellence in Journalism, in Washington, said that
journalists' statements about a candidate's character _ that Bush
was inexperienced, for example, or that Gore was prone to stretch
the truth _ were usually accompanied with supporting evidence but
that denials of such assertions were given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined a sampling of five months of election
coverage in 17 news outlets, including network news broadcasts,
Sunday morning talk shows, cable news talk shows, national and
regional newspapers and online publications. The study compared the
themes the journalists emphasized with voters' perceptions of the
candidates, as measured in a separate survey of 1,204 potential
voters conducted by the Pew Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison indicated that voters gave issues like Bush's
family connections or Gore's fund-raising tactics substantially
different weight than journalists did. The journalists' ``lens on
what's being said by one candidate or others doesn't affect the
public,'' said Amy Mitchell, one of the study's authors. But, the
study noted, journalists offered no evidence for their statements
or cited the work of other journalists about one-quarter of the
time that they made assertions about the candidates' characters.

   GORE `MULLING' OVER VICE PRESIDENTIAL POSSIBILITIES
</P>
<P>
   Speculation may be swirling around Vice President Al Gore's
decision on a running mate, but Gore was the picture of
tranquillity Thursday as he sought to begin a vacation with his
family on a private island off North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters that he had pretty much finished his
interview process for a running mate and was entering the
``mulling'' phase of his decision, but he gave no clue as to where
that might take him and would not offer up any names. ``I've got
the luxury of time to kind of sit and let things settle for a
while,'' Gore said. ``I have not even preliminarily picked
someone.''
</P>

   He said there were fewer than 10 people on his list of
candidates. And he said that none of them would visit him while he
was on vacation. He did say he would probably talk with Warren
Christopher, who is heading his search for a running mate.

   THE CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   SECOND ACT FOR BAUER
</P>
<P>
   There was a time earlier in this year's presidential campaign
when Gary Bauer could conjure up a dream of being on the podium at
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, accepting his
party's nomination and then, as the former head of the conservative
Family Research Council, delivering a ringing call for the nation
to embrace religious and family values anew.
</P>
<P>
   But when he ended up as little more than a statistical blip in
the first tallies of caucus and primary votes, he became one of the
first of the White House hopefuls to fold his campaign tent. Still,
Bauer is going to make it to next week's Republican convention, and
also to the Democratic National Convention that will follow in Los
Angeles. And, in a way, he will have a say in things.
</P>
<P>
   He will cover both as a correspondent for an Internet site,
Beliefnet.com, which features news and commentary on religions in
America. Beliefnet officials said Bauer would file daily audio
reports and write an analytical article examining the role religion
plays in Republican politics.

CONSECO, NEEDING TO PAY DEBT, PLANS JOB CUTS AT FINANCE ARM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind.)  (Eds.: In 11th graph, the word ``plus'' should be converted to the
symbol.)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conseco Inc., the troubled insurance and finance company, said
Thursday that it planned to cut 2,000 jobs from its Conseco Finance
operation and sell numerous assets as it seeks to raise cash to
meet debt payments coming due.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wendt, the company's new chairman and chief executive, said
Conseco's new strategy would concentrate on raising cash to meet
debts at the holding company and on maximizing long-term economic
earnings, without regard to whether accounting rules would allow it
to show profits.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., had a long string of rising
profits under its founder and former chief executive, Steven
Hilbert. But the holding company that controlled the insurance
subsidiaries was left with a rising debt level and investors began
to doubt the quality of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company Thursday reported a loss of $404.7 million, or $1.25
a share, for the second quarter, compared with a profit of $213.3
million, or 64 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The
latest loss included a large number of special items, including
writing down assets that were being sold and the $45 million
signing bonus given to Wendt. The company said that its operating
loss was $28.6 million, or 9 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco Finance, the former Green Tree Finance, had been put up
for sale by prior management, but the offers for the company were
not high enough and Wendt indicated he was now more interested in
operating it than selling it. He compared losing the finance
company, a leader in the financing of mobile homes, to losing one
of a person's two arms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a conference call with analysts if the finance unit
was still for sale, he replied, ``Everything is for sale,'' but
then added: ``My top priority is to sell the holding company. If
you know anyone who would like to buy that puppy, we can make a
really good deal for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the finance unit would be operated so that it would
become self-financing and a contributor of cash to the parent
company, rather than a drain on cash. He said the company now had
$300 million to prepay debts coming due in September and said that
when sales of assets were completed it would have the cash needed
to pay debt coming due this year and ``well into 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, who gained a large Wall Street following as chief
executive of GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric, also
announced that three people who had worked with him at GE Capital _
Paul Street, Mike Borom and Peter Keenoy _ had ``joined our team of
`restoration activists.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conseco shares, which peaked in early 1998, just before Green
Tree was acquired, at $58.125, Thursday rose $1.625, to $9.50 in
New York Stock Exchange in trading before the company's
announcements were made.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco said it would sell its stake in Tritel, a wireless
telephone company, whose shares fell $1.6125, to $29.6125 in late
trading. It took a $47.6 million charge to write that stake down to
market value.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt said the company would also focus on restoring the ratings
of its insurance companies. A.M. Best has downgraded Conseco to a
rating of B plus plus, which is devastating in a market where
nearly every company has a rating of A or higher. Wendt said that
getting holding company debt down would be a primary part of his
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, Wendt said, the company will look for what
he calls ``rented equity,'' in which other insurance companies
provide reinsurance to assure that Conseco's products are rated
highly enough to be able to sell new policies.
</P>
<P>
   At the finance unit, which Wendt said had ``been portrayed as
the demon in the Conseco house,'' the company plans to sell five
business units and cut costs by closing some offices. He said that
would lead to a loss of 2,000 jobs at the company. When the
restructuring is completed Conseco Finance will be able to grow
while spinning off cash to the parent, Wendt said.

COMMERCIALS BY GUN INDUSTRY WILL TRY TO COUNTER LITIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asserting that gun manufacturers are in dire
jeopardy from a raft of lawsuits by state and local governments,
the firearms industry plans to start running commercials during
prime-time coverage of the Republican National Convention next week
attacking President Clinton and other politicians, mostly
Democrats, who support the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being blamed for crime and violence by this
administration and big-city mayors whose greedy lawyers are using
your tax dollars to sue us,'' says the narrator in one of the two
60-second spots, which depict a well-dressed man, presumably a
lawyer, carefully shredding an American flag. ``So now, we need
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the
industry's leading trade association, are part of a broader effort
by the group to hurt elected officials who have accused gun makers
of being legally responsible for gun violence. The group has also
created a political action committee and is using its nationwide
network of retailers and gun clubs to register voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have gone out of business, and will go out of
business if this continues,'' said Robert Delfay, president of the
organization that represents 1,800 companies. ``This is a
critically important election in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Delfay said the commercials would run twice a night on CNN on
all four days of the Republican convention. The group plans to do
the same during the Democratic convention next month. It also
intends to broadcast the spots throughout the fall in closely
contested states with large numbers of hunters, including Michigan,
Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's advertising campaign, which Delfay said would
cost several million dollars by Election Day, is the latest
escalation of the gun-control battle this year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's politically potent ally, the National Rifle
Association, which represents 3.8 million gun owners, plans to
spend a record $15 million on state and federal elections this
fall. The group is expected to endorse Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And a loose coalition of gun-control groups has pledged to spend
several million dollars helping to elect their friends, most of
them Democrats. Handgun Control Inc., one of the coalition's
leaders, plans to run commercials during the Republican convention
that portray Bush as a pawn of the rifle association.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush signed legislation that prohibits Texas
municipalities from suing gun makers without approval of the state
Legislature. Enacting such bills in all 50 states is a top priority
of the gun industry and the rifle association. Bush has suggested
that he would sign similar federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a feel for my position by looking at what I've
done in office,'' he told reporters in May, ``and what I did in
office was sign a bill that made it very difficult for local
municipalities to sue manufacturers of a legal product.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presumptive Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore,
has been a vocal supporter of the litigation, as have Clinton and
Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, who has threatened to bring
lawsuits against the industry on behalf of the public housing
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Shooting Sports Foundation does not plan to endorse
a candidate, its members are voicing support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush appears more willing to respect private
citizen's rights of self-defense,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel
for Beretta U.S.A. ``To us, the choice between the candidates is
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit against the nation's largest gun makers has been filed
by New York State; 32 cities and counties around the country,
including New York City, have also filed suits. Most suits do not
seek monetary damages, but are intended to force the manufacturers
to build safety devices into their weapons and to take steps to
prevent sales to criminals and black-market gunrunners.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest maker of
handguns, agreed to a ``code of conduct'' outlining many of those
safety measures in exchange for being dropped from the litigation.
But the company has backed away from some provisions of the
agreement, and also has been the target of a boycott organized by
the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials represent the industry's first major foray into
electoral politics. About 80 companies have pledged to contribute 1
percent of their gross profits for political and lobbying work,
about $10 million a year. Known as the Hunting and Shooting Sports
Heritage Fund, the program is also paying for lobbyists, a voter
registration drive and a voter education program.
</P>
<P>
   Both commercials depict a man stripping the stars and stripes
off an American flag, leaving nothing but a frayed white banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were with the patriots who fought for this flag at
Gettysburg,'' the narrator says in one spot. ``We were with the
heroes who fought for these stars in the Mekong Delta. We are the
makers of America's firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said of the manufacturers: ``They are not on the side of
the patriots. They are on the side of the criminals.''

CHENEY QUIZZED REPEATEDLY ON HIS VOTING RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dick Cheney tried Thursday to beat back
questions about his conservative voting record, appearing on the
morning news programs of all three major networks as the Bush
campaign fought to keep from being defined by the second man on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush jumped into the debate, accusing the
Democrats of using a ``constant line _ vote for me, I'm going to
tear down the other person'' _ in attacking the record of his
running mate, whose service as defense secretary to Bush's father
followed 10 years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Cheney brought people together and helped win a
war,'' Bush said, ``which stands in stark contrast to Vice
President Al Gore, who tends to divide people to create war.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke as Cheney, for a second straight day, was called on
to explain positions he took as a congressman from Wyoming,
including votes against the Equal Rights Amendment, gun control and
sanctions on South Africa's apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have highlighted those stands to undercut Bush's
efforts to define himself as a ``different kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   At times Thursday, Cheney shot back by pointing to
inconsistencies in Gore's own congressional voting record. At other
times, he defended his conservative views. And occasionally, he
turned to talk of legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Asked, for instance, why he had voted against the Equal Rights
Amendment, he said Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., as the speaker of a
Democratic-controlled House, had brought it up for a vote under a
procedure ``that prohibited amendments of any kind _ we had to
accept or reject it.'' He said he had feared that the way it was
written would have required the drafting of women into the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I didn't think that was a very good idea,'' Cheney said
on ``The Early Show'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later Bush made a brief appearance before
reporters, taking time out from practicing his acceptance speech
for his nomination next week, and maintained that he had not been
blindsided by Cheney's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I knew his votes,'' Bush said. ``But I also know his
record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who all they
do is spend time tearing people down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats kept up their efforts to use Cheney's record as a
way of tying Bush to a Republican establishment of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Cheney's selection has done is given us a rather vivid
picture of old guard Republicanism,'' said Mark Fabiani, a deputy
Gore campaign manager. And, Fabiani said, ``some of his past votes
are hard to explain away in any era.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for Bush is that some of the stands of his
running mate cut right to the heart of the way he has been seeking
to define himself as a ``compassionate conservative.'' Bush has put
a heavy premium on education, for example, and Cheney voted against
the Head Start program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush regularly surrounds himself with members of minorities and
recently spoke at the convention of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. Cheney voted against imposing
economic sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa and
against a House resolution calling for Nelson Mandela to be freed
after 23 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning Cheney said on the NBC ``Today'' program that
``this notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela
is a typical distortion by Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue had been tied up in a debate over sanctions
against South Africa. He said he believed that forcing U.S.
companies out of South Africa would have left many blacks there
worse off, because ``any good jobs available to black South
Africans were with American firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Of domestic matters, Cheney argued that the 1980s, when he
served in the House, were a different era, when budget deficits
required votes to control spending. And he said his rise in
Congress up the leadership ladder of his party showed that he had
not been viewed as an extreme conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``So whatever the Democrats want to say about me now,'' he said,
``the fact of the matter was many Democrats, as well as all of the
Republicans, thought I was a reasonably respectable fellow in the
1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, Cheney stood firm. When asked why he had been
one of only 21 House members to vote against a ban on so-called
cop-killer bullets, he said: ``I consistently voted against gun
control. I'm one of those people who believes that the solution to
our gun problem is to enforce existing laws, not impose new
restrictions on law-abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed as to why in 1988 he voted against a ban on plastic guns
that can make it through airport security, a measure that was not
opposed by even the National Rifle Association, he said, ``Well,
obviously I wasn't in the pocket of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   And on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' he tried to turn the
scrutiny to Gore, whose position on gun issues has changed since
his first years in Congress. ``At the same time that I was doing
that, casting those votes, Al Gore was receiving an A rating from
the National Rifle Association,'' Cheney said. ``He was pro-gun and
anti-gun-control.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his votes against creating the Department of Education
and against spending on Head Start, Cheney cautioned against the
assumption ``that anything that's got the word `education' on it is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at the substance of it,'' he said. ``You've
got to analyze the legislation. The fact of the matter is that
education is primarily a state and local responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also answered questions about a Republican fund-raising
brochure from 1992 that had a picture of him as defense secretary
and promised large contributors the right to attend unspecified
government briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do any fund-raisers in the Pentagon,'' he said.
``Never did. I did brief people from time to time, but as a general
rule we stayed out of partisan politics in the Pentagon.''

REPUBLICAN PUSH TO SHUFFLE PRIMARY CALENDAR CLEARS FIRST HURDLE By
ADAM CLYMER   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican National Committee voted on
Thursday to make the presidential nominating season last until May
by requiring big states to hold their primaries last. But the plan
faces a stiff fight in the national convention's rules committee on
Friday and perhaps on the convention floor next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was 92-55. Most of the opposition came from big
states, like New York, California and Illinois, which would be
permitted to hold primaries or caucuses no earlier than the first
Tuesday in May. And while each state has three votes on the
national committee, and two on the rules committee, the bigger
states have more votes in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argued that the new system, in which a majority of
delegates would be elected in May, would allow Republicans in all
states to cast votes that mattered. This year the nominations of
both major parties were settled in March, before many states had
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Blackwell, a national committeeman from Virginia, argued
that if the party did nothing, states would continue to move their
primaries to the earliest possible date. That, he said, would
create a national primary, which could be won only by someone with
enough money to campaign everywhere at once, or by someone
``beloved by the media'' and favored with magazine covers and
television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued that coming late would deprive them of
influence, and also warned that Democratic governors and
Democratic-controlled legislatures would refuse to shift primary
dates, thus forcing Republicans either to hold caucuses or to pay
for their own primaries. John Fleischman, executive director of
California's Republican Party, said this would cost the party $15
million to $20 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters like Richard Forsten, general counsel of the Delaware
party, argued that with the flexibility that the proposed rule
would give the Republican National Committee, such problems would
be worked out amicably. Though he did not mention it, the
Democratic National Committee has the authority to change
delegate-selection rules _ including primary dates _ between
elections and to grant waivers to states that want to break them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican proposal's comparable flexibility, which its
advocates said was essential to make it work, runs counter to
Republican tradition, in which the rules are set once every four
years, at the national convention. And the idea of changing that
will stir hostility in the convention's rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   However the rules committee decides, the vote is likely to be
close enough for the losing side to take the issue to the floor, a
step that would require the signatures of 27 of the committee's 107
members. Both Fleischman, opposing the plan, and Tom Sansonetti of
Wyoming, chairman of the national committee's rules panel, which
produced it, said on Thursday that they were ready to go to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   That could be forestalled by the presidential campaign of Gov.
George W. Bush, which has been structuring the convention to make
it free of controversy. But the spectacle of politicians' arguing
about political calendars, rather than something so emotional as
abortion, might not seem harmful, especially if it took place on
Monday morning, when only a couple of cable networks were covering
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has had nothing to say about the proposal, although
recently his aides have said he has some ``concerns'' about it. Ari
Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, said in Austin on Thursday
that ``he has no position on it.'' But Charles Black Jr., a veteran
Republican consultant in Washington who is an adviser to the
campaign, said he and several other advisers, acting on their own,
were trying to build opposition to the plan. Black said that
without any sign that Democrats would cooperate, adoption of the
proposal could let them pick their nominee by March and start
building campaign donations while Republicans continue to contest
their nomination.

HAMPTON GIVES BULLPEN A REST AND METS A SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Between games of a doubleheader Thursday, Pat Mahomes
asked Mike Hampton if Hampton was going to pitch nine innings.
Hampton, the Mets left-hander, said he would. ``He was true to his
word,'' Mahomes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes had just thrown 4 2/3 innings, a season high for a New
York Mets reliever, but his effort had not prevented manager Bobby
Valentine from using three other relief pitchers to secure a 9-8
victory over the Montreal Expos in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' bullpen needed a rest, and Hampton was the man to
provide it. The Mets had lost both games he started on their recent
road trip, but this was a dire situation, and that, Hampton's
teammates have found, is when their No. 1 starter is at his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a big-game guy,'' Mahomes said. ``No matter what
happens, it seems like every time there's a big game, he steps up
and does a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was outstanding Thursday, offering the Expos his usual
assortment of sinkers down and away and cut fastballs down and in,
to pitch the Mets to a 4-3 victory, completing a sweep. Hampton had
allowed three runs (two earned) on five hits through eight innings.
With rain coming down hard and Armando Benitez warming up in the
bullpen, he fought through a difficult ninth inning to secure the
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past the eighth,'' said Hampton, who walked only
one, ``it doesn't really matter how tired you are. Adrenaline will
push you another inning.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hampton knocked down a hard bouncer by Milton Bradley and
threw to first for the game's final out _ three batters after a
diving stop by Edgardo Alfonzo for the inning's first out _ it
concluded a bizarre day at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous Grant Roberts was overwhelmed in his major league
debut, lasting only 1 1/3 innings and giving up six earned runs on
six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Derek Bell left the first game when a ball smashed
off his chin in right field, then returned for the second game with
three stitches, only to be removed in the fifth inning when he felt
light-headed and sick. Shortstop Melvin Mora left the first game
when a ground ball struck his right index finger, cracking it open
and causing him to miss the second game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Expos combined for nine errors that did not
include two dropped pop-ups that were not scored errors. Third
baseman Lenny Harris had three of those errors in the second game,
but made up for it with a home run that took one hop and bounced
over the back wall of the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a minute I thought I was Robin Ventura, because I wasn't
making any errors,'' said Harris, who had only one error as
Ventura's replacement at third base before Thursday. ``Then I got
back to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are still waiting for Benny Agbayani to do the same.
They continue to explore options for a more proven bat to put in
the everyday lineup, and Agbayani does not know if he will still
have a spot in the lineup or on the team after Monday's nonwaiver
trading deadline. Meanwhile, he continues to produce, going 4 for 5
in the first game and singling in the Mets' three-run rally in the
second inning of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani admitted the Mets were not optimistic coming off the
field after the top of the first inning of the first game. Roberts,
who walked the first two hitters and allowed hits to three of the
next four, had thrown 41 pitches in putting the Mets in a 4-0 hole.
Bell, a .300 hitter, had left the game, and Mike Piazza was resting
in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably thinking, `Aw, this is going to be a long day
_ what a way to start a game off, like this,''' Agbayani said.
``But you've got to play all nine innings to find out what's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and the bases loaded in the first inning, Agbayani
doubled to the base of the wall in left field, driving in two runs
to cut the Expos' lead in half. Montreal went ahead by 7-2 in the
second, but then Mahomes was on his way, blanking the Expos through
the sixth. By the time Turk Wendell came on for the seventh, the
Mets had closed to within one run of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   They tied it, then allowed the Expos to go ahead, 8-7. But with
two outs in the eighth, Joe McEwing doubled, Alfonzo walked and
Todd Zeile singled in the tying run. Facing the left-hander Steve
Kline, the left-handed-batting Matt Franco rapped the go-ahead
single to right, his third hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine usually does not let Franco hit against left-handers;
Franco was 0 for 7 against lefties last year and 1 for 6 this
season. If the Mets had been trailing, Valentine said, he would
have brought his only remaining position player, Piazza, off the
bench. Catcher Todd Pratt then would have shifted to the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine let Franco hit, and Franco rewarded him, stroking
a 2-1 fastball to right for the decisive single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that's one thing in baseball that's kind of
overrated,'' Franco said. ``A guy like Randy Johnson's tough on
lefties, but he's tough on everybody. There's a lot of left-handers
in the league that can hit lefties.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco was back on the bench for the second game, but the Mets
still got most of their production from players not used to the
spotlight. Alfonzo and Piazza were 0 for 10 in the doubleheader,
but Agbayani, Harris and Jay Payton all had hits in both games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the entire team to win as many games as we need to
win,'' Valentine said. ``We've been relying heavily on Mike and
Fonzie, and tonight it worked without their offensive
contributions.''  &QL;

ADVERTISING: AN AGREEMENT ON DATA GLEANED FROM WEB SURFERS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what both sides hailed as a big step in online
privacy protection, the government reached agreement Thursday with
a group of Internet advertisers on how they will glean information
from Web surfers and what they will do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said it had agreed with the
advertisers on crucial principles. From now on, Web surfers will be
told explicitly of advertisers' attempts to profile potential
consumers and will be given the option of choosing not to
participate. Nor can anonymous information previously collected be
linked to ``personally identifiable data'' without a consumer's
consent.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission said it would continue to press for
legislation protecting privacy during online profiling _ something
that the advertisers are decidedly lukewarm about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry self-regulation must play a central part in
protecting consumer online privacy,'' said Jodie Bernstein,
director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. She
applauded the advertisers, who negotiated with the agency as the
Network Advertising Initiative, for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Self-regulation is what the advertising group has advocated all
along. ``We think it should be given a chance to work,'' said Jeff
Connaughton, a lawyer for Quinn Gillespie &AMP; Associates, a
Washington lobbying firm that represented the group in talks with
the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to require Web sites to disclose what they do with
data collected from those who view the sites was introduced on
Wednesday by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the Senate
Commerce Committee. Sens. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., John Kerry,
D-Mass. and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., respectively, are co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bipartisan sponsorship, it is by no means clear that
Congress will act on the issue before the elections. But no one, in
politics or out, disputes that Internet privacy will continue to be
an issue of surpassing interest and importance as computer
technology advances.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisers agreed to put their self-regulatory principles
into effect at once, the commission said. Those principles include
enforcement by independent outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The Network Advertising Initiative consists of most of the
biggest names in Web advertising, including AdKnowledge,
DoubleClick and Engage Technologies. The consortium embraces about
90 percent of the Internet-advertising industry, and Bernstein
asserted that federal law is needed to make the rest comply with
the majority's precepts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, Connaughton suggested. He said the 10 percent might
be led by ``centrifugal force'' to go along, or risk losing both
respect and business.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has been negotiating with the advertisers for months,
and while both sides described the talks as generally collegial,
the agency's final vote reflected divisions. While the five
commissioners said they ``unanimously applauded'' the consortium's
efforts, one commissioner, Orson Swindle, dissented from the
overall document on grounds that legislation would be ``overly
burdensome and unwarranted.'' And another commissioner, Thomas B.
Leary, issued a separate statement calling for less sweeping
legislation than his colleagues favor.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Matus, a New York lawyer who specializes in
Internet-privacy issues, predicted in a telephone interview that
legislation would be enacted eventually. While the Internet is a
blessing for businesses and information-seekers, it is also
``potentially very dangerous to individuals and their privacy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Information about people and their buying habits was available
long before the computer era, of course. Someone who subscribed to
a golf magazine, say, could expect to get unsolicited mail about
golf resorts or golf schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, infinitely more information _ or misinformation _ can
be inferred about a person's hobbies, finances, health and even
sexual preference based on his or her Web use. While no one
interviewed Thursday could cite an individual ``horror story,'' no
one disagreed that technologically speaking the worst imaginable
violations of privacy are feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But Connaughton said the advertisers who reached the accord with
the government had pledged to ``draw a circle around sensitive
personal data'' like medical and financial information.

DODGERS OUTSLUG ROCKIES, 16-11
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Adrian Beltre hit a grand slam and had a career-high
six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but shortstop Alex Cora, who had one RBI in a month and
seven on the season, hit two homers, including a 396-foot,
three-run shot to the opposite field, and drove in a career-high
five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Guess where the Dodgers played?
</P>
<P>
   Correct. The only place such acts could take place, but
fortunately for the Dodgers, their two guys at the bottom of the
lineup pounded Colorado pitching for four hits apiece and drove in
11 runs as the Dodgers out-Coors Fielded the Rockies 16-11
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield had three RBI on three singles for the Dodgers
and Eric Karros had three hits. Colorado's Larry Walker went 4 for
4 with an upper-deck homer and tied a club record by scoring five
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a typical Coors day, it seems like to me, when you're
going to run out of pitchers or use everybody you have that's
available to try and win a ballgame,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson, who used five pitchers. ``It's never over until the last
guy makes an out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (54-47) tied season highs for runs and errors
(four), banged out a season-best 20 hits and won three of the four
games in the series to win for the eighth time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all was not splendid in the clubhouse afterward because the
expected happened. Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne, of whom the
organization thinks highly, was sent to Triple-A Albuquerque after
one of the worst outings of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leads of 7-3 in the third inning and 11-7 in the fifth,
Gagne never made it far enough to qualify for the win. He allowed
eight runs (five earned) on a career-high 11 hits in 41/3 innings.
Gagne is 1-6 with a 5.74 ERA; his spot is taken by Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   It was an equally tough day for lefty Onan Masaoka, who pitched
two-thirds of an inning of perfect relief for his first win but was
also sent to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give me 11 runs, it should be enough,'' Gagne, 24, said.
``I deserve (to go to the minors). I need some innings. We're in a
race and it's not about me, it's about the team. Valdes is going to
come in and do a good job. I didn't do the job and there's nothing
I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gagne continues to struggle, Beltre turned things around
in this series. Not able to come up with the big hit in clutch
situations for the past month, he changed that here. Beltre had the
game-winning single Tuesday, and hit his second grand slam of the
season in the third inning Thursday as the Dodgers took a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get production out of your seventh and eighth hitter, it
makes the guys up front more relaxed so when we get guys on, now we
can wait for our pitch,'' Sheffield said. ``If he walks us, we can
wait for the next guy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora followed Beltre's slam with his first homer of the day to
put the Dodgers ahead 7-3. Gagne gave it all back in the third and
fourth innings, culminating with Todd Helton's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the quintessential Coors Field game, and no sooner
had the Rockies tied it in the fourth than the Dodgers piled on
again. Beltre started it with an RBI single in the fifth, and Cora,
with one career homer coming in, hit a three-run homer off reliever
Giovanni Carrara.
</P>
<P>
   Cora added his fifth RBI with a double off the right-field wall
to cap a three-run sixth inning for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not after (Mark) McGwire, I'm after Sheff right now,''
Cora said jokingly. ``I know he's very happy because we had a talk
(Wednesday) before the game and he gave me a tip. He told me to
watch the game and try to learn, and he's one of the best hitters
in the game. My approach was different because of that.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AS OEDIPAL ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We don't need Dad in this race,'' George W. Bush told The
Midland Reporter-Telegram back in 1978, when he was making an
unsuccessful run for Congress and being questioned about the views
of his already famous father. But in the world of oedipal politics,
keeping dad out of the campaign can be a difficult task, as Bush
and countless other famous sons have discovered over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American campaigns sometimes seem to resemble one of
those men's-movement fables from ``Iron John'' in which the son can
achieve full masculine power only by vanquishing the father's
ghost. As a practical matter, of course, ghosts can be easier to
deal with than a living, meddling father or public suspicions about
paternal string-pulling. American voters seem to like political
dynasties _ up to that point where the romance of father-son
continuity seems to verge on something resembling royal
entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the few traits that Bush and Vice President Al
Gore seem to have in common is the dilemma of being a famous son.
Bush probably has the harder task in containing the offstage
presence of a very lively 76-year-old former president. But Gore's
candidacy is haunted, in a way, by the golden-throated ghost of
former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., who died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, political scions from Herman (son of Ol' Gene)
Talmadge to George Wallace Jr. have labored to avoid the appearance
of being foisted on the public. In that respect, it was probably
less than helpful when the elder Gore, asked in 1992 about his
son's presence on the Democratic national ticket, said, ``We raised
him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the father's reputation competes with the son's
reality. Albert Gore Sr. was a famous orator. The son turns to
stone at the teleprompter. Vice President Gore is accused of
pandering. Senior lost his Senate seat rather than alter his
opposition to the Vietnam War. The father had the advantage of an
impoverished Tennessee boyhood. Albert Gore Jr. used their
Tennessee farm as a summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Bush faces the tougher, day-to-day threat of being
miniaturized by a living ex-president. The elder Bush inflicted
unintended collateral damage at a rally before the New Hampshire
primary by referring to his son as ``this boy.'' In a subsequent
interview with The New York Times, former President Bush and his
wife, Barbara, took what appeared to be a pledge of
non-interference.
</P>
<P>
   But family discipline seemed to break down during the process of
putting Dick Cheney on the ticket. Bush acknowledged ``kibitzing''
by his father, apparently code for days of lobbying by the former
president for his secretary of defense. A fatherly call to the
elderly Texas heart surgeon Denton Cooley about Cheney's health was
also made public.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, in damage-control mode, said Thursday
that it was ``absolutely inaccurate'' to say he had driven the
choice of Cheney. But in fact the whole process took on a very
retro, Texas-elite, Bush-senior look. The psychological signal was
even more damaging, as if by pushing Cheney, the former president
was saying, Don't worry: when my son makes decisions, adults will
be in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Were John F. Kennedy alive, he could certainly identify with the
problem of paternal-assistance overload. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.'s
bootlegger image and his reputation for being soft on Nazi Germany
made it essential to keep him in the background. But the old man's
public ambition to put a son in the White House and the jokes about
his not paying for a single vote more than necessary made that a
hard task. Indeed, the elder Kennedy's triumphal behavior at JFK's
inaugural was enough to make one wonder whose day it was _ at least
in Joseph Kennedy's mind.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fathers, there is, of course, a
counter-tradition in postwar presidential politics. Harry Truman,
Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton were all figures who were, in a political
sense, fatherless. Truman had made his bones in machine politics.
Eisenhower, through his war experience, entered elective combat
with the status of national father figure. It was impossible to
imagine the Supreme Allied Commander playing junior to any man,
even back in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Johnson, Nixon and Reagan, pitied their fathers for
their weaknesses. Others, notably Carter, revered their fathers'
rectitude. Ford and Clinton were estranged by death and
circumstance from their biological fathers. All had, by the time
they ran for president, far surpassed the paternal example of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore is quite there yet. True, Gore now
outranks his father, but he is not yet perceived as having made the
step from scion to paterfamilias. That could argue for picking a
junior figure for a running mate. Bush has gone in the other
direction, putting a de facto father on the ticket at the urging of
his real father in Houston. Gov. Bush cites this as proof of his
inner security, and it may be. But he still has to worry that
voters will read it as a sign of a son not yet risen to full
autonomy.

COWBOYS' DAT NGUYEN, COMING OFF LASER EYE SURGERY, HAS SIGHTS SET
ON STARTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dat Nguyen's keen instincts just got
keener.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' second-year middle linebacker from Texas A&AMP;M
underwent laser eye surgery five months ago. He no longer needs to
wear contact lenses to find the ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Dat Nguyen with both a ``nose'' ``and'' 20/20
vision for the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to squint to see what time it is anymore,''
saidNguyen, 24. ``I don't have to scramble to find my glasses in
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Now with corrected vision, Nguyen can set his sights on winning
the starting middle linebacker job.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-10, the 1998 Lombardi Trophy winner has grown
accustomed to proving he's not too short to play this game.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Godfrey, the team's leading tackler last season, was
lost to free agency when he signed with the Tennessee Titans in
February. Nguyen automatically _ or so it seemed at the time _
would become Godfrey's successor after playing middle linebacker in
nickel packages as a 1999 rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to play all three downs,'' Nguyen said. ``When
you're a competitor, you never want to come off the field. I play
the game with a lot of love. But I'm still a young player, and I'm
still learning on the run. I'll do whatever I need to do to help
this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's competition for the starting job is Barron Wortham, who
has made 55 NFL starts, including Super Bowl XXXIV for the
Tennessee Titans, and Chris Bordano, who has had 18 NFL starts with
New Orleans, including 12 starts last season.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham came to the Cowboys as a free agent from Tennessee,
following in the steps of strongside linebacker Joe Bowden. Bordano
came to the Cowboys from New Orleans in a trade for cornerback
Kevin Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie last season, Nguyen appeared in all 16 games, plus
the playoff loss to Minnesota, as a situational middle linebacker
on passing downs and a fierce tackler on special teams. His next
NFL start will be his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dat will be able to play all three downs, without a
doubt,'' Cowboys linebackers coach George Edwards said. ``But I
also think that our having the luxury of experienced linebackers in
camp, he may not have to \Rplay all three downs\S. We'll take it
day-to-day, week-to-week, and see how things progress.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys explore their options, Nguyen keeps working to
get better at making the defensive calls, which the middle
linebacker must do, and making plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding the football and getting \Rthe ball carrier\S on the
ground is what Dat does best,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said.
``Dat's instincts are what separate him from the pack ... \Rand\S
I'm comfortable with him in there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards added: ``When the lights are on, Dat plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is learning to be more of a conformist and play within
the scheme in the Cowboys' standard packages that are used on first
and second down. Last season, he seemed better suited for the
nickel packages, which allowed him to do what he does best: read
and react, find a way to make a play.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen shows up better in games than in practice drills. But he
still needs to use the Cowboys' five preseason games to nail down
the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I 100 percent comfortable at middle linebacker?'' Campo
asked. ``No, because we don't know 100 percent about the position.
We have a complete situation there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, born in a refugee camp in Arkansas to parents who left
Vietnam just before the end of the Vietnam War, knows something
about challenges and overcoming long odds. He's the only
Vietnamese-American player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel you always have to prove yourself,'' Nguyen said. ``In
football, you have to want to get better every day. I know when I
make a mistake now before I've been told. I'm just more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I'm fitting in more ... although I guess I still
stick out a little bit because I'm the only Asian guy out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to be the only Cowboys' starting middle linebacker
when the season begins Sept. 3 against Philadelphia.

CLINTON ATTACKS LAZIO'S TIES TO DISSIDENT AIDS GROUP
</HEADLINE>
  By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attacking her opponent as ``out of touch with the
mainstream,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed to take some delight
Thursday in pointing to Rep. Rick Lazio's links to a dissident band
of scientists who contend that the human immunodeficiency virus
does not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, wrote to federal
health officials earlier this year on behalf of the Group for the
Scientific Reappraisal of HIV/AIDS. The group is connected to two
scientists, Peter Deusberg and David Resnick, to whom the South
African president, Thabo Mbeki, also apparently turned earlier this
year in questioning the causes of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign aides said Thursday that he wrote to officials
with the Health and Human Services Department and the National
Institutes of Health on behalf of a constituent, who belonged to
the group. Molly Fullington, a spokeswoman for the Lazio campaign,
said the group was trying to secure federal financing to conduct
research on ``the underlying causes of AIDS and to fund holistic
approaches to treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not comment on whether Lazio knew of the
group's disputed belief. But, she said, ``Rick Lazio does not hold
their view that HIV does not cause AIDS,'' adding that ``he
believes it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The report of Lazio's advocacy of the dissident AIDS group was
first published Thursday in The New York Post. Clinton seized on
the report at a news conference to announce endorsements from two
gay and lesbian groups, the Human Rights Campaign and Empire State
Pride Agenda. ``It was a further piece of evidence as to why my
opponent doesn't get it,'' she said, urging him to engage in
debates statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the two organizations that announced their
support pointed to her advocacy of issues important to gay and
lesbian voters, from her support of hate-crimes laws to backing the
right of gay couples to be foster and adoptive parents. Clinton,
her backers said, has also supported the right of openly gay people
to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a close call,'' Tim Sweeney, executive director of
Empire State Pride Agenda said in announcing his endorsement of
Clinton. ``He's not even Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   The gay community split over the question of D'Amato in the last
Senate race in New York, with the Human Rights Campaign backing
D'Amato over his Democratic opponent, Charles Schumer. But this
time, officials with the Human Rights Campaign said, there was no
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio has had ample opportunity to support our issues,''
said the group's executive director, Elizabeth Birch. ``And time
and time again, he has come up short or come up empty.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's invitation to debate, Lazio's aides welcomed
it. Michael Marr, a spokesman, described it as an opportunity to
highlight ``the difference between the candidate who has a real
record of legislative achievement and a candidate who has no such
record.''

CLAUDE SAUTET, 76, NOTED FRENCH FILM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Sautet, an award-winning director whose films focused on
the lives of the bourgeoisie, died July 22 in Paris. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, his producer, Alain Sarde, told
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to choose subjects or anecdotes, if you will, that
are quite simple, to develop them simply, to film them simply and
to find multiple levels in relationships,'' he said in a 1996
interview with The Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   Sautet spent the early part of his career working in television
and as a screenwriter and script doctor. He first drew critical
attention as a director with ``Les Choses de la Vie'' (``The Things
of Life'') in 1969, a tragicomedy about a romantic triangle, with
Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   He himself acted in that film and several others, including
``Cesar and Rosalie'' (1972), about a divorced woman who becomes
involved with a wealthy man and a young artist.
</P>
<P>
   His credits also included ``Vincent, Francois, Paul and the
Others'' (1974); ``Une Histoire Simple'' (``A Simple Story''), with
Schneider, which was one of the nominees for the 1980 Oscar for
best foreign film; and ``Quelques Jours Avec Moi'' (``A Few Days
With Me'') in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Un Coeur en Hiver'' (``A Heart in Winter''), released in the
United States in 1993, was the story of a violin repairer (Daniel
Auteuil) who is better at his work than at his relationships with
people _ including a beautiful young violinist (Emmanuelle Beart)
with whom he falls in love. Sautet's film was praised by Janet
Maslin in The New York Times as ``a coolly elegant romance.'' The
film brought him a Cesar, the French equivalent of an Oscar, in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   He won another Cesar for his last film, ``Nelly and Monsieur
Arnaud'' (1996), with Beart and Michel Serrault, the story of a
young woman and her relationship with the reclusive elderly man who
unexpectedly chooses to become her benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Montrouge, a suburb of Paris, on Feb. 23, 1924, Sautet
first sought a career as a painter and sculptor before enrolling in
film school in Paris. He worked at a series of jobs, writing music
criticism and even serving as warden of a school for juvenile
delinquents, before finding work as a script doctor and directorial
assistant. His early efforts included several gangster films.
</P>
<P>
   Sautet said that the heart of his films, which often featured a
group of people supporting the main character, was drawn from, as
The Times of London put it, ``childhood experiences in an extended
family with a cafe as the center of community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I also discovered the secret of loneliness of
people, of being lonely in a crowd,'' he said in the interview.
``One of the classic subjects is solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I always try to create an imbalance, an edge to
friendship. You never know what's going to trigger the next moment.
My real subject is always uncertainty.''

DODGERS BETTER WITH HUNDLEY AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Catcher Todd Hundley returned to the lineup and the
Dodgers scored double digits in runs for the first time since June
7.
</P>
<P>
   So Hundley went 2 for 4 with an RBI and two runs scored in the
Dodgers' 16-11 win against Colorado, and the bottom of the order
accounted for most of the run production.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's importance to the lineup can't be underscored too
heavily. The Dodgers are much deeper when Adrian Beltre bats
seventh and Hundley is hitting sixth than when Beltre is batting
sixth and the catcher du jour is batting seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The key is keeping Hundley healthy. He's missed 41 games because
of injuries, including 39 of the last 52. In Hundley's two stints
on the disabled list, the Dodgers averaged 4.64 runs per game and
are 20-18. When he's not on the disabled list, the Dodgers have
averaged 5.90 runs and are 34-29.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley missed most of June after straining his right oblique
muscle running the bases, then missed 15 games after suffering a
nondisplaced fracture in his right thumb July 7 when he was hit
with a foul tip. However, Hundley said the thumb was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can bend it and I can feel my thumb, so that's what
counts,'' said Hundley, who missed two games early in the season
when he tweaked his knee. ``I've been hitting for the last week so
the swing is there. Catching will come back, I expect, by the
second inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wanted to keep backup
catcher Paul LoDuca on the roster, numbers made it impossible.
LoDuca, who batted .288 with two homers and seven RBI and did
everything the Dodgers asked, has minor-league options remaining,
so he was sent to Triple-A Albuquerque. Journeyman first baseman
Chris Donnels doesn't have options, so he remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love (LoDuca). He's a gamer,'' Johnson said. ``He knows how
to play the game. It's unfortunate. The one area we have depth is
the catching. With Hundley being out half the year, LoDuca and
Kreuter have done a great job. Sending him out is tough, and to
make matters worse he goes down and shares time with (Angel)
Pena.''
</P>
<P>
   OLSON ACTIVATED: Finally, after 3\ months of injury and rehab
and frustration, right-hander Gregg Olson will be available today
when the Dodgers begin a three-game series in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has a 9.00 ERA in two games but hasn't pitched since
injuring his right forearm April 8 in New York. Since then, he's
gone out on a few rehab assignments only to feel problems once
again. However, after he pitched with Single-A San Bernardino and
Triple-A Albuquerque for three weeks, then sat around and threw on
the side with the Dodgers for the last week, the organization
finally has deemed him ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Olson, the Dodgers did the expected and
optioned Onan Masaoka back to Albuquerque, leaving the Dodgers
without a lefty in the bullpen. But it's not as though Masaoka was
being used often. He won Thursday to improve to 1-0 with a 2.75 ERA
in 19 games, but he pitched 42/3 innings in seven games in July.
</P>
<P>
   VERO VOTE: The Dodgers took a major step in cementing their
return to Vero Beach, Fla., for spring training well into the
century when a ``memorandum of understanding'' was passed with a
3-1 vote by the Indian River County (Fla.) Commission and a 4-1
vote by the city council. A majority was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased with having taken the next step in the
process, and it's a substantial step,'' Dodgers president and COO
Bob Graziano said. ``It shows they're supportive of the framework
of which all the deals would be done. It's a very significant
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum outlines the renovations and plans for
Dodgertown, the spring-training home of the Dodgers since 1948,
which includes the construction of a mini-town, the renovation of
the offices and clubhouses and a renovation of Holman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said it puts the Dodgers ``significantly closer'' to
signing a long-term lease, which sources said would be for 20
years. The vote also paves the way for the next few steps in the
deal, which includes a land-purchase agreement as the Dodgers sell
the land to the municipality, a lease document agreement in which
the Dodgers rent it back for $1 per year, a collateral-development
agreement and a parking-development agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It also pushes Las Vegas from the back burner to the
back-back-back burner as a spring-training option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegas is still on a holding pattern,'' Graziano said. ``It's
still there as a contingency, but our focus is on Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Johnson hasn't said right-hander Ismael Valdes
will start, but he said he didn't want to upset the starting days
of Darren Dreifort, Kevin Brown and Chan Ho Park, who will pitch
the next three games. It leaves Monday as the most likely choice,
but Johnson said he would think about using Valdes in relief today
and Saturday to ready himself for a start. ... Adrian Beltre's
third-inning grand slam was the eighth by the Dodgers this season,
tying the franchise mark. The Brooklyn Dodgers hit eight in 1952.
... While the Dodgers' 20 hits were their most since they had 22 on
July 14, 1997, at Coors Field, right fielder Shawn Green continues
to slump. He went 0 for 5 for the second straight day, was 2 for 18
(.111) in the series and his average is down to .282. ... The
back-to-back homers by Beltre and Alex Cora in the third inning
marked the fourth time the Dodgers have done it, but the first time
it didn't involve Gary Sheffield. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FORD'S CLEAN AIR BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   The various industries responsible for much of the country's air
pollution _ the oil companies, the automakers, the big utilities _
have usually resisted federal clean air regulations, routinely
overestimating the costs of the regulations while underestimating
the ability of their engineers to satisfy them. In the 30 years
since the passage of the Clean Air Act, industry has rarely been
out in front of government.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, Ford Motor Co. reversed this paradigm with
the announcement that it would increase the average fuel economy of
its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years.
It did so even though Congress recently rejected yet another effort
by environmentalists to tighten up fuel economy standards.
</P>
<P>
   The company's move deserves applause from anyone who worries
about carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas that is thought to
be a major contributor to global warming. Cars and trucks are
responsible for about one-third of the carbon dioxide produced in
the United States, and SUVs are responsible for a big chunk of
that. SUVs, pickup trucks and vans now account for half the
vehicles sold in America. This has been a boon for Detroit but not
for cleaner air, mainly because SUVs, which are officially classed
as light trucks, have been allowed to emit up to three times as
much pollution per mile as standard cars. They also consume about
one-third to one-half more fuel than ordinary cars.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Environmental Protection Agency began a crackdown
on SUVs, using the so-called tailpipe standards authorized by the
Clean Air Act. It issued new rules that will require SUVs to meet
the same emission standards that apply to ordinary cars and govern
pollutants like nitrogen oxide, a precursor to urban smog. At the
same time, the EPA required the oil companies to produce a
cleaner-burning gasoline to increase the efficiency of a car's
catalytic converter, the device that strips most pollutants from
auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   But the catalytic converter does nothing to decrease emissions
of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. The only way to reduce
carbon dioxide, short of installing an engine that does not use
fossil fuels, is to increase fuel efficiency. That is what Ford's
new strategy for its SUVs would do.
</P>
<P>
   While committing itself to more fuel-efficient SUVs, the company
remains opposed, along with other automakers, to legislative
efforts to increase fuel economy standards generally. These
standards have not significantly changed in nearly 20 years. Ford's
answer to what some see as an inconsistency is that it opposes
top-down regulation but will respond to consumer-driven market
forces. Ford says it is convinced that consumers are ready to
sacrifice a modest amount of engine power and size in exchange for
a cleaner SUV. It also argues that it has the technology to
increase the fuel economy of SUVs without increasing prices _ the
implication being that it will be able to do the same for other
cars if allowed to proceed at its own pace.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists on the whole were delighted. They noted that
if Ford can build SUVs that yield much better mileage per gallon,
other companies are sure to follow. If they do, William C. Ford
Jr., Ford's chairman and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, will
further solidify his reputation as the most adventurous executive
in an industry not previously known for environmental stewardship.

ALVIN ALM, 63, A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Colo.)   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alvin L. Alm, a businessman and senior government
official who helped create environmental and energy policy in
Republican and Democratic administrations for four decades, died
July 24 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Alm was stricken at his home in nearby Falls Church, Va.,
apparently with heart failure, said Allen Moore, a colleague at
Chambers Associates, a public policy consulting firm where Alm was
president.
</P>
<P>
   As an expert in budgeting, economics, regulation and the other
fine details of environmental policy, Alm operated just under the
bureaucratic rank where public service translates into renown.
Although virtually every policy- maker in Alm's field knew of his
work, the influence of the jobs he held, like assistant secretary
of energy for environmental management and deputy administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency, far exceeded his public name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Alm spoke lightly of his many moves into and out of government,
once saying, ``I have to confess I am a recidivist.'' One reason he
came and went was that the most powerful figures in the federal
government called upon him at critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the EPA was in crisis during the Reagan
administration, with Administrator Anne Gorsuch's resignation under
pressure for her handling of the Superfund and other programs, Alm
returned for a second stint at the agency under William D.
Ruckelshaus, whom President Ronald Reagan had called back to
salvage the EPA's bruised reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Leroy Alm was born in Denver, graduated from the
University of Denver in 1960 and earned a master's degree in public
administration from the Maxwell Graduate School at Syracuse
University.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on environmental matters in the Washington bureaucracy
for several years and by 1970, when the modern environmental
movement reached full flower, held a crucial post as staff director
of the newly created White House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   He helped develop the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972 and moved
to the EPA, then in its infancy, as assistant manager for planning
and management. There, from 1973 to 1977, he helped devise the
system of water pollution permits that put the law into force.
</P>
<P>
   During the energy crisis of the late 1970s, he worked on energy
policy for the Carter administration and moved to the Energy
Department for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his long career, Alm took on some of the most
intractable of problems. His most recent tour in government was
from 1996 to 1998, as President Clinton's assistant secretary of
energy in charge of cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons
complex, overseeing a program of about $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Outside government, he was chairman and chief executive of
Thermal Analytical Corp., an environmental testing concern, from
1985 to 1987; chief executive of another technical consulting
company, Alliance Technologies Corp., from 1987 to 1989; and senior
vice president of yet another, Science Applications International
Corp., from 1989 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s he was at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard as a lecturer and head of a research program.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to the former Ronnie Elwell ended in divorce. He is
survived by a daughter, Jessica Alm of Boston; a sister, Carol
Birza of Denver; and his companion, Mary Clark of Washington.

JOHN TUKEY, 85, STATISTICIAN WHO COINED 2 CRUCIAL WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mass.)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Wilder Tukey, one of the most influential statisticians of
the last 50 years and a wide-ranging thinker credited with
inventing the word ``software,'' died on July 26 in New Brunswick,
N.J. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack after a short illness, said Phyllis
Anscombe, his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Tukey developed important theories about how to analyze data and
compute series of numbers quickly. He spent decades as both a
professor at Princeton University and a researcher at AT&AMP;T's Bell
Laboratories, and his ideas continue to be a part of both doctoral
statistics courses and high school math classes. In 1973, President
Richard M. Nixon awarded him the National Medal of Science.
</P>
<P>
   But Tukey frequently ventured outside of the academy as well,
working as a consultant to the government and corporations and
taking part in social debates.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he criticized Alfred C. Kinsey's research on
sexual behavior. In the 1970s, he was chairman of a research
committee that warned that aerosol spray cans damaged the ozone
layer. More recently, he recommended that the 1990 Census be
adjusted by using statistical formulas in order to count poor urban
residents whom he believed it had missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about being a statistician,'' Tukey once told a
colleague, ``is that you get to play in everyone's backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   An intense man who liked to argue and was fond of helping other
researchers, Tukey was also an amateur linguist who made
significant contributions to the language of modern times. In a
1958 article in American Mathematical Monthly, he became the first
person to define the programs on which electronic calculators ran,
said Fred R. Shapiro, a librarian at Yale Law School who is editing
a book on the origin of terms. Three decades before the founding of
Microsoft, Tukey saw that ``software,'' as he called it, was
gaining prominence. ``Today,'' he wrote at the time, it is ``at
least as important'' as the `` `hardware' of tubes, transistors,
wires, tapes and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years earlier, while working at Bell Laboratories, he had
coined the term ``bit,'' an abbreviation of ``binary digit'' that
described the 1's and 0's that are the basis of computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both words caught on, to the chagrin of some computer scientists
who saw Tuley as an outsider. ``Not everyone was happy that he was
naming things in their field,'' said Steven M. Schultz, a spokesman
for Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Tukey had no immediate survivors. His wife of 48 years,
Elizabeth Rapp Tukey, an antiques appraiser and preservation
activist, died in 1998. Tukey was born in 1915 in New Bedford, a
fishing town on the southern coast of Massachusetts, and was the
only child of Ralph H. Tukey and Adah Tasker Tukey. His mother was
the valedictorian of the class of 1898 at Bates College in
Lewiston, Maine, and her closest competition was her eventual
husband, who became the salutatorian. Classmates referred to them
as the couple most likely to give birth to a genius, said Marc G.
Glass, a Bates spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Tukey became a Latin teacher at New Bedford's high
school, but, because of a rule barring spouses from teaching at the
school, Tukey worked as a private tutor, Anscombe said. Tukey's
main pupil became her son, who attended regular classes only for
special subjects like French. ``They were afraid that if he went to
school, he'd get lazy,'' said Howard Wainer, a friend and former
student of John Tukey's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Tukey graduated from nearby Brown University with a
bachelor's degree in chemistry, and in the next three years earned
three graduate degrees, one in chemistry at Brown and two in
mathematics at Princeton, where he would spend the rest of his
career. At the age of 35, he became a full professor, and in 1965
he became the founding chairman of Princeton's statistics
department.
</P>
<P>
   Tukey worked for the U.S. government during World War II.
Friends said he did not discuss the details of his projects, but
Anscombe said he helped design the U-2 spy plane.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, much of his important work came in a field that
statisticians call robust analysis, which allows researchers to
devise credible conclusions even when the data with which they are
working are flawed. In 1970, Tukey published ``Exploratory Data
Analysis,'' which gave mathematicians new ways to analyze and
present data clearly.
</P>
<P>
   One of those tools, the stem-and-leaf display, continues to be
part of many high school curriculums. Using it, students arrange a
series of data points in a series of simple rows and columns and
can then make judgments about what techniques, like calculating the
average or median, would allow them to analyze the information
intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   That display was typical of Tukey's belief that mathematicians,
professional or amateur, should often start with their data and
then look for a theorem, rather than vice versa, said Wainer, who
is now the principal research scientist at the Educational Testing
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He legitimized that, because he wasn't doing it because he
wasn't good at math,'' Wainer said. ``He was doing it because it
was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with another scientist, James Cooley, Tukey also developed
the Fast Fourier Transform, an algorithm with wide application to
the physical sciences. It helps astronomers, for example, determine
the spectrum of light coming from a star more quickly than
previously possible.
</P>
<P>
   As his career progressed, he also became a hub for other
scientists. He was part of a group of Princeton professors that
gathered regularly and included Lyman Spitzer Jr., who inspired the
Hubble Space Telescope. Tukey also persuaded a group of the
nation's top statisticians to spend a year at Princeton in the
early 1970s working together on robust analysis problems, said
David C. Hoaglin, a former student of Tukey.
</P>
<P>
   Tukey worked as a consultant to the Educational Testing Service,
Xerox Corp. and Merck &AMP; Co. From 1960 to 1980, he helped design the
polls that the NBC television network used to predict and analyze
elections.
</P>
<P>
   His first brush with publicity came in 1950, when the National
Research Council appointed him to a committee to evaluate the
Kinsey Report, which shocked many Americans by describing the
country's sexual habits as far more diverse than had been thought.
From their first meeting, when Kinsey told Tukey to stop singing a
Gilbert and Sullivan tune aloud while working, the two men clashed,
according to ``Alfred C. Kinsey,'' a biography by James H. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of meetings over two years, Kinsey vigorously
defended his work, which Tukey believed was seriously flawed,
relying on a sample of people who knew each other. Tukey said a
random selection of three people would have been better than a
group of 300 chosen by Kinsey.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Little more than two weeks ago, Dick Cheney
visited Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee in his office on Capitol Hill,
and Frist made his pitch, explaining why his experience as a heart
surgeon who had managed life-and-death situations made him the
right man to accompany Gov. George W. Bush along the inevitably
rocky, tense road to Election Day and perhaps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney apeared to listen intently. It was his job to supervise
the Texas governor's hunt for a running mate, and he had arranged
to meet Frist.
</P>
<P>
   Within several days, Bush flew to the Northeast and met twice
with Gov. George Pataki of New York, discussing a possible place
for Pataki on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   For all this tantalizing activity, it now appears that Cheney
had at the time already emerged as a leading candidate _ and
perhaps the leading candidate _ for the slot he had been assigned
to help fill. Cheney and Bush had discussed the possibility July 3
at Bush's ranch near Crawford, about 90 miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheney's own candidacy was moving along a track so secret
that some of the other politicians on the list of seemingly serious
prospects had no idea that Bush was settling on Cheney until they
learned it from newspaper and television reports less than 72 hours
before Bush formally announced his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans who discussed the vice-presidential
selection with Bush over the past two weeks, among them Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania, said that the Texas governor had not let on
that he was considering the head of his search committee for the
post. He also did not inquire about how such a selection might
play, even as he reviewed with them the qualifications of other
potential candidates on his list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the choice of Cheney was all but assured in the final
days of frenzied speculation among news organizations, days that
yielded some entirely unfounded reports: that Sen. John McCain of
Arizona might be a last-minute addition to Bush's short list; that
Bush was making a final, hopeful approach to Gen. Colin Powell.
Bush was really just running Cheney through his mind one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is an immensely respected political veteran, and his
selection elicited praise from many Republicans. But the unusual
way in which the former defense secretary arrived at Bush's side at
a news conference here on Tuesday to announce the vice-presidential
selection has stirred concern among some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They have noted with alarm the attacks Democrats were able to
quickly muster on Cheney's conservative voting record in Congress,
and questioned whether the man in charge of screening the other
candidates for the job could possibly have received as thorough a
screening himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they vet?'' a senior Republican strategist with
experience in national campaigns asked Thursday. ``That he went to
college? They really got their ears pinned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Cheney's ties to former President George Bush have
provoked renewed speculation about the influence of Bush's father
on his son's presidential campaign. In a telephone interview
Thursday that represented his first public comments on the search
process, President Bush said: ``What I see emerging is that the old
guy drove the choice. That is absolutely inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that he spoke regularly with his son about
the search and gave his opinions on various candidates, including
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was asked if he spoke directly to Cheney and urged
him to think about taking the job, Bush said, ``I cannot reveal
whether I did or didn't. Not wanting to obfuscate, but put this
down to obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please respect my age _ 76,'' he continued. ``I'm forgetful.''
Asked if that meant that he had forgotten whether he spoke with
Cheney, his response suggested that the two men had talked, perhaps
because Cheney was soliciting opinions about vice presidential
contenders and the former president knew many of these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into what I talked to Dick Cheney or
anybody else about,'' President Bush said. ``You've got to put it
in the context of what Dick Cheney was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his son's advisers, the review of Cheney's
credentials and background materials was conducted somewhat outside
of the process that Cheney had established for the rest of the
field, and it proceeded at a much speedier pace. Within minutes
after Cheney's selection was announced on Tuesday, Democrats
produced a trove of extremely conservative votes from Cheney's
decade in Congress, and the barrage of questions about his record
that hit Cheney and the Bush campaign seemed to take them at least
partly by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
Thursday about several votes that he cast in opposition to gun
control, Cheney said, ``Well, I'd have to go back and dig into that
in detail.'' In a previous interview on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
Cheney seemed a bit surprised by similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and his aides have declined to provide any
more than rudimentary details about the vetting of vice
presidential prospects, including Cheney, but said that all of them
had been carefully noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I knew his votes,'' Bush said during a brief news
conference at the governor's mansion here Thursday. ``But I also
know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who
all they do is spend time tearing people down. And they're going to
give it their level best trying to tear Dick Cheney down, but
they're not going to be able to do so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that most Americans already knew and
respected Cheney as a result of his role as defense secretary
during the Persian Gulf War. ``Secretary Cheney brought people
together and helped to win a war, which stands in stark contrast
with Vice President Al Gore, who tens to divide people to create
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his aides, Bush declined to be interviewed for this
article. Cheney did not respond to several requests for an
interview about the search process that were made through Bush's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with Republicans who spoke with Cheney and Bush
these past few weeks, including a number of men who were told they
were on the short list of potential vice presidential candidates,
suggest that they underwent a process that was different then the
one Cheney endured. It is these differences that account for the
murmurs of concern among some Republicans who have watched Cheney's
first few turbulent days as a candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney took charge of reviewing financial histories and
interviewing candidates, Bush himself attended to that chore in
Cheney's case. While Cheney researched the voting records of the
other vice presidential prospects, the task of assessing Cheney's
political past fell to Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager.
(Allbaugh also did not return a call for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates began submitting their voluminous paper
work in mid-May, in some cases shipping boxes of documents to
Cheney, the examination of Cheney apparently began little more than
a week before Bush called him and offered him the job.
</P>
<P>
   And while at least 11 Republicans filled out an extraordinarily
detailed, 83-question form, including inquiries ranging from
plagiarism to recreational drug use, Bush's senior advisers were
unable to say if Cheney had taken the same formal step, though they
noted that Cheney's background had been reviewed when he was named
secretary of defense under President Bush. ``Secretary Cheney told
me he subjected himself to the same kind of scrutiny,'' Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But unexplained oddities about the vetting of Cheney lingered.
According to one Republican official, the name of his daughter,
Elizabeth Cheney, a lawyer, was on the return address of the
materials that another candidate received, and she helped place
calls late last week to round up the weekend phone numbers of other
vice presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Elizabeth Cheney's possible role in helping to
screen candidates, including her father, Hughes said that except
for Dick Cheney, Bush and Allbaugh, ``I am not able to discuss
others who were involved in the vetting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney said on ``Good Morning America'' that there was no
cause for concern about the unusual way in which he came to be
selected. Referring to Bush, he said: ``The fact of the matter is
that we spent a lot of time _ and again, remember my original
advice to him was, you know, we're going to find you a great
candidate, but I'd rather not be a candidate myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we went through the process in terms of talking about
my health and my record and my business career and so forth, we
reviewed all those things between the two of us as we went forward
and before we made the decision, before he made the decision that
he wanted me to be a candidate,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore has seemed
genuinely invigorated by the news of Cheney's selection. Aides to
the vice president were churning out reams of documents about
Cheney's legislative background literally from the moment Bush
concluded the formal announcement of Cheney's selection.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of what is arguably the most important political
decision Bush has made in his presidential campaign to date may
never be known. The lack of information has prompted questions
among some some Republicans about whether many of the politicians
whose names were publicly floated as possible running mates for
Bush were ever in serious contention.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said in an interview that he had told aides on July 5 that
he did not want to be considered for the race; nonetheless, Bush
himself continued to encourage speculation that he was considering
Ridge when he campaigned with the Pennsylvania governor in
Pittsburgh a week later. Similarly, by the time Bush met with
Pataki on July 14 _ an encounter that his aides readily confirmed _
Cheney, who has a history of heart attacks, had completed a medical
examination in New York and reported to Bush that he had been given
a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ridge and Pataki are supporters of abortion rights, unlike
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who is a staunch opponent of abortion, had been pitching
in with the governor's presidential campaign from the beginning.
Last year, he helped Bush assemble the team of foreign policy
advisers for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was natural that in mid-March, after Bush
effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, he
asked Cheney if he wanted to be considered as a possible running
mate. Cheney said no, but, weeks later, agreed to supervise the
search process.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, hundreds of letters were sent to Republican
officials to get their advice. At least 11 prospective candidates
received questionnaires and requests for documents.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who had been mentioned as potentially the
strongest running mate Bush could chose, Powell, explicitly told
Bush that he did not want the job. He did so during a private
moment with the governor on May 25, when Bush held a ceremony here
pledging support for Powell's national youth-mentoring program, an
aide to Powell said this week. Bush and his senior advisers never
raised the subject with Powell again, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no hint yet that Cheney's professed resistance
to considering the job was softening, Bush's advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 27, just six days before Cheney visited Bush's ranch
and indicated a possible willingness to be Bush's running mate, his
name popped up during a gathering of former members of his father's
presidential administration at the Bush family compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine. Those present included President Bush; his
former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and his former
director of presidential personnel, Chase Untermeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer recalled that as these men and others sat around a
table on the back porch, Bush asked in a lighthearted manner who
they thought should be his son's vice presidential pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost in the sense of a parlor game, as if he were
asking, ``Who do you think will win the Masters?''' Untermeyer said
in one of two telephone interviews this week. He said the name that
came up most often was Ridge's.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Untermeyer said, someone brought up Cheney's
name, and someone else said he was not interested. According to
Untermeyer, Scowcroft then said that Cheney had recently indicated
to him that he might be willing to take the job after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression was that President Bush was very interested to
hear that and took it aboard as if it was an important fact to
know,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scowcroft and President Bush both made telephone calls to a
reporter Thursday to dispute the accuracy of that account.
Scowcroft said that before the Kennebunkport meeting, he had run
into Cheney and teased him about being the perfect vice
presidential prospect. Scowcroft said that he merely shared that
story with President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush said that he did not press the idea of Cheney on
his son. ``Am I high on Cheney?,'' the former president said.
``Absolutely. Was I high on others? Absolutely. Did I talk to
George when he called to go over stuff? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Less then a week later, Bush revisited Cheney's initial
objections with him at the ranch, and Cheney began to budge.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11th, Hughes said, he got his medical examination. On
July 15 he and Bush informed Bush's senior advisers that he was in
the running, and his vetting began, according to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days later, the job was his.

CONE LOSES ANOTHER ONE AS YANKEES FALL TO TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ There was no mistaking the dejection on David
Cone's face Thursday night, his mouth turned down, lips pursed,
sadness weighing on his eyes like anvils. It was the look of
helplessness, and it was the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's reputation is built on dominance, and the Minnesota Twins
were burying him. He is known for stubborn relentlessness, and as
Cone worked deeper into trouble, defeat must have felt inevitable
to him, on the eve of the three-month anniversary of his last
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cone lost again, was pounded again, allowing nine hits, five
walks and eight runs in five-plus innings Thursday night, and he
remained in that long only because manager Joe Torre tried to wait
for the New York Yankees to come back and rescue the veteran
pitcher from the losing streak. But they were defeated, 9-3, their
four-game winning streak ending as Cone's won-lost record fell to
1-10, and it would seem that his place in the team's rotation is in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has been an ace pitcher most of his career, embracing the
responsibility that this entails, and there is no getting around
the fact that his troubles are dragging down the team. In Cone's
last 12 starts, the Yankees are 0-12; they are 32-19 in games
started by others during that same span.
</P>
<P>
   Only one pitcher in club history has made more starts with only
one victory to show for it: Fritz Peterson, who was 1-10 after 22
starts in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens are permanent
members of the five-man rotation. Orlando Hernandez is working his
way back from the disabled list. Dwight Gooden is 3-0 with a 2.16
earned run average in three starts. The Yankees are entertaining
the idea of trading for another starting pitcher, in San Diego's
Matt Clement.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is scheduled to pitch again on Wednesday if nothing
changes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 37, extracted some hope from his previous defeat. He felt
good about an adjustment he made to his pitching mechanics: he held
his hands near his right hip in the middle of his windup, rather
than raising his hands and then dropping them before throwing; this
made his motion more compact and seemed to help his control against
Tampa Bay in a game last Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was relieved after six innings of that game, having thrown
just 94 pitches, and Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, knew Cone
was angry about this. But Cone remained mute about that decision,
realizing he was not pitching well enough to complain, and focused
on his next start. Cone flipped the ball to Stottlemyre after
finishing his warm-ups Thursday night, and Stottlemyre patted him
on the shoulder. ``Let's go,'' Stottlemyre said, and Cone nodded.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth pitch of the game was smacked down the left-field
line for a double by Denny Hocking; Cristian Guzman bounced Cone's
ninth pitch for a single, to score Hocking. Cone tries to analyze
his starts as objectively as possible and can be brutally honest
with himself, to the point where it probably hurts him; Cone is not
superstitious, does not blame fate. Still, he cannot comprehend why
trouble hits him in speed-of-light fashion, why it seems he cannot
get away with any mistakes, the way other pitchers do. Cone stops
short of saying it is bad luck, but he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Matt Lawton on four pitches, and Ron Coomer singled
home the Twins' second run. Cone, rushing in his delivery, fell
behind David Ortiz, three balls and no strikes, and walked him.
Bases loaded, still nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   He was missing badly by now, his fastball and slider straying,
and when he threw two balls out of the strike zone to Corey Koskie
_ 2-0 _ the phone in the Yankees' bullpen rang and Jason Grimsley
started warming up.
</P>
<P>
   There were two fly balls, and another run scored. Jacque Jones,
the Twins' No. 8 hitter, stepped out of the batter's box a couple
of times and Cone appeared to be incensed by this; after Jones
struck out to end the inning, Cone walked over and spoke to the
umpire Gregory Gibson pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw 36 pitches in that first inning, 21 in the second, a
staggering toll for a pitcher rarely given a chance to throw more
than 100 pitches anymore. He got through the third inning easily,
retired the first hitter in the fourth and appeared to gather some
sort of rhythm, sometimes peeking at the radar gun readings posted
on the face of the upper deck in left field. His fastball was
hitting 88 mph. Cone dropped his arm angle to throw a rare sidearm
slider to Chad Moeller, Minnesota's ninth-place hitter: a sliver of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone went on to walk Moeller. He walked Hocking, as well,
and when Lawton laced a breaking ball into the left-field corner,
the bullpen coach Tony Cloninger reached down and held his hand on
the bullpen phone, anticipating the call that came a second later,
after both of Minnesota's runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   Cone glanced at the bullpen as he departed the mound at the end
of the fourth, to see if somebody was warming up to relieve him.
Minnesota led, 5-0, but when the Yankees scored three runs in the
top of the fifth, Torre stayed with Cone; he believes that if only
Cone can end his losing streak, then at least bits of his old
confidence will be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Ortiz to lead off the bottom of the fifth, Grimsley
got up for the third time and sat down for the third time when Cone
held the Twins scoreless in the half-inning. But Cone's pitch count
was 106 after five innings, and when Jones singled to lead off the
sixth, Grimsley got up one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller lifted a high pop with the runner moving, and there was
confusion between second baseman Jose Vizcaino and left fielder
Paul O'Neill and the ball fell between them. Hocking hit a double
and the runners charged around the bases. That was all. The
Yankees' infielders gathered around Cone at the mound. Not one
appeared to say anything before Cone handed the ball to Torre.

DNA TESTS BEING SPONSORED IN CASE THAT LED TO EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seeking to learn if an innocent man was put to death
four years ago, The Boston Globe and three other news organizations
said this week that they would underwrite new DNA tests on evidence
from a 1981 Georgia murder case.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ellis Wayne Felker, was executed in 1996 for the rape
and murder of a 19-year-old college student, Evelyn Joy Ludlam. If
DNA tests prove his innocence, it would be the first time the
technology exonerated an inmate who had been put to death.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence has cleared eight convicts awaiting execution, and
next week in Texas a man sentenced to 99 years in prison for the
rape of a 16-year-old girl is likely be pardoned on the strength of
new DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that only DNA testimony with its reliability could
prove that a person was wrongfully executed,'' said Ben Bradlee
Jr., The Globe's deputy managing editor for projects. ``This has
never been tested, but if it could be proven, it would
significantly alter the terms of the death-penalty debate in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia judge cleared the way for the investigation earlier
this month, when he agreed to turn over evidence from Felker's case
to The Globe. After the decision, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
joined the Globe in offering to pay for the DNA tests, and The
Macon Telegraph and CBS's ``60 Minutes'' news magazine are now
petitioning to gain access to the evidence. The cost of the tests
has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project, an advocacy
group at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva
University in New York that assists inmates protesting their
innocence, said this was the first instance of a court granting the
public access to evidence for DNA testing after the inmate's
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all other cases, they've denied access because they were
afraid it would prove there was an unlawful execution,'' Scheck
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly R. Burke, the district attorney in Houston County, where
Felker's case was originally tried, opposed the move, saying: ``If
I thought I had a legal basis to stand on, I'd be fighting this. I
think it's a colossal waste of time. I believe the DNA evidence is
going to have degraded such that when it gets to the lab, the
scientists are going to look at it and say, `Sorry, we can't test
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What proved Wayne Felker did it wasn't just one piece of
evidence. There were a lot of different things that went into the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Ludlam was raped and strangled, her eyes and mouth
covered with duct tape, and her body dumped in a creek, where it
lay for two weeks. Felker was convicted of the crime after
investigators found hair matching his on the victim. He was found
guilty in 1983, and sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Felker received national attention in 1996, when the Supreme
Court heard his challenge of a law limiting the federal appeals
process for death row inmates in an effort to hasten executions.
The court ruled unanimously against him, and he was put to death
one month later.

TROUBLED J.C. PENNEY NAMES A NEW CHAIRMAN AND CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Allen L. Questrom, who headed Federated Department
Stores for much of the 1990s and led Barneys New York Inc. out of
bankruptcy, was named chairman and chief executive of J.C. Penney
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who have knocked three-quarters of the market value
off Penney in the last two years, pushed the stock up 16 percent,
betting that Questrom can lift the sagging fortunes of the company,
one of the nation's largest department store chains.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has lost focus, losing to nimbler
competitors like Kohl's and Target, and has struggled to wrest
itself from an insular and plodding culture that left too much
power in the hands of store managers. That has led to serious
inventory problems, including slow distribution of newer,
hot-selling merchandise and overstocked shelves of unpopular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's chief executive, James E. Oesterreicher, who said in
May that he would resign, and Vanessa Castagna, the chief operating
officer, who was hired last year from Wal-Mart Stores, were both
considered possible successors at one point.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Questrom, 60, said that he expected to stay at
Penney for at least five years, though he is leaving Barneys New
York after just over a year. At Barneys New York, Questrom will
remain chairman and help lead a search for a new chief executive.
At Penney, he said that he planned to immerse himself in the
company's operations for a few months before letting anyone know
his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of impressions, but I hesitate to share those
until I get to talk to people,'' Questrom said. ``Little companies
are nimble, and as they get larger, they have to go back and
refocus.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected Questrom, who begins at Penney on
Sept. 15, to take a number of steps this year, perhaps closing
stores, announcing a major inventory write-off, or trimming the
number of vendors and brands in Penney stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best possible outcome of this company's executive
search, frankly,'' said George Strachan, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs, who raised his rating on the stock. ``He's got a lot of
charisma and is very decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, applauded
the move but said he did not expect Penney to show quick
improvement. ``I don't consider it to be tremendously undervalued,
given its earnings prospects'' in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Penney shares gained $2.375, to close at $17.25.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys, Questrom had an unusual compensation package that
granted him about 15 percent of the company's equity, depending on
